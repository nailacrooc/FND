Timberwolves beat Curry-less Warriors 117-93 in Game 2 to even series,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Minnesota Timberwolves were stewing over their rough start in Game 1 against Golden State, a reaction coach Chris Finch was pleased to see. Julius Randle had 24 points and 11 assists to help the Timberwolves capitalize on Warriors star Stephen Currys absence in a 117-93 victory Thursday that tied the second-round series at a game apiece. The foundation was laid in an ornery film session with Finch and his staff the day before. He was unhappy, and he let us know he was unhappy, and we felt that, Randle said. We were pretty motivated as a team. Anthony Edwards finished with 20 points after an injury scare for the Wolves, who more than tripled their 3-point output (going 16 for 37) from their Game 1 loss when Curry was sidelined by a left hamstring strain that likely will keep him out at least until next week. Nickeil Alexander-Walker added 20 points to spearhead a superb performance by the bench, combining with Donte DiVincenzo and Naz Reid to go 10 for 22 from deep.  We looked a lot more like ourselves, Finch said. Jonathan Kuminga (18 points) and Trayce Jackson-Davis (15) combined to shoot 14 for 17 from the floor for the Warriors. They took nearly five minutes to score, finally breaking through down 13-0 on Jimmy Butlers 3-pointer. With the NBAs career leading 3-point shooter next to him on the bench, coach Steve Kerr used a kitchen-sink experiment with 14 players getting time. 
        
     But I would still like to win, Butler said. I think the biggest lesson is dont start off in a hole like we did tonight, and the game maybe could have ended up a little bit differently. Kuminga, the seventh overall pick in the 2021 draft who dropped out of the rotation at times during the regular season and missed significant time with a sprained right ankle, was a bright spot off the bench. But this Warriors team was already thin on offense with a healthy Curry.  We have to figure out what were going to be able to do in this series without Steph, Kerr said. So we gave a lot of people a lot of chances, and some guys really stepped up.  Against the Wolves and their athletic, long and versatile defense, there wasnt much to lean on. Without Curry to worry about, the Wolves had an easier time keeping shooters Buddy Hield and Brandin Podziemski quiet. The Warriors put up their lowest first-quarter score (15) in the playoffs since Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals, according to Sportradar, when they had 11 in a loss to Cleveland. Draymond Green picked up his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, two short of an automatic one-game suspension, for elbowing Naz Reid after Reid had just fouled him. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-timberwolves-score-a2bb1ddb63982e7dd6a3fc64cfaf6c29,sports

Jeeno Thitikul happy to see putts go in and lead at Liberty National with a 64,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP)  Jeeno Thitikul of Thailand feels so much better when she sees putts going in, and Thursday was an happy occasion at the Mizuho Americas Open. She took only 26 putts, eight of them for birdie, in a clean start of 8-under 64 to lead by two shots. Thitikul was bogey-free at Liberty National and had the advantage of playing in the morning with virtually no wind on the course across the Hudson River from Manhattan. She finished strong, dropping a short iron into 5 feet on the 17th and judging the distance perfectly on the closing hole with a shot that stayed below the hole and left her only about 3 feet for birdie. Celine Boutier of France ran off five straight birdies in the middle of her round to account for not taking advantage of the par 5s. She was at 66 with Hye-Jin Choi of South Korea and Lindy Duncan, who lost in a five-way playoff at the Chevron Championship two weeks ago. I think my putter working well, better than Chevron week, said Thitikul, the No. 2 player in the womens world ranking. She opened with rounds of 71-75 at the Chevron Championship, the first major of the LPGA season. Thitikul took off last week and devoted a lot of time to her putting, almost to a fault. She found her emotions going all over the place depending on the result. First couple days Ive been back home and I putt a lot, a ton, she said. I feel good when I see it drop but I feel bad when I see it miss. ... And I was like, No, you cant be like this. Its in or its not. It has to be the same feelings and emotion. 
        
     I just going to putt less and think less. Thats pretty much I want to do, she said. Because mental-wise, pretty important to see all putts in. I dont want to be so tight and tense. Besides, she felt the greens were tough for everyone at the major. Were here, hit it good, and also making the putts, Thitikul said after her 11th round of 64 or lower over the last four seasons. Defending champion Nelly Korda had six birdies  three of them on the par 5s  to account for a few bogeys on her front nine and finished in the group at 68. Korda, the No. 1 player in womens golf by a big margin, has yet to win this year. She won the Mizuho Americas Open a year ago for her sixth victory of the season. Her game hasnt been as sharp this year, and Korda is more interested in looking ahead. Just got to focus on what my game plan was last year  that was one shot at a time, not to get ahead of myself, Korda said. I know at the beginning of the year I had a lot to defend, but I think that instead of putting pressure on myself I should be happy that I was in that moment, that I did achieve all that great success. So just go out here and do what I love. The group at 67 included Haeran Ryu of South Korea, coming off a victory last week at the Black Desert Championship in Utah that elevated her to No. 5 in the world. Her round included a bogey on her final hole. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/jeeno-thitikul-mizuho-americas-liberty-national-nelly-3f4eef57eca778c935000786178f885f,sports
Mitchell shoots 61 for 1-shot lead at Truist Championship; McIlroy shows rust in 66,"FLOURTOWN, Pa. (AP)  Keith Mitchell led a birdie spree at the Truist Championship on Thursday, shooting a career-best 9-under 61 to shatter the course record at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. The previous Wissahickon Course record of 65 was shared by Colin St Maxen, Zac Blair and Angus Flanagan. The 7,100-yard A.W. Tillinghast design with modest par 4s and gettable pin placements fell victim to the long hitters and aggressive shots with short irons and wedges. Mitchell was bogey-free and had an outside chance at 59 on his second shot from 102 yards on the ninth hole, his 18th. He hit his approach to just over 9 feet and settled for a closing par and a one-shot lead over Denny McCarthy. Colin Morikawa, Rickie Fowler, Sepp Straka and Akshay Bhatia shot 63. Rory McIlroy, making his first individual start since completing the career grand slam at the Masters, had a 66 and was one of 64 players who beat par on the seemingly defenseless Wissahickon layout in the sixth signature event of the PGA Tour season. Mitchell led the way despite a ho-hum start of five straight pars on the back nine. Things started to heat up for the 33-year-old with a birdies on the stout 17th and 18th holes. His run continued with birdies on two of the first three holes on his back nine before a four-birdie run for a 6-under 29 on the inward nine. Mitchell said he has a buddy who is a member at Philly Cricket and received some intel ahead of his arrival. But, he credited the work he and his caddie did early in the week studying the greens for setting the stage for his success. 
        
     I just plotted my way around Monday and Wednesday to figure out what to hit and where to kind of try to put the ball on the green, said Mitchell, who has one career win and six top-25 finishes this year with one missed cut. If you get above the hole really pin high on the wrong side, you can have a really fast putt and have a ton of breaks. The 32-year-old McCarthy, who has lost twice in playoffs and is winless on tour, was aided by a fast start that included five straight birdies at Nos. 11-15. He opened his inward nine with back-to-back birdies and added two more for a satisfying, but not surprising to him, opening round. Ive been playing really well lately, so it doesnt really surprise me, he said. Theres still a lot of golf left. This is a really nice start. Im excited for how my game has been trending lately. McIlroy, the defending champion and four-time winner of the event, stayed with his aggressive gameplan of trying to overpower the layout with driver off the tee. He had two stumbles along the way: a three-putt at the par-4 11th and a bogey at the 570-yard, par-5 15th, where he scrambled after missing the fairway with his drive and the green with his approach from 243 yards. McIlroy quickly moved past his first-round errors. I think it worked out fine, McIlroy said of his round of six birdies and two bogeys. I drove the ball pretty well. I missed it in a couple of spots, but was sort of able to get away with it. McIlroy is playing for the first time in about two weeks after celebrating his slam-clinching win at the Masters and 12th-place finish in New Orleans, where he and fellow Irishman Shane Lowry were defending champs. He acknowledged his game is not in top form. I felt like I was a little rusty out there, just hadnt played in a week and I hadnt really done a ton of practice, especially like on and around the greens, he said. I certainly can tidy a few things up, but overall a decent day. Alex Noren made his return to the tour, playing for the first time since August due to neck and leg injuries. The 42-year-old Swede opened with a 67 and was happy to be back and looked forward to fine-tuning his game. Its weird not to play for so long, he said. Ive been looking forward to get some nervousness and some adrenaline flowing and just be a little sharper. You go around practicing your short game for a while. Its not so inspiring in the end when you dont really know when you can come back. Finally, the last two weeks, it felt good for two weeks in a row. The hamstring is holding up. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-truist-championship-e1c5a8494e34515b38c69a17c361025e,sports
Fowler shows old spark with 8 birdies in strong start at the Truist Championship,"FLOURTOWN, Pa. (AP)  Rickie Fowler heard about the complaints  mostly from puzzled fans  after he received an invitation to play next weekend in the PGA Championship. His retort? Keep the whining coming. The negative stuff, I would say, kind of helps me in a way because it fuels me to kind of go out and prove people wrong, Fowler said. Fowler answered his critics at the Truist Championship with the kind of play that showed he can still be considered a threat to win, even if he actually hasnt taken a tournament since 2023. Ive been happy with where my games been at for quite a while. I just havent really seen the product of the work Im putting in or what I feel like I can produce, he said. This was a little better day. Fowler reeled off eight birdies and a bogey to shoot a 7-under-63 on Thursday at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, leaving him two strokes behind leader Keith Mitchell.  You obviously want to come out and prove yourself, Fowler said. I havent been playing all that well last year and the start of this year. It hasnt been very far off. The 36-year-old Fowler absorbed some criticism this week when the PGA Championship released its field for next week at Quail Hollow.  The PGA Championship offered an invitation to Fowler, who has plunged to No. 125 in the world and missed the Masters. There is a category for players in the most recent Ryder Cup  Fowler was at Marco Simone in Italy  provided they are among the top 100 in the world. 
        
     Fowlers first PGA Tour victory was at Quail Hollow in 2012. His best finish at the PGA Championship came in 2014 when he tied for third. Fowler was ranked 146th in the world when he received an invitation into the 2022 PGA Championship. Fowler, a six-time winner on the tour, has played in nine events this year without a top-10 finish and needed a sponsor exemption to play this weekend at the suburban Philadelphia course. Its not quite the way he wanted to qualify for tournaments  but Fowler will take it. A number of exemptions this year, which Im very, very happy for and appreciate it from the sponsors and the tournament directors, he said. You want to come out and play well. So off to a good start and looking forward to keeping it rolling. Fowlers winless streak stretches to July 2023 when he made a 12-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole of the Rocket Mortgage Classic and outlasted Collin Morikawa and Adam Hadwin to win in Detroit. His putting was strong at the Cricket Club.  Fowler made a 13-foot birdie putt on the par-4 seventh hole that kept him among the leaders and finished with a birdie on 18 to cap his outing. He called the the birdie the shot of his round after his bogey-5 on No. 17. I think making birdie there, hit a nice drive off of the last, good shot in there with 6-iron, he said. Hard to pick out one shot. Ill pick the 18th hole. Maybe his effort was the result of a course where 10 players shot under 65. He also didnt want to play catch-up with rain in the forecast. My bodys feeling better, kind of allowing me to go play golf, Fowler said. We made a minor adjustment yesterday, put my irons a degree up. I felt like I was making good swings and zeroing things out, and the ball was just hanging a little right from what I wanted to see. So it was good to kind of see things tighten up with irons today. For anyone else who thinks he cant win, Fowler recalled a 2015 Sports Illustrated player poll that named him one of the most overrated players on the tour. He promptly went out and won the The Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass. That worked out all right that week, he said. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-truist-championship-fowler-0f678799bd5ef932d0e044a039405fed,sports
Natalie Nakase is 1st Asian American WNBA head coach and unfazed by being the face of the Valkyries,"Dont tell Natalie Nakase she doesnt have what it takes to do something. The coach of the San Francisco Bay Areas first WNBA team got to where she is by learning to block out those who underestimated her. If I hear one negative thing about my goal, about my dream, its out, were done, Nakase told The Associated Press. It made my circle really small, but its made my circle really powerful and encouraging and supportive for me. That focus and grit is what led to Nakase, 45, to going from being a walk-on at UCLA to team captain as a 5-foot-2 freshman in 1998. Its what made her the first Asian American player to join the now-defunct National Womens Basketball League in 2003. Nakase is blazing a trail again as the WNBAs first Asian American head coach. That distinction adds to an already impressive rise to be the leader of the Golden State Valkyries, the leagues first expansion franchise since 2008. Their inaugural roster also happens to include championship-winning UConn guard Kaitlyn Chen, who last month became the first Taiwanese American drafted. 
        
     Its clear Nakase, who is of Japanese ancestry, isnt rattled ascending to a larger spotlight. The Golden State Warriors organization, of which the Valkyries are a part of, has prepared her for being more public and preparation builds confidence, she said. Coaching is something Nakase expressed interest in as far back as 20 years when she was on the San Jose Spiders. For people who may not see Asian American women as leaders, Nakase hopes her new role will change minds. I think its more like whats in your mind rather than like the exterior part of it, said Nakase, who at UCLA was often mistaken for a gymnast or tennis player. The negative opinions fuel my fire, though. Nakases leadership style is one of tough love. Its an approach she learned from her father. Compliments were not something given in her family. But candor was. Her father not only (held) me accountable but, he set higher and higher standards because I think if you believe in yourself  in this  then I want to push you to this, Nakase said. If your expectations are here, I want to push you even higher. Thats not to say she wont be there for players off the court. Nakase said her responsibility is to be with them every single day, every single moment, check in, Are we good today? Nakase will be one of four head coaches of color in the WNBA this season. The other three are Black, but that number is down from six in 2022. Within that subset, Seattle Storm coach Noelle Quinn is the only other female. In 2022, Latricia Trammell became the first Native American or Alaska Native head coach. The Dallas Wings, however, fired her after two seasons. Only one-fourth of the head coaches in the league are Black, which is a sharp contrast to the fact that roughly 64% of WNBA players are Black or African American, according to a 2023 report from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. Hispanic/Latina and Asian players each account for 1.4%. Those who identify as mixed race amount to nearly 11%. The WNBA is on track to expand to 16 teams by 2028. Toronto  the first outside the U.S.  and Portland, Oregon, will have franchises next year. This is all happening as womens sports at college and professional levels have seen a popularity surge in the last few years. Nakase was a Los Angeles Clippers assistant coach for 10 years before she joined the WNBAs Las Vegas Aces in a similar role. In 2023, after the Aces won back-to-back championships, Nakase noticed a shift in interest. She believes the opportunity to be part of the movement happening in womens sports as the coach of the Valkyries couldnt have come at a better time. Im exactly where Im supposed to be, especially going from the NBA, experiencing everything on a day to day on what it looks like, what they get and now coming here, Nakase said. Nakases presence has electrified Bay Area Asian Americans who already were stoked to have a hometown WNBA team to support. Teresa and Nathan Chan, who are Chinese American, had bought Valkyries season tickets for themselves and their daughters Adelaide, 16, and Ashlyn, 15. Both girls play for the San Jose Zebras, one of several Asian American youth teams around the Bay Area. Adelaide said she was freaking out when she found out an Asian American woman would be taking a lead in Dub Nation. She sees parallels with Nakase, who also grew up playing in an Asian American league. I thought that was just so cool and it felt more so like she was part of our community already, Adelaide said. Both Nakase and Chens presence have intensified Ashlyns interest. I didnt really watch the WNBA like that much before, Ashlyn said, but now that I see a lot of Asian representation ... Im more like, Oh, this is my team now. Teresa Chan, whose father founded a local basketball club over 30 years ago, said its the most wonderful thing that we could ever ask for. I think also it challenges the stereotypes and expands their views of whats possible. Its a symbol to all girls and boys alike in the Asian community, Nathan Chan added. Nakase embraces what she feels is a responsibility and thinks about how to use her new platform to encourage more girls on a daily basis. What I feel like Im going to connect more to also is more coaches, Nakase said. Because I think that, like I said, the impact of coaches is going to be the reason why other females  younger kids that look like me  that theyre going to be inspired. ___ Tang reported from Phoenix. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/golden-state-valkyries-natalie-nakase-wnba-aapi-225ff925866245dd982661f9b4858587,sports
Lynxs Napheesa Collier poised for another WNBA title run after an offseason playing with Unrivaled,"Napheesa Collier drove to her left, stopped and hit a turnaround jumper over Aaliyah Edwards to capture the 1-on-1 tournament crown in the Unrivaled 3-on-3 womens basketball league. When the shot went in, Collier let out a triumphant yell. The moment captured how the Minnesota Lynx All-Star forward spent her WNBA offseason: Physically and mentally working on her game and raising her profile. After Collier and the Lynx came up short in their bid for a title last season  falling to Breanna Stewart and the New York Liberty in the WNBA Finals  Collier went to work as a one of the marquee players in Unrivaled and co-founder of the league. You always want to keep building, Collier said during Lynx training camp. Even though I had a good year last year, theres always things you can improve on, things that I wanted to get better at from last year. Things that I worked really hard at during the offseason and at Unrivaled. So really looking to implement that for this year. All of Colliers skills were on display during her eight-week stint with Unrivaled in Miami. She dazzled chase-down blocks, tough fadeaway jumpers and 3-pointers. The reigning WNBA Defensive Player of the Year honed the pieces of her game that made her a matchup nightmare in the league last year, and Colliers poised to be even better in the 2025 season, which starts later this month.  Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve likes to compare Colliers work ethic to that of Las Vegas Aces forward Aja Wilson, a three-time MVP of the league. 
        
     They each add something (to their game) every year, Reeve said. I think when Aja Wilson comes back this year, shes going to be even better than last year, which is scary  Same for Phee. Collier has added something each year, whether thats becoming more aggressive in hunting her shot or being a more consistent scorer off the dribble. That was clear during her stellar 2024 season, when Collier finished fifth in the league in scoring, third in rebounding and was the MVP runner-up behind Wilson. Averaging 20.4 points per game last season, Collier led the Lynx to their deepest playoff run since 2017, when a Sylvia Fowles-led squad won the championship one year after falling just short.  Collier is hoping for a similar run in 2025. No one is going to feel sorry for us, she said. We dont feel sorry for ourselves, but it is something that we use to fuel us. Its just a feeling you dont want to feel again, so making sure were coming in every single day, starting today, with good energy. The coaches were telling us ... about how they lost in a heartbreaker in 2016, and they used that to fuel them for 2017. Thats the story that we want to have for this year. For Collier, writing that story began with Unrivaled, the league she co-founded with Stewart to provide a stateside offseason option for WNBA players to compete while supplementing their income. Collier was the most dominant individual competitor in the 36-player league, unveiling an assortment of shot-making and defensive aggression. She was voted Unrivaled MVP after leading the league in points (25.7), field goals (10.4) and steals (2) per game while shooting 61.3% from the floor. Collier averaged 10.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists for the Lunar Owls, who finished with the best record in the league at 13-1. Collier took home $200,000 and elevated her brand after breezing through the field during Unrivaleds 1-on-1 tournament. She scored the second-most points in an Unrivaled game when she dropped 38 on 16-of-27 shooting against Stewarts Mist BC in February. Phee shows why shes one of the top players in the league, said Colliers Lunar Owls teammate Allisha Gray, who plays for the WNBAs Atlanta Dream. Every day she comes in. She works hard. Her conditioning is elite, top level. Shes somebody that if you want to get better, youll definitely want get in the gym and work out with her. Collier said her goal this offseason was to work on her ball-handling, which has improved since she came into the league out of UConn in 2019. Becoming a better ball-handler, she added, will help her be stronger in the paint. She also shot 32.7% from 3-point range at Unrivaled, her best from that range since her second season in the WNBA. But remembering that feeling of defeat in the finals is fueling Collier. Ive talked ad nauseam about last year, she said, but I think just using it to my advantage, honestly, where it does give me that leg up where I want to push just that little bit more. I want to win just that little bit more. Thats what it feels like. Thats what it felt like when I was playing at Unrivaled, and I want to keep that same mentality coming into the W season. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-lynx-napheesa-collier-unrivaled-426177a091ed8bb5826ca7b554c12fca,sports
Caitlin Clarks return to Iowa for Fever preseason game draws average ESPN viewership of 1.3 million,"BRISTOL, Conn.

Olympic great Sue Bird to be first managing director of USA Basketball womens national team,"NEW YORK (AP)  Sue Bird is giving another assist to USA Basketball, becoming the managing director of the womens national team. The five-time Olympic champion was named to the newly created position Thursday and it marks a major change in the way the organization creates its roster and coaching staff. I played for USA Basketball for so long and always really enjoyed my time with them, Bird said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. I love representing my country. I love being competitive on that stage. To have that opportunity to do it in a different role is exciting. Before the change, a committee made those decisions, but now in a move similar to what the USA mens national team does, Bird will be the one responsible for putting things together. Grant Hill has the same role on the mens side. We are really, really excited about Sue for so many reasons, USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said in a phone interview. Her pedigree and standing in the sport is so strong. Not just in womens basketball, but all of sport. Shes a tremendous leader and were very excited that she took this on for us. The mens team has had a managing director for two decades with Jerry Colangelo serving in that spot from 2005-21 before Hill took over. Shes had five Olympic gold medals herself and understands whats involved, Tooley said. Having the managing director position makes it easier to work with the staff for long term vision of the program. Its hard to do that with a committee that comes and goes and gets together a handful of times. 
        
     Tooley said Birds term will be for four years  the same as the Olympic cycle  and the change to this structure has been in the works for a few years, well before the decision to not select Caitlin Clark for the 2024 Paris Games team that left some people upset. Discussions happened after the 21 Olympics and Sue served on the board last quad, Tooley said. We got in discussions about the managing director role and we sat with her awhile and she gave it a lot of consideration and thought. Its an enormous responsibility. Bird said shes used to the pressure of USA Basketball where its basically win a gold medal or bust. The Americans have won eight straight, including one at last years Paris Olympics. This is a different type of pressure, she said. Im hoping to bring all that I learned as a player, all my experience, all my understanding. The whole goal is to win a gold medal and it feels at times thats the only option. ... I know what its like to be a player, know what its like as a player to build teams and have teams come together and see what clicks. Before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the Americans will play in the FIBA World Cup in Germany next year. The first qualifying event will take place in November. Besides figuring out what players will be on that team, Bird will have to decide who will be coaching the squad. There is no clear-cut choice right now. Of course Ive started to think about it, jotting some names down here and there, Bird said. Its the first priority without a doubt. There are so many qualified coaches in college and the WNBA. Bird said that she doesnt have a specific time frame to have a coach in place. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/usa-basketball-olympics-bird-11d908122c676d3cfee6a9bf90770260,sports
"Panthers release veteran edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney, rule out Jonathan Brooks for the season","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  The Carolina Panthers released veteran Jadeveon Clowney on Thursday after selecting two edge rushers in the NFL draft. Clowney, the No. 1 pick in the 2014 draft, had 5 1/2 sacks last season for the Panthers. He had one year left on his two-year, $20 million contract. The Panthers drafted Texas A&Ms Nic Scourton in the second round and Mississippis Princely Umanmielen in the third round in last months NFL draft with an eye to getting younger at the position. Carolina also signed free agent Patrick Jones II in free agency. Carolinas other edge rushers include D.J. Wonnum, DJ Johnson, Amare Barno, Kenny Dyson, Thomas Incoom and 2021 second-round pick Boogie Basham. The Panthers also placed running Jonathon Brooks, the teams second-round pick in 2024, on the physically unable to perform list  meaning he will not play in 2025. Brooks re-tore the ACL in his knee as a rookie in Week 14 after suffering a similar injury to the same knee during his final season at the University of Texas. The Panthers had prepared for just such a scenario with Brooks, adding depth to the running back room this offseason by signing free agent Rico Dowdle from the Dallas Cowboys and drafting Trevor Etienne from Georgia in the fourth round.  Carolina also waived tight end convert Colin Granger, a former college basketball player, as part of an injury settlement. The team also released tight end Jordan Matthews and receiver Dax Milne, and waived receiver T.J. Luther, offensive lineman Andrew Raym and defensive tackle Jerrod Clark. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/panthers-jadeveon-clowney-d6851dabd115a559c5816ae191b0cb8f,sports
Robert Saleh plans to revive the 49ers defense in his 2nd stint as coordinator,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP)  Robert Saleh once again is tasked with reviving the San Francisco defense following a rough season when the Niners struggled to slow down opposing offenses. The main difference this time when Saleh returns for a second stint as Niners defensive coordinator following an unsuccessful run as head coach of the New York Jets is the talent that he inherits. Instead of building a defense up nearly from scratch as he did in his first tenure, Saleh inherits a unit that features a former Defensive Player of the Year in edge rusher Nick Bosa, four-time All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner and versatile defensive back Deommodore Lenoir. Theres a lot of really good talent on this defense, Saleh said Thursday. So its not nearly as what 17 was. Saleh was hired as head coach Kyle Shanahans first defensive coordinator in 2017 and struggled the first two seasons. But after the team drafted Bosa in 2019 and implemented the wide nine scheme that featured edge rushers lining up wide and focusing on getting up field, the defense took off. San Francisco went to the Super Bowl in the 2019 season and still had a strong season the following season when Bosa missed almost the entire year with a knee injury, leading to Saleh getting the head coaching job with the Jets. Saleh was fired midway through this past season in New York, but the Jets had a strong defense under his tenure. During Salehs last two full seasons with the Jets in 2022-23, New York ranked first in yards passing allowed per game (178.9) and yards per play allowed (4.7), and second in total defense (301.7 yards per game). 
        
     Obviously, Ive gone through the head coaching stuff and you learn a lot going through that, Saleh said. But Im happy to be back in this chair where I get to coach a little bit more football and not deal with all the administrative stuff that comes with being a head coach. Saleh said he never considered taking a year off when he didnt get another shot at being a head coach and returning to the 49ers was his first choice as a coordinator. Saleh had high praise for the way Shanahan and general manager John Lynch run the organization and appreciates the loyalty they showed early in his first time as coordinator.  If you think about those first two years as D-coordinator in 17 and 18, it wasnt easy, he said. It could have been very easy for them to move on from me. Im indebted to this organization, to those men for the rest of my life. They stuck with me and we made it happen. We did what we needed to do, and the rest is history. Im excited about the opportunity to get the chance to do it again with them. Saleh said his defensive system has evolved since he left San Francisco as he tries to stay ahead of whatever offenses are doing around the NFL. He plans to bring in those new elements along with some of the successful changes that the Niners have undergone to create a new defense. He also will have to incorporate in several rookies who could be key contributors to fill several holes created earlier this offseason. Some things are the same, some things are the same from the Jets, some things are meshed, some things are coming in that are new, he said. Were trying to stay a couple years ahead. A lot of it may seem similar, but theres a lot of nuance that makes a difference. Saleh will be the fourth defensive coordinator in four seasons for San Francisco. DeMeco Ryans, who replaced Saleh in 2021, left to become head coach in Houston following the 2022 season, and Steve Wilks and Nick Sorensen were each replaced after one season the past two years. The 49ers regressed this season under Sorensen as the injury-filled unit struggled to create turnovers, stop the run and create consistent pressure on the quarterback. San Francisco ranked 29th in the league in scoring defense, allowing 25.6 points per game, and was tied for the seventh-fewest takeaways with 17. The Niners had just two takeaways over the final nine games and ended the season allowing at least 40 points in back-to-back games for the first time since 2015. Theres a lot of empathy for what happened to the group last year, Saleh said. There was a lot of things that, through the halfway point, this defense was playing some really good football and there were a lot of injuries and the wheels kind of fell off during the last four weeks of the season. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/49ers-robert-saleh-b219c5306139c7b5c24797c9a7cf529c,sports
Cardinals rookie cornerback Will Johnson ready to show his talent,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP)  Will Johnsons first few moments as a member of the Arizona Cardinals werent the best, with the cornerback still seething because of his fall from a potential top-10 pick to the second round because of injury concerns. Two weeks later, hes in a much better mood. Happy to be here, happy to get to work and happy to see whats to come, Johnson said. Johnsons demeanor has improved for many reasons, but mainly because his drop to the No. 47 overall selection meant he landed in Arizona. The Cardinals believe theyre an up-and-coming franchise under third-year coach Jonathan Gannon after finishing with an 8-9 record last season, which was a four-win improvement over 2023. Now theyre embarking on a defensive overhaul in an effort to return to the postseason for the first time since 2021. The Cardinals have made it clear that the 22-year-old Johnson is one of the centerpieces for that effort.  Hell get his first chance to reward that confidence on Friday, when the team opens rookie minicamp. You can tell theyre trying to win, Johnson said. Theyve got a lot of pieces on offense and you can tell theyre trying to get those same pieces on defenses to make it all come together. Weve just got to get to work and prove were great players. The Cardinals used six of their seven picks during Aprils draft on defensive players, adding Ole Miss defensive tackle Walter Nolen III at No. 16 before grabbing Johnson, who was a vital contributor during Michigans run to a national title in 2023.  
        
     Arizona also added Oregon edge rusher Jordan Burch in the third round, Ohio State linebacker Cody Simon in the fourth, Ohio State cornerback Denzel Burke in the fifth and Nevada safety Kitan Crawford in the seventh. The only offensive player taken was Texas guard Hayden Conner. The Cardinals also spent plenty of money on the defense during free agency, adding several veteran pieces, including Josh Sweat, Calais Campbell and Dalvin Tomlinson. I wouldnt want to be anywhere else, Johnson said. There is little concern about Johnsons ability on the field, but slightly more angst about his injury history. He played in just six games last season with the Wolverines, missing several weeks while dealing with turf toe. There was also a hamstring issue that kept him out of Michigans pro day during the pre-draft process. But the real red flag seems to be a knee issue that required surgery in 2023. Johnson said the injury hasnt bothered him since and has been adamant there are no lingering effects. Its all good, Johnson said. Ready to go. Johnson said hes ready to play for Gannon, a high-energy coach who as a coordinator helped lead the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl in 2022 before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs. Gannons specialty is coaching defensive backs and the Cardinals have used lots of draft capital on the position the past few years, adding Garrett Williams in 2023, Max Melton in 2024 and now Johnson. Much like Johnson, Williams fell to the third round in the 23 draft because of injury concerns. He was coming off a torn ACL but has quickly grown into a key contributor. Williams, Melton and Johnson could all have a major role this fall. Hes just very passionate about it, and you got to love someone who is passionate, Johnson said of Gannon. He cares about his players and is a players coach. That the kind of guy I want to play for. Johnson called Gannons defensive system a cornerbacks dream because it gives players the opportunity to play several different styles. For a confident player who feels he was overlooked during the draft, its just the kind of opportunity he was expecting. Ive been able to move on, its just motivation, Johnson said. I know theres going to be something special here, so Im excited for it. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/cardinals-will-johnson-19e205253f531f39391fd72e4bf0f4a7,sports
Bears sign No. 10 overall draft pick Colston Loveland to his rookie contract,"LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP)  The Chicago Bears signed first-round draft pick Colston Loveland to his rookie contract on Thursday. The Bears wasted little time locking in the tight end from Michigan after taking him with the No. 10 overall pick two weeks ago. He gets a four-year deal with a team option for the 2029 season. Last year, the Bears didnt sign No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams and first-rounder Rome Odunze until mid-July. Loveland was one of five draft picks Chicago signed on Thursday. The others were linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II (fourth round), defensive back Zah Frazier (fifth round), offensive lineman Luke Newman (sixth round) and running back Kyle Monangai (seventh round). Second-rounders Luther Burden III (receiver), Ozzy Trapilo (offensive tackle) and Shemar Turner (defensive end) remain unsigned. The 6-foot-6 Loveland gives the Bears a potentially potent tandem at tight end with Cole Kmet. He set a school record for a tight end with 56 receptions for 582 yards and five touchdowns as a junior last season. He was second-team All-Big Ten and a finalist for the John Mackey Award given to college footballs top tight end. He was first-team all-conference in the 2023 national championship season, when he caught 45 passes for 649 yards and four TDs. Loveland had surgery to reconstruct the AC joint in his right shoulder on Jan. 29 to fix an injury he suffered in September. He is expected to be ready by training camp. The Bears finished last in the NFC North at 5-12. They fired former coach Matt Eberflus in the middle of a 10-game losing streak and hired Ben Johnson in the offseason to replace him. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/chicago-bears-colston-loveland-c2a57caaf135f7f4a6e8678eba7f3896,sports
Mikko Rantanen and other trade deadline additions are having big impacts on the NHL playoffs,"Mikko Rantanen is showing exactly why Dallas was willing to pay such a hefty price to put him the roster. One of the players the Stars traded for Rantanen is also making a positive impact for his new team. Nearly every team in the second round of the NHL playoffs is benefitting from moves they made at the trade deadline. That includes Toronto with Brandon Carlo and Scott Laughton; Florida with Brad Marchand and Seth Jones; Washington with Anthony Beauvillier; Edmonton with Jake Walman and Trent Frederic; Winnipeg with Brandon Tanev and Luke Schenn; and the Carolina Hurricanes also with Taylor Hall and Mark Jankowski. One of those teams  or maybe Vegas, which made a move to get Reilly Smith back  will hoist the Stanley Cup in June and have a trade or two to credit for the journey. The Stars and Hurricanes are co-Cup favorites according to BetMGM Sportsbook after making the biggest deadline deal: Rantanen to Dallas for Logan Stankoven, two first-round picks and a third-rounder to Carolina. Rantanen has had a hat trick in each of the past two games  last weekend in Game 7 to knock out the Colorado Avalanche who traded him in late January and then in Wednesdays series opener at Winnipeg. Its a treat, teammate Sam Steel said. Hes one of the best players in the world and hes just on fire right now, so were just trying to get him the puck. Stars coach Peter DeBoer said Rantanen had an easy transition. That may be an understatement, as the 28-year-old Finn leads the postseason with eight goals and 15 points. 
        
     We all know how elite he is, Jets winger Nino Niederreiter said. Hes really done it these last few games and throughout his whole career  always a fantastic player. That was the Hurricanes thinking when they sent Martin Necas, Jack Drury and two picks to Colorado for Rantanen in an unexpected, blockbuster trade more than a month before the deadline. Avalanche president of hockey operations Joe Sakic  who drafted Rantanen with the 10th pick in 2015  heard after that move that the possibility of another trade back West was possible. With the clock ticking toward the deadline on March 7, first-year Hurricanes general manager Eric Tulsky made the most of the situation and dealt Rantanen to the Stars, who then signed him to an eight-year, $96 million extension. Rantanen is a playoff producer (101 points in 81 games before this spring, including helping Colorado win the Cup in 2022).  Carolina has gotten three goals this playoffs from Stankoven and three points from Hall, while Jankowski was a big reason for a perfect penalty kill in the first round. Theyve all helped in a lot of different ways on both sides of the puck, captain Jordan Staal said. Three great players that have really kind of solidified our lineup and played really well for us. So has Marchand for defending champion Florida, so far scoring at a point-a-game pace this playoffs. He and Jones felt welcomed right away. This team is built to want to win, and they have that drive, Marchand said. And when you walk in the room, everyone was really excited for each and every one of us to come in and be part of the group. The Capitals got Beauvillier in part because he has had some high-scoring playoffs. He had 27 points combined over two New York Islanders trips to the Eastern Conference Final and put up five points in his first six games with Washington. Theres something about important games and meaningful games that get me, I guess, a little bit more fired up and get my a little bit more focused, Beauvillier said.  Some of the additions have been more subtle: Laughton has a couple of points and Carlo is playing important minutes for the Maple Leafs as they try to get past the second round for the first time in more than two decades. Schenn and Tanev toughened up Winnipeg, and Walman and Frederic helped the Oilers fill holes vacated by Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway leaving last summer. Dallas also loaded up beyond Rantanen. General manager Jim Nills February trade for Cody Ceci and Mikael Granlund, also involving a first-round pick, has paid dividends. I cant say enough about Granlund and what hes brought, Cody Ceci  (without them) we dont get through the first round, DeBoer said. ___ AP Sports Writers Tim Reynolds in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Aaron Beard in Raleigh, North Carolina, Stephen Hawkins in Frisco, Texas, Pat Graham in Denver and the Canadian Press contributed. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/trade-deadline-nhl-playoffs-5db6ec2b01cea30ff575e7361b71fc29,sports
Sullivan makes sure to speak with every player on the roster as he starts anew as Rangers coach,"For Mike Sullivan, the latest coach of the New York Rangers, there will be many priorities in taking over a team that missed the playoffs a season after winning the Presidents Trophy. Foremost will be communication. I have spoken to every player on the roster over the last three days, Sullivan said Thursday at his introductory press conference. I think there is a fair amount of leadership in that room. Theres a lot of character in that room. Sullivan, the 38th coach in franchise history and fifth since 2018, agreed to lead the Rangers on May 2 after parting ways with Pittsburgh, where he won the Stanley Cup twice. He replaces Peter Laviolette, who was fired April 19 after the Rangers slid 29 points to miss the postseason despite their raft of talent. It will be up to Sullivan to resuscitate a power play that fell from the leagues top echelon to 28th overall in 2024-25 and help the defense improve in front of elite goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who is coming off his worst NHL season. Sullivan spent four seasons as a Rangers assistant under then-coach John Tortorella from 2009-13. He also coached current Rangers president and general manager Chris Drury during that time. They also worked together through USA Hockey at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February and will be part of the U.S. contingent for the 2026 Milan Olympics. Sullivan will have top scorers Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad and Adam Fox on his side after years guiding Penguins stars Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang in Pittsburgh, where he won the Cup in 2016 and 2017. 
        
     Ive grown so much respect over the years for the talent that the Rangers have, said Sullivan, who lost a seven-game first-round playoff series to the Rangers in 2022. I look forward to the opportunity to get to know these guys on a more personal level. I look forward to the opportunity to work with them, both on the ice and off the ice, to try to become the most competitive team that we can become. Also pressing for the 57-year-old Sullivan  who was drafted by the Rangers in 1987 and later played 709 NHL games for four other franchises  is how he will handle younger Rangers such as 22-year-old Brennan Othmann and 20-year-old Gabe Perreault, a first-round pick in 2023 who joined the team briefly at the end of last season. Part of coaching or the art of coaching, I guess, is trying to figure out what that daily recipe is thats best for the player, Sullivan said. Sometimes its time in the American League as a young player, sometimes its time in the National League depending on the types of minutes that that player can play. What I will tell you is that I think its important that every player earns their opportunities, that no ones entitled to an opportunity. Sullivan was joined Thursday by Drury, who was awarded a contract extension last month. Drurys previous two coaching hires  Laviolette and Gerard Gallant  each lasted two seasons. The 48-year-old executive expressed enthusiasm for the addition of Sullivan, the only U.S.-born coach with multiple Stanley Cup wins. The second Mike was available, we quickly and aggressively pursued him, Drury said. We are certainly thrilled that pursuit led us to this moment today. Theres a lot of work to be done. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-rangers-sullivan-71597d590ab7e5079a20288a28e5ff70,sports
"Fridays NHL games: Leafs seek 3-0 lead in Florida, Rantanen and Stars aim at 2-0 lead over Jets","Mikko Rantanen is on a history-making tear. The Florida Panthers need a history-making comeback. The Toronto Maple Leafs will seek a 3-0 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers on Friday night, while Rantanen  on a scoring roll the likes of which hockey hasnt seen in generations  will lead the Dallas Stars into Game 2 of their Western Conference semifinal series against the Winnipeg Jets. Florida lost a pair of one-goal games at Toronto to open their series, which resumes on the Panthers home ice for Game 3 on Friday. History says the Panthers are in big trouble: Toronto has won all 11 of its previous best-of-seven series when taking a 2-0 lead at home, Florida is 0-5 all-time in series where it dropped both Games 1 and 2, and leaguewide, teams facing 0-2 deficits come back to win those series only about 14% of the time. There are no magic words to say now, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Thursday. If there was, you would have said it two games ago, right? Were not holding back any gems, Maurice said. Thats probably the most important thing that you realize. We went on the road and lost two one-goal games. Our games not perfect. Neither is theirs. So, youre looking for an adjustment to foundation more than an adjustment to something unusual. Over in the West, where Dallas stuck first in Winnipeg with a 3-2 win, Rantanen is indeed doing something unusual  lots of things that are unusual, actually. 
        
     Hes the third player in NHL playoff history to have a hat trick in back-to-back games: Jari Kurri for Edmonton in 1985 and Doug Bentley for Chicago in 1944 are the others. Hes had a hand in each of Dallas last 12 goals, a streak unmatched by any player on any team in playoff history. Hes the first player in playoff history with at least eight goals and six assists in a four-game span. The first player with two three-goal periods in the same postseason. And on, and on, and on. Lets see how long he can run this for, Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. Hes rolling. Hes feeling it. Pretty impressive, what hes doing. I mean, considering the opponent and the time of year and how hes dominating games, really impressive. When/Where to Watch: Game 3, Friday, 7 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max) Series: Maple Leafs lead 2-0 If losing a pair of one-goal playoff games wasnt bad enough  5-4 in Game 1, 4-3 in Game 2  the Panthers can look at two goals given up in those games and really lament how those scores factored into creating their current situation. In Game 1, Seth Jones scored to get Florida within 2-1  and the Panthers gave up a goal to Morgan Rielly 19 seconds later. In Game 2, Anton Lundell scored early in the third to pull Florida into a 3-3 tie  only to have Mitch Marner score what became the game-winner 17 seconds later. The Leafs held serve at home, which is what they were supposed to do. Toronto became the first team to get to six wins in these playoffs and will be feeling very good about its game going into Game 3. It doesnt change how we go about our day today, Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said Thursday before Florida hopped aboard its charter flight back home. Its about recovering and putting the best foot forward to play our best game tomorrow night and get back in this thing. When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Friday, 9:30 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max) Series: Stars lead 1-0 Playoff hockey is different. Every opponent at this time of year is obviously proven. But the Winnipeg Jets  who needed seven games and a Game 7 miracle to escape St. Louis in Round 1  are right back into some hot water, in large part because theyre giving up a lot of goals. The Jets have given up 26 goals in the last six games, after not giving up more than 20 in any six-game span of the regular season. Rantanens hot streak is one thing, but Winnipegs defense wasnt exactly airtight going back to Round 1 either. And while the Jets survived a Game 7 at home to get here, the last thing they need is to go back to Dallas in a 2-0 hole. That starts with doing more against Rantanen. Hes just somebody that you always have to know when hes on the ice, Jets coach Scott Arniel said of facing Rantanen. Whenever you face elite players, youve got to know where they are. And hes feeling it. Weve got to know when hes on the ice. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-playoffs-panthers-leafs-stars-jets-a818f333aef5c649d391e941c2016a2c,sports

"Chet Lemon, a star on the Detroit Tigers 1984 championship team, dies at 70","CHICAGO (AP)  Chet Lemon, a three-time All-Star outfielder who helped the Detroit Tigers win the 1984 World Series, has died after a lengthy battle with blood cancer. He was 70. The Tigers announced his death in a post on X on Thursday.  The Detroit Tigers join all of baseball in mourning the passing of Chet Lemon, the team said. While he was a World Series champion and All-Star on the field, perhaps his biggest impact came off of it. That includes creating the Chet Lemon Foundation and dedicating much of his post-playing career to youth baseball development. Our thoughts are with Chets family, friends and all those he coached, mentored and inspired. Lemons wife, Gigi, told the Detroit Free-Press her husband had gone to sleep on his reclining sofa at their home in Apopka, Florida. He just wasnt responsive, she said. Lemon batted .273 with 215 homers and 884 RBIs over 16 seasons with Chicago and Detroit from 1975 to 1990. A first-round draft pick by Oakland in 1972, he played his first seven years with the White Sox and made All-Star teams in 1978 and 1979. Lemon was traded to Detroit following the 1981 season for fellow outfielder Steve Kemp. Three years later, he made his third All-Star team and helped Detroit bring home its first championship since 1968.  Lemon made a memorable catch in Game 3 of the World Series when he raced back and turned around to snare Terry Kennedys drive a few steps from the warning track in Tiger Stadiums notoriously deep center field. The Tigers won that game to go up 2-1 in the series and took the next two to capture the championship. 
        
     Chet was the kindest of men and always had that great smile on his face, Lance Parrish, an All-Star catcher on the 1984 team, said in a statement. He was also a fierce competitor on the baseball field and a great teammate. I loved him like a brother. In retirement, Lemon coached youth and high school and travel baseball in Florida. He also established the Chet Lemon Foundation, which helps athletes earn scholarships and provides support for people affected by strokes and aphasia. Lemon had battled health issues for the past three decades. He was diagnosed with polycythemia vera  a type of blood cancer that can lead to blood clots, according to the Mayo Clinic  and suffered a series of strokes that left him unable to walk or talk in recent years. Ill never forget his laughter and infectious smile, former Tigers pitcher Dan Petry said. His athleticism on the field always stood out. But he was an even better teammate and friend. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/chet-lemon-dead-detroit-tigers-9969d1ce16e94c5919ecf3b40ab535ae,sports
Mackenzie Hughes with a 63 leads at Myrtle Beach,"MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP)  Mackenzie Hughes of Canada birdied his last four holes Friday for an 8-under 63, giving him a one-shot lead after the first round of the Myrtle Beach Classic. The winner of the PGA Tour event  held opposite a signature event at the Truist Championship this week  gets a spot in the PGA Championship if not already eligible. Thats not the case for Hughes or two of the players one shot behind him  Seamus Power and Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark  both already in the field next week at Quail Hollow. Will Chandler also shot 64. He has yet to qualify for the PGA Championship. Hughes finished with a flurry, making five birdies over the last six holes. He is a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, though it has been more than two years since his last title. He felt like his putting has let him down in recent week, so he changed up his routine by being quicker and more instinctive on the greens. Putted nicely today, he said. Then at the end there I kind of caught fire. I cant remember the last time I birdied the last four holes. But its definitely a nice finish. The group at 66 included 44-year-old Nick Watney, who hasnt won in 13 years, and 17-year-old Blades Brown in his first year as a pro. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/mackenzie-hughes-myrtle-beach-pga-tour-9846b67a3889c95aa7d82d55d1e92c04,sports
"Shohei Ohtani could have landed 15-year deal, agent says, but he didnt want to risk skills decline","INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP)  Shohei Ohtani could have pursued a 15-year contract through age 44, agent Nez Balelo said Thursday, explaining the two-way superstar didnt want to risk a decline in his skills while under the big deal. Balelo pulled back the curtain that shrouds Ohtani a bit when he spoke at Sporticos Invest West conference featuring decision-makers in sports, entertainment and finance at the new Intuit Dome, home of the NBAs Los Angeles Clippers. Ohtanis $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers that he signed in December 2023 was the largest in professional sports. He won his third MVP award and first World Series title in his first season after moving from the Los Angeles Angels. A year later, Juan Soto went even bigger. The left fielder landed a $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in which none of the money will be deferred. We wouldnt do anything different, Balelo said afterward. He won a championship. He went to the right team. No regrets. Ohtanis deal includes $680 million in deferred payments. Those deferrals reduce the net present value of the contract to about $461 million for baseballs luxury-tax system, instead of an average of $70 million a year had there been no deferrals. Ohtani will be 38 when the contract ends after the 2033 season. We could have went to 13, 14, 15 years, Balelo said. But Shohei wanted to always kind of keep the integrity of where hes at as a player. He just didnt want to have the end of his storybook career tail off and then on year 13, 14 and 15, its just like who is this guy? You cant even run down first and hes not a guy anymore. 
        
     Balelo prefers operating behind the scenes and carefully controlling the narrative around Ohtani. But even he couldnt tamp down a cottage industry of rumors about which team would land Ohtani and how much it would cost. It was quite a ride, he said in a discussion moderated by Ben Verlander, MLB analyst for FOX Sports. A social media frenzy ensued when it was reported Ohtani was on a plane to Toronto to sign with the Blue Jays. Well, that was reckless reporting. We actually tried to let the individual know, No, were not on a plane, Balelo said. I felt bad for the country of Canada. I felt horrible for the organization because clearly they knew we werent. Ohtanis goals were to keep his new team competitive by allowing the club money to sign other players and to allow him to win championships and continue to be a two-way player. The Dodgers gave us their word thats what they were going to do, said Balelo, who works for CAA Sports baseball division. Ohtani is MLBs top endorser, with his earnings jumping from $65 million in 2024 to $100 million this year. Yeah, absolutely, those are real numbers, Balelo said. It continues to take on a life of its own. According to Balelo, Ohtani endorses just over 20 brands that are carefully vetted and chosen based on his use or belief in the product and the people behind it. His priority is his on-the-field performance and the training that goes into it. He takes that very, very serious and everything really becomes secondary other than his family, Balelo said. We just have to make sure that we dont overexpose him or put him in a situation where its too heavy of a lift. Balelo first spotted the future superstar as a high school junior in Ohtanis native Japan and followed him closely as Ohtanis pro career began with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. There were some things that that I did differently than I typically would when I recruit, he said, declining to elaborate when asked afterward. It was definitely a battle, thats for sure, but we came out on top and I was very fortunate. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/shohei-ohtani-dodgers-13f40a19b9eeac3202e2546143c57008,sports

War of words highlights buildup to UFC 315 in Montreal where political hostilities could overflow,"MONTREAL (AP)  The verbal gloves are off when it comes to the buildup to UFC 315, with the tension between the U.S. and Canada spilling into the card. Even the style of trash talk came up for debate in the headline event between welterweight champion Belal Muhammad and challenger Jack Della Maddalena. After Maddalena said it was time for Muhammad to retire, the champ countered that his Australian opponent isnt really good at trash talk. I just cant wait for him to eat his words and eat these fists, Muhammad said. Muhammad (24-3-0 with one no-contest) will put his championship on the line for the first time and is one of two title fights. Kyrgyz-Peruvian champion Valentina Shevchenko defends her flyweight crown against Manon Fiorot of France in the co-main event. Muhammad walked into the news conference room with his championship belt, wearing shades and a black basketball jersey with Bully written across the chest  a nod to his Bully B nickname. I do see myself as a bully, he said. I bully all these guys in the cage. The 36-year-old from Chicago is aiming for his 12th straight win after snatching the welterweight crown off Englands Leon Edwards at UFC 304 in July. Doing so in front of Canadian and mixed martial arts legend Georges St-Pierre  a three-time welterweight champion  would be a cherry on top. Hes on everybodys Mount Rushmore, a guy that I looked up to, Muhammad said. Thats what Im trying to chase, right? 
        
     My first goal was the gold. Now my next goal is the GOAT. So Im chasing him, and to be chasing him starting here in Montreal and in front of him is going to be great. Della Maddalena (17-2-0), meanwhile, is on a 17-fight win streak  including seven straight in the UFC  since dropping his first two bouts as a pro. A +145 underdog at BetMGM Sportsbook, he faces his stiffest test yet in Muhammad, but the calm-as-can-be 28-year-old doesnt expect the winning to stop in Montreal.  You learn a lot from losses. I learned a lot from both those ones, skill-wise and then mentally as well, and just been on a tear ever since, he said. Im glad to have got the losses behind me and all wins going forward. Shevchenko (24-4-1) is facing a new opponent for the first time in two years after three consecutive title bouts against Mexicos Alexa Grasso, having reclaimed the flyweight crown in September. Fiorot (12-1-0) is undefeated in seven UFC fights and trending as the slight -135 favorite to dethrone Shevchenko. Its because my past three fights have been total domination compared to her, whos had closer and tougher fights, Fiorot said. Shevchenko, 37, said shes never felt better. If compared myself to like (a) few years ago, Im a better version of myself  faster, stronger, more confident, she said. I feel the best shape that Ive been in my entire career. Its the UFCs eighth event in Montreal and first since 2015. Its also the 35th overall in Canada. Saturdays card is the first in Canada since Donald Trump was re-elected American president in November. It comes amid growing political tensions between Canada and the United States, as Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. I dont even think about that at all, UFC President and CEO Dana White said. That doesnt have an impact on what we do. Much like the 4 Nations Face-Off, however, political tensions between Canada and the U.S. could spill over into the arena. Bell Centre also was the site of three hockey fights in nine seconds when nations met at Februarys 4 Nations Face-Off. At least, thats how American welterweight Charles Radtke views his bout with Ontarios Mike Malott  especially amid the widespread booing of The Star-Spangled Banner at Canadian sports events. I dont (care) about hockey. Thats not my gig, Radtke said. But what I do hold dear is I grew up on a bison ranch with my grandfather, who was a sergeant major in the Marine Corps, and when you all boo the national anthem, somebodys gonna have to pay for that. Radtke has in recent months promoted Trumps 51st State rhetoric  the source of many boos during performances of the American national anthem north of the border  and spent much of his news conference trash-talking Canada. When asked about his message to the more than 20,000 Canadian fans likely to fill the building with jeers when he steps into the arena, he responded with an expletive. Mallott said he doesnt need to draw extra motivation from Radtkes noise. If thats where you want to put your energy, go for it, he said ahead of their preliminary card bout. Thats not where Im putting my energy. Im putting my energy into the octagon. It seems like were both really focused on me. Thats what I think about that. I dont care what this guys doing. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/ufc-315-muhammad-maddalena-montreal-6a14400cc9594ef3be450896abf69893,sports
Australian field hockey player who tried to buy drugs at the Paris Olympics returns from ban,"SYDNEY (AP)  Field hockey player Tom Craig was recalled to the Australian national team on Friday after serving a six-month suspension for trying to buy drugs at the Paris Olympics. The Australian player was stripped of his Olympic privileges when he was arrested in Paris following the sides Games quarterfinal exit last year. He spent the night in a Paris jail after attempting to buy drugs but escaped without a fine or conviction. The 29-year-old Craig was later handed a 12-month suspension by Hockey Australia, of which six were suspended. That didnt prevent him from playing overseas. Craig kept his contract in Germany where he pushed for a test recall under new Kookaburras coach Mark Hager. Craig, who has played 142 games for Australia, will remain in Europe ahead of the sides next Pro League legs in Belgium, England and Germany. Keeping the gratitude front of mind, Craig said of his mindset during the suspension. I cant really put to words how grateful I am for everyone whos supported me. Craig won Olympic silver with the team in Tokyo four years ago. ___ AP Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",https://apnews.com/article/australian-olympian-drugs-suspension-ac5c665e7f5af9cbea3e7f800c49ff16,sports

Rafael Devers tells Red Sox he wont move to first base,"BOSTON (AP)  Rafael Devers is the Boston Red Soxs designated hitter. And hes not interested in another position switch. Speaking with reporters for the first time since Triston Casas was ruled out for the season after rupturing his left knee tendon and undergoing surgery, Devers said on Thursday that Red Sox management approached him about the idea of filling in as Bostons first baseman.  The three-time All-Star doesnt see it in his best interest to make another position switch after being asked to move from third base to DH during spring training after the Red Sox signed Alex Bregman to play third. They came to me and talked to me about it, Devers said after homering and driving in two in Bostons 5-0 win over Texas.  I know Im a ballplayer, but at the same time, they cant expect me to play every single position out there. In spring training, they talked to me and basically told me to put away my glove. I wasnt going to play another position other than DH. Right now, I dont think it would be an appropriate decision by them to ask me to play another position. Devers said he spoke with Red Sox Chief Baseball Officer Craig Breslow about the prospect of playing first in Casas absence.  For now, Boston is filling the first base spot with a platoon featuring Romy Gonzalez and Abraham Toro. He (Breslow) played ball. I would like to think that he knows that changing positions isnt easy, Devers said through Red Sox interpreter Daveson Perez.  
        
     They put me in this situation. They told me they didnt want me to play any other positions. Devers offered a suggestion to Breslow, who pitched 12 major league seasons and was a key member of Bostons bullpen when the team won the World Series in 2013. Breslow is in his second season leading the Red Sox baseball operations department. Now, they should do their jobs essentially and hit the market and look for another player. Im not sure why they want me to be an in-between, Devers said. Next thing you know, someone in the outfield gets hurt and they want me to play in the outfield. I know the kind of player that I am and thats where I stand. Asked about changing his mind in the event the Red Sox receive little production from the current group of first basemen, Devers reiterated that hes a full-time DH.  He also stated that he was upset that Boston would consider him taking over a position where hes logged zero innings as a big leaguer. They told me that Im a little hard-headed, but they already asked me to change (positions) once. This time, I dont think I can be as flexible, Devers said. I dont feel they stayed true to their word. They told me I was going to play this position, DH. Now theyre going back on that. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/rafael-devers-boston-red-sox-6b555bbf156f83bcc4f2ce6ce9d6b29a,sports
A psychiatrist accused of negligence in Maradonas death does not regret the treatment provided,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  Psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov, one of the seven healthcare professionals on trial accused of negligence in the death of soccer great Diego Maradona testified on Thursday that she does not regret the treatment she provided to the former national team captain and blamed the private medical company for the deficiencies in his home care. Maradona had surgery for a hematoma that formed between his skull and brain and stayed in intensive care at Los Olivos clinic between Nov. 4-11. He then was sent recover to a private home where he died on Nov. 25. 2020 at the age of 60. I acted convinced that what I was doing was best for the patient, said the psychiatrist, the first of the defendants to testify in the courts of San Isidro, a northern suburb of Buenos Aires. In my role, I did what I could and even more. Cosachov was part of Maradonas medical team during the final stages of his life, along with neurosurgeon Leopoldo Luque and psychologist Carlos Daz. The three are on trial with doctors Nancy Forlini and Pedro Di Spagna; Mariano Perroni, a representative of the company that provided the nursing service; and nurse Ricardo Almirn. Maradona died in a rented house in Tigre, a northern suburb of Buenos Aires. Cosachov broke down in tears twice during her testimony, once when the presiding judge asked her what she thought happened to Maradona, to which she responded simply: I dont know. 
        
     Three judges will decide whether those charged are guilty of manslaughter. The maximum jail time for those sentenced is 25 years. According to the prosecution, the accused professionals didnt provide adequate medical care. We were all in agreement for home hospitalization, the psychiatrist stated, referring to Maradonas daughters, his sisters, his ex-wife, and the companys doctors. Involuntary hospitalization was also considered but the family didnt want that and home hospitalization was the only option. According to testimony of the director of the clinic where Maradona had surgery, the soccer star requested alcohol during the post-operative period, and was difficult to deal with. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/maradona-trial-argentina-6f9955067932f5fc33d7e7970d41027c,sports
"Montero, Keith lead Tigers over slumping Rockies 11-1 to sweep doubleheader","DENVER (AP)  Keider Montero pitched eight strong innings, Colt Keith homered, and the Detroit Tigers beat the Colorado Rockies 11-1 in the second game on Thursday to sweep their doubleheader. Spencer Torkelson had three hits and Brewer Hicklen singled in the third for his first career hit for Detroit. The Tigers won the first game 10-2 and finished 7-3 on their 10-game road trip. Montero (1-1) allowed a run and five hits to earn his first victory since Sept. 15, 2024. Two of Monteros seven career wins have come against the Rockies.

Former Australian test cricketer Stuart MacGill is spared jail time over supplying cocaine,"SYDNEY (AP)  Former Australian test bowler Stuart MacGill was spared jail time and given a community service order when he appeared in court on Friday for sentencing over supplying cocaine. MacGill was convicted of supplying drugs for a deal between his regular supplier and his brother-in-law in April 2021. He appeared at Downing Centre District Court where a statement from former test captain Steve Waugh supported his former colleague. MacGill was sentenced to an intensive corrections order of one year and 10 months. MacGill must complete 495 hours of community service work and undergo drug testing as part of the order, in lieu of a prison term. The former legspinner, who began using cocaine after he retired from cricket, was found guilty in March of supplying an indictable quantity of the drug. A jury determined the 54-year-old MacGill knew about the deal between his regular dealer and his brother-in-law but was oblivious to the fact a one-kilogram (2.2-pound) brick was changing hands. He was acquitted of taking part in a large commercial drug supply. His role in the lucrative cocaine deal led to his alleged violent kidnapping days later. He was shoved into the back of a car by several men and taken to an abandoned building in Sydneys western suburbs, where he was assaulted and threatened before being released. Six days later, MacGill went to police but denied any involvement in the drug deal. He was arrested in 2023. 
        
     Judge Nicole Noman said Friday that MacGill played an indispensable role setting up the cocaine deal. His role was essential to bring the parties together and for the transaction to occur, she said. The offenders colossal lapse of judgment has been causative of a very public fall from grace. MacGills international career from 1988 to 2008 which featured 208 wickets in 44 test matches was largely overshadowed by fellow Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, who is second on the list of all-time leading wicket takers in test cricket. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/cricket-stuart-macgill-drugs-b494820be78811f0b10cf9f07f78c480,sports
Ottawa Charge beat the Montreal Victoire 3-2 in Game 1 of PWHL semifinal series,"LAVAL, Quebec (AP)  Shiann Darkangelo broke a third-period tie, Gwyneth Philips made 31 saves and the Ottawa Charge beat the Montreal Victoire 3-2 on Thursday night in Game 1 of the PWHL semifinal series. Darkangelo took a pass from Emily Clark, and beat goalie Ann-Renee Desbiens with a wrist shot from the right side at 9:17.  Clarky made a great pass out to me and kind of made my job easy to get the puck on net  and in back the net, Darkangelo said. Just try to hit the net there, and good things happen. Charge captain Brianne Jenner had a power-play goal and Ashton Bell also scored. Game 2 of the best-of-five series is Sunday in Laval. Regular-season champion Montreal elected to face third-place Ottawa instead of fourth-place Minnesota. We dont need external motivation, Ottawa coach Carla MacLeod said. Weve come into this playoffs confident in what allowed us to get to this point. Its not about who were playing or where were playing. Its that we are playing, and were playing Ottawa Charge hockey right now. Maureen Murphy and Marie-Philip Poulin had power-play goals for Montreal. Desbiens stopped 24 shots. Its tough. Hockey is tough, Montreal forward Laura Stacey said. I had to take a deep breath before coming in here, because it hurts. Losing hurts, especially in the playoffs when you want it that bad. Jenner opened the scoring on a power play at 4:54 of the first period, and Murphy tied it on a power play with 7:47 left in the period. 
        
     Bell put Ottawa back on top at 5:07 of the second, and Poulin tied it on a power play at 7:12 of the period. We have a lot of respect for them and a lot of respect for the way that they play, Jenner said. But at the same time, were confident. When we bring a solid 60 minutes, we have a great chance of beating any club. ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/charge-victoire-score-pwhl-hockey-playoffs-62cb44212dfbb9ca009d88e6d8eb6e93,sports

Trial of ex-high school basketball coach who conducted naked fat tests comes to a close,"WAKEFIELD, R.I. (AP)  Attorneys on Friday will deliver closing arguments in the trial of a former Rhode Island high school basketball coach facing criminal charges after authorities say he repeatedly asked male student-athletes to remove their clothes while alone with him so he could check their body fat.  Aaron Thomas, 57, who coached at North Kingstown High School from the 1990s until he resigned in 2021, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree child molestation and second-degree sexual assault.  The trial began last month and has involved 10 students testifying against Thomas, with some of the testimony turning emotional as the former students recalled the embarrassment at being pinched with a caliper while naked in front of their coach. One student said Thomas was visibly aroused while conducting the so-called naked fat test. A key detail surrounding the case is the question Thomas would present to the male athletes, asking if they were shy or not shy. Those who said no were asked to strip naked, allowing Thomas to pinch various areas of their bodies, including near their groins and buttocks.  During his testimony, Thomas told his attorney he likely saw more than 600 student-athletes throughout his career, with roughly 80% of them taking their underwear off during the test. He acknowledged that removing the underwear was not necessary. Meanwhile, four separate students testified in favor of the tests. They told the jury that it helped them become better athletes.  
        
     Thomas was the last witness to take the stand. Notably, on his third day of testifying, Thomas apologized and confirmed he lied to law enforcement when he was initially asked if students were naked for the tests.  Im truly sorry that it occurred the way it occurred, Thomas said. It was never my intent to ever hurt or cause any kind of pain, or embarrass, or make uncomfortable, even, any of the student-athletes. It was just for competitive advantage. Thomas added that it was a foolish thing and now can see how it could be construed.  Thomas criminal investigation started in late 2021 and involved interviews with more than 30 former students, as well as teachers, coaches, administrators and medical professionals.  Although Thomas is alleged to have performed the tests on multiple students over many years, the charges relate to just two, authorities said. One was under age 14 at the time of the alleged crime between September 2000 and February 2002.",https://apnews.com/article/fat-pinching-teacher-d71e82ac02144b637ce12855b9ea7c17,sports

Former France and Man United player Evras mixed martial arts debut postponed,"PARIS (AP)  Former France and Manchester United player Patrice Evras mixed martial arts debut has been postponed. The 43-year-old Evra was set to fight in Paris on May 23, but the Professional Fighters League Europe said on Thursday that the event had been rescheduled to a later date yet to be announced. The PFL said Evra, who retired from soccer in 2019, has been training in combat alongside MMA star Cdric Doumb. Ive been training alongside the best in the world for years, and theyll also tell you Im ready for this, Evra said. Evra played for Manchester United nearly 400 times from 2006-14. He captained the club on several occasions. He also played for Nice, Monaco, Juventus, Marseille and West Ham. He was named France captain at the 2010 World Cup but was stripped of the captaincy during the tournament after the team went on strike at training. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/mma-evra-debut-delayed-af92b6a24ca08170e39879ac701ce1f9,sports
"Texas regents approve basketball coach Sean Millers 6-year, $32 million contract","AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  The University of Texas System Board of Regents approved Longhorns basketball coach Sean Millers six-year, $32 million guaranteed contract on Thursday, as the school tries to boost a program that struggled in its first year in the Southeastern Conference. Texas will pay Miller about double that of his predecessor Rodney Terry. Terry still had three years left on a five-year contract that paid him about $3 million per year when he was dismissed in March. Millers deal starts at $4.8 million for the 2025-26 season and increases by $200,000 every year through the 2030-31 season. He also got a one-time $250,000 relocation payment, and can earn up to $850,000 in bonuses every season depending on conference championships, personal awards and how far Texas advances in the NCAA Tournament. Texas hired Miller from Xavier after the Musketeers beat Texas in the NCAA Tournament in a First Four matchup just a few days earlier. The 56-year-old Miller had two stints at Xavier and also coached at Arizona. He coached the Musketeers from 2004-09 before leaving for Arizona. He then returned to Xavier in 2022 after he was fired at Arizona. Millers teams have made the NCAA Tournament 13 times with four trips to the Elite Eight. He is 487-196 overall in 20 seasons. He now inherits a Texas program looking to find its footing in the SEC, college basketballs dominant league this season. Texas finished 14th in the 16-team conference and barely scraped its way into the NCAA Tournament before its early exit. 
        
     Terry led Texas to the Elite Eight as interim coach in 2023, but pressure mounted as he struggled to maintain that success. Texas made quick exits from the tournament the past two seasons, and was just 6-12 in league play in its first season in the SEC. Miller faces a significant rebuild of the Texas roster. Tre Johnson, the SEC freshman of the year and the Longhorns scoring leader last season, declared for the NBA draft and eight other players either finished their college eligibility or transferred. Texas has signed transfers Simeon Wilcher from St. Johns, Lassina Traore and Dailyn Swain from Xavier, Matas Vokietaitis from Florida Atlantic and Camden Heide from Purdue. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Alcaraz back from injury hoping to renew rivalry with Sinner at Italian Open,"ROME (AP)  Carlos Alcaraz says he has recovered from the muscle injuries that forced him to withdraw from the Madrid Open and is 100% ready for the Italian Open  where he hopes to renew his rivalry with Jannik Sinner. Alcaraz had an upper leg ailment that bothered him during the Barcelona Open final, plus a left leg injury. Im in a good shape. Im 100% ready to start the tournament, Alcaraz said in Rome on Thursday. Alcaraz opens against Serbian qualifier Dusan Lajovic on Friday. During the Spaniards Rome debut last year, he lost to then-135th-ranked Hungarian qualifier Fabian Marozsan in the third round as he dealt with a bothersome right forearm issue. But Alcaraz then went on to win back-to-back Grand Slam titles at the French Open and Wimbledon. Last year was even more difficult, Alcaraz said, noting how this clay season he has already won the Monte Carlo Masters and reached the final in Barcelona, where he lost to Holger Rune. I wasnt worried at all, Alcaraz said. Right now I have confidence. The practices (have gone) well. ... I cant wait for tomorrow. I think my level is in a good spot. The Rome tournament also marks the return of top-ranked Sinner from a three-month doping ban. Sinner and Alcaraz are in opposite sides of the draw. Im really happy to have him around again, Alcaraz said. Obviously for him was tough and Im pretty sure was super long.  It is great for me, for tennis, for the fans, that hes able to play a tournament again. Hopefully, the third-ranked Alcaraz added, Im going to meet him at the final. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/carlos-alcaraz-italian-open-6d1cb1c1ddaed229a0104a9ffcb99b29,sports

Punjab vs Delhi game in Indian Premier League abandoned after power outage,"DHARAMSALA, India (AP)  A power failure led to the abandonment of the Indian Premier League game between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals on Thursday with both teams awarded one point. One of the light towers at the stadium malfunctioned due to the outage, and the game was called off. Rain and a wet outfield had delayed the start by an 90 minutes and Punjab cruised to 122-1 in 10.1 overs before the outage. Due to a power outage in the area, one of the light towers at the HPCA stadium malfunctioned, the IPL said in a statement. BCCI regrets the inconvenience caused to the in-stadium attendees. Priyansh Arya (70) and Prabhsimran Singh (50 not out) both took on the new ball bowlers Mitchell Starc and Dushmantha Chameera as Punjab raced to 50 in the first four overs. Arya completed his third half-century of the season soon after the batting powerplay of six overs off just 25 balls. Prabhsimran became the first uncapped batter to score four successive half-centuries in the IPL that featured seven boundaries. Arya smashed six sixes and five boundaries in his aggressive knock of 34 balls before he top-edged fast bowler T. Natarajan and the players walked off the field due to power failure. It was the last game of the season in Dharamsala after the organizers shifted Punjabs scheduled game on Sunday against Mumbai Indians from Dharamsala to Ahmedabad because of India-Pakistan tensions. 
        
     The IPL cited logistical challenges on Thursday. Airports in Dharamsala and Chandigarh  where Punjab Kings are based  have been closed for civilian and commercial purposes since Wednesday. Airports across Indias northwestern corridor have been similarly closed off. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/punjab-delhi-ipl-power-outage-62a13a910a0c66bf8f61f245e621de6d,sports
Brewers option Elvin Rodrguez to minors and send Aaron Civale on rehab assignment,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  The Milwaukee Brewers optioned right-hander Elvin Rodrguez to Triple-A Nashville on Thursday, one day after he allowed six runs over 3 1/3 innings of relief in a 9-1 loss to the Houston Astros. Rodrguez, 27, has an 0-2 record and 8.68 ERA in six appearances with Milwaukee this season. He has allowed seven homers in 18 2/3 innings. While 10 other NL pitchers also had given up at least seven homers this season heading into Thursdays games, each of the others had pitched at least 28 innings. The Brewers also announced Thursday that right-hander Aaron Civale has been sent to Nashville for a rehabilitation assignment as he recovers from a strained left hamstring.

Marquette announces addition of womens swimming to its list of varsity programs,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Marquette is launching a womens swimming program, marking the first time it has added a varsity sport since 2013. School officials have launched a national search for someone to coach the program, which could begin competition as early as the 2025-26 school year. Marquette plans to compete in the Big East championships in womens swimming, but it wont have a diving program. Big East schools that already have womens swimming include Butler, UConn, Georgetown, Providence, Seton Hall, Villanova and Xavier. Adding womens swimming will improve gender equity in athletics and provide a revenue generation opportunity for the university, while offering a competitive Division I experience for our student-athletes, athletic director Mike Broeker said in a statement. Its a win-win for our department and university. The team will train and compete in the recently renovated Wellness + Helfaer Recreation facility, which includes a six-lane, 25-yard pool plus seating for nearly 150 spectators and a dedicated team locker room. The facility would be able to host dual competitions, though any larger meets would take place off campus. Womens swimming becomes Marquettes 17th varsity sport, which includes nine womens programs. Marquette last launched a new program in 2013, when it added mens and womens lacrosse. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",https://apnews.com/article/marquette-women-swimming-47dfc06e55810627f38d681a96a402fa,sports
Brooks Lees go-ahead double in 8th leads Twins to 5-2 victory over Orioles for series sweep,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Brooks Lee had a tiebreaking two-run double with two outs in the eighth inning to propel the Minnesota Twins to a 5-2 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday, completing a three-game sweep with their fifth straight victory. Lees double came off reliever Gregory Soto, who entered after Yennier Cano (0-2) walked Harrison Bader leading off and Byron Buxton with one out. Soto struck out Trevor Larnach before Lee doubled to center. Ty France followed with an RBI single for a three-run lead. Buxton went 0 for 2 after homering in three straight games, but he walked twice, scored twice, stole a base and threw a runner out at home. Emmanuel Rivera and Ramn Laureano had RBI doubles in back-to-back innings off Twins starter Bailey Ober for a 2-1 lead in the third. Buxton threw out Rivera, who doubled and was trying to score on Gunnar Hendersons single in the sixth. The Twins tied it in the bottom half on a leadoff homer by Larnach  his fifth. Kremer has surrendered eight of Baltimores MLB-high 55 homers. Ober allowed two runs  one earned  on eight hits in five innings. Griffin Jax (1-2) pitched a scoreless eighth and Jhoan Duran earned his sixth save. Kremer went seven innings, allowing two runs on three hits with eight strikeouts for the Orioles, who have lost five straight and 9 of 11. Minnesotas Royce Lewis, who returned from a hamstring injury to make his season debut on Tuesday, went 0 for 3 and is in a 0-for-30 slump since last Sept. 24. Orioles catcher Maverick Handley singled for his first career hit. 
        
     Baltimore was 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position against Ober. Twins pitchers entered with the fifth-best ERA in the AL (3.48) and fourth-most strikeouts (327). The Orioles were last in both at 5.50 and 247. The Twins will start RHP Chris Paddack Friday to open a three-game series against the Giants.

Rafael Devers homers and drives in two runs as the Red Sox beat the Rangers 5-0,"BOSTON (AP)  Rafael Devers homered and drove in two runs, and five Boston pitchers combined for a five-hit shutout as the Red Sox defeated the Texas Rangers 5-0 on Thursday afternoon. Devers hit a solo shot for his sixth home run of the season, sending it into the Green Monster seats in the seventh inning. His first RBI of the game came on a single in the fifth inning. Carlos Narvaez also produced a run-scoring single for the Red Sox, which took two of three against the Rangers. Red Sox starter Bryan Bello teamed up with four relievers to produce Bostons third shutout of the season. Justin Slaten (1-3) earned the win with 1.1 scoreless innings. Garrett Whitlock tossed one inning with Liam Hendricks finishing off Texas with two innings. Texas starter Jack Leiter (2-2) took the loss, giving up four runs and walking four in 5.1 innings. No. 9 hitter Tucker Barnhart collected two of the Rangers five hits. Texas has now dropped nine of its last 12 games. Boston took advantage of Leiter issuing two walks and throwing a wild pitch in the second inning en route to building a 2-0 lead. Trevor Story led off with a single and scored on a wild pitch while Jarren Durans grounder to second plated the second run of the frame. Bello ran into control problems that left him one out short of qualifying for his third win. Boston manager Alex Cora turned to the bullpen after Bello issued his fifth walk to set up a two-on, two-out scenario for the Rangers in the fifth inning. Slaten came on and got a grounder for the final out and closed the book on Bello, who tossed 4.2 innings but only threw 44 of his 83 pitches for strikes. 
        
     Whitlock found himself in trouble in the seventh after throwing a wild pitch that moved the two Texas baserunners into scoring position with two down. Trying to avoid getting charged with his third blown save in as many outings, Whitlock kept Bostons shutout bid alive by getting Rangers No. 3 hitter Joc Pederson to fly out to center for the innings final out. Bello lowered his ERA to 1.10 in three starts at Fenway Park this season. Rangers: Travel to Detroit with Texas slated to start LHP Patrick Corbin (2-1, 3.28) against Tigers LHP Tarik Skubal (3-2, 2.21) on Friday.

Los Angeles Coliseum and SoFi Stadium to share opening and closing ceremonies for 2028 Olympics,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Itll be a mix of old and new for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and Paralympic Games. The historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in nearby Inglewood will share the ceremonies, city officials announced Thursday, confirming what was part of the citys bid in 2017. It will be the Coliseums third time hosting the ceremony  the most in Olympic history  and itll be the first time two locations have shared it. SoFi will also host swimming at the Games. The torch lit by decathlon gold medalist Rafer Johnson at the 1984 Los Angeles Games is still atop the Coliseums entrance.

US striker Baloguns return to fitness boosts Monacos Champions League hopes,"MONACO (AP)  Folarin Balogun is back in form and thats excellent news for Monaco as the race for Champions League places draws to a close in Ligue 1. The United States forward last weekend played his first full match since shoulder surgery in December and was excellent throughout, helping Monaco to a crucial 3-1 win at Saint-Etienne that kept the Principality side in contention for a place in Europes elite competition.  Playing 90 minutes is definitely a positive thing for my fitness and confidence, Balogun said after scoring his first league goal this year. Its good to have helped the team win by scoring. Its always difficult to return to 100% when you injure your shoulder. Monaco next has a tough game against Lyon on Saturday. With two rounds left and Paris Saint-Germain already crowned champion, second-placed Marseille has just a one-point lead over Monaco. A trio of chasing teams  Nice, Lille and Strasbourg  lag one point further back. The top three qualify for the group stage of the Champions League, and the fourth team grabs a spot in the qualifying rounds. Marseille travels to struggling Le Havre on Saturday. PSG, which qualified for the Champions League final on Wednesday, is at last-placed Montpellier. Balogun returned to action in March with the clubs reserve team in a friendly against Brighton Under-23s. The American international scored a hat trick in the first half and gradually came back to full fitness, making five substitute appearances before getting a starting nod last week. 
        
     The forward was previously sidelined for about two months by the injury and returned to competition at the end of November. But he took a hit during a match against Marseille that aggravated the problem and he opted for surgery. It takes time to regain ones full capacity, and I didnt know when I would be back, Balogun said. I was a little anxious but Im glad I took the time because Im now completely confident. Baloguns presence against Lyon is also timely if fellow forward Mika Biereth is not fully fit after getting injured at Saint-Etienne. The American striker started alongside Biereth up front and the chemistry was obvious.  Weve played together in the past at Arsenal, so hes a player Im familiar with, Balogun said. We have a very good connection, and I love playing with him. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/ligue1-balogun-monaco-bfd7247cf5aa327dfe3042c3561cb204,sports
Bundesliga Preview: What to watch in German soccer this weekend,"BERLIN (AP)  Beers and tears are set to flow in the Bundesliga amid Bayern Munichs title celebrations, farewell tributes, and two teams potentially relegated from the division this weekend. Bottom two Bochum and Holstein Kiel could be demoted on Saturday if their and other results dont go their way. Bayern, which clinched its 34th German championship last weekend with two rounds to spare, will be presented with the trophy after its home match against Borussia Mnchengladbach on Saturday, when the departing Thomas Mller will be honored after 25 years at the club. England star Harry Kane will finally get to take part in title-winning celebrations. Meanwhile, a host of teams are fighting for European qualification with just two points between Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund and Leipzig in the race for the last Champions League qualification spot. Only the top four teams qualify for Europes premier competition. 
        
      Bochum needs to avoid defeat at Mainz to stave off demotion. Even a win might not be enough if Heidenheim wins at Union Berlin at the same time. Heidenheim is third from bottom, four points clear of Bochum, in the relegation playoff place.  Kiel would be demoted by a defeat to Champions League-chasing Freiburg if Heidenheim beats Union. Freiburg, which should have beaten Bayer Leverkusen last weekend, will be targeting three points to defend the all-important fourth place.  Borussia Dortmund has put itself in contention for the Champions League with three straight wins since its 2-2 draw with Bayern. Niko Kovas team next visits Leverkusen on Sunday, when the home team will be under pressure to produce a good showing to appease fans frustrated by the speculation over Xabi Alonsos future as coach.  Third-placed Eintracht Frankfurt can secure Champions League qualification with a win over visiting St. Pauli on Sunday. Even a draw will be enough if Freiburg fails to beat Kiel or Dortmund fails to beat Leverkusen earlier. But St. Pauli could be playing for its survival, depending on other results on Saturday. A win would guarantee the Hamburg teams place in the Bundesliga next season.  Dortmund forward Serhou Guirassy scored twice against Wolfsburg last weekend and already has 19 goals in his first season with the club. His goals could prove vital if Kovas team is to complete its renaissance with Champions League qualification. Dortmund was 11th when Kova took over.  Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya is the fastest player in the Bundesliga, clocked at more than 37 kph (23 mph) against Bochum in the 26th round. The 19-year-old French forward has made 32 appearances for Frankfurt this season.  Jamal Musiala is still working on his comeback for Bayern. The 22-year-old Germany star hasnt played since early April because of a left thigh injury but the club is hopeful hell be fit for the revamped Club World Cup in the United States next month.  Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano has returned to training after a knee operation, but Kim Min-jae needs more time after an Achilles problem.  Heidenheim goalkeeper Kevin Mller left hospital on Monday after a serious head injury in last weekends game against Bochum, which also took a heavy toll on Bochum forward Philipp Hofmann. Hofmann broke a rib causing his lung to collapse and will miss the rest of the season.  Mainz defender Dominik Kohr is out for the rest of the season with a left knee injury from Sundays 1-1 draw with Frankfurt.  St. Pauli winger Elias Saad is also out with a right thigh injury from last weekends 0-0 draw with Werder Bremen, becoming the clubs fourth player to miss the rest of the season after James Sands, Karol Mets and captain Jackson Irvine.  The Bild tabloid reported this week that Dortmund has decided against offering new deals to Emre Can, Julian Brandt, Pascal Gro and Niklas Sle.  The Ruhr Nachrichten reports that Dortmund is interested in bringing another Bellingham to the club, Jobe, the younger brother of Jude, who had a successful stint in Dortmund before his big-money move to Real Madrid. The 19-year-old Jobe Bellingham plays for Sunderland in Englands second division.  Liverpool is targeting Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller, according to the Stuttgarter Nachrichten. The local newspaper reports Stuttgart would demand a club record fee of 60 million euros to let the defensive midfielder go. The 24-year-old Stiller has played almost every game for Stuttgart this season and made four appearances for Germany. Some are calling him the new Toni Kroos.  Im definitely keen to leave my comfort zone at some point and experience something new.

PSG vs. Inter Milan in the Champions League final? Few expected that,"Its a Champions League final few could have predicted. No Real Madrid. No team from the mega-rich Premier League. No rejuvenated Barcelona. And no Harry Kane-inspired Bayern Munich. Instead, it will be Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan facing off to be a somewhat unlikely winner of the biggest prize in club soccer. Neither club was among the favorites when the new-look, 36-team league phase of the competition rolled out in September. Indeed, PSG  without Kylian Mbapp and at the start of the post-galacticos era  guaranteed its place in the knockout stage only by winning its final game of the league phase. Months later, however, PSG has been widely admired as perhaps the most stylish team in the competition after ending the title hopes of a succession of English opponents in its latest bid for its first European title. Meanwhile, three-time champion Inter, another team lacking superstars but well-coached and with a never-say-die spirit, has gone under the radar once again like it did when reaching the final in 2023 and losing to Manchester City. Heres a closer look at the details of the final, the teams and their route to the title match: Munichs Allianz Arena will host the final on May 31. Its the fifth time the German city has staged the European Cups title match. The first three  1979, 1993, 1997  were at Munichs previous home, Olympiastadion. The Allianz Arena was the host for Chelsea beating Bayern in a penalty shootout in 2012. American rock band Linkin Park will play the pre-match show. Real Madrid earned almost 139 million euros ($154 million) from its title-winning campaign in the Champions League last season and this seasons winner should get more. Last years prize fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) rose by 25% this season in the expanded format featuring more teams (36, up from 32) and more games (eight instead of six in the first stage). So expect PSG or Inter earn at least 150 million euros ($170 million) if the team winds up as champion. These coffers can be further boosted across June and July, when both teams will be in the United States for the expanded 32-team Club World Cup. Winning that competition could net PSG or Inter more than $100 million from the $1 billion prize money fund. The finalists have never met in the Champions League. Thats a refreshing rarity for two big clubs who regularly compete in Europe. PSG became the third French team to reach the European Cup final on two occasions, after Reims (1956 and 59) and Marseille (1991 and 93). PSGs other time was in 2020, when losing to Bayern Munich 1-0 in Lisbon. PSGs road to Munich has gone mostly through England. After seeing off fellow French club Brest in the playoffs, PSG has beaten Liverpool, Aston Villa and lastly Arsenal in successive rounds in the knockout stage  having also defeated then-Premier League champion Manchester City in a key victory in the next-to-last round of the league stage. Qualification was in the balance at that stage, with PSG having won just one of its first five league games only to win its last three. Inter was a two-time European champion before PSG was even founded in 1970, after titles in 1964 and 1965, while the Italian team added a third European crown in 2010. Unlike PSG, Inter qualified directly to the last 16 after finishing in fourth place, conceding just one goal in its eight league games. In the knockout stage, Simone Inzaghis team overcame Feyenoord in the round of 16, Bayern in the quarterfinals and Lamine Yamal and Barcelona in a pair of epic legs in the semifinals. PSGs relatively brief history was underwhelming until the club was bought in 2011 by Qatar Sports Investments. Then came the soccer boom in the capital and the arrival of trophy after trophy  well, at domestic level anyway. PSG has won 11 of the last 13 Ligue 1 titles but now the hardware the Qatari owners want is the Champions League. There will be extra satisfaction if it happens after a change in approach that has seen the club shed the superstars  Lionel Messi, Neymar and Mbapp  and rely on mostly young and hungry replacements, such as midfielder Joo Neves and forward Dsir Dou. It has been a more financially turbulent story at Inter, which has been owned by U.S. investment fund Oaktree since May last year after the eight-year tenure of Chinese retail giant Suning came to an end amid mounting debts. For three years before that, Inter was owned by a consortium led by Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir, which bought out Massimo Moratti. PSG has already clinched another French league this season, while Inter is still in a fight with Napoli to retain the Serie A title. ___ Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80 ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/champions-league-final-psg-inter-milan-a3ccc78740bdd82b85c20347aada197f,sports
Beckham and Neville part of new ownership group at English soccer club Salford,"David Beckham and Gary Neville are part of a new consortium to have taken ownership of English fourth-tier soccer club Salford City. The club was previously owned by Beckham, Neville and other former Manchester United teammates in its so-called Class of 92  Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville  along with Singapore businessman Peter Lim. A new ownership group, containing Beckham, Gary Neville and other shareholders from the United States, India and England, has bought Salford and have committed to invest significantly in the club, the team and its facilities, Salford said on Thursday. Butt, Giggs, Scholes and Phil Neville are no longer shareholders but will continue to contribute to the next step of this journey with roles in the club, Salford said. Beckham grew up in Salford and said he had such fond memories of my time living there and the place and its people played such an important part in my early life in football. Salford City is at the heart of its community ... it has a rich history and I am delighted to be a part of the next chapter. Beckham also is a co-owner of Major League Soccer club Inter Miami. Neville said the consortium contains a diverse range of minds and expertise, held together by a love of football. Football will come first, however its critical that we drive the club towards sustainability in the next four, five years, Neville said. I cant wait for the next part of this journey. 
        
     Salford finished in eighth place  outside the playoff spots  in League Two this season. Beckham said he has been inspired by Wrexhams rise through English soccer under the ownership of Hollywood celebrities Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney since 2021. Im not saying this is why were doing it because its not, Beckham told The Athletic in an interview. But Ive spoken to Ryan about it so many times now and he said the feeling around the city, the feeling around the club, is so exceptional. Thats the kind of thing that we want to create.

Ferrari frustration mounts as Hamilton and Leclerc struggle at Miami Grand Prix,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Lewis Hamilton arrived at the Miami Grand Prix admittedly frustrated with his slow start to the Formula 1 season driving for Ferrari.  There was little improvement to his performance, and Hamilton was ordered by Ferrari to give up seventh place in Sundays race to teammate Charles Leclerc. Hamilton settled for eighth, his worst finish since he was disqualified from the second race of the season.  Even so, the seven-time F1 champion was upbeat after the race.  I generally enjoyed the race, Hamilton said. I think this weekend, while we were not as quick as we want to be, I feel like I had a better weekend in general. The result might not show it, but I was 12th to seventh. Hamilton even briefly thought hed have a fantastic day when a change to medium tires made him feel the car really come alive and I felt super optimistic in that moment. Even so, Ferrari had nothing for McLaren Racing, which went 1-2 with Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. I think it wasnt a good weekend ... we cant be satisfied with P7 and P8, said Ferrari team principal Frdric Vasseur. You start P8 and P12, its almost impossible to fight your way back and challenge the cars ahead. The other thing is that McLaren was probably on another planet. We had enough pace to battle with Red Bull and Mercedes, but not with McLaren. Piastri has four victories this year  three in a row  and Norris has one as McLaren has won five of the first six races. Four-time defending F1 champion Max Verstappen has one win, while Ferrari has yet to even challenge with Hamilton and Leclerc.  
        
     Compounding problems for Ferrari in Miami was a crash on Saturday when Leclerc lost control of his car as he headed out to the track for the sprint race. He wasnt able to compete in the sprint and Ferrari had to hustle to even have him ready for qualifying.  Hamilton finished third in the sprint race but then failed to carry the momentum into qualifying. His only complaint after the race, though? Not the team orders to give Leclerc position, but in how slow Ferrari was to communicate the plan.  It seemed that Ferrari told Leclerc before the team told Hamilton, so when Leclerc first attempted the pass, it didnt work. Once Hamilton got the message, the British driver let Leclerc by on the next lap.  This is not good team work. Thats all Im going to say, Hamilton said on the Ferrari team radio.  After the race, Hamilton said he thought he was actually pretty fast when Ferrari called for the position swap.  I was clearly quick at that moment and I didnt think the decision came quick enough, Hamilton said. And then for sure, in that time, youre like Come on. I have no problems with the team or Charles. I think we can do better, but the car is where we really need to go to work.  Leclerc said he knows Ferraris drama in Miami will make for a compelling controversy in F1, but that the true problem is the car just isnt good enough.  We need to do better, thats for sure. Today was not ideal and was far from maximizing our potential, he said. Weve got to regroup as a team and be better. He admitted that like Hamilton, Leclerc is also frustrated by Ferraris performance so far this season. His best finish to date was third at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix last month.  Theres frustration already that you are, I was fighting for P8 and I was not making any gains, Leclerc said. I was really struggling with the car, so theres a frustration of that and then all the rest and it all adds up.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-ferrari-hamilton-leclerc-4021aec691671c3f5e3665aa00e5ce1c,sports
Reigning Cup champion Joey Logano gets 1st win this season in overtime at Texas,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)  Reigning NASCAR Cup champion Joey Logano overcame a lot to finally get his first victory this season.  It came a week after Team Penske teammate Austin Cindrics win at Talladega, where Logano had a fifth-place finish that became 39th after a postrace inspection found an issue with the spoiler on his No. 22 Ford. There was also Loganos expletive-laden rant on the radio toward his teammate in the middle of that race that the two smoothed out during the week. Oh, and he started 27th at Texas after a bad qualifying effort on the 1 1/2-mile track.  But Logano surged ahead on the restart in overtime Sunday to win in the 11th race this year. He led only seven of the 271 laps, four more than scheduled.  After what happened last week, to be able to rebound and come right back, its a total 22' way of doing things. So proud of the team, Logano said.  On the final restart after the 12th caution, Logano was on the inside of his other teammate, Ryan Blaney. But Logano pulled away on the backstretch and stayed easily in front the final 1 1/2 laps, while Ross Chastain then passed Blaney to finish second ahead of him. Just slowly, methodically, Logano said of his progression to the front. Just kept grinding, a couple here and a couple there and eventually get a win here. Logano got his 37th career victory, getting the lead for the first time on lap 264. He went low to complete a pass of Michael McDowell. 
        
     I mean theres always a story next week, right, Logano said. So I told my wife last week before we left, I said watch me go win this one. Its just how we do stuff. On a caution with 47 laps left, McDowell took only two tires and moved up 15 spots to second. He ended up leading 19 laps, but got loose a few laps after getting passed by Logano and crashed to bring out the caution that sent the race to overtime. He finished 26th.  We were giving it everything we had there to try to keep track position, McDowell said. Joey got a run there, and I tried to block it. I went as far as I think you could probably go. When Blaney slid in front of me, it just took the air off of it and I just lost the back of it. I still had the fight in me, but I probably should have conceded at that point. William Byron, Kyle Larson, Denny Hamlin and Chase Elliott remained the top four in season points. ... Elliott left Texas last spring with his first victory after 42 races and 18 months without one. He hasnt won since, and now has another long winless drought  this one 38 races and now nearly 13 months after finishing 16th. ... A crew member for Christopher Bell crawled in through the passenger side of the No. 20 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota and was fully in the car to reconnect an air hose the drivers helmet during a caution in the second stage. It took two stops during that caution, and twice climbing into the car, to resolve the issue.  Hamlin had finished on the lead lap in 21 consecutive races, but a fiery finish on lap 75 ended that streak that had matched the eighth-longest in NASCAR history. He was the first car out of the race.  After the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota lost power, something blew up when Hamlin recycled the engine. There were flames coming out from under the car and it was engulfed in smoke by time it rolled to a stop on the inside of the track and Hamlin climbed out unharmed.  Carson Hocevar, the 22-year-old driver who is McDowells teammate with Spire Motorsports, was the youngest polesitter ever in Texas. He led only the first 22 laps of the race, losing it while pitting during the first caution. He finished 24th after a late accident. Both in-race stages finished under caution. Cindric won Stage 1 after Hamlins issues and Kyle Larson took the second after a yellow flag came out because of debris on the track after the right rear tire on Chris Bueschers car came apart.  Larson got his 68th overall stage win and his sixth at Texas, with both marks being records. He has won a stage in each of the last five Cup races at Texas, starting in his 2021 win there.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-texas-logano-57237c018b7ff8ecb7dac17f6bbe5395,sports
Cadillac F1 makes its entrance as official team at Miami Grand Prix as questions swirl about lineup,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  The new Cadillac F1 team officially announced its arrival at a glitzy South Beach extravaganza packed with industry executives and influencers and highlighted by a musical showcase from Janelle Mone and actor Terry Crews Jr., who shared an anecdote about how hed never been born had his father not relocated at age 20 to Flint, Michigan, in search of a job with General Motors.  A splashy video ultimately unveiled the Cadillac F1 team logo at a multimillion-dollar party jammed elbow-to-elbow in the Queen Miami Beach venue.  What wasnt revealed? Cadillacs car, a bit of a disappointment for those who expected to see all the bells and whistles at the brand launch introduction to F1s newest team.  No worries, promised the leaders of the new team: Cadillac F1 is on pace to be on the grid in 2026.  Were building cars, weve been in the wind tunnel for a long time, said Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports, the team owner. Chassis has arrived, were continuing to add (personnel) to the team, there are so many work streams that are happening all at once. But I want to make sure everybody understands just how deep the partnership is with General Motors and with Cadillac. I think thats something that really will set apart this team, this entry, on the grid.  Cadillac will debut in 2026 with a two-car lineup that will push the F1 field to 22 cars  the first time since 2016 the grid will have more than 20 cars. It was a long road for Cadillac F1 to get to this point. The project started with Michael Andretti, who failed to buy Sauber in his effort to create a true American team that would feature at least one American driver. When he didnt close the Sauber deal, Andretti petitioned F1 and governing body FIA to expand the field for Andretti Global, which led to the equivalent of an IRS audit during a grueling application process. F1 denied the application. Towriss and Cadillac pressed on  they spent the last year saying work on the project continues on pace  and when Towriss bought out Andretti late last year, F1 changed course and the new team was suddenly fast-tracked. General Motors President Mark Reuss was finally able to attend an F1 race  the Miami Grand Prix over the weekend  in an official capacity. So geeked to finally be in the club, Reuss pulled out his phone to play an audio clip for reporters of the first Cadillac engine being fired.  Cadillac will initially race with Ferrari engines before GMs power unit is ready for 2029. Reuss said the Cadillac approach is deliberate to have a reliable, fast engine rather than rush one out for next season.  You have to go slow to go fast, Reuss said. Cadillac will have the largest U.S. presence of any F1 team and will operate out of facilities in Fishers, Indiana, as well as in Charlotte, North Carolina. The team also has a satellite facility at Silverstone, England. When Andretti first launched this project, he was adamant it was for an American driver, specifically California native and current IndyCar driver Colton Herta.  Now the list of potential drivers is rather long. Towriss and Reuss were adamant theyve yet to sign a driver amid reports that Sergio Perez has already signed. The need for there to be an American is not a pressing issue to TWG. Theres a lot of interest in this team and were very appreciative of that, Towriss said. We want that person set up for success, and want that seat respected when that American driver does come in for the team. ... Well find the right way and the right time to bring the right driver into Formula 1. IndyCar driver Pato OWard, who races under the Mexican flag but spent most of his childhood in Texas, wants a seat. Towriss said they had a funny run-in two weeks ago at the Indianapolis 500 open test when the elevator Towriss was in opened and there was OWard; they joked they would talk.  McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown said he wouldnt prevent OWard from pursuing a seat with Cadillac. OWard drives for McLaren in IndyCar and is the teams F1 reserve driver. I wouldnt like it, but I wouldnt stop him, Brown said. Valtteri Bottas, now an F1 reserve driver for Mercedes, told The Associated Press he is very interested while IndyCar driver Colton Herta has recently hedged on whether he wants the seat. There are a number of Americans who could be candidates, especially if the team is willing to wait until deeper into its existence to hire one. NASCAR driver Connor Zilisch, an 18-year-old quickly climbing through the stock car series ladder system, initially pursued European racing in his career. Sebastian Wheldon, who is deep into the Andretti Global driver development program, on Saturday won his debut Italian F4 race at Misano with Prema Racing. Another idea could put a long-debated topic to the test: NASCAR champion Kyle Larson, who often comes up as potentially the only driver in the world who could match F1 standout Max Verstappen in talent.  When AP asked Reuss about the possibility of Larson, Reuss said lets focus on Indianapolis first. Larson will run for McLaren and Chevrolet for a second consecutive year in the Indianapolis 500 later this month.  Reuss said GMs F1 efforts will not be affected by President Donald Trumps proposed tariffs despite a potential $5 billion (3.8bn) impact. Despite reversing a number of the planned tariffs on imports in recent weeks, a 25% tariff is still in place.  This is a long-term footprint that we have that are very old in some cases, that have been there a long time, Reuss said. So were working to bring as much as we can into the United States and avoid the tariffs. But not at all cost, and it doesnt happen overnight. Theres no light switch that says, Oh, all of a sudden were tariff-free. You probably would have seen over the last few days, we did earnings on the early part of the week, and then we came back and did the earnings review and guidance. In that second one, theres about $5 billion of impact for us. But its not going to affect this (F1) project. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-cadillac-miami-2026-895ff9f4e321ce964ddb65ed3447e870,sports
"NASCAR championship weekend goes to Homestead in 2026, starting a rotating formula","MIAMI (AP)  NASCAR asked its fans where they would prefer seeing championship weekend held, and the majority of those who responded picked Homestead-Miami Speedway. And NASCAR listened. The 2026 NASCAR season will end in South Florida, with stock car racings championship weekend returning to Homestead-Miami next year. Itll be the first time since 2019 that the title-winners will be crowned there and will start a rotation where NASCAR will move its final weekend around various tracks. How thatll work in 2027 and beyond remains unclear. But in 2026, Homestead is the spot. I like that we move it around, said reigning NASCAR champion Joey Logano, who won the crown last fall at Phoenix  this years title-deciding spot as well  and the first of his three titles at Homestead-Miami in 2018. That was one of the things that I always thought would be a great idea if we were able to pull it off, right? The Super Bowl doesnt stay in the same place every year. Why should our Super Bowl, our championship race, stay in same place every year? NASCAR made the announcement Tuesday, and it was not exactly a stunner. (Im sure everyone was surprised to see this coming, Logano said, smiling.) Its three series  the truck series, the Xfinity Series and the Cup Series  will see their seasons come to a close at Homestead from Nov. 6-8, 2026. It isnt a permanent return, though: NASCAR said that championship weekends are going to be on a rotation to ensure that the seasons exciting conclusion is shared amongst NASCARs marquee venues and key markets. Phoenix will be part of that rotation, somehow, but NASCAR isnt ready to say which other tracks may be involved and when all that will be announced. 
        
     We have a lot of confidence, when we go to Homestead-Miami Speedway, its going to deliver from a racing product perspective, NASCAR executive vice president Ben Kennedy said. Its also going to create a good amount of unpredictability for many of our fans that come to that race or tune in on TV just going to a different championship venue and having it on the line. Were excited to see all that. Part of NASCARs commitment to Homestead-Miami, Kennedy said, includes a capital investment to make sure it is a championship-caliber facility when we show up next year. NASCAR routinely makes tweaks to schedules and now will tinker again with where seasons end, but one non-negotiable appears to be the start of the season: Daytona will remain the first points race for the foreseeable future, Kennedy said. We ran a survey a couple years ago, and it was over 95% of our fan base wants to see their first points race be the Daytona 500, Kennedy said. That was a statistic that was strong enough for us to say were not even going to explore that for now. Homestead-Miami was the championship weekend site from 2002 through 2019. There are three active drivers who were crowned NASCAR champions at Homestead  Kyle Busch in 2015 and 2019, Brad Keselowski in 2012 and Logano in 2018. Logano has also won the title at Phoenix in two of the last three seasons, including last year. And all seven of Jimmie Johnsons NASCAR titles came at Homestead, which has renamed a tunnel in his honor to commemorate those championships. If youre asking drivers, its about the track, right? The environment obviously is really cool. Its different being in Miami. Thats a neat thing, Logano said. But the drivers, what we care about is the racing, right? Can we move around the racetrack, can we do different things, are the tires falling off, is that fun. To us, yeah, thats fun. NASCAR decided after the 2001 season to move its truck and Cup series races to one track, in order to create a season-ending championship celebration. Homestead-Miami was the original site after that decision, and then things moved to Phoenix starting in 2020. Kennedy said racing in early November isnt exactly possible at all of the tracks on the NASCAR schedule, meaning that the series would prefer a warm-weather climate for its finish  something that Phoenix and Homestead-Miami provide. And Homestead-Miamis history isnt lost on NASCAR, either. Homestead has put on some of the most phenomenal finishes, especially when we had the championship there, Kennedy said. But even since then, and weve crowned so many legends and Hall of Famers over the past 15 years when we did have the championship at Homestead-Miami Speedway. So, competition is a part of it, variability, and I think diversity in where youre crowning the champion was another consideration. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-homestead-2026-finale-9f2da920a3ba2947471c03d511dc63fb,sports
Rory McIlroy getting back to normal as defending champ of Truist at the Philadelphia Cricket Club,"FLOURTOWN, Pa. (AP)  Things are getting back to normal for Rory McIlroy, and its anything but routine for this weeks Truist Championship at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the sixth of eight signature events on the PGA Tour this season. McIlroy is playing in an individual tournament for the first time since winning the Masters and becoming the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam. He teamed with fellow Irishman Shane Lowry at last months Zurich Classic and the pair finished 12th. Now, hes returning to action after a short break. Im excited to get back to being a golfer, McIlroy said. Its nice to get back into the routine again and get back to what I know how to do. McIlroy is the defending champion and a four-time winner of this event. The 36-year-old said celebrating his Masters victory is behind him and hes looking forward to the next few months. First, his attention is on the Truist that begins Thursday. A winner of the event in 2010, 2015, 2021 and 2024, McIlroy doesnt have the luxury of trying to go back-to-back on the same course. The event was moved to Philly Cricket this year while the tournaments usual home, Quail Hollow in North Carolina, prepares to host next weeks PGA Championship. The last two times Ive won the Truist Championship, I havent been able to defend on the same golf course the next year, McIlroy said. We won in 21 and then played Potomac, and won last year and then were here. 
        
     So it doesnt quite feel like a defense. This weeks field in the no-cut event will be tested by Philly Crickets Wissahickon Course for the first time. The layout in the golf-rich Philadelphia suburbs plays just over 7,100 yards and a par 70. The oldest country club in the U.S., founded in 1854, the layout was designed by club member A.W. Tillinghast and opened in 1922. It underwent restoration just over a decade ago and has hosted a number of notable events, including last years USGA Amateur Four-Ball Championship and the 2016 Constellation Senior Players Championship. The signature event is missing world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who won for the first time in 2025 last week at his hometown Byron Nelson, where he matched the PGA Tours 72-hole scoring record. Third-ranked Xander Schauffele returns to competition for the first time since a tie for 18th place at the RBC Heritage in April and will defend his PGA Championship title next week. Justin Thomas is coming off a victory at the RBC Heritage and, at No. 5, has his highest ranking since holding the same spot in 2022. McIlroy and others have described the Wissahickon layout as old school and seemed excited to have the event staged at the venerable layout. The players will face large landing areas, not-so-penal rough and tricky greens. Expectations of how the course holds up against todays pros drew varied responses. Its very similar to a lot of these old school courses that have been renovated over the past few years. A lot of trees have been taken out. The green complexes are, for me, the interesting thing about the golf course, McIlroy said.  A little simple off the tee ... but making sure with the second shots that youre below the hole and trying to get to learn the greens a little bit more. Thomas is a fan of Philly Cricket and was hopeful that an early forecast of inclement weather on Thursday and Friday doesnt diminish the courses defenses against the top-flight field. I love these kinds of designs, he said. Theyre fun. ... Theyre very specific in terms of what the conditions give us. ... It is meant to play firm and fast, especially the greens. Schauffele expects a low score to win. For some reason, whenever courses seem to be really, really hard, guys seem to shoot low, he said. I think this course is kind of the middle of the road in terms of difficulty. I think theres some hard holes on there and some holes that are really gettable. The Truist Championship is a one-off stop for the PGA Tour in the Philadelphia area, yet is leaving a lasting mark. Truist earlier this week announced a $750,000 donation to the Cobbs Creek Foundation in support of the continued revitalization of the late Charlie Siffords home course and one of the nations first inclusive golf facilities. Cobbs Creek opened in 1916 and is one of eight golf courses in the National Black Golf Hall of Fame. The restoration includes a Tiger Woods foundation TGR Learning Lab and Jordan Spieths foundation contributed $250,000 that funded the construction of a practice putting green. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-truist-mcilroy-339cf7cf927cbbcb12846337593dd445,sports
"Go Birds and birdies: Retired Eagles great Jason Kelce takes his swings, advice at PGA Tour pro-am","FLOURTOWN, Pa. (AP)  Jason Kelce flubbed his pitch shot from the thick rough next to a green on the ninth hole  on a round that featured more Go Birds chants than birdies  and muttered a common refrain from most weekend golf warriors: Hey, thats why Im an amateur, Kelce said. Kelce could have crowd-sourced some golf tips from the scores of fans that followed him hole after humbling hole on Wednesday during a rare PGA Tour stop in the Philadelphia area. The retired Philadelphia Eagles center has tried in his first year of retirement to up his golf game and lower his score, taking the task of trying to get it in the hole as seriously as he did opening them as he once did on the offensive line. Kelce posted a video of his swing on Reddit this week and asked readers  anyone from pros to casual players  for advice on how to get better. Jason Kelce here. Now that Ive hung up the cleats, Im trying to get serious about my golf game, he wrote. Ive uploaded 6 different angles of my swing from a session yesterday. Looking for any tips you can give me  especially on my backswing and follow-through. Kelce said the early feedback was crazy. Some of this stuff is like stuff other pros have put out and its kind of generic stuff that everybody can use, Kelce said. But theres been some stuff so far thats been like, Holy cow, I never thought about it like that. So Im excited about that. 
        
     Kelce  who retired following the 2023 season after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles, played his role as man of the people to perfection during a pro-am ahead of the Truist Championship. He took time to answer questions from 14-year-old Benji Panzer, a middle school student who had credentials as part of an area sports broadcasting camp. Panzer asked Kelce about his New Heights podcast that he tapes with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The ability of players to connect with fans directly has never been greater, Kelce told Panzer. Kelce connected with plenty of Eagles fans, signing everything from aluminum beer bottles, T-shirts, golf balls and all types of Eagles memorabilia. He accepted gifts, too, including a Kelly green Eagles beer koozie. One fan who called himself T-Shirt Phil  did we mention the tourney was near Philly?  said he wanted to introduce Kelce to Phillies slugger Nick Castellanos. The 37-year-old Kelce  who with wife and social media star Kylie, welcomed their fourth child Finnley Finn Anne Kelce in March  refused to name his favorite golf course in the area but seemed to enjoy the fast greens his first time at Philly Crickets Wissahickon Course. The course is in great shape, he said. Its gorgeous. All the guys we played with agreed. The guys included PGA pros Stephan Jager and Shane Lowry. One unspecified member of the group sliced a ball into the crowd and struck the left hand of 25-year-old spectator Hudson Mokrejs, of Elverson, Pennsylvania, who needed an ice pack on his reddened wrist. We were talking beforehand like, Man, wouldnt it be great to get hit by Jason Kelces ball? And then he shot it over the green, Mokrejs said. I was talking and all of a sudden I hear, Look out! I turned and it just smacked me in the hand. I covered my hand. I didnt spill my drink. I had a Transfusion. Classic golf drink, you know what I mean? Chugged that real quick to get me healthy. Kelce noted the serene golf atmosphere made for more Go Birds chants more than the popular E-A-G-L-E-S chant that punctuates the Eagles fight song. Its just so quick, Kelce said. The E-A-G-L-E-S youve got start in halfway through. Someones got to get it going. He can expect to hear more of them on the course on big-time golf events in the area. The 2026 PGA Championship will be held at Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square and the 2030 U.S. Open is at Merion Golf Club. Philly is an unbelievable golf hub, Kelce said. Theres a lot of fans in the game. Theres a lot of incredible courses with a lot of history to it. Who knows? Thanks to social media, Kelce the amateur golfer just might get good enough to take some swings when it counts. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-truist-proam-kelce-f6398858e43813b1def88f54f675a101,sports
PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 25: Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth pursue different grand slams at Quail Hollow,"Before golf fans have had a chance to exhale after an exhilarating Masters, the next major is at the door selling an equal dose of anticipation. Chatter about a Grand Slam had gone largely quiet for the better part of 25 years since Tiger Woods knocked it out in a span of 35 days  winning the U.S. Open and British Open for the last two legs by a combined 23 strokes  in 2000.  Now its a big part of the conversation going into the PGA Championship. Rory McIlroy is playing the best golf of his career and still buzzing over his playoff victory at Augusta National. That Masters green jacket he proudly wears has given him newfound freedom now that he is the sixth player with the career Grand Slam. Is a calendar slam out of the question?  The next step is the PGA Championship, which starts Thursday at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, where McIlroy has won four times, including last year, the most titles for him on any golf course in the United States. Im obviously going to feel more comfortable and a lot less pressure, and Im also going back to a venue that I love, McIlroy said. Its nothing but positive vibes going in there next week with what happened (at the Masters) and ... how well Ive played at Quail. I probably wont be quite as on edge as I have been for the last few years when Ive been at major championships, he said. Ill probably be a little bit better to be around for my family, and Ill be a little more relaxed. I think overall it will be a good thing. 
        
     Thats the freedom he has to go along with his three victories this year at Pebble Beach, The Players Championship and his crown jewel, the Masters. And his peers have taken notice. That was really good for golf, Xander Schauffele said. It was good for Rorys psyche, maybe worse for us now that he feels free. High praise also comes from Jordan Spieth, who could be next in line. This will be his ninth PGA Championship with a chance to get the final leg of the career slam. It took McIlroy 11 tries. It was obviously a very challenging week for him. It was harder than anybody maybe ever to win a Masters, Spieth said. To be that far from his most recent major as well, and then to go and do it, I mean, it was very inspiring. Spieth hasnt attracted nearly as much attention, mainly because he hasnt won any tournament in three years while coping with a wrist injury that finally led to surgery last August. But then he shot 62 in the final round in Dallas, a subtle reminder he hasnt disappeared and is still more than capable. Gary Player completed the Grand Slam in the 1965 U.S. Open. Jack Nicklaus followed a year later in the British Open. But then it was 34 years until Woods joined them, and 25 years before McIlroy finally got it done. Could you just imagine if we get to the weekend and we have a possibility to have two players do this in the same year after having waited so long? said Trevor Immelman, a former Masters champion and lead analyst for CBS. My goodness, every eyeball in the world that loves sport and loves golf will be enthralled by that. Such is the backdrop going into the PGA Championship, the major that rarely lacks for drama but often gets overlooked compared with the other three.  Not this year. Not with so many players at the top of their games. Scottie Scheffler showed off his No. 1 form by matching the PGA Tour record for 72 holes at 253 with an eight-shot victory in the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, his first win of a season that started slowly because of a freak injury. And then theres Bryson DeChambeau. He played in the final group at four straight tournaments before he broke through with a LIV Golf win in South Korea. In three of the last four majors, DeChambeau finished one behind in the PGA Championship, won the U.S. Open and was in the last group with McIlroy at the Masters. In between, Justin Thomas  he won the PGA Championship the last time it was at Quail Hollow in 2017  got back on track by winning a playoff at the RBC Heritage. At stake for Thomas is a chance to join Woods as the only players to win the PGA Championship twice on the same course. Woods won at Medinah in 1999 and 2006. Quail Hollow is a rare major championship course that breeds familiarity, at least for PGA Tour players. It has been on the PGA Tour schedule since 2003 except for years it has hosted the PGA Championship or the Presidents Cup. Its a big course at 7,626 yards playing to a par 71, though the par 5s are reachable and theres a par 4 on each nine where players can try to drive the green. The closing stretch starts on the reachable par-4 14th with water down the left side, followed by a par 5 and then the Green Mile  two long par 4s with water hazards and a peninsula-green in between at the par-3 17th. You really have to be in play to be successful on that property, said Schauffele, the defending PGA champion. Its a hard place to scramble ... if youre not hitting many fairways and in the rough and trying to work your way up to holes. I dont know if youd call it a second-shot golf course or predominately a tee-shot golf course. But it does feel like you have to do everything really well around that property. While McIlroy has won four times at Quail Hollow, Schauffele has been runner-up the last two years. He won two majors last year but, much like Scheffler, had a slow start to the season because of a rib injury that kept Schauffele out for two months.  Still, there has been no shortage of star power in the weeks leading to the PGA Championship. The Masters is always a tough act to follow, particularly this year with that storybook finish by McIlroy. The PGA Championship at least has the ingredients in place. Ill leave it up to the golf gods to deliver the script, CBS lead announcer Jim Nantz said. Theyve been quite prolific so far at their creative writing best. And I cant wait to see what theyre going to hand deliver to the world. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-championship-quail-hollow-mcilroy-spieth-scheffler-60f429ca61cc52b99ffc16c8499b80a3,sports

Back to school: WNBA teams open preseason in college arenas as star alums return to campus,"Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Sabrina Ionescu are among the players who will get a chance to play one more game in their college arenas as WNBA teams return to campuses for preseason contests. Its a trend, started by the Las Vegas Aces last season when they played at South Carolina in a return for Aja Wilson to her alma mater. It gives WNBA teams a chance to capitalize on the popularity of players and they hope it also brings new fans to the league. Reese will headline the Chicago Skys trip to LSU on Friday to face the Brazilian national team and then on Sunday Clark will lead the Indiana Fever to Iowa for an exhibition game against the same Brazilian squad. Im really excited, Clark said. It should be fun. I cant believe its already here. I honestly havent been back to Iowa City a ton since I left a year ago now -- only been back once for a football game and once for the jersey retirement. But it will be fun to get back there, see some of my former teammates, my friends that are there. Both the Fever and Sky games will be on national television. The WNBA will be showing all 15 of its preseason games either on national television or league pass. Clark did have one concern about the trip to Iowa; the basketball arena doesnt have air conditioning. A lot of my family will be coming, so I know theyre excited. I warned everybody, Im like theres not air conditioning in Carver-Hawkeye (Arena), usually dont play basketball games there in May, so hopefully it stays a little cool in there, she said, laughing. 
        
     A trio of former Notre Dame standouts will take the court in South Bend, Indiana, on Friday when the Dallas Wings open the preseason against Wilson and the Aces. WNBA All-Stars Jewell Loyd and Jackie Young both starred for the Irish while Wings standout Arike Ogunbowale also excelled there. Ogunbowale, who was the second-leading scorer in the WNBA last year, hit two of the most historic shots in NCAA Tournament history to lift Notre Dame to the national championship in 2018. The opener will also mark the debut of No. 1 pick Paige Bueckers for the Wings.  Ionescu and the New York Liberty will close out the preseason schedule on May 12 when the team goes to Oregon to play at her alma mater against the Japanese team  the Toyota Antelopes. The NCAAs career triple-double leader never got a chance to say goodbye to the school or the fans because the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the NCAA Tournament her senior season in 2020. I dont really know how Im going to feel, especially suiting up and stepping on that court again. I might get emotional, just knowing that I finally get to say goodbye to that chapter of my life and get a little bit of the closure that I never got. Some storylines to watch as the preseason tips off: Washington rookie Georgia Amoore suffered an injury to her right ACL in practice on Tuesday and is sidelined indefinitely. The No. 6 pick in the draft averaged 19.6 points for Kentucky last season and was expected to help the franchise rebuild this year along with fellow rookies Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen, who were selected third and fourth last month. The Mystics also announced that second-year forward Aaliyah Edwards is out with a lower back contusion and will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Eight of the 13 WNBA teams will have new head coaches this season. Atlanta and Los Angeles turned to college coaches Karl Smesko and Lynne Roberts, respectively. Indiana brought back former coach and player Stephanie White to lead the Fever. White had been in charge of the Connecticut Sun, who replaced her with former Belgium national team coach Rachid Meziane. Chicago, Dallas and Washington turned to former WNBA assistant coaches Tyler Marsh, Chris Koclanes and Sydney Johnson, respectively. Golden State also brought in a former assistant coach, Natalie Nakase, to be the first head coach in the expansion franchises history. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-clark-reese-bueckers-91431df20e98615db4d6e8f9e9c1905f,sports
Paige Bueckers has bumpy WNBA preseason debut as Wings lose to Aces in South Bend,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP)  Dallas Wings guard Paige Bueckers drove into the teeth of the Las Vegas Aces defense during the first quarter of her WNBA preseason debut. Launching from the left side, Bueckers connected on a left-handed floater from 5 feet, and then fell hard to the baseline. It was a welcome-to-the-league moment that might leave a bruise. Bueckers, the No. 1 overall selection in the WNBA draft after leading UConn to a national title a month ago, scored 10 points in 23 minutes on Notre Dames home floor as the rebuilding Wings lost 112-78 to the perennially title-contending Aces. Jackie Young scored 28 points for Las Vegas. She was one of three former Notre Dame players in the game, joined by teammate Jewell Loyd and Dallas Arike Ogunbowale. Bueckers is hoping to turn around a franchise that went 9-31 in 2024. The playmaking guard averaged 24.8 points in the womens NCAA Tournament for UConn, finally delivering the title that shed been chasing since her sensational freshman season. Now shes trying to reset after grinding her way through a 40-game college season that ended a month ago. Its super surreal in terms of the turnaround from where I was two weeks ago to where I am today, Bueckers said. Im just soaking it up and enjoying every moment, getting used to new routines, traditions, new teammates, new organization. Im just excited to be playing basketball again with this new group and continue to grow and get better every day. 
        
     Bueckers said the pace of the game and the level of talent in the WNBA are much different from anything shes experienced. She noted the Aces had five former Olympians in their lineup. The physicality of the league appeared to get to Bueckers at times. She questioned a no-call when she was trying to ignite a fast break and ran into Young, who made a steal and turned it into a pair of free throws for the Aces. She looked unhappy with the three fouls called on her. Fighting her way through screens was an issue. A year ago, Caitlin Clark came into the league with unusual star power and immediately boosted attendance and ratings while clashing at times with the WNBAs more established players.  The Wings hope to help Bueckers have a smooth transition into the pro game. We have that example (of Clarks first season) to learn from already, and I think were prepared, Wings coach Chris Koclanes said. Paige is unique and special, and shes prepared to be able to handle everything that comes her way, on and off the floor, and well do everything we can to support her. You try to prepare and teach and put her in positions to be able to find success, and then youve got to let her go, and you got to let her live and let her experience it, Koclanes said. So its a balance just feeling out what that ultimately ends up looking like. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/paige-bueckers-wnba-dallas-wings-south-bend-e507a05c1140dc9dcf33c32484ae96e6,sports
Angel Reese has a rousing return to Baton Rouge in an exhibition for the Sky vs. Brazil,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP)  Former LSU star Angel Reeses homecoming in the Chicago Skys WNBA exhibition opener was a smashing success. Reese had 15 points and 10 rebounds, helping the Sky to a rousing 89-62 victory over the Brazilian national team on Friday night at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Reese was smiling the moment she entered the arena where her college career took off after transferring from Maryland. She earned All-America honors twice and led LSU to the national title in 2023. Im just happy to be back to see all the fans, even down to the security guards, because I know how much was put into this program, said Reese, whos entering her second season with the Sky after earning WNBA All-Rookie honors last year, when she set a league single season rebounding record. A crowd of 6,373, many of whom wore Sky T-shirts and Reese No. 5 jerseys, cheered her and rookie teammate Hailey Van Liths every move. Van Lith was an LSU teammate of Reese in 2023-24 before playing her final collegiate season at TCU. Van Lith entered the game to a loud ovation with 5:43 left in the third quarter and finished with seven points, five assists and three rebounds. Reese and Van Lith were honored before the game with video highlights of their time at LSU. Tigers coach Kim Mulkey gave the duo bouquets and hugs. Kia Nurse added 11 points for the Sky. Chicagos Kamilla Cardoso, playing against her Brazilian countrywomen, had six points and eight rebounds. Manu Alves led Brazil with nine points. 
        
     Fridays game was the first for new Sky coach Tyler Marsh. The Sky also debuted a revamped starting lineup, with veteran free agent signees Nurse and Courtney Vandersloot and trade acquisition Ariel Atkins joining Reese and Cardoso. The result was a smooth offense guided by Vandersloot, a four-time all-league guard in her first 12 WNBA seasons with the Sky. She spent the last two years with the New York Liberty. Brazils next stop in its U.S. tour will be an exhibition against Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever on Sunday at the University of Iowas arena in Iowa City, where Clark starred in college. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-sky-angel-reese-baton-rouge-brazil-d8c427cfb17d1ece6b13c63a7890c955,sports
Caitlin Clark returns to Iowa in Fevers preseason game against Brazil despite leg injury,"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP)  Caitlin Clark made the shot everyone came to see. Clark stopped late in the third quarter of Sundays WNBA preseason game between the Indiana Fever and the Brazilian national team and launched a 3-pointer near the 22 logo on Iowas Carver-Hawkeye Arena court. It was the spot where she hit the shot in her senior season in 2024 that made her the all-time leading scorer in NCAA womens basketball, and of course it went in. This shot, with 25 seconds left in the third quarter, capped Clarks return to the arena where she broke records on her way to becoming the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader. I was like, Ah, why not? Clark said, smiling. Had to give the fans a little something. Clark, starting her second season with the Fever, scored 16 points in Indianas 108-44 win. Clarks day was bookended by shots that were reminiscent of her career with Iowas womens basketball team  her first 3-pointer came from the tip of the beak on Iowas Tigerhawk logo at midcourt 34 seconds into the game. And after both shots went in, the crowd response sounded just like all the shots she made in front of sellout crowds as she led the Hawkeyes to back-to-back appearances in the NCAA national championship game in her final two seasons. Its amazing to see how many people love her, Fever forward Makayla Timpson said. Clark, dealing with a leg injury that kept her out of Saturdays preseason opener against the Washington Mystics, played almost 19 minutes, and that was enough to please the capacity crowd of 14,998. She finished the game making 6 of 10 shots, and added six rebounds and five assists. 
        
     Something about this gym makes me play well, Clark said. It was Clarks second time back at the arena since she left the Hawkeyes  she had her jersey No. 22 retired in a ceremony after Iowas 76-69 win over USC on Feb. 2. Ive told my teammates theyre going to be here cheering for me, yes, but theyre also going to be here cheering for you and our entire team, Clark said before the game. And I think thats whats so great about these fans, is they really rally around the entire team. Its not just myself, and thats what I love about it. Clark was greeted with a loud ovation when she took the court before the game, and the noise continued throughout the day. The crowd noise for Clarks pregame introduction reached 116 decibels, and the first 3-pointer recorded 117-decibel applause. That kind of a response wasnt a surprise to Fever coach Stephanie White. Ive seen the Caitlin Clark stuff from the outside looking in and being on the television side and certainly being an opponent, said White, who called some of Clarks games while working at ESPN and went against her last season as the coach of the Connecticut Sun. For us to be able to bring Caitlin back here and to bring our team here to experience this fan base, its an incredible opportunity. Iowa coach Jan Jensen had the same reaction. Were just proud that we can fill this place up in May, she said. Are you kidding me? The event became a hot ticket as soon as it was announced earlier this year. The average paid price of $440 per ticket on the secondary market this week made it the most in-demand event involving Clark, according to ticketing technology company Victory Live, which analyzes sales across the secondary market. Asking prices on the secondary market Wednesday ranged from $146 to $2,368. Clark made it clear before the game she was going to play despite the injury, although it was apparent the injury was still an issue  when she came out of the game in the first half she went to the tunnel behind the Fever bench to ride a stationary bike. It sucked being on the sideline yesterday, but obviously, its probably just the best decision in the preseason, Clark said. Kelsey Mitchell led the Fever with 17 points. Aliyah Boston added 11. Clark left the game after making that last shot, and as she got to the bench waved to the crowd, encouraging one last cheer. Thats my goal, Clark said before the game. Get them involved, get them loud. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/caitlin-clark-iowa-fever-brazil-eae70207f0b03412b93d905bafa2e311,sports
LA Rams announce plans to hold their June minicamp in Maui,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  The Los Angeles Rams are moving their minicamp to Maui. The Rams announced their plan Wednesday to hold their mandatory minicamp on Hawaiis second-largest island on June 16-19. The camp will feature two days of on-field workouts at War Memorial Stadium in Wailuku, with one day open to the public. The Rams will also host a football clinic for local youth teams, and Rams players and staff will join Habitat for Humanity to rebuild four homes in Lahaina, which was largely destroyed by wildfires in 2023. The Rams have a lengthy history of partnerships with the state of Hawaii and its individual islands. They played a preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys in Honolulu in August 2019 before the largest crowd in Aloha Stadiums history, and the team did extensive fundraising for Maui wildfire relief two years ago. The Rams international ambitions stretch all around the Pacific Rim. They will play the first regular-season game in Australia in 2026 at the historic Melbourne Cricket Ground, and the team also was the first to get NFL marketing rights to Japan last year. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-rams-maui-minicamp-9c664f06c5b9f5edb61d2548d894d51d,sports
"Jaguars release WR Gabe Davis, moving on 14 months after signing him to a $39M contract","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP)  The Jacksonville Jaguars released veteran receiver Gabe Davis on Wednesday, moving on nearly 14 months after signing him to a three-year, $39 million contract in free agency. The Jaguars designated it as a post-June 1 cut, meaning it will cost them $5.7 million against the salary cap in 2025 instead of $20.3 million. Nonetheless, Jacksonvilles new decision makers clearly thought it would be better to to take on dead money than have Davis on the roster as a fourth or fifth receiver. Davis, 26, is still recovering from a torn meniscus in his left knee sustained in mid-November and likely would have started the season on the physically unable to perform list. But he really became expendable once the Jaguars traded up to select two-way star Travis Hunter with the second pick in the NFL draft. They also signed speedy receiver Dyami Brown to a one-year, $10 million deal in free agency. Throw in Brian Thomas Jr., who made the Pro Bowl as a rookie, and the Jaguars didnt see how Davis would fit  especially since he didnt contribute much on special teams in five NFL seasons. Davis played in 10 games last year, with nine starts, and finished with 20 receptions for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He caught 163 passes for 2,730 yards and 27 touchdowns in four years with Buffalo. He had six more TD receptions in the playoffs. The 6-foot-2 Davis grew up in nearby Orlando and was supposed to be a bigger target for quarterback Trevor Lawrence. But his role never materialized despite a deal that included $24 million guaranteed, and first-time general manager James Gladstone and first-time head coach Liam Coen are moving forward with Hunter and Thomas as Lawrences 1-2 punch for the foreseeable future. 
        
     Cutting Davis is the latest and most costly offensive adjustment made by Jacksonvilles new regime. The team replaced two offensive linemen  retiring center Mitch Morse and guard Brandon Scherff  traded veteran receiver Christian Kirk to Houston and cut veteran tight end Evan Engram. The Jags also drafted two linemen, two running backs and made a splashy move to get Hunter to replace some of the losses. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/jaguars-gabe-davis-released-8e06f95acacc9a5db60c4c83b2409b25,sports
Seahawks re-sign veteran defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins,"SEATTLE (AP)  Defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins re-signed with the Seattle Seahawks on Wednesday. Hankins, 33, signed a one-year deal with the Seahawks as a free agent last year and is entering his 13th season in the NFL. Last season, Hankins appeared in all 17 games for the Seahawks and had 30 tackles, five tackles for loss and one sack. I like it here. Everything made sense, Hankins said in a statement. To be able to still be playing in Year 13, and obviously the organization wanted me back, so it just made sense. Hankins has played for four other NFL franchises in his career: the Raiders, Giants, Cowboys and Colts. He has had 433 tackles as well as 18 1/2 sacks. Hankins will remain with a Seahawks defensive line that already has a good amount of depth. Prior to Hankins signing, the Seahawks already had Leonard Williams, Jarran Reed and Byron Murphy II under contract for the 2025 season. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/seahawks-johnathan-hankins-4dc66f35be38c7039ae202768fe97c4e,sports

"Lions squad for Australia: Itoje captain, Pollock in but no Doris or Farrell","Maro Itoje will captain a British and Irish Lions squad for the tour of Australia that contains 15 Irish players, just two Welshmen and an Englishman with barely 30 minutes of international rugby to his name. A 38-man touring party was announced on Thursday in front of an audience of more than 2,000 rugby fans at The O2 arena in London, with the 30-year-old Itoje becoming the first English player to captain the Lions  one of the biggest honors in the sport  since Martin Johnson in 2001. Itoje will be heading on his third tour, after 2017 and 2021, and completes his rise as a leader, having become the captain of England and Saracens only this season. When his name was read out by Lions coach Andy Farrell, Itoje walked out in full Lions uniform  holding the lion mascot, Bill  to warm applause. Its a tremendous honor and a tremendous privilege, said Itoje, who has 93 caps for England. Its a bit of a surreal experience, to be honest. Farrell phoned Itoje on Tuesday to give him the good news but they could barely hear each other because of a poor signal, so Farrell hung up. He soon phoned back and quickly offered him the captaincy. Itojes path to the Lions captaincy might have been cleared by Caelan Doris, the Ireland captain, who injured his shoulder playing for Leinster against Northampton Saints in the Champions Cup semifinals last weekend. Doris, a star No. 8, would have been a certainty to make the squad but had to be left out. 
        
     As you can imagine, he is devastated, Farrell said. Commiserations to those who thought they would be selected today. But things happen on tour or before you get on the plane as well. So everyone who has ambition, keep fighting, stay fit and we will be watching. Injuries are expected before the tourists leave for Australia in late June. In 2021, Ireland prop Andrew Porter withdrew because of a toe injury. Hes been picked again. Tour captain Alun Wyn Jones and Dan Lydiate were injured in the warm-up win over Japan. Jones recovered from a dislocated shoulder to play in the tests in South Africa. That Leinster-Northampton game was significant in another way, too. Henry Pollock, a 20-year-old flanker who was largely unknown before this season, produced a man-of-the-match display for Northampton in its improbable win to cement his place in the Lions squad and continue his dramatic rise in rugby. His only appearance for England was as a second-half, try-scoring replacement against Wales in the final round of the recent Six Nations. He started the championship with the England Under-20s and had played only one game in Englands top league before this season. Pollock  the surprise name selected by Farrell in a squad containing the best players from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales  was watching the squad announcement on TV with his Northampton teammates and was mobbed when his name was read out. If youre good enough, youre old enough, Farrell said. An Englishman not picked was Owen Farrell, the son of the coach and someone hoping to go on a fourth straight Lions tour. Fellow Englishmen Fin Smith and Marcus Smith and Scotlands Finn Russell were the preferred options at flyhalf. Farrell hasnt played international rugby since the 2023 World Cup, after which he stepped down from national duty to protect his mental health. He has since quit English rugby and moved to France to play for Racing 92 in Paris, but he suffered a head injury last weekend in an injury-plagued season. He was in the conversation, Andy Farrell said of his son. We feel Owen is still trying to find his way back to fitness. Beside Farrell, other flyhalves contenders to miss out included Ireland starter Sam Prendergast and England veteran George Ford. Only Ireland has more players than Englands 13. Scotland will have eight representatives and one was born in Melbourne  center Sione Tuipulotu. Just two players are from Wales  scrumhalf Tomos Williams and flanker Jac Morgan  with their nation on a losing run of 17 tests stretching back to 2023. Its Wales smallest representation since World War II. I didnt feel any pressure at all to pick Welsh players, Farrell said. Williams said he shed a tear when he heard his name, adding: Its the top of the mountain  you cant get higher than this achievement. Its an inexperienced squad, with 26 players set to be first-time tourists and nine going on a second tour. Scotland centers Tuipulotu and Huw Jones  nicknamed Huwipulotu  were chosen on long-ago form. Tuipulotu was considered a nailed-on Lions starter until he tore a pectoral muscle in late January, dealing a damaging blow to Scotlands Six Nations hopes. Hes close to returning to action. Jones hasnt played since the Six Nations because of an ankle injury. Scotland record try-scorer Duhan van der Merwe was also picked even though he hasnt played since late March after ankle surgery. Rugged lock Scott Cummings was another to miss the Six Nations and has just returned from a three-month layoff. Their national teammate Blair Kinghorn is also in, but if his Toulouse club reaches the French Top 14 final again on June 28, he wont join the Lions until after their opening match in Australia. The Lions won the test series against the Wallabies the last time they toured Australia, in 2013. They have since drawn the series against New Zealand in 2017 and lost in South Africa in 2021. For the latest tour, the Lions will play three tests against the Wallabies, along with six more games in Australia  against Western Force, Queensland Reds, NSW Waratahs, ACT Brumbies, an Invitational Australia and New Zealand XV, and a First Nations and Pasifika XV. The tour begins with a match against Argentina in Dublin on June 20 and ends with the series-closing third test on Aug. 2.

Rog aiming to do a Pog by winning the Giro-Tour double. First up is conquering Italy again.,"MILAN (AP)  Anything Pog can do so can Rog. Primoz Roglic will try to step out of the shadow of the all-conquering Tadej Pogacar by emulating his Slovenian compatriot when the Giro dItalia starts on Friday in Albania. Last season, Pogacar, who rides for UAE Team Emirates, became the first cyclist in 26 years to win the Giro and Tour de France in the same year. Now Roglic and his Red Bull Bora Hansgrohe team have their eyes on the double. You can get some inspiration by looking at how UAE approached it, and seeing the ideas, team head of performance Dan Lorang says. You have to focus on yourself, but it would be stupid to close the eyes and not look left and right. You get inspiration when you see whats possible, and thats motivating. Pogacar proved the Giro and the Tour is possible. In the absence of cyclings dominant duo, Pogacar and two-time Tour winner Jonas Vingegaard, Roglic is the favorite going into the Giro  although it is unlikely to be the demolition job it proved last year, when the question almost from the start was not if Pogacar would win but by how much. In the end, Pogacar won by the races biggest margin of victory in nearly six decades. The previous year, Roglic won the Giro by one of the smallest margins. Five-time Grand Tour winner Roglic will head into the gruelling three-week race backed by a strong team that includes 2022 winner Jai Hindley and last years runner-up Dani Martnez. 
        
     The goal is to win, of course, Lorang said. Having Primoz on board now changes things for us. He knows how to win three-week stage races and the Giro. We planned for a victory at the Giro from winter until now. Pogacar wont be one of Roglics main rivals at the Giro but one of his teammates will be. With a reputation as the rising star of Spanish cycling, Juan Ayuso will regard anything less than a podium finish a disappointment. Ayuso told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport that he wouldnt see it as failure if he failed to win on his Giro debut. He wasnt finished. But at the same time, Im not saying that I would be happy with a podium, either. It would be a disappointment not to finish in the top three, because I would consider that a step backwards. It will be a fight between experience and youth. The 22-year-old Ayuso is already a winner in Italy this season after success at the week-long Tirreno-Adriatico but he was pipped on home turf by the 35-year-old Roglic at the Volta a Catalunya. This Giro wont just be a two-man race, however. There are other potential winners, up-and-comers and those with tested general classification potential. The peloton includes five former Giro winners  beside Roglic and Hindley were Nairo Quintana (2014), Richard Carapaz (2019) and Egan Bernal (2021). All have their names etched on the Trofeo Senza Fine (Trophy With No End). Theres a saying that you cant win the Giro in the first week but you can certainly lose it. There is no major set-piece mountain battle in the first half of the race unlike in other editions, and  as usual  a brutal final week. But riders will still face plenty of difficulties right from the start. Three tricky stages in Albania are followed by the Giro moving to the heel of Italy and the route snaking north. Stage seven sees the first summit finish and two days later there is a mini Strade Bianche on the white, gravel roads of Tuscany. The winner of the maglia rosa will be decided in the Alps, which hosts four of the five hardest mountain stages in the final week and more than 9,000 meters of climbing in the two days before the climax in Rome. The 3,443-kilometer (2,140-mile) route ends on June 1 and includes a homage to the late Pope Francis by passing through an area of the Vatican rarely seen by the general public. ___ AP cycling: https://apnews.com/hub/cycling",https://apnews.com/article/roglic-ayuso-giro-ditalia-cycling-b6896f308cd27f42fc9b05eb68e1b2aa,sports
Dubai police make several arrests over disturbances after a local soccer match,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Dubai police arrested several people involved in fights after a weekend soccer match between UAE Pro League clubs Shabab Al Ahli and Al Wasl in a rare disturbance in the tightly policed sheikhdom. Officers used surveillance footage to identify suspects, Maj. Gen. Abdullah Al Ghaith said in a statement Wednesday. Police didnt say how many people were arrested. Al Wasl won the match on Saturday 2-1. Angry Shabab Al Ahli fans threw water bottles at Al Wasl fans and on the soccer field, while Al Wasl fans lit smoke flares and hurled water bottles. Local media reported that fans threw stones, clashed outside the stadium and confronted Shabab Al Ahli defender Bogdan Planic as he made his way to the team bus before security guards intervened. The UAE Football Association on Tuesday demanded both soccer clubs pay fines over the fights and swearing. Shabab Al Ahli was fined $19,000, while Al Wasl was fined more than $21,000.  Political parties and labor unions are banned in the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms including Dubai. Broad laws severely restrict freedom of speech and protests. A middle finger raised in a traffic dispute, a text message calling someone a name or swearing in public easily can spark criminal cases  something that foreign tourists may not realize until its too late.",https://apnews.com/article/emirates-dubai-soccer-arrests-06e31f873cb16b81e7e51b876f5f1004,sports
Sinner not naming names for messages he did and didnt receive during doping ban,"ROME (AP)  Jannik Sinner was just as surprised by which fellow players sent him messages of support at the start of his three-month doping ban as those who sent nothing. The top-ranked player is returning to tennis at the Italian Open this week after his settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency raised questions, since it conveniently allowed Sinner not to miss any Grand Slams and come back at his home tournament.  At the start of the suspension I received some surprising messages from some players, whereas there were others who I would have expected to hear from that didnt send anything, Sinner said. But Im not going to name names. The settlement was made after WADA appealed a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency to fully exonerate Sinner for what it deemed to be an accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid in March 2024. Many fellow pros feel Sinner was treated too lightly and Sinner recently discussed how he didnt really feel comfortable in the locker room and the players lounge during his run to a second straight Australian Open title in January, noting that players were looking at me differently. Coach Simone Vagnozzi said that he and Darren Cahill, Sinners other coach, also sensed the glares. When something like that happens I think its almost inevitable to have everyone looking at you. But there have also been some nice things said, Vagnozzi said, highlighting comments he appreciated from Holger Runes mom, Casper Ruud and Alexander Zverev. In the final month of his ban, Sinner practiced with Jack Draper, Lorenzo Sonego and Rune at his training base in Monaco. 
        
     At the start of his suspension, Sinner was banned from entering any sanctioned sports event. I wanted to support my friends in cycling or motorsport, Sinner said. I couldnt go there. That for me was the toughest part. In March, professional cyclist Giulio Ciccone posted a photo on Instagram of himself posing during a bike outing with Sinner and Ferrari endurance drivers Alberto Giovinazzi and Alessandro Pier Guidi. Cahill has announced he will retire at the end of the year and Vagnozzi was asked if he would consider then coaching Sinner on his own. I would be able to do it on my own, Vagnozzi said. But with players of this level its important to have another viewpoint. And its important to sometimes split up the weeks you spend with the player. Otherwise its a 365-day/year job and thats a bit much. But Im hoping that Darren stays on for another five years, because we have such a great relationship. He might be the best coach ever in terms of results and other factors. Vagnozzi referred to how Sinner is the fourth player the Australian has coached to No. 1 after Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep. But most of all, hes a special person. Sinner will play his opening match on Saturday against No. 99 Mariano Navone, who beat 18-year-old Italian wild card Federico Cin 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday. Sinner enters on a 21-match winning streak but hasnt played an official match since January. Also, the red clay at the Foro Italico is not Sinners best surface. Only one of his 19 career titles has come on the dirt, in Umag, Croatia, in 2022. Its definitely the surface where he is the least sure of himself, Vagnozzi said. But last year he had a good clay season, reached the semifinals in Monte Carlo and the French Open and the quarterfinals in Madrid.  So I think he can do well here, too. The last Italian man to win the Rome title was Adriano Panatta in 1976. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/jannik-sinner-doping-italian-open-1a3dd689c8675d61515c195e353d4f99,sports
Olympic rugby medalist Josaia Raisuqe of Fiji has died at 30,"CASTRES, France (AP)  Josaia Raisuqe, a Paris Olympics medalist, was killed in a road crash on Thursday, his Castres rugby club said. He was 30. Raisuqe was reportedly on his way to training when his vehicle was hit by a train. Castres Olympique is in mourning, the club said in a statement on its website. It is with heavy hearts that we learned of the death this morning of our player Josaia Raisuqe in a road accident. The entire CO family is devastated by this terrible news. Josh had been a member of the club since 2021. He was a wonderful teammate, much loved by everyone, including the Castres supporters who had embraced him. We extend our sincere condolences and thoughts to his family and loved ones. Raisuqe appeared on the wing for the Top 14 club less than two weeks ago. He was in the Fiji team which won the Olympic silver medal in rugby sevens in Paris last year. He scored a try against the United States in pool play and started in the final against France. Hes been playing club rugby in France since 2015, when he joined Top 14 champion Stade Francais. He also played for second-division side Nevers, and got into an infamous incident in 2021 when, overjoyed by a win, he hoisted the referee over his head after the fulltime whistle. The ref gave him a red card. The following season, Castres deployed Raisuqe as a flanker en route to the 2022 Top 14 final. 
        
     He was a radiant boy on and off the field, a pillar of the Fijian community we have at the club and to which we are very attached, Castres chairman Pierre-Yves Revol said. It is also difficult at this time not to mention the faith of all these (Fijian) players and of Josaia. My thoughts are with his fiance and his entire family. ___ AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby",https://apnews.com/article/josaia-raisuqe-fiji-rugby-death-6054e70242a4707e10e9b465dcc506f6,sports
Swiatek gets back on track in Rome after being routed by Gauff in Madrid,"ROME (AP)  Iga Swiatek bounced back from one of the worst losses of her career with a comfortable 6-1, 6-0 rout of home player Elisabetta Cocciaretto in the second round of the Italian Open on Thursday. Swiatek said she was dealing with personal stuff when she was beaten 6-1, 6-1 by Coco Gauff in the Madrid Open semifinals last week. The second-ranked Swiatek is a three-time Rome champion but has not reached a final on tour this year. She improved to 21-2 in Rome since 2021.

"Olympic medalists Snyder, Dake and Brooks sign with Real American Freestyle wrestling","Olympic medalists Kyle Snyder, Kyle Dake and Aaron Brooks headline the newest additions to the Real American Freestyle wrestling league. The announcement of the signings Thursday comes off the heels of the Tampa, Florida-based companys launch last week. The league, with pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan as the commissioner, will hold its first event Aug. 30 in Cleveland. Snyder earned gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and silver in Tokyo in 2021. Hes a three-time world champion who won three national titles at Ohio State. Dake is a four-time world champion and two-time Olympic bronze medalist. He was a four-time national champion at Cornell. Brooks, a four-time national champion at Penn State, earned bronze at the 2024 Paris Olympics. David Carr and Trent Hidlay also have signed. Carr was a two-time national champion at Iowa State. He was an under-20 world champion, and bronze medalist at the under-17 world championships. Hidlay was a two-time national runner-up at North Carolina State. David, Kyle, Aaron, Trent, and Kyle represent the best of the best, and thats who were targeting for Real American Freestyle, Hogan said in a statement. Our goal is to give these athletes an opportunity to continue their careers, create a platform for greatness, and inspire a legacy that lasts. Kennedy Blades, a silver medalist at the Paris Games, had already signed on the womens side. She believes the input of people such as Hogan will help it be sustainable. Her longtime coach, Israel Hernandez, is the leagues chief operating officer, and shes excited that hes teaming up with Hogan, chief media officer Eric Bischoff and co-founder Chad Bronstein. 
        
     I think the Real American Freestyle wrestling is going to be huge for the sport. I know coach Izzy, at the end of the day, wants to push wrestling to the highest level. The goal is to get people outside who dont know anything about wrestling to come watch and invest in the sport financially, being there at the events, stuff like that, she said. So Im really excited about it. Events will feature eight weight classes with eight matches for men and four for women. Wrestlers will have the opportunity to win a championship purse and bonuses  in adherence to NCAA regulations  for victories. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/hulk-hogan-real-american-wrestling-6d6bc5d1dff53e0b9c9e6af755898676,sports
FCS teams would be allowed to play 12 regular-season games every year under recommendation,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  FCS teams would be allowed to play 12 regular-season games every year under a Division I Football Championship Subdivision Oversight Committee recommendation. The NCAA announced Tuesday the one-game extension would go into effect in 2026 if the Division I Council gives its approval during its June 24-25 meeting. Current legislation permits 12 regular-season games in years when there are 14 Saturdays from the first permissible playing date through the last playing date in November. In all other years, only 11 regular-season contests are permitted. The recommendation also would standardize the start date of the FCS season as the Thursday 13 weeks before the FCS championship bracket is released, which is the Saturday before Thanksgiving. Football Bowl Subdivision teams have had 12-game regular seasons since 2006. ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/fcs-schedule-ncaa-95b27f0e1971d28dbf8f8e0970c4bc22,sports

Ryan Flaherty, J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis began the bottom of the first inning with homers to give Baltimore a lead it would not relinquish. The previous team to homer in its first three at-bats was the Milwaukee Brewers on Sept. 9, 2007. Hardy was also the middle man in that assault. Milwaukee was the third major league team to accomplish the feat, all from the NL. 2013  Two one-hitters with no other baserunners were pitched.

The Braves lose their 17th in a row in Turners debut, as coach Vern Benson makes most of the strategic decisions. After the game, the National League removes Turner from the dugout, citing a rule that prevents an owner from doubling as manager. Dave Bristol, who was given a sabbatical to allow Turner to step into the dugout, will be brought back to finish the year at the helm of the team. 1980  39-year-old Pete Rose steals second base, third, and home in one inning for the Phillies. The last National League player to pull this feat had been Jackie Robinson in 1954. 1996  Al Leiter, the wildest pitcher in the American League the previous season, pitched the first no-hitter in Floridas brief history as the Marlins beat the Colorado Rockies 11-0. 1998  Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs set the major league record for strikeouts in consecutive games (33) by fanning 13 Arizona Diamondbacks in a 4-2 victory. The record for strikeouts in two starts had been 32, set by Luis Tiant in 1968 and matched by Nolan Ryan (1974), Dwight Gooden (1984) and Randy Johnson (1997). 2000  The Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 14-8 in the longest nine-inning game in National League history  4 hours, 22 minutes. The teams tied the major league record set by Baltimore and the Yankees on Sept. 5, 1997. 2003  Rafael Palmeiro of Texas became the 19th player to join the 500-homer club. In a 17-10 win, Palmeiro hit a full-count fastball into the right field stands off Cleveland right-hander David Elder. 2009  In the tallest pitching matchup in baseball history, 6-foot-10 Randy Johnson beat 6-9 Daniel Cabrera. The Big Unit and the towering Cabrera measure a combined 163 inches  one more than the combined heights of Cabrera and Mark Hendrickson on Sept. 1, 2004, in the previous record-holding matchup. Johnson struck out nine for his 298th career victory as San Francisco topped Washington 11-7. 2011  Tim Wakefield takes the mound for the Red Sox at age 44 years and 282 days.

He now shares the mark with Roger Clemens, Kerry Wood and Randy Johnson. Scherzer does not issue a single walk in the game. 2020  Major League Baseball owners agree on a tentative plan to resume the season that has been put on hold since spring training was shut down in early March by the coronavirus pandemic. Training would resume in June and an 82-game season would start around July 1-4, with games played in home ballparks, but without spectators. Teams would play games only against divisional opponents, or teams from the corresponding division in the other league, and the postseason would be expanded to 14 teams from the current 10. Rosters would be expanded to 30 players, with an additional 22-man taxi squad available as replacements in the absence of minor league games. Owners insist that the Players Association will need to accept that salaries will be based on total revenues for the plan to go ahead, something that is unlikely to be acceptable, however. This exact plan will be rejected, but the two sides will agree on a 60-game season starting in late July along the same general parameters. 2021  The Oakland Athletics receive permission from MLB to start exploring relocation options, as their most recent attempt to come to an agreement with local authorities on replacing the outdated Oakland Coliseum, has gone nowhere. 2022  Christian Yelich becomes the 5th player to hit for the cycle for the third time when he does so in a 14-11 Brewers loss to the Reds. His previous two cycles had also come against the Reds, within a three-week span in 2018. 2024  Paul Skenes, the first overall pick of the 2023 amateur draft and considered the best pitching prospect since Stephen Strasburg, makes his much-anticipated major league debut for the Pirates against the Cubs. He allows only one run through the first four innings, on a solo homer by Nico Hoerner in the 4th, and strikes out seven, but allows the first two batters in the 5th to reach base before giving way to reliever Kyle Nicolas, who allows both inherited runners to score. The Cubs, who were trailing 6 - 1 at one point, eventually tie the score but Pittsburgh comes out on top, 10 - 9, after a two-hour rain delay. _____ May 12 1910  Chief Bender of the Philadelphia Athletics pitched a 4-0 no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians. 1926  Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators records his 400th career win when he defeats the St. Louis Browns, 7-4. 1937  St. Louis Joe Medwick hit two home runs and two doubles to lead the Cardinals to a 15-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. 1955  Sam Toothpick Jones of the Cubs got a no-hitter the hard way. In the ninth inning against Pittsburgh, he walked the bases full and then struck out the next three batters for a 4-0 victory. 1956  Carl Erskine of the Brooklyn Dodgers pitched a 3-0 no-hitter against the New York Giants. 1958  Willie Mays hits the first grand slam in the history of the San Francisco Giants. 1966  Lou Brocks RBI single in the 12th inning gave the St. Louis Cardinals a 4-3 victory over Atlanta in the opening of Busch Memorial Stadium.

Burnett pitched an unlikely no-hitter  overcoming a record nine walks  to lead Florida over San Diego 3-0. 2004  In one of the most remarkable at-bats in major league history, Alex Cora fouls off 14 consecutive pitches and then hits the 18th pitch over the right field fence for a two-run home run off Cubs pitcher Matt Clement. 2008  Indians second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera turned the 14th unassisted triple play in major league history, accomplishing the feat in the second game of a doubleheader against Toronto. Cabrera made a diving catch on a line drive by Lyle Overbay, touched second base and then tagged out Marco Scutaro to quickly end the fifth inning of Clevelands 3-0 loss in 10 innings. 2009  Ryan Zimmerman extended his hitting streak to 30 games, getting a first-inning single in the Washington Nationals 9-7 loss to San Francisco. 2010  Homer Bailey became the latest Cincinnati Reds starter to pitch a gem against the Pittsburgh Pirates, tossing his first career complete game in a 5-0 win. The Reds became the first team in the majors in nearly 10 years to pitch back-to-back, complete-game shutouts without a walk  Oaklands Tim Hudson and Barry Zito did it on Sept. 9-10, 2000, against Tampa Bay. 2015  The Mariners tie a team record by hitting six homers in an 11-4 win over the Padres at Safeco Field. Nelson Cruz hits his major league-leading 15th home run, while Mike Zunino hits two, and Kyle Seager, Justin Ruggiano and Logan Morrison complete the barrage. 2017  Buster Posey homers in the 17th inning to send the Giants to a 3-2 win over the Reds, in a game that takes 5 hours and 28 minutes. _____",https://apnews.com/sports/daniel-cabrera-randy-johnson-boston-red-sox-st-louis-cardinals-bryce-harper-d31d8e185175afffc643c655444aae8b,sports

Punjab-Mumbai IPL game shifted to Ahmedabad because of India-Pakistan tensions,"MUMBAI, India (AP)  The Punjab Kings-Mumbai Indians game in the Indian Premier League scheduled for Sunday was shifted from Dharamsala to Ahmedabad because of India-Pakistan tensions. The IPL cited logistical challenges on Thursday. Airports in Dharamsala and Chandigarh  where Punjab Kings are based  have been closed for civilian and commercial purposes since Wednesday. Airports across Indias northwestern corridor have been similarly closed owing to the cross-border tensions between India and Pakistan. With the airports shut down, there was no way for Mumbai Indians to reach Chandigarh or Dharamsala. There was another logistical challenge awaiting the Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals squads, as well as broadcast crews, to travel from Dharamsala to their next respective venues. Punjab takes on Delhi in Dharamsala in a crucial game on Thursday. Both teams will take a 10-hour road journey to New Delhi after the game. The Capitals play Gujarat Titans at home next, and the Kings fly from Delhi to Ahmedabad for their next game against the Mumbai Indians. Punjab, Delhi and Mumbai are all in contention for the four knockout spots. Despite shifting Sundays game to Ahmedabad, there were other operational challenges as well: Narendra Modi Stadium was adorned with Gujarat Titans sponsor branding as its home ground.

Barcelona must regroup after Inter loss to face Real Madrid in crucial La Liga clasico,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  Barcelona must recover from its painful Champions League exit in time to face Real Madrid on Sunday with the La Liga title on the line. Hansi Flicks team was moments away from reaching its first European final in a decade when Inter Milan conjured a 4-3 extra-time comeback on Tuesday. The Italian side won 7-6 on aggregate in one of the most memorable knockout ties in recent soccer history. Barcelonas youthful team was left reeling from the loss, but Flick immediately tried to put the focus on the upcoming clasico with only four days separating the two crucial games. This game is over and now we have to pick ourselves up and look ahead as we have the clasico coming up, Flick said after the defeat at San Siro. I will wake the team up. Barcelona leads Madrid by four points and a victory would give it a comfortable cushion, but a Madrid win would throw open the title chase in the three remaining rounds. Barcelona is seeking a double after having beaten Madrid 3-2 in extra time in the Copa del Rey final two weeks ago. A Barcelona triumph would also complete a sweep of all four clasicos this season; it beat Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup in January after winning 4-0 at Madrid in the league in October. Madrid, in contrast, is trying to salvage a disappointing season by successfully defending its La Liga title ahead of this summers expanded Club World Cup. 
        
     Lamine Yamal, who played superbly against Inter only to be denied a second-leg goal, pledged that Barcelona take another run at the Champions League title next season. But he ended that message with a rallying cry ahead of Madrids visit. Sunday is another final and we have to stick together. Go Bara! Yamal wrote after the game. The wear and tear of the season has taken its toll and left several players, especially in defense, on the injured list. Madrid will be without its entire first-choice backline of Antonio Rudiger, Eder Milito, Dani Carvajal and Ferland Mendy. Midfielder Eduardo Camavinga, who moonlights as a left back, is also out. That means youth player Ral Asenscio and midfielder Aurlien Tchouamni will likely anchor Madrids defense with Lucas Vzquez and Fran Garca as full backs. Barcelona is hoping left back Alejandro Balde will recover from a left-thigh injury that ruled him out of the series against Inter. Right back Jules Kound, who netted the winner in the Copa del Rey final, has been ruled out by a left-thigh injury. Ronald Arajo, or perhaps ric Garca, will take his place and face off against Madrids Vincius Jnior. Flick will have to decide if Robert Lewandowski or Ferran Torres starts at striker. Lewandowski missed several matches before he came on as a late substitute against Inter this week but was unable to prove effective. Watch out for the midfield battle between Barcelonas Pedri Gonzlez and Madrids Jude Bellingham. The playmakers are critical to directing their teams attacks. All three prior clasicos have been high scoring  at least for Barcelona with 12 total goals to Madrids four, so expect more goals against the depleted defenses at the Olympic Stadium. Led by Raphinha, Yamal and Lewandowski, Barcelona has a league-high 91 goals, compared to Madrids 69. Both sides have conceded 33 goals this campaign. Lewandowski leads the league with 25 goals. Madrids Kylian Mbapp is right behind with 24. But while Yamal and Raphinha are having breakout seasons, Vincius and Rodrigo have been inconsistent. With Barcelona ruling the statistics and recent meetings, Madrid will have to capitalize on its extra days of rest and hope that Barcelonas morale was damaged by Inter. The vibe in Spain is that Sundays game will likely be the last big contest for Carlo Ancelotti as the Madrid coach. He is under contract through the next campaign but is widely expected to leave the club after a rough season in which the team played worse despite adding Mbapp to its squad.

Azteca Stadium to reopen 75 days before start of the 2026 World Cup,"MEXICO CITY (AP)  The revamped Azteca Stadium is scheduled to reopen 75 days before the start of the 2026 World Cup with improved services around it, Mexico City mayor Clara Brugada announced on Wednesday. The iconic venue closed last May for renovations ahead of next years 48-team competition hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada. The 83,000-seat Azteca, which recently was renamed, will host five games including the tournament opener. It also hosted the first matches in the 1971 and 1986 World Cups. Brugada did not reveal further details regarding the reopening of the stadium on March 28, 2026. Stadium director Felix Aguirre said they are thinking long term. The stadium is moving ahead with its renovations so it can work for the next 40 or 50 years, he said. We are respecting its legacy, but we also want to improve the fan experience. The stadium owners, a company related to Televisa, Mexicos largest television network, have released images of work done on the pitch and the lower seats. The luxury boxes apparently havent been touched because some owners refuse to release them to FIFA. Brugada also said that for the 2026 World Cup, they are going to improve a light rail line that heads toward Azteca, will enhance outdoor lighting and a pedestrian bridge around it among other things. On game days, the Xochimilco Light Rail known as Tren Ligero is one of the fastest ways to reach the stadium, located south of the city, but it currently has 20 trains and the citys government will purchase 17 more. 
        
     We will have around 40 trains to attend a daily requirement of over 400,000 passengers, Brugada said. The current capacity of the trains is 160,000 passengers per day and the ride from Taxquea station, the closest metro line, to the stadium is around 15 minutes with trains departing every 10 minutes. Brugada said that with more trains the departures time will be shorter. The mayor said they will be upgrading the citys video surveillance camera system for the tournament and adding 40,000 to have a total of 123,000. Mexico Citys video surveillance system is called the Command, Control, Computing, Communications, and Citizen contact center known as C5. Besides the cameras, the system has 1,000 panic buttons to enhance public safety. The video surveillance system put us in the forefront, we are the most video-monitored city in Latin America, Brugada said. Brugada also informed that Los Pinos, which until 2018 was the Mexican presidents official office and residence, will serve as the media center. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/azteca-stadium-2026-world-cup-reopening-7c211f4f4e30cf3f87a42dcbddc926b7,sports
FIFA picks 8 host cities for the 2027 Womens World Cup in Brazil,"SAO PAULO (AP)  Soccers international governing body has confirmed eight host cities for the 2027 Womens World Cup to be held in Brazil.  FIFA announced the venues for the month-long tournament on Wednesday but hasnt decided yet where the opening match and the final will take place. All eight sites were among the 12 used for the mens World Cup in 2014: Rio de Janeiro (Maracana Stadium), Sao Paulo (NeoQuimica Arena), Belo Horizonte (Mineirao Stadium), Braslia (Nacional Stadium), Fortaleza (Arena Castelao), Porto Alegre (Beira-Rio Stadium), Recife (Arena Pernambuco), and Salvador (Arena Fonte Nova).  From stunning beaches to cosmopolitan cities, the world will experience the energy, color and warmth that only Brazil can offer, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement. Some members of Brazils soccer confederation have said they want to hold the opening match at Sao Paulo and the final at the 78,000-seat Maracana, as it did in the 2014 World Cup. Curitiba, Manaus and Natal, all venues for the mens World Cup, were not included in the womens tournament bid book. Belem was also left out. The host city selection process started in August of last year. At the 2014 World Cup, players, fans and coaches criticized the choice of 12 host cities for a tournament that was widely spread across the country. For this tournament, set for June 24-July 25, 2027, almost all host cities are either on the Brazilian coast or close to it, with the exception of the capital, Brasilia, and Belo Horizonte, two of the nations most populous cities. Brazil will host the womens tournament for the first time. Brazil is a five-time World Cup champion in mens football but has never won the womens global title. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/brazil-2027-womens-world-cup-hosts-4419db25fcc12a3025149e15cbe07b60,sports
Bukayo Saka misses a sitter against PSG and Arsenal misses out again,"Bukayo Saka missed from a near-unmissable position and Arsenal missed out again. A 2-1 loss to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday ended Arsenals hopes of winning the Champions League and halting a barren trophy run that now stretches five years. PSG won the two-legged semifinal 3-1 on aggregate and will play Inter Milan in the final in Munich on May 31. Arsenal will wonder how another season of promise has ended up empty-handed. We have to learn from this. We did a lot of good things, but its not enough, captain Martin Odegaard said after the match in Paris. It might have been different had Saka not fired over the bar with an open net to aim at in the 79th  but Arsenal had already given itself a mountain to climb at that point, having gone 2-0 down. Saka reduced the deficit and could have leveled the score on the night if not for his wayward finish. Inside the boxes, over the two games, we werent good enough, Odegaard said. A top class center forward is likely top of Mikel Artetas wanted list when the transfer window opens  and his failure to strengthen his forward line in January has undermined Arsenals campaign. A challenge for the Premier League title fizzled out and it is only Arsenals form in Europe that has disguised its failings since the turn of the year. Artetas team has won only three of its last 10 league games and just one of the last five. Blowing the lead against Bournemouth last weekend was the fourth time in five league games that it has dropped points from a winning position. 
        
     Arsenal has saved its biggest performances for the Champions League  beating holder Real Madrid home and away in the quarterfinals. But its hopes of a first final appearance since 2006 were ended by a PSG team that finally looks ready to conquer Europe after more than decade of lavish spending from its Qatari backers. What next for Arsenal after this latest near miss? Injuries to forwards Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus have not helped, but Arsenals trophy wait goes on. Artetas only major trophy with the club was in his first year when they won the FA Cup in 2020. Since then he has restored Arsenal to one of the biggest forces in English soccer and returned it to the Champions League. There were back-to-back runner-up spots in the Premier League over the past two seasons and it is currently second to champion Liverpool this year. A Champions League quarterfinal last year was followed by a semifinal this time around. But still no trophy. There have been two Community Shields since the FA Cup triumph, but they are not widely considered major trophies, rather a curtain raiser to the season that is often described as a glorified friendly match. Sometimes you have to lose a few in order to win and you have to overcome some of these setbacks and mentally grow as a person and as a player and as a group, Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice said. Were going through that at the moment, a few losses, in terms of losing out in the league and coming close in the Champions League in back-to-back years. PSG have gone through tonight and were absolutely gutted but this doesnt define us for sure. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/psg-arsenal-champions-league-0646d6a013ba0aa5f8073d942d8878db,sports

Antonelli becomes youngest pole winner in F1 history by taking top stop for Miami sprint race,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Kimi Antonelli became the youngest pole-winner of any Formula 1 event in history when the 18-year-old Mercedes driver won the top starting spot Friday for the sprint race ahead of the Miami Grand Prix.  Antonelli is in his first season in F1, where Mercedes hired him to replace seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton. Mercedes has great faith the Italian can deliver, and he did in qualifying for the second sprint race of the season. I am feeling over the moon, I did not expect this, Antonelli said. He will start Saturdays sprint race alongside current F1 points leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who lost the pole by .045 seconds to Antonelli. Its the first time since 2009 an Italian driver has won any pole in F1. It was a very intense qualifying, Antonelli said. I felt very since this morning and I felt very confident going into qualifying. Really happy to get the first pole. Its going to be nice to start on the front row and see how we can do in the sprint.  Lando Norris, second in the standings, qualified third for McLaren and was followed by Max Verstappen, who arrived in Miami in time for Friday practice after skipping Thursday activities as he welcomed his first child with partner Kelly Piquet. George Russell, the lead driver at Mercedes, qualified fifth and was followed by Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Hamilton. Alex Albon of Williams was eighth and followed by Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls and Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/fi-miami-sprint-qualifying-antonelli-1a363ecbda3c4b282253004bd21ad7d0,sports
Tire Water: McLaren boss calls for rule designed to curb bogus allegations made by rival teams,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla, (AP)  McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown wants the FIA to adopt a rule that prohibits teams from making baseless allegations against their rivals. Brown floated the idea after using a water bottle on pit lane that had multiple large  TIRE WATER labels affixed on the bottle. It was Browns way of trolling Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner, who allegedly complained to Formula 1s governing body that McLaren was using water to manage its tire temperature. (The water bottle) was poking fun at a serious issue, which is teams have historically made allegations of other teams. Most recently, one team focuses on that strategy more than others, Brown said Saturday at the Miami Grand Prix. Theres a proper way to protest a team at the end of the race, and you have to make it formal, disclose where it comes from, put some money down, he continued. I think that process should be extended to all allegations to stop the frivolous allegations which are intended only to be a distraction. The protest policy F1 currently has in place requires a monetary deposit from the team that makes a formal complaint. Brown now wants the same process to apply to publicly aired concerns from rival teams so that the allegations are put on paper and also to curb the practice. If you had to put up some money and put on paper and not backchannel what your allegations are, I think that would be a way to clean up the bogus allegations that happened in this sport, which are not very sporting, Brown said. And if someone does believe theres a technical issue, by all means youre entitled to it. Put it on paper, put your money down. It should come against your cost cap if it turns out youre wrong, and I think that will significantly stop the bogus allegations that come from some teams in the sport. 
        
     Brown said the pay to complain fee should be meaningful to be effective, and, if an allegation is proved true, the money would be returned to the complaining team. It needs to be meaningful from a Im choosing to spend money on that instead of my own racing car (point of view). Were all right at the limit of the budget gap, Brown said. I know we will not waste a dollar on anything that we dont think brings performance, so its probably 25 grand. Would I spend $25,000 on a distraction tactic or develop my own race car? Id spend it on my race car all day long. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-brown-tire-water-mclaren-protest-6ab4ee786733f8ccc5b3a93e11073718,sports
Cindric all good at Texas after week celebrating a Cup win and talk with teammate over radio rant,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)  Austin Cindric will start on the second row for the NASCAR Cup race at Texas after a week of celebrating a win at Talladega and a lot of attention paid to an expletive-laden radio rant directed toward him by his own teammate during Team Penskes first win of the season. There also was the conversation with Joey Logano, who was furious midway through the race when he didnt get the help he needed in his Ford from Cindric, which allowed rival Toyota driver Bubba Wallace to win the second stage and earn valuable bonus points. Definitely needed, right? I mean, I think youve got to talk about that. Youve got to talk about what happened on track. I think thats a lot more of the substance of the conversation, Cindric said Saturday. I feel like Ive got pretty thick skin, and I also feel like I know Joey fairly well, so Im not overly concerned or have too many emotions at all about what was said, he said. But I think for us, sorting out where we both stood on track and what we can do in the future to be better there and capitalize on those opportunities. They are back on the track Sunday at Texas, the 1 1/2-mile track where Cindric qualified third for the 11th Cup race this season. All good for me, man, Cindric said when asked if the teammates were good. Carson Hocevar earned his first Cup pole with a qualifying lap of 191.659 mph in the Spire Motorsports Chevrolet. The 22-year-old Hocevar is the youngest pole winner ever at Texas Motor Speedway, which will host its 45th Cup race. His 56th career Cup race will start on the front row with Cup points leader William Byron (191.564 mph), also in a Chevy. 
        
     Cindric ran a qualifying lap of 191.523 mph. Logano will start 27th, two spots ahead of defending race champion Chase Elliott. Logano said this week that he probably spouted off more than he should have against his teammate during the Talladega race, and that it came in the heat of the moment. Among the reactions this week was Baseball Hall of Famer Chipper Jones criticizing reigning NASCAR champion Logano in a series of social media posts. Jones congratulated Cindric, called Logano selfish and celebrated Logano being disqualified for failing postrace inspection. Cindric said he knows who the former Atlanta Braves slugger is even though he doesnt follow much baseball. But to have something like that with eyes on our sport, a Hall of Famer is really cool, Cindric said. The rest of its a lot of noise. But its cool to have someone like that behind me. As for that Braves cap Cindric keeps in his truck, that isnt about being a fan of the MLB team, and he didnt wear it at all this week. Well, the funny thing is, thats like my neutral hat ... because I dont want to walk around like advertising, Hey, Im a NASCAR driver if I can help it, he said. So its usually either that or my Colts (cap) that I snag in my truck. Chase Elliott left Texas last spring with his first victory after 42 races and 18 months without one. He is back with another long winless drought, this one 37 races and nearly 13 months since crossing the finish line under caution after taking the white flag as the leader there. Definitely not a conversation you want to be having, but nonetheless, I think weve been going in the right direction, said Elliott, who is fourth in the NASCAR Cup standings, with six top-10 finishes and none outside the top 20. The sports most popular driver shouldnt be hard to find on the track Sunday, when he will drive a gold car to help NAPA Auto Parts mark its 100th year as a company. NAPA has been his primary sponsor since he was racing in the Xfinity Series in 2014. Elliotts win last year was the eighth at Texas for Hendrick Motorsports, twice as many as any other team. Hendrick has won three of the last four there with different drivers each time. William Byron won the tracks last fall race in 2023, two years after Kyle Larson won a playoff race and the non-points All-Star race. Its not the best race track, but its unique enough that its different and its a challenge. Theres that positivity to it. They didnt do a good job with the remodel of it, Larson said, referring to a 2017 total repave with significant changes to Turns 1 and 2. I mean you can still have success somewhere and not love it. But, yeah, I dont hate it either. Larson at +375 is the betting favorite to win Sunday, per BetMGM Sportsbook, followed by Byron at +550 and Tyler Reddick at +700. ... Kyle Buschs 35th race at Texas will come two days after his 40th birthday. He has four wins at Texas, where he has led in 20 different races overall, a track record. His 1,069 laps led are second only to Jimmie Johnsons 1,152. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-texas-preview-cindric-penske-5e5dd419ade3f03711a08dc0b1a000f1,sports
Haeran Ryu pulls away for a wire-to-wire win at Black Desert Championship,"IVINS, Utah (AP)  Haeran Ryu made an 8-foot eagle putt during a flawless back nine that allowed her to pull away Sunday with an 8-under 64, giving her a five-shot victory at the inaugural Black Desert Championship in the LPGA Tours return to Utah after a 61-year absence. Ryu became the second player to go wire-to-wire on the LPGA Tour this year, and it was her second time winning a new event. She won the FM Championship at the TPC Boston last year. She was coming off a rough finish at the Chevron Championship last week, sharing the 54-hole lead at the first major of the year until closing with a 76. This one was closer than the five-shot margin indicated. Ryu was clinging to a one-shot lead over Esther Henseleit of Germany going to the back nine. She missed a 6-foot birdie putt on the 10th  her third straight miss from short range for birdie. But then she made a 15-foot birdie putt at the 11th, and her eagle at the 13th put her ahead by four shots. Incredible day, said Ryu, who now has won in each of the last seven years dating to her first win as an 18-year-old on the Korea LPGA. Henseleit, who started three shots behind, went out in 31 to get within one shot. She cooled on the back nine, not making another birdie until the 18th hole for a 66. She tied for second with Ruoning Yin (67), the final challenge to Ryu. Started out great on the front nine and then couldnt quite keep up on the back, Henseleit said. Haeran played amazing and she really deserved to win it today. 
        
     Yin, who got back into the mix with a 62 on Saturday, was four shots behind at the turn. She ran off four straight birdies starting at the 11th, all of them inside 8 feet. The last one got her to within three shots of Ryu. The South Korean responded with an approach into 3 feet on the 15th for a birdie to restore her lead to four shots, and Yin fell back with a double bogey from the bunker on the 16th. I play 70 good holes, Yin said. I made a triple on the first day and then a double on 16 today. But overall, I think my game is really solid. Yan Liu closed with a 65 to finish alone in fourth. Stephanie Kyriacou of Australia finished with the shot of the day, a fairway metal on the par-5 18th that rolled in for an albatross, giving her a 67 to tie for sixth. Ryu is the 10th winner in 10 tournaments on the LPGA Tour this season. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/haeran-ryu-lpga-black-desert-henseleith-yin-a653ed837917639509e134c4baecd2ef,sports
Scottie Scheffler matches PGA Tour 72-hole scoring record in 8-shot win at the Byron Nelson,"McKINNEY, Texas (AP)  Scottie Scheffler cradled his year-old son Bennett  the reason he missed his beloved hometown CJ Cup Byron Nelson in 2024  and struggled to keep his emotions in check for a TV interview, just as he did a few minutes later during the victory speech. The top-ranked player had time to prepare for the moment because of the giant lead he took into Sundays final round, and he even added a little drama by chasing the PGA Tours 72-hole scoring record. Scheffler matched that mark of 253 set by Justin Thomas at the 2017 Sony Open and equaled six years later by Ludvig Aberg at the RSM Classic, closing with a 63 to finish at 31 under par. The runaway victory came 11 years after his PGA Tour debut at the Nelson as a high school senior, and 22 years after a photo was taken of then-6-year-old Scheffler with the tournament namesake.  Scheffler couldnt help but think about that day in 2014, when his now-wife, Meredith, was his girlfriend  not yet the mother of their first child  and sister Callie, now a mother of two, was his caddie. My family was all able to be here, and it was just really, really special memories, and I think at times it all comes crashing down to me at once, Scheffler said. We have a lot of great memories as kids coming to watch this tournament. I just dreamed to be able to play in it, and its more of a dream to be able to win it. Scheffler was in position to break the tour scoring record before a flubbed chip that led to bogey on the par-3 17th hole and a par from a greenside bunker on the par-5 closing hole. His 8-foot putt for birdie and the record slid by the left side of the hole. 
        
     Hideki Matsuyama has the lowest score in relation to par this season, 35 under on the par-73 Plantation Course at Kapalua. Scheffler tied the 54-hole Nelson record with an eight-shot lead, and nobody got closer than six during the final round. Erik van Rooyen of South Africa matched Schefflers 8-under 63 to finish at 23 under, three shots ahead of Sam Stevens and four ahead of another hometown favorite, Jordan Spieth. We spoke last night, and I told you it was going to be a steep mountain to climb, and it was, van Rooyen said. Scottie was practically flawless, which is kind of what you expect from the world No. 1. Really proud with the golf I played. Scheffler and Spieth finished with the two lowest rounds of the tournament. Scheffler opened with a 10-under 61 on Thursday at the defenseless par-71 TPC Craig Ranch in a suburban community about 30 miles north of Dallas. Spieth shot 62 in the final round, knowing his friend and fellow Texas alum was about to become the first of the pair to win the event they both cherish. Spieth was the first to make his tour debut at the Nelson, four years before Scheffler. On top of that, Spieth contended as a 16-year-old in 2010, leading many to believe that surely he would have won it by now. Scheffler stole those bragging rights. I think Ill take it easy on him, Scheffler said with a chuckle. Spieth played with Scheffler the first two days and was 12 shots behind him going into the weekend, so he understands how things have changed. They started the tournament with 13 PGA Tour wins apiece. Now Spieth trails for the first time. It wasnt that long ago I was definitely better than him, and now Im definitely not right now, said Spieth, a three-time major champion. I hate admitting that about anybody, but I just watched it those first two rounds, and, like, Ive got to get better. Its very inspiring.  It was the first victory this year for Scheffler after he won a total of 10 times before May in the previous three years combined, including two Masters victories.  Schefflers previous best Nelson finish was a tie for fifth in his most recent appearance two years ago. Now hes the first wire-to-wire Nelson winner since Tom Watson 45 years ago. Im not jealous of him winning this event over any other, Spieth said. Im jealous of anyone that wins any week. When Scottie wins, Im happy. It doesnt matter where it is. If Im not going to win, I like when he wins. Scheffler shattered the previous Nelson scoring record of 259 set by Steven Bowditch in 2015. That tournament was played at the TPC Four Seasons. Normally a par 70, that course had a par-69 layout the final three days when heavy rain forced officials to convert a par 4 into a par 3. Bowditch finished 18 under. The margin of victory was the second-largest at the Nelson behind Sam Sneads 10-shot win in 1957, when it was known as the Dallas Open Invitational. This is a golf course where you can kind of make a run, and I knew that I couldnt just coast to the finish line today, Scheffler said. I knew I had to put together a good round. Because of heavy rain Wednesday and Friday, players were allowed to lift, clean and replace their golf balls in the fairway for the first three rounds, but not in the final round. Aberg had so-called preferred lies during the first rounds at the 2023 RSM Classic.  ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/scottie-scheffler-byron-nelson-pga-tour-scoring-record-72047ee609a52573394cdd3d39b9ed2d,sports
New York Liberty open up camp ready to defend their first WNBA championship,"NEW YORK (AP)  Breanna Stewart and her New York Liberty teammates are focused on the present and that includes defending the WNBA championship. The Liberty opened camp Sunday along with the other 12 teams in the league. Stewart knows exactly how hard it is to repeat as champion, having won two titles in Seattle and failing to repeat each time. The only repeat champion in the past two decades in the WNBA was the Las Vegas Aces in 2022 and 2023.  The mentality is turning the page, she said. Knowing what we did last year, we had a lot of time to celebrate it and now its, building to be better. You know, we talked about, being consistently great night in and night out. And that starts with building great habits in training camp and keeping them sustainable throughout the entire season. The Liberty have most of the core back from last seasons title run that was the first in franchise history. They also added Natasha Cloud and Isabelle Harrison. I thought it was a great start. And like, I always said, you cant bring back the same when you win and we have a real good, nice freshness about us, New York coach Sandy Brondello said. Weve got some players that were really going to help us. Obviously, you know, no one greater than Natasha Cloud, Brondello wasnt concerned that Stewart is working her way back from offseason meniscus surgery last month. Stewart took part in the early part of practice Sunday and said shes feeling great. She will integrate more fully into live practice next week.  
        
     Stewart said she felt she did something to it in Game 5 of the WNBA Finals last year and waited until after the inaugural season of Unrivaled was over to take care of it. I just needed to kind of clean up things in there and clean up the meniscus, she said. And, it was just a little bit uncomfortable to be dealing with. And I want to when Im on the floor, I want to be playing and, free flowing and not really thinking about other things. While Stewart will be back before the regular season begins, the Liberty are going to be missing Betnijah Laney-Hamilton for a few months as she recovers from her own knee injury. Were definitely gonna miss her a lot this season, Stewart said. I think, you know, with her being out, it gives people opportunities. You know, Leonie (Fiebich) will have a bigger role. Marina (Johannes) coming here. ...Its just going to be like next woman up mentality and knowing that theyre not going to take her place. But theyre going to be the best version of themselves. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-liberty-ca54d4f643819f4f9996eee8c65db83a,sports
"Caitlin Clark, Angel Reeses return to college for WNBA preseason games to be shown on national TV","NEW YORK (AP)  Caitlin Clark and Angel Reeses return to college for WNBA preseason games will be two of a record four exhibition games shown on national TV. Clark will head back to Iowa for an exhibition between her Indiana Fever and the Brazilian national team on Sunday, a game airing on ESPN. The Fevers exhibition game against the Washington Mystics a day earlier will be on NBA TV. Reese will lead the Chicago Sky back to her alma mater, LSU, on Friday to face the Brazilian team. Sky teammate Kamilla Cardoso played for that Brazilian team in February 2024, trying to help it qualify for the Paris Olympics. That game will be part of a doubleheader on ION. The WNBA will be showing all 15 of its preseason games either on national television or league pass. Weve seen the demand for WNBA content grow exponentially and we are meeting that demand by working with our broadcast partners and our teams to make a significant investment by making all 15 preseason games available to WNBA fans, Chief Growth Officer Colie Edison said. The league showed two exhibition games in 2023 and four last year, including Clarks debut, which was on league pass. Reeses preseason debut against Minnesota wasnt televised, but a fan livestreamed it on social media. The livestream drew significant attention, getting millions of views. The two rookies last season helped the league draw record-breaking viewership. ESPN games averaged 1.2 million viewers in the regular season, a 170% increase from the previous year. The postseason averaged 1.1 million viewers, making it the leagues most-viewed playoffs in 25 years. 
        
     The other game that will be nationally televised will be when Dallas plays Las Vegas at Notre Dame in the first game of the ION doubleheader Friday. Three former Irish stars  Dallas Arike Ogunbowale and Las Vegas Jewell Loyd and Jackie Young  are coming back to campus. The game also will mark the debut of Paige Bueckers, the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft two weeks ago. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-preseason-caitlin-clark-angel-reese-ff8c777fa04417596c7bea188133cae0,sports
Stronger Caitlin Clark gears up for 2nd WNBA season with a revamped and upgraded Fever roster,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark slapped the court with both hands and started gesturing in her sides direction after forcing a 5-second call near the end of Tuesdays practice. It was only Day 2 of training camp, yet this is what Clark has yearned for these past seven months  going back to work with a new coach, a revamped roster and even higher expectations in her second WNBA season. After leading the Fever to their first playoff berth in eight years, winning the leagues Rookie of the Year Award, being named Associated Press 2024 Female Athlete of the Year and Time magazines 2024 Athlete of the Year, Clark returned to Indianapolis a stronger, wiser player, more determined to win the championship that eluded her in college. It was an adjustment sure, because I was so used to playing minutes for, well, basically a year of my life. Thats all I did, Clark said. So the rest was good. I thought it was going to feel long and it really didnt. We were in here all the time. But that rest aspect, just getting my body where it needed to be and really on things I needed to work on was super important. But Im ready to compete again.  It was a well-deserved vacation for perhaps the busiest player in womens basketball. She capped her final college season by playing a 39-game schedule while leading Iowa to a second straight national championship game. One week after losing to South Carolina, the Fever drafted her No. 1 overall and 13 days after that, training camp opened. 
        
     Following a brief preseason, Clark made her regular-season debut May 10. That started a grueling 42-game grind during which the Fever overcame a 1-8 start to finish 20-20. Then they were swept out of the playoffs. The only real stoppage for Clark during that 81-game, 10 1/2-month span was the monthlong Olympic break.  Clark turned sellouts at college and WNBA games into the norm as she found her every move scrutinized on social media. Fans complained she was being treated poorly by the leagues older players and some even argued the physical play was racially motivated. Her friendships and relationships became all the rage, and nothing seemed to be off limits. But Clark never complained, never bowed to the pressure and used this seven-month break to focus on being herself. She completed one bucket list item  attending the final round of The Masters earlier this month  and had her college jersey retired. She attended a Taylor Swift concert, an NFL game with Swift and, of course, Pacers games. Now, though, she sounds refreshed as she sings the praises of a veteran team full of title dreams and championship resumes from coach Stephanie White to teammates Natasha Howard and 37-year-old DeWanna Bonner. And the early returns seem to show the personalities are a perfect match. Everything is just absolutely good, All-Star guard Kelsey Mitchell said. It feels fresh. It feels kind of like when you take your clothes out of the dryer. It just feels different and it feels good because we have new leadership. Its not just the overhauled roster, either. Mitchell, one of the few holdovers left from last season, also sees a different version of Clark, one showcased in a photo posted on social media last month. From a physical standpoint, her strength and her ability to make plays that people dont think about  that skip pass from here to here, Mitchell said. A person of her caliber, it seems small but its going to help her go from having 10 assists to 12. And then after that the professional learning, watching film, knowing what you need. Just the thought of an improved Clark this season could make opponents jittery. Clark led the Fever in minutes (35.4 per game) and steals (1.3), shared team scoring honors with Mitchell (19.2 points), and broke the WNBAs single season mark for assists with 337. Not bad for a rookie trying to fit in and find her way. But the intensity and passion Clark plays with, even in practice, seem to have her more comfortable playing the leading role from the start of this season, too. She doesnt waste reps and she literally embodies the value that how you do anything is how you do everything  whether its a ball-handling drill or a shooting drill or setting screens, White said. She approaches it with such a discipline that she doesnt waste time, and I appreciate that. Clark, meanwhile, is just focused on winning games. The Fever will play at her alma mater and Notre Dame in the preseason, with the real tests set to begin with Indianas season opener May 17 at Chicago and her old rival, Angel Reese. And you can bet, Clark will be just as eager to celebrate then as she was in practice. Dont get me wrong, I love basketball, like thats one of the most fun things in the world, she said. We had a great year and eventually getting away from that, I came to a point where I was itching to get back in here after like a month. So Im happy to be back. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-fever-caitlin-clark-a57296074672f8ac81123312ef3ea257,sports
Jalen Milroe is cheerful but diligent as he begins his first minicamp with the Seahawks,"RENTON, Wa. (AP)  For all the million-dollar smiles Jalen Milroe flashed following his first practice with the Seahawks, its clear Seattles third-round draft pick means business. Milroes diligent approach stems from his being raised by military parents. His father, Quentin, served in the Marine Corps while his mother, Lola, served in the Navy. Both were on hand for the opening of the Seahawks rookie minicamp on Friday. Having two military parents, you definitely emphasize determination. Grit. Goals, short-term goals and long-term goals, and understanding that it takes a team, Milroe said. I dont believe in the word self-made at all. It takes a team to accomplish what you want to accomplish. So, my team was here today at practice. So, too, was Milroes passing potential. He worked through the route tree and showed impressive touch on deep throws. Milroe, who completed 64% of his passes at Alabama with 45 touchdowns and 20 interceptions, has spent the last year and a half working on his mechanics with former NFL quarterback Jordan Palmer in San Clemente, California. Palmer has also worked with Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and even Seattles new starter, Sam Darnold. Milroe has gained a better understanding of the role his lower body plays in making strong, accurate throws. Every quarterback is different, Milroe said. And so, doing a really deep understanding of how my body functions at the quarterback position for how I throw the ball. And so, understanding how to distribute my body when it comes to my lower-half mechanics and things like that. Thats been a focus for us. And so with that, its all about being an efficient passer. 
        
     Tight end Elijah Arroyo, a second-round pick, appreciated catching passes from Milroe. I cant really explain it. Im not a quarterback, Arroyo said. But just the way he throws the ball, the way he moves. He has a chance to be an elite quarterback at the highest level. Odds are Milroe will do a lot more sitting than competing early in his NFL career. Darnold, after all, signed a three-year, $100.5 million contract this offseason. The Seahawks also brought in veteran backup Drew Lock. None of that is to suggest the 22-year-old Milroe intends on coasting in his first year as a pro. He said he began studying the Seahawks playbook the day after he was drafted. It was a quick turnaround for sure, Milroe said. Its definitely now, this is my job. Now I know where Im going to be. Its a long process for sure. Milroe has some familiarity with having to learn new a new offensive system. He worked alongside three offensive coordinators with the Crimson Tide. Last season, Milroe operated with an entirely new coaching staff, too, after Nick Saban called it quits on as decorated a coaching career as any in college football. Seattle also has a new offensive coordinator this year. Klint Kubiak was hired in January after one season in the same position with the New Orleans Saints. We saw football in different lenses with each coordinator, Milroe said. You have different terminology. You have different formation adjustments. One familiar thing for Milroe on his first full workday as a pro: having his parents with him. My parents made a joke, Its like your first day of class today, and they took a bunch of pictures after practice, Milroe said. But no, its definitely cool to be an NFL quarterback, to get my feet wet, get acclimated with everything. It was definitely a dream come true for sure. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/seahawks-jalen-milroe-rookie-camp-859730a9faa86994e5623f208ed065a7,sports
Ravens draft pick Mike Green says he was open with teams about sexual assault allegations,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP)  Mike Green has been open about the fact that hes faced multiple sexual assault allegations, but when it comes to details, he wasnt discussing it further at rookie camp this weekend. Green was available to Baltimore-area reporters Sunday for the first time since the Ravens drafted the edge rusher in the second round the previous week. The allegations that likely hurt his draft stock were, as expected, a significant topic. Every team asked me, and Ive been completely open about everything, Green said. Its something that I had to go through, and I got through it. Green played at Virginia and then at Marshall. He said at the NFL scouting combine that he transferred after being accused of sexual assault for a second time. Green told reporters at the combine that he also was accused of sexual assault in high school. He said he was never charged and insisted he did nothing wrong. He was asked Sunday how he ended up facing two separate allegations. Im just focused right now on moving forward with my career at the Ravens, he said. Im blessed to be here. Its an honor. The Ravens said after drafting Green that they did their due diligence on him. Baltimore also drafted kicker Tyler Loop in the sixth round, underscoring how uncertain Justin Tuckers future is. The Baltimore Banner has reported that over a dozen massage therapists have accused Tucker of inappropriate sexual behavior. The NFL has said it would investigate. 
        
     Tucker has maintained he did not act inappropriately while receiving professional bodywork treatment. From the standpoint of the investigation and all that, we dont know anything. We havent been given any information  as it should be. Its all done the way its done, coach John Harbaugh said. So you cant make any decisions based on that. Every decision we make has to be based on football. Theres a lot of layers to that, Harbaugh continued. Youve got a rookie kicker in here. You took him in the sixth round, early in the sixth round. Hes a talented guy. Just from a football standpoint  salary cap, all the different things that you just take into consideration  whatever we decide to do over the next few weeks will be based on football. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-ravens-mike-green-justin-tucker-7d9e7a48ffe46c65ab58c18b56163cfe,sports
"Washington to host the 2027 NFL draft on the National Mall, President Donald Trump says","WASHINGTON (AP)  The 2027 NFL draft is heading to the nations capital on the National Mall, President Donald Trump said Monday, bringing the widely popular event back to Washington for the first time in more than eight decades. After word of Washington getting the draft two years from now surfaced Sunday night, Trump made the formal announcement in the Oval Office flanked by Commissioner Roger Goodell, Commanders controlling owner Josh Harris and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.  I dont think theres ever been anything like that, Trump said. Its going to be beautiful. Its going to be something that nobody else will ever be able to duplicate that, I dont suspect. Its very exciting. It is the latest off-field victory for the Commanders, who a week ago reached an agreement with the D.C. government to build a new home on the old RFK Stadium site, pending council approval. Trump also endorsed that plan in his remarks, saying, I dont think there is a better site anywhere in the world. Under former owner Dan Snyder, the team previously tried multiple times to land the draft and was unsuccessful. Now, itll happen behind the teams new Harris-led ownership group, which bought the Commanders from Snyder in 2023. What a great day for Washington, Harris said. I believe well get over a million people, and its going to be an amazing day and itll showcase what Washingtons all about. 
        
     Washington last hosted the draft in 1941 at the Willard Hotel. We believe in investing in sports because they have helped us transform neighborhoods, and the NFL bringing this event to the nations capital will help us fill hotel rooms, our restaurants, Bowser said. Americans from all 50 states will come to their nations capital and enjoy our beautiful city and museums. Green Bay, the NFLs smallest market, hosted the most recent draft in late April outside historic Lambeau Field. The NFL announced a crowd of 600,000 fans attended over the three days. The draft has really become one of the great entertainment and sports events, Goodell said, trumpeting the popularity of the draft in recent years. It will not just be an event. It will be something that will show the world how far the nations capital has come and where its going. The NFL draft used to be a fixture at Radio City Music Hall in New York and has become an even bigger hit since it hit the road in 2015. Chicago hosted the draft in 2015 and 16. Philadelphia had it in 17, followed by Dallas and Nashville.  Goodell announced the picks from his house in 2020 during the pandemic. It went to Cleveland in 2021 followed by Las Vegas, Kansas City and Detroit. A record crowd of 750,000 attended Detroits draft in 2024. Pittsburgh will host next year. The draft in Washington in 27 will mark the third anniversary of the franchise-altering selection of quarterback Jayden Daniels with the second pick. The Commanders made the playoffs and reached the NFC championship game in Daniels rookie year and look to be a Super Bowl contender for years to come. I have to say that Josh had a very good draft a short while ago, Trump said. You have a very good quarterback  a great quarterback, I think. Success on the field under Harris-hired general manager Adam Peters and coach Dan Quinn has made Washington a premier market again, decades after the organizations glory days that included three Super Bowl championships.  After the news conference last week unveiling plans to build a 65,000-seat stadium, Goodell said the turnaround from losing to winning is immeasurable in so many ways. This market is obviously critical, Goodell said. To be able to have a franchise here that everybody here is proud of thats gotten back on the football field in a positive way and now to have a stadium that brings their team back into D.C., I think thats a really big step and something thats going to be great for the NFL, too. ___ AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed from Tampa, Florida.  ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/nfl-draft-commanders-trump-15860d4e1d55f9bc8428d75e9dda0d44,sports
Well-traveled WR Dionate Johnsons tour of the AFC North makes another stop in Cleveland,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Diontae Johnson is making another stop in the AFC North. The well-traveled wide receiver signed a one-year deal with Cleveland on Monday. The Browns are Johnsons third stop within the division in the last 14 months. Johnson spent the first five seasons of his career in Pittsburgh, where he was a Pro Bowler in 2021. He was traded to Carolina in March 2024 before being sent to Baltimore in the middle of last season. Johnson played in just four games with the Ravens before being released and signing with Houston, where he appeared in a single game. The 28-year-old Johnson had career lows in receptions (33) and yards (375) in 2024. He joins a Browns team that has a crowded quarterback room that includes Kenny Pickett  a former teammate of Johnsons in Pittsburgh  as well as veteran Joe Flacco and rookies Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/cleveland-browns-diontae-johnson-bd5ebcdec55f85b3be2117c6b38ff657,sports
LA Kings president expects coach Jim Hiller to remain in charge after GM Blakes replacement hired,"EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP)  Los Angeles Kings president Luc Robitaille expects coach Jim Hiller to remain in charge after the team selects its new general manager. Robitaille expressed strong support for Hiller on Tuesday, one day after GM Rob Blake and the Kings mutually agreed to end Blakes eight-year tenure. Your general manager, you want to give him the freedom, you dont want to lock up a new person thats coming in, but the record of what Jimmy has done this year is really, really good, Robitaille said at the Kings training complex. It would be really hard for any GM to say, Well, this guy shouldnt come back. Hes been really good. I think Jimmys a great coach, and I fully think that this guy is coming back, for sure. Hiller has been in charge of the Kings bench since February 2024, when the former assistant took over for the fired Todd McLellan. The Kings are 69-37-10 in Hillers first job as an NHL head coach, and they matched franchise records with 48 victories and 105 points this season before losing to Edmonton in the first round for the fourth consecutive postseason. Robitaille emphasized that the new GM would have the final say on the coaching staff, but the longtime team president reiterated his overall happiness with the state of the Kings roster, their coaching staff and even their style of play despite their repeated playoff disappointments. Robitaille made it clear that Blake supported the decision to seek new team leadership. Robitaille plans to hire a general manager who can provide a fresh perspective on how to change a talent-filled roster that cant get it done in the postseason. 
        
     Blakey and I have been talking about it for probably a year, Robitaille said. He always said he wanted to wait to sign (a contract extension). Im not going to get into detail about our conversation, but its something we talked about ... and we both agreed this was better for the franchise. The former Kings teammates agreed that it was time to probably bring a new voice just to get us to that next level, Robitaille added. Los Angeles hasnt won a playoff series since raising the Stanley Cup in 2014, and the Oilers have bounced the Kings in four straight springs. Los Angeles has won only eight total games in those four first-round series, and Hillers club lost its final four in a row last week after winning the first two at home. Robitaille didnt sound close to hiring Blakes replacement. He plans to examine multiple candidates, including Marc Bergevin, the former Montreal GM who was a senior adviser to Blake for the past 3 1/2 years. Robitaille isnt waiting until he hires a new GM to begin preparations for next season. Working with assistant general manager Nelson Emerson, Robitaille has already spoken to pending unrestricted free agents Andrei Kuzmenko and Vladislav Gavrikov, who both played significant roles in Los Angeles late-season success. When asked what he sought in a replacement for a general manager of a team coming off one of the best regular seasons in franchise history, Robitaille emphasized the importance of evaluating the Kings roster with fresh eyes. We had a good year ... but its sports, and you want to win the last game of the season, Robitaille said. Thats our goal. Robitaille doesnt necessarily want to see the Kings abandon their regimented, defense-oriented style of play under McLellan and Hiller, however. Fans often criticize Los Angeles style as old-fashioned and not offense-forward, but Robitaille offered a passionate defense of a team that stopped relying so heavily on the neutral-zone trap this season and finished 14th in the NHL in goals scored (249). We had three of the best lines in hockey, Robitaille said. We scored goals. We had a 40% power play (at the end of the season). We felt like we needed to tweak our power play, and credit to our guys, they figured it out. Some teams have a 60-goal scorer. We dont, but we have a lot of guys that can score goals. We play hard. We forecheck. We dont sit back. ... We want to push. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/kings-nhl-blake-hiller-robitaille-d72ce1b3b907cf61be0c988e72decfeb,sports
Jaccob Slavin scores in OT as the Hurricanes beat the Capitals in Game 1 of their 2nd-round series,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Very few people in the arena knew the puck was in the net, including Jaccob Slavin, who shot it through traffic. Goaltender Logan Thompson figured it out when he saw the red light on behind him. I didnt know it went in until I saw Jordan Staal, Staalsy, coming with his arms up yelling at me, Slavin said. Seeing it to believe it, Slavins overtime goal gave the Carolina Hurricanes a 2-1 victory at the Washington Capitals in Game 1 of their second-round series on Tuesday night. The winner came on their 94th attempt and 33rd that got on net, showing the shot volume offense that has gotten them to this point. We were all over it, and we knew we had to just throw everything at the net, Slavin said. That mentality paid off there at the end. Carolina allowed Washington to get just 14 shots on goal, the second-fewest in Hartford Whalers/Hurricanes history. Frederik Andersen gave up just an early second-period goal to Aliaksei Protas in his return from missing the end of the first round because of injury. Just trying to take what comes my way and be in that moment all the time and just stay with it, Andersen said. You dont know when that next big saves going to happen. Thompson made 31 of them for the Capitals, who spent large swaths of time defending in their own end. That sucked a lot of the energy out of the top seed in the Eastern Conference, which is accustomed to putting on the pressure rather than absorbing it. 
        
     We didnt play our style of hockey, Washingtons Dylan Strome said. We let them dictate. The Capitals led from Protas goal until nearly the midway point of the third, when an errant pass from Protas banked off teammate Alex Alexeyevs right skate and to Jesperi Kotkaniemi, who fed Logan Stankoven to tie it. I just thought Id rip it, Stankoven said. It was nice to see it go in. Carolina remains the only team perfect on the penalty kill this postseason, keeping Washingtons power play off the board twice to improve to 17 of 17. That, along with Kotkaniemi and Stankoven taking advantage of a mistake and Slavin scoring with Seth Jarvis screening Thompson was the difference. We got some traffic, coach Rod BrindAmour said. Obviously, it wasnt the greatest of goals, but they all count. Game 2 is Thursday night in Washington before the series shifts to Raleigh, North Carolina, for 3 and 4. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-capitals-score-nhl-playoffs-cf3a91e770ad093adec0deb215ab3476,sports
Frederik Andersen returns from missing end of 1st round to help Hurricanes beat Capitals in Game 1,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Frederik Andersen had no choice but to sit and watch his Carolina Hurricanes teammates clinch their first-round series victory and move on in the NHL playoffs. A week later, he was back in net and delivered the kind of quality goaltending theyve gotten from him whenever he has been healthy. Andersen stopped 13 of the 14 shots he faced as the Hurricanes beat the Washington Capitals 2-1 in overtime in Game 1 of their second-round series. Just really been looking forward to this for a while, Andersen said. Happy we could start off on the right foot. Andersen was Carolinas starter to begin the postseason and turned aside 88 of 94 shots before getting injured when New Jersey forward Timo Meier barreled into him in the second period of Game 4 last round. He gave way to backup Pyotr Kotchekov, who finished the job that night and did enough to advance with an overtime victory in Game 5. Extra time off allowed Andersen, a 35-year-old Dane in his 12th season in the league, to heal up. He was not tested much in the opener at Washington, but even the lack of action he had made it more challenging for a veteran coming off a long layoff.  Well thats tough  it seems easy, coach Rod BrindAmour said. Hes been here long enough (to know) you got to stay focused. And I thought he did a good job. The Hurricanes pummeled the Capitals with 94 shots attempts: 33 that got on net  two of which went in past Logan Thompson  and 36 that got blocked before reaching him. After Logan Stankoven tied it midway through the third period, Andersen took space away on Ryan Leonards breakaway with just under six minutes, a play that did not count as a save but contributed to sending the game to overtime. 
        
     You could tell he was on it, BrindAmour said. That was a huge one for us. Carolina has been used to playing without Andersen, who missed half of 2023-24 getting treatment for blood clots and was out for a few months this season after knee surgery. But the organization showed how important Andersen is, signing him between rounds to a contract for next season, one that could see him earn up to $3.5 million. In his first game since getting that deal, Andersen rewarded the Hurricanes by making the saves he needed to make to give them a series led. Hes huge for us, Stankoven said. Were trying at the other end to create offense, and when we do give up chances or there are breakdowns, hes there for us. And hes been great all playoffs for us, so were going to need him to keep playing like that. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/frederik-andersen-carolina-hurricanes-capitals-553e8b1b5d209218d1f7844f97b4846c,sports
Torkelsons double in the 10th lifts Tigers to 8-6 win over struggling Rockies,"DENVER (AP)  Spencer Torkelson hit a go-ahead double in the 10th inning and the Detroit Tigers beat the stumbling Colorado Rockies 8-6 on Wednesday night to give A.J. Hinch his 900th win as a big league manager. Torkelson hit a liner to right-center off Zach Agnos (0-1) that brought in Riley Greene, who began at second base under baseballs extra-innings rule. Trey Sweeney added another run when left fielder Jordan Beck couldnt snare his two-out blooper that was changed from a double to an error on Beck. Will Vest (2-0) pitched out of a ninth-inning jam by striking out pinch hitter Kyle Farmer. He got Adael Amador to fly out in the 10th to end the game. Javier Bez hit a pair of two-run singles to help make it a milestone night for Hinch, who became the 75th major league manager to reach 900 wins.  The Rockies dropped to a major league worst 6-29, tied for the second-worst record through 35 games in the live-ball era that began in 1920. They trail the 1988 Baltimore Orioles, who opened at 5-30. The Rockies Ryan McMahon finished with four hits, including two doubles and a two-run homer. Michael Toglia added two doubles and a two-run homer.  Both starters were knocked out of the game early. Detroits Jackson Jobe gave up six runs in 3 2/3 innings, while Colorados Chase Dollander surrendered six runs over three innings. Tommy Kahnle worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth.  
        
     The path doesnt get any easier for the Rockies, who are in the thick of playing 29 straight games against teams above .500. They wont face another team below .500 until Miami on June 2-4. The Tigers and Rockies will play a doubleheader Thursday. In the first game, the Tigers will throw right-hander Casey Mize (5-1, 2.70 ERA) while the Rockies go with lefty Kyle Freeland (0-4, 5.70).  ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/tigers-rockies-score-b91e4e2f7ecd9f50696d28b9c187fb9a,sports
Jorge Solers 3-run double in the 9th inning gives Angels 5-4 win over Blue Jays,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Jorge Soler lined a double into the left-field corner with the bases loaded to drive in three runs in the ninth inning and lift the Los Angeles Angels to a 5-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday night. Trailing 4-2, the Angels loaded the bases with no outs against Blue Jays closer Jeff Hoffman (3-1) when Kyren Paris drew a four-pitch walk and Zach Neto and Nolan Schanuel singled. Hoffman struck out Taylor Ward for the first out, but Soler drove a ball that rolled into the corner and past left fielder Jonatan Clase for the comeback win. The Blue Jays opened the seventh with five straight hits, including Myles Straws go-ahead RBI single and Bo Bichettes two-run single, to take a 4-1 lead.  Toronto starter Jos Berros gave up two runs  solo homers by Paris and Yoan Moncada  and five hits in six innings, striking out nine, walking five and inducing 18 swinging strikes. Angels starter Yusei Kikuchi gave up one run and five hits in six innings. Brock Burke (3-0), Los Angeles fifth pitcher, got the win with one scoreless inning. With the score tied at 1, Ernie Clement opened the seventh with a double off Reid Detmers. Andrs Gimnez beat out a sacrifice bunt for a single and Straw singled home Clement to give Toronto a 2-1 lead. Bichette singled in two runs to make it 4-1.  Paris homered in the seventh off Berros to pull the Angels within 4-2. 
        
     With two on and one out in the eighth, Moncada made a diving backhand stop of Straws grounder down the third-base line, got up, stepped on the bag and threw to first to complete an inning-ending double play and preserve a 4-2 deficit. The Angels have allowed nine bunt hits this season, tied with Miami for the most in the majors.

"Warriors sideline Curry for at least a week with hamstring strain, putting rest of series in flux","MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Golden State Warriors are planning to play without Stephen Curry for at least the next three games of their second-round series against Minnesota, after an MRI exam on Wednesday confirmed a mild strain of the star guards left hamstring. The Warriors said Curry would be sidelined at least a week after the injury on Tuesday night forced him out early in the second quarter of Game 1, which they went on to win 99-88. He had 13 points in 13 minutes to help Golden State build a comfortable lead and take home-court advantage away from the Timberwolves. Every year the playoffs are about adapting, whether its a game plan or an injury or a lineup, so we just have to adapt, coach Steve Kerr said. Weve done this before, and were confident we can do this again. Game 2 is in Minneapolis on Thursday, before the series moves west to San Francisco for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday. The earliest return for Curry appears to be Game 5 on May 14, which is conveniently followed by three straight off days before Game 6 on May 18. Curry has never had a significant hamstring injury in his career, creating yet more mystery around the length of this absence and whether the Warriors can tread water long enough without the all-time leading 3-point shooter in NBA history to get him back near the end of the series. Theyd be unwise to bank on that, though. We think we have the best defense in the league, and thats been proven over the last couple of months, Kerr said. 
        
     Curry missed multiple games because of injuries during the 2016 and 2018 playoffs, absences the Warriors adeptly endured on their way to the NBA Finals in both scenarios. They lost to Cleveland in seven games for the 2016 championship, and they swept the Cavaliers in 2018 for a third title in four years. Without Curry during those two postseason runs, they went 9-3. This Golden State roster hardly stacks up to those predecessors, however, when Curry and Draymond Green were much younger and other standouts like Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala were integral to their success. By 2018, they had Kevin Durant, too. For now, the Warriors were feeling good about the all-hands-on-deck effort led by Jimmy Butler, Buddy Hield and Green in Game 1, in which Kerr used 12 different players. Without Curry, the ball will go through Butler on most possessions, as it did on Tuesday. The six-time All-Star, whose acquisition in a trade with Miami three months ago helped spark and solidify the Warriors on both offense and defense, had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists in Game 1. He scored 20 or more points in four of the five full games he played in the first round against Houston. Everybody is live. Everybody who comes into the game is looking to make plays, Timberwolves guard Mike Conley said. So you have to be almost even more so locked in on the game and who youre matched up with and the tendencies. Because theyre not looking for just Curry. Obviously, Buddy is going to be more aggressive, Jimmy is going to be more aggressive, but theyve got guys who can put the ball in the hole, and they may try to do that collectively as a group. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-curry-injury-7ff9bd8b9e6b0f4215577e5c540c52aa,sports

"With WNBA camps open, eyes already turning to 2026 free agency with so many players possibly moving","NEW YORK (AP)  WNBA training camps just opened and there already are so many eyes on the 2026 season when more than 100 players will be free agents. Nearly all of the leagues top players could be on the move, including 20 of last seasons All-Stars. Its a fact that the majority of veterans will be unrestricted free agents after this season based on current contracts. Its unclear if that will equate to a ton of player movement, Atlanta Dream general manager Dan Padover said. But everything is set up that it could be the most player movement in WNBA history. I think every franchise is looking at it differently. Our most important priority is taking care of our Dream players in 2025 and beyond. Though teams and players say the focus now is winning a championship in 2025, the uncertainty of what beyond looks like is keeping front office staff around the league up at night. Everything can change. Its kind of fascinating. we wont really know what the gameboard looks like until we get the new CBA, ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said. Any team could theoretically become a super team. It could be Golden State, it could Toronto or Portland in their first year. It could completely change the power dynamic as we see it. Aja Wilson and Breanna Stewart are among the star-studded group on one-year contracts knowing that a new collective bargaining agreement will hopefully be in place next season that is expected to monumentally increase salaries. The WNBA begins an 11-year $2.2 billion media rights deal in 2026 which is where the shift will come from. 
        
     Most of the players who wont be free agents are the ones on rookie contracts  including Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The pair, who were rookies last season, earn about $75,000 in base pay. Currently WNBA players can have a maximum base salary of $250,000. While there hasnt been a media rights deal like this in the WNBAs 28-year history, when the NBA had an exponential increase in its TV deal in 2016, that leagues salary cap increased about 35%. Its not just increased salaries, however, that will entice free agents to move. Many of the players who changed teams this offseason cited practice facilities as a factor in choosing where theyll go. Currently Phoenix, Las Vegas, Golden State and Seattle have dedicated practice facilities for their WNBA teams while Minnesota and Washington share their facilities with NBA franchises. New York, Dallas, Chicago and Indiana have ones in the works. I think facilities are a huge piece of it, Lobo said. You heard how much players talked about that with Vegas a few years ago. Players were posting about Phoenixs new facility at All-Star last year. Its also about the culture around a franchise that makes it inviting to players. Atlanta made a splash in free agency this winter, signing Brittney Griner and Brionna Jones. Padover hopes to keep them beyond this season. Both will be free agents again next year. Free agency has never lined up like this before for the league. While New York, Las Vegas, Minnesota and Indiana are considered the top teams heading into this season, that could all be different next year.  ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-free-agency-2026-aa8db44f7cbb3b6db7cc194535b89d93,sports
Oilers rally for NHL-record fifth straight time to beat Golden Knights 4-2 in Game 1,"LAS VEGAS (AP)  One thing is becoming clear during this years NHL playoffs: Dont count out the Edmonton Oilers. They rallied from a 2-0 series deficit to oust Los Angeles in six games in the first round. Then they opened the second round Tuesday night by setting a league record with their fifth consecutive playoff comeback victory in a single postseason. Zach Hyman scored from just above the right circle with 3:02 left to put Edmonton ahead for good in its 4-2 victory over Vegas Golden Knights after falling behind 2-0. Thats part of having a mature, older group, Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. Players have seen a lot, a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. In the playoffs, things fluctuate. Theres a lot of things that can stress out the team. No matter what happens, I think we handled it really well tonight. Vegas, which had just seven shots on goal over the final two periods, lost a playoff game in regulation after leading by at least two goals for the first time. The Golden Knights are 47-4 overall in the postseason with that kind of lead. Game 2 is Thursday night in Las Vegas. Well go over it and get ready for Thursday nights game, said Mark Stone, who scored both Vegas goals. Its going to be a big one for us. Leon Draisaitl had a goal and an assist for the Oilers, and Corey Perry and Connor Brown scored the other goals. Evan Bouchard and Connor McDavid each had two assists. McDavid now has four consecutive postseasons with at least 10 assists for fourth-best in league history. Calvin Pickard was barely tested after the first period and finished with 15 shots. 
        
     We have experience to win games in a lot of different ways, a lot of untraditional ways, Hyman said. Any time you get a win, its a big day. Weve got to take what we did in the second and third and do in the first. Stone tied Jonathan Marchessaults franchise record with 36 goals for his Vegas career. He also extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. Adin Hill made 24 saves. Both star-studded top lines delivered in the first period, with Stone scoring twice, the first on a double-minor power play. Edmontons top unit cut the deficit in half with 3:34 left when Perry deked Hill for an open net with McDavid and Draisaitl getting assists on the play. Neither team scored in the second period even though the Oilers outshot Vegas 12-1. The Golden Knights had never been held to fewer than two shots on goal in a regulation playoff period. Edmonton didnt waste a chance early in the third, tying the score 57 seconds in when Draisaitl backhanded a shot off the boards and off Hill. Hyman, who earlier in the shift took a stick to the face from Kaedan Korczak, broke the tie in the closing minutes, and Brown sealed the win 1:16 later. Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo did not play because of an illness, allowing Korczak to make his first career postseason start. Vegas also was without Pavel Dorofeyev, who led the team with 35 goals this season, for the second game in a row because of an undisclosed injury. Coach Bruce Cassidy has descibed him as day to day. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/oilers-golden-knights-score-nhl-playoffs-9741061ec6e71f1be1574c1b1b26d1d4,sports
Utah Mammoth is the permanent name of the NHL team in Salt Lake City,"After a mammoth undertaking of buying an NHL team, moving players, coaches and a full staff more than 600 miles and getting it all together in a matter of months before the puck dropped on a new season, it is perhaps a fitting identity that owners Ryan and Ashley Smith chose after rounds and rounds of fan voting. They unveiled Utah Mammoth as the franchises permanent, full-time name Wednesday, with a profiled logo of the ice age creature featuring nods to the shape of the state, its mountain range and the same light blue, black and white color scheme that quickly became synonymous with the team in its first season in Salt Lake City. Our fans made it very easy for us, Ryan Smith said at a news conference at Delta Center celebrating the branding efforts competition after more than 850,000 votes were cast over the past 13 months. Every single night we were doing the voting, Mammoth just started running away with it. ... And for us, it was like, Thats it. Mammoth replaces the 2024-25 placeholder name Utah Hockey Club, which was also one of the three finalists. Yeti was taken out of consideration when the cooler company bearing that name could not come to a copyright agreement with Utah ownership, and Wasatch  a reference to the states mountain range  was quickly replaced as an option by Outlaws. The Mammoth are maintaining the road jerseys with UTAH diagonally down the front. The logo, along with mountains and a hidden M and more of what Smith called Easter eggs, also has a curved tusk that forms a U. 
        
     Mammoth fossils have been found throughout Utah, including a complete skeleton in Huntington Canyon in 1988. The team said Tusks Up will be its rallying cry. We uncovered a little bit of the mammoth history in this state, Smith said. It was daunting  of how close and tied and whether it was Lake Bonneville or Fairview, Utah, or Lake Powell and the size of the mammoth and how fast they go, it became like this really cool thing. Utah has an exciting summer ahead holding the fourth pick in the draft, the first phase of arena renovations taking place and more than $20 million in salary cap space for general manager Bill Armstrong to make a splash in free agency and trades. With young talent like captain Clayton Keller, budding star forward Logan Cooley, two-time Stanley Cup champion Mikhail Sergachev and emerging goaltender Karel Vejmelka, the Mammoth could contend for a playoff spot as soon as next season. Sitting next to Commissioner Gary Bettman, Ashley Smith said the goal was to bring him back with more to celebrate. Next time, Stanley Cup, she told Bettman, who responded, It would be my pleasure. Bettman, who turns 73 in July, added, When you win the Stanley Cup, I hope Im still doing this to present it. Hockey in Utah has already been a win after Smith Entertainment Group bought the team previously known as the Arizona Coyotes from former owner Alex Meruelo and moved it to Salt Lake City. The Coyotes played in the Phoenix area since 1996 after moving there from Winnipeg, where the team was the original Jets. The first year has been almost mind-blowing in terms of how successful Utah and you and everybody in SEG has been, Bettman said. This has been the ultimate team effort for the ultimate team sport. And while you may be thrilled to have us, were thrilled to be part of Utah and are grateful. The rollout of Mammoth even included a fan holding a Stanley cup  lower-case C  Yeti coolers biggest competition in that market. In the midst of a formative day in the organizations history, Ryan Smith almost seemed to want to manifest another one sometime in the future, not for a mug but the sports most hallowed trophy. When we etch Utah Mammoth in Lord Stanleys Cup, he said, thatll be a good one. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/utah-mammoth-name-nhl-31aa2fa9d1cbb825ba5e0b61815e58de,sports
Buffalo Sabres hire former NHLer Eric Staal as special assistant to general manager Kevyn Adams,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)  Former NHL forward Eric Staal is rejoining the Buffalo Sabres, this time in a front-office role as special assistant to general manager Kevyn Adams, the team announced Wednesday. Staal will be involved in all aspects of the hockey department in the newly created role, which comes after Sabres executives completed end-of-season meetings with owner Terry Pegula. The 40-year-old, who retired after 18 NHL seasons two years ago, joins a front office that features three assistant GMs in Jason Karmanos, Mark Jakubowski and Jerry Forton. Staal is reunited with Adams, who were teammates on the 2006 Carolina Hurricanes Stanley Cup-winning team. And he played 32 games for the Sabres in 2021 before being traded to Montreal. As I looked for ways to enhance our existing staff, I wanted to add somebody to our group that has a fresh perspective and the direct experience of winning at all levels of hockey, Adams said of Staal, who also won an Olympic gold medal in 2010 and world championship in 2007 representing Canada. He has done it all as a player and I know his experience and knowledge will be invaluable to our team as we look to take the next step. Staals hiring comes as Adams faces increasing criticism over his five-year tenure as GM, in which the Sabres extended their NHL-record playoff drought to 14 seasons. One of four players to have his number retired by the Hurricanes, Staal spent 12 seasons playing for Carolina in a career that also included stops with the New York Rangers, Minnesota and Florida. Throughout my career I was fortunate to be on so many successful teams and I hope I can lean on some of those experiences to help the organization moving forward, Staal said. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/sabres-eric-staal-b1b110126c5c7d5fd0e99b4c4a84b7ca,sports
Maple Leafs goaltender Joseph Woll gets chance against Panthers amid concerns about Stolarz,"TORONTO (AP)  Joseph Woll is back under the postseason spotlight, a place the Toronto Maple Leafs goalie has thrived in the past. Woll was given the start for Game 2 of the teams second-round Stanley Cup playoff series against Florida on Wednesday night and finished with 25 saves in the Maple Leafs 4-3 win for a 2-0 series lead.  The 26-year-old Woll entered the opener midway through the second period after starter Anthony Stolarz took an elbow to the head from former teammate Sam Bennett and wound up at the hospital. On Wednesday, Woll made his first start since April 17. Its been something Ive had to focus on and come up with a plan to stay ready, Woll said. Its a different challenge than playing every night, but a challenge nonetheless. Woll, who entered with a .950 save percentage in his four previous playoff starts, also performed well when called upon in both the 2023 and 2024 postseasons because of injury. Calm and cool, Maple Leafs coach Craig Berube said. On his toes and fighting through traffic. Very impressed. Veteran Matt Murray, who spent most of this season in the American Hockey League, served as Wolls backup over Dennis Hildeby. The rookie was on the bench in the third period of Game 1. Experience, I think, more than anything, Berube said of turning to Murray, a two-time Cup winner with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Hes been there, done it. 
        
     The Maple Leafs have not disclosed details of Stolarzs injury, though Berube said the 31-year-old is recovering and doing well.  Chris Nowinski, chief executive officer of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, said he was concerned with how the situation was handled at Scotiabank Arena. Stolarz was hit in the head twice where he exhibited possible signs of concussion and neither time was he removed and assessed, Nowinski told the Canadian Press. I cant remember the last time I saw a player vomiting on the ice, but it makes you very concerned about what was happening in his brain and whether (he) not only had a concussion, but a possible brain bleed. Stolarzs mask came off in the first period of Torontos 5-4 victory when he stopped a shot by Sam Reinhart. Stolarz appeared to shake his head before putting the mask back on and resuming play. In the second period, he was elbowed in the head as Bennett skated through the crease. Stolarz immediately grabbed his head as he fell to the ice. He later leaned over the boards and vomited into a bucket. He left the game midway through the period and was replaced by Woll. According to the NHL/NHLPAs concussion protocol, the identification and removal of a player is a club-level responsibility. The actual diagnosis and whether to play is up to the team doctor. League spotters also observe players behavior during games to help. A Maple Leafs team spokesman said spotters were not involved in Stolarzs departure from the game.  Nowinski said he was concerned about the head shake by Stolarz; he said research has shown many athletes who do that end up having a concussion. The fact that he was left out there (to) vomit in front of the entire world shows that the NHL was not conservative enough in their decision of how to execute their protocol, he told CP. Woll was solid off the bench and held off the Panthers late, stopping 17 of 20 shots as Florida rallied after trailing 4-1 through 40 minutes. The Panthers got defenseman Aaron Ekblad back after he served a two-game suspension for a head shot on Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brandon Hagel in the first round. I was aiming for his chest and I caught him in the chin, Ekblad said in his first comments since the incident that knocked Hagel out of the series. Im never out to hurt anybody on the ice. Its unfortunate the way that the outcome happened. The 29-year-old Ekblad was selected No. 1 overall at the 2014 draft had recently returned after getting suspended 20 games for violating league policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Ekblad returned for Game 3 of the Tampa series before the Hagel incident in Game 4. Whirlwind of a season, he said. Its not the way I scripted it, but were here now. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/toronto-maple-leafs-goalie-joseph-woll-b400590cd9c7aac63056ce324bbe41e4,sports
Warriors will rely on the Jimmy-Buddy show to help stay afloat vs. Wolves with Curry out,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  With the superhero of the Golden State Warriors out for the rest of the game, the sidekicks stepped up.  Jimmy Butler and Buddy Hield have become quite the sideshow, on and off the court. When Stephen Curry went down with a strained left hamstring early in the opener of this second-round series against Minnesota, Butler and Hield delivered the both-ends-of-the-floor production necessary to fend off the Timberwolves for a 99-88 victory. Im Batman. I saved the day, Hield said. Hes still Robin. Butler was willing to concede that interim role to Hield with Curry out, but not without reminding Hield the Warriors had to burn a timeout in the first minute of the game because the shorts he was wearing didnt match the team uniform. Thats not real Robin and/or Batman like, Butler said, turning to Hield as they shared a table for their joint postgame interview. Butler pitched in 20 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and sound defense. Hield hit five 3-pointers among his 24 points to go with eight rebounds and no turnovers for a team-leading plus-22 rating. Both of them will have to keep that up now that the Warriors have ruled Curry out for at least the next three games. Two of the newest players to the team have also developed a unique odd-couple bond, with Butler constantly needling the softer-spoken Hield with his wry sense of humor. They clearly get on each others nerves at times, to the point of shouting at each other in one of the huddles during a timeout on Tuesday.  
        
     Since Butler arrived in a trade with Miami, the Warriors are 29-11. Hield was acquired from Philadelphia last summer.  They have an incredible relationship. Yall dont get to see everything, but theres times where they really go at it. Thats just the nature of the game we play, teammate Draymond Green said. They have a great dynamic, both of them playing great basketball for us. The Warriors, who were the last team to advance to the second round after finally beating second-seeded Houston in that seven-game series on Sunday, took a much-needed day off on Wednesday. Theyll need to bring their intensity back for Game 2 on Thursday, when the Wolves are bound to be fired up from the way they flailed through Game 1. Coach Chris Finch sounded irritated on Wednesday for a number of reasons, including what he described as football-like contact by the Warriors against Rudy Gobert that went uncalled and prevented the big man from grabbing several rebounds. The Wolves sent in multiple video clips to the league to plead their case.  They look like pulling guards and linemen out there just taking shots at Rudy, Finch said. Warriors center Kevon Looney was one of those guys jockeying for position in the paint with the 7-foot-1 Gobert. Last series, I feel like was way worse than anything I did last game, Looney said, recalling the physical tone of the first round against the Rockets as he smiled. Its the playoffs. Im going to grab and push until they call it. Not to be outdone by Finchs gamesmanship, Warriors coach Steve Kerr offered his own measured take on the officiating. I think they couldve called a foul six, seven straight possessions with them guarding Steph, so Ive got my complaints, too, Kerr said. Trust me, we all do, and this is how it works in the playoffs. The Timberwolves had practice after a sobering film session for admonishment and dissection of the many deficiencies that were on display throughout the previous night. Finch was particularly pointed in his commentary, starting with star Anthony Edwards for his decision-making with the ball and adrift first-half performance. We didnt look at all like ourselves. The game plan discipline was really poor, Finch said. Our resiliency was poor. Physicality was also poor. Edwards had 22 of his 23 points in the second half after missing his first 10 shots from the floor. The fifth-year guard, who moved into second place on the franchises career list for postseason games played behind Kevin Garnett, has never shied from constructive criticism. Were lucky. Our guys will take it, Finch said. If you want the ball in your hands or you want to be in the center of the action or you want to be playing all the minutes, then youre going to be on that film. When/Where to Watch: Game 2, 8:30 p.m. EDT (TNT) Series: Warriors lead 1-0. BetMGM says: Timberwolves by 10.5. What to Know: Including their series-clinching win over the Los Angeles Lakers a week ago, the Wolves have missed 64 of their last 76 attempts from 3-point range over the last two games. Just keep shooting. Thats the name of the game, Edwards said. We cant worry about the last shot. Take the next one and shoot it with confidence. The Warriors had a 51-41 edge in rebounding in Game 1.  ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-timberwolves-curry-edwards-butler-9a918ce85399e09b637e5151bf2cdba9,sports
Thunder set NBA playoff record for first-half points with 87 vs. Denver in Game 2 of West semis,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  The Oklahoma City Thunder set an NBA playoff record for first-half points with 87 against the Denver Nuggets in Game 2 of their Western Conference semifinal series Wednesday night. Oklahoma City surpassed the previous record of 86 set by the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Golden State Warriors in Game 4 of the NBA Finals on June 9, 2017. Chet Holmgren, who missed two critical free throws late in Game 1, made a pair with a second remaining to set the record. The Thunder tied the record for points in any half of a playoff game on their way to a 149-106 win. Milwaukee had 87 in the second half against Denver on April 23, 1978. The Thunder shot 58.8% from the field and made 17 of 18 free throws to take an 87-56 lead at the break. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the way with 18 points. All five Thunder starters scored in double figures in the first half. Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 34 points and eight assists in three quarters. Oklahoma City became the first team to post two wins by at least 40 points in a postseason. The Thunder rolled past Memphis 131-80 in Game 1 of their first-round series. This is a team that does that, Denver interim coach David Adelman said. Theres a reason why they have historic plus-minus numbers throughout the season as they put people away. So youve got to have a much better start than that. We cant come out like that. 
        
     It was a dramatic change from Denvers 121-119 victory in Game 1. Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said his team looked sharper and took advantage of having learned more about the Nuggets. I didnt really look at tonight as a response as much as I looked at tonight as just us being who we are, and thats how weve been all season, Daigneault said. We dont really respond to the last game. When we win, we dont have more confidence. When we lose, we dont have more urgency. I think this team has a really good baseline that we just try to return to every day when the sun comes up and we have a game. And I thought thats what tonight was. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/thunder-playoff-record-nuggets-bc52c74fff9f7a2048375600dd720278,sports
Fire alarm causes brief evacuation after Knicks Game 2 win over Celtics,"BOSTON (AP)  A fire alarm was triggered at TD Garden in the aftermath of the New York Knicks 91-90 playoff victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night, causing a brief evacuation. TD Garden officials released a statement late Wednesday saying that an alarm was tripped and that no one was injured. The cause of the alarm is under investigation, the statement said. Alarms began blaring while New Yorks Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart were still at the podium concluding a post game interview. Bostons Jaylen Brown had just completed his interview session in a separate room when officials directed members of the media toward the exits. Due to the evacuation, Jayson Tatums planned interview session was canceled.  New York leads the series 2-0. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/knicks-celtics-fire-alarm-7ea4a8cc3d84282460136479e62a6eb8,sports
Capitals and Golden Knights are the latest to blow leads this NHL playoffs and need to fix problems,"So far early in these NHL playoffs, 45 times a team has skated onto the ice for the third period with a lead. Nearly a third of those times that team lost the game. The Washington Capitals and Vegas Golden Knights lost their second-round series opener, becoming the 12th and 13th examples of that particular blown lead this postseason. The Capitals lost to Carolina in overtime and the Golden Knights fell to Edmonton in regulation.  Weve been good at getting leads and building leads in past playoff series, but the past is the past and the times now, Vegas center Jack Eichel said. You learn from some stuff thats happened. At the same time, we have to understand theyre not going to come in here and roll over, so our effort needs to be better. Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl dont know the meaning of roll over. Trailing 2-1, the Oilers outshot the Golden Knights 12-1 in the second period, then scored 57 seconds out of intermission on the way to winning 4-2. Washington led 1-0 midway through the third, when a turnover by Aliaksei Protas off the right skate of teammate Alex Alexeyev put the puck right on Jesperi Kotkaniemis stick. Quick pass to Logan Stankoven, who beat Logan Thompson, and the score was tied. Carolina finished it off three minutes into OT. Sure, it was a bad bounce, but the Capitals were 31-1-1 during the regular season when up after two periods.  
        
     You have to trust yourself and play within good D-zone structure for when those bad moments do happen because inevitably theyre going to happen in a series, center Nic Dowd said. Pucks are going to hit stanchions, theyre going hit toes of peoples skates  things like that are going to happen. But I trust that the five guys that are on the ice are always going to get the job done. That was a one-goal lead, and Washington was under siege most of Game 1. Vegas blew a two-goal advantage, ending a streak of winning 26 playoff games in a row when up by that margin or more. I dont think its anything that concerns us, said Reilly Smith, a member of the Knights 2023 Cup-winning team who was reacquired ahead of the trade deadline in March. Theres a lot thats correctable. I think we need to play faster and more direct, and I think it starts there. When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Thursday, 7 p.m. EDT (ESPN) Series: Hurricanes lead 1-0 What went wrong for the Capitals in the series-opening loss? Let coach Spencer Carbery count the ways. You can obviously go down 20 different alleys, Carbery said. Dowd referenced 94 twice as the number of shot attempts Carolina had in Game 1 compared with Washingtons 34. That explains just how much the ice was tilted toward Thompson. Theyre going to funnel a ton of pucks to the net, and eventually something bad will happen, Dowd said, referencing Jaccob Slavins overtime winner on a seemingly harmless shot from 65 feet out. You give them enough opportunities, something weird is bound to happen, just like it did. But all in all I dont think we played a very good game, so well obviously be looking to get back to what we do best. The silver lining for the Caps is they were one goal from stealing a game they had no business winning. Games 3 and 4 are on the road in Raleigh, where the Hurricanes get to control matchups  making this as close to a must-win as a Game 2 can realistically be. Were very, very short-term focused, so I dont even look at it as a series at this point right now, Carbery said. Our focus is: What do we need to adjust? What do we need to do tomorrow to have success on home ice and have our game look as close to possible what our game needs to look like this year and the level it has to be at  extremely high  to compete with a team like the Carolina Hurricanes? When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Thursday, 9:30 p.m. EDT (ESPN) Series: Oilers lead 1-0 Trailing in a playoff series is nothing new for the Golden Knights, who have shown a fortitude throughout their eight-year history to overcome early losses. No, I dont think were panicking, Eichel said. Its a seven-game series. Obviously, we didnt have our best (Tuesday) night and it cost us Game 1, but you learn from it and move on. The Golden Knights have won three consecutive series after losing the opener and are 4-2 in franchise history in such scenarios. They lost the first game to Winnipeg in both 2018 and 2023 on eventual trips to the Stanley Cup Final. In 2021, the Golden Knights dropped their first two games to Colorado before storming back to win in six. Vegas also has a series comeback just this year. The Golden Knights took Game 1 in the first round against Minnesota, lost the next two to trail 2-1, then won the next three to move on. Coach Bruce Cassidy anticipates a hungry opponent after the Oilers came one victory away from the Stanley Cup last season and not being satisfied with winning just one of the first two at Vegas. We cant be relying on (past comeback success), Cassidy said. Weve got to play better is what weve got to do. ___ AP Sports Writer Mark Anderson in Las Vegas contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-playoffs-second-round-d6d0cc5d0947ad7cde12795626d578a8,sports
Marner scores tiebreaking goal as Maple Leafs beat Panthers 4-3 for 2-0 series lead,"TORONTO (AP)  Mitch Marner has experienced a whirlwind stretch  both at home and the rink. Joseph Woll waited patiently and prepared for a chance he wasnt sure hed get. They both came through for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Game 2 of their second-round playoff series. Marner scored the tiebreaking goal in the third period and Woll made 25 saves in place of the injured Anthony Stolarz as the Maple Leafs beat the Florida Panthers 4-3 on Wednesday night to take a 2-0 series lead. A really exciting time in my house, said Marner, who became a father for the first time during the weekend. ""(And) pretty special feeling tonight. Woll was pressed into service after Stolarz exited midway through Mondays opener  a 5-4 Toronto victory  following an elbow to the head from Panthers center Sam Bennett, Woll started for the first time since April 17. Its been something Ive had to focus on and come up with a plan to stay ready, Woll said. Its a different challenge than playing every night, but a challenge nonetheless. Woll, who entered with a .950 save percentage in his four previous playoff starts, also performed well when called upon in both the 2023 and 2024 postseasons because of injury. Calm and cool, Maple Leafs coach Craig Berube said. On his toes and fighting through traffic. Very impressed. Max Pacioretty and Max Domi each had a goal and an assist, William Nylander also scored and Morgan Rielly added two assists for the Maple Leafs.  
        
     Anton Lundell had a goal and an assist, and Aleksander Barkov and Brad Marchand also scored for the defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers. Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 16 saves. Lots of stuff that we like about our game that we think we can improve, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. Well take a look at it and get better. The best-of-seven matchup between Atlantic Division heavyweights now shifts to South Florida, with Game 3 set for Friday. Trailing 3-2 after two periods, Florida tied it got even at 5:33 of the third when Lundell shoveled his third goal of the playoffs past Woll. Toronto regained the lead just 17 seconds later when Marner fired a shot from the boards that found its way through traffic past a surprised Bobrovsky. Marner, who turned 28 on Monday, has added an M to his equipment since he and wife Stephanie welcomed their son Miles on Sunday morning. Just calmness, he said of what looking down and seeing that initial does for him. I try to stay calm as much as I can throughout games. Its always a roller-coaster ride. Theres always stuff going on, stuff you cant predict happening. Im trying to play for him. Woll made a huge stop on Mackie Samoskevich with 9:59 left in regulation, and Maple Leafs defenseman Jake McCabe swatted a loose puck out of the crease with under six minutes to go. The Panthers continued to press and Sam Reinhart hit the post with just over three minutes left before the Maple Leafs held on late. Florida, which beat Toronto in five games two years ago at the same stage of the playoffs, went ahead 2-1 just 15 seconds into the middle period when Marchand  a Maple Leafs playoff nemesis as a member of the Boston Bruins  took a pass from Lundell down low off a turnover by Rielly and roofed his first of the playoffs. Toronto tied it at 4:18 when Pacioretty chipped a puck past Panthers defenseman Seth Jones before finding Nylander in front for him to bury his sixth, and the forwards seventh point in three games. Theyre very good on the rush, Marchand said. It seemed like every time we gave them the opportunity to get above us, they created something or capitalized on it. The Maple Leafs took a 3-2 lead with 2:51 remaining in the second when Domi took a pass from Steven Lorentz on a 2-on-1 and one-timed his second over a sprawling Bobrovsky. Toronto got nothing from two power plays inside the games first 10 minutes before Florida struck 5 seconds into its first man advantage when Barkov fired past Woll for his second at 10:58. The Maple Leafs got their third power play of the period when Dmitry Kulikov was whistled for delay of game for shooting the puck out of play. Toronto again didnt get much going until the second unit took the ice and Rielly fired a shot from the point late in the man advantage that Pacioretty  a healthy scratch to start the postseason before scoring the series-clinching goal against Ottawa in the first round  tipped it upstairs for his second with 1:41 left before the first intermission. The Panthers had defenseman Aaron Ekblad back following a two-game suspension for a forearm to the chin of Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brandon Hagel in the first round.  ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/panthers-maple-leafs-score-nhl-playoffs-79d47cf6e02173fa5604afb9b8d9c4fe,sports
Mikko Rantanen has second straight hat trick as Stars beat Jets 3-2 in series opener,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP)  Mikko Rantanen had a natural hat trick in the second period, Jake Oettinger stopped 30 shots and the Dallas Stars beat the Winnipeg Jets 3-2 on Wednesday night in Game 1 of the second-round series. Rantanen, who had a hat trick in the third period of the Stars Game 7 win over his former Colorado teammates, is the third player in NHL history  and the first in nearly 40 years  with hat tricks in consecutive playoff games. Edmontons Jari Kurri accomplished the feat in Games 5 and 6 of the 1985 Campbell Conference final, and Chicagos Doug Bentley did the same in Games 4 and 5 of the 1944 Stanley Cup Final. Sometimes it goes that way, said Rantanen, acquired from Carolina at the trade deadline. The third goal goes off them and goes fivehole. Or when youre going through a tough stretch, you feel like you could only pray for those and those never come. Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Friday night in Winnipeg. Nino Niederreiter and Mark Scheifele scored for the Jets, who had won four in a row at Canada Life Centre. Connor Hellebuyck made 21 saves. Scheifele returned after sustaining an upper-body injury in Game 5 in the first round against St. Louis. Dallas forward Jason Robertson was back after injuring a knee in the final game of the regular season. The Jets led the NHL with 116 points to earn home-ice advantage through the playoffs, while Dallas was second in the Central Division and third in the Western Conference with 106. 
        
     We know we just gave up home-ice advantage, Jets coach Scott Arniel said. And that wasnt a game where they rolled over top of us for three periods. That was a game where we werent at our best. Niederreiter got the sold-out crowd cheering when his sharp-angled backhander beat Oettinger at 3:30 of the second period. He became the NHLs first Swiss-born player to skate in 100 postseason games. Rantanen tied it at 8:43 with his sixth goal of the playoffs. His second goal was a tip of Thomas Harleys point shot with 5:39 left, and he made it 3-1 on the power play 2:17 later when his shot went in off Jets defenseman Dylan Samberg. Sometimes its ups and downs in hockey and now its going well individually and as a team, Rantanen said. Rantanen extended his points streak to four games with eight goals and six assists across the stretch. He has 15 points this postseason. Hes one of the best players in the world and hes just on fire right now, so were just trying to get him the puck, said center Sam Steele, who assisted on Rantanens first goal of the night. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/stars-jets-score-nhl-playoffs-9104a02d0a358148370e8bb5c4024a07,sports
Crosby and MacKinnon back together for Canada at the ice hockey worlds after 10 years,"Be aware: Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon join forces to play for Canada at the ice hockey world championship after 10 years. As all eyes are on the NHL playoffs, the two major stars are in Europe for the worlds opening on Friday across the Swedish capital of Stockholm and Denmarks city of Herning. It is the final mens international test before the 2026 Winter Games in Italy, where NHL players return to the Olympics after 12 years. The two friends and neighbours in Halifax, Nova Scotia, were on the team that Crosby captained to gold at the 2015 worlds. By winning the tournament in Prague then, Crosby joined hockeys Triple Gold Club, a small group of players who have won the Stanley Cup, the Olympics and the worlds. These are the third worlds, and first since 2015 for Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup winner (2009, 16 and 17) and double Olympic champion (2010 and 14). Hes captured gold for Canada at every international tournament, including the 2016 World Cup of Hockey and the 2005 world junior championship. In February, the 37-year-old also shone alongside MacKinnon as he captained Canada to the 4 Nations Face-Off trophy, beating archrival the United States in overtime. Crosby has behind him a 20th NHL season featuring 33 goals, 58 assists and 91 points in 80 games for the Pittsburgh Penguins, who missed out on the NHL playoffs. MacKinnon opted to join Canada after his Colorado Avalanche were knocked out in the first round. It will be the fourth worlds and and first since 2017 for the 29-year-old center, who recorded the second highest points in the regular season  116  and added another 11 in the playoffs. 
        
     Crosby will also reunite with goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury who has just exited the NHL but postponed his retirement at age of 40 to play again with Crosby and at the worlds for the first time. Itll be fun to go spend some time together and yell at him in practice a bit, keep him honest, said Fleury, who won the Stanley Cup with the Penguins three times. Among the rising stars, Canada includes the 18-year-old Macklin Celebrini, the top pick in the 2024 NHL draft who collected 63 points from 25 goals and 38 assists in his rookie season for the San Jose Sharks. Canada is the most successful nation at the tournament with 28 titles and is a favorite every year no matter who is available. With Crosby and MacKinnon, it is definitely the team to beat. David Pastrnak is back for the defending champion Czech Republic after his Boston Bruins didnt advance to the playoffs. The Czechs beat Switzerland 2-0 in the final in Prague last year with Pastrnak scoring the winner. It was the seventh title won by the Czech Republic  or Czechia  since the 1993 breakup of Czechoslovakia. Pastrnak racked up 106 points in the NHL, reaching one hundred for the third straight season. Utah captain Clayton Keller will also captain a U.S. that is seeking a first worlds medal since a bronze in 2021. Alternate captains, forward Tage Thompson of the Buffalo Sabres and forward Conor Garland of the Vancouver Canucks, were on that team four years ago. Columbus defenseman Zach Werenski and Boston net-minder Jeremy Swayman were on the team that was fifth last year. Filip Forsberg will appear again for the Sweden team that beat Canada 4-2 in the bronze-medal game last year. The left winger will return home to play in two regular season games between Nashville and the Penguins in Stockholm in November as part of the the NHL global series. Others on the Sweden squad include New York Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad and New Jersey defenseman Jonas Brodin and goalie Jacob Markstrom. The 2022 champion Finland struggled at the previous two worlds, finishing seventh and eighth, its worst results in decades. Nashville goalie Justus Annunen, Chicago forward Teuvo Teravainen and Rangers forward Juuso Parssinen hope to help turn things around. Switzerland features a trio from New Jersey; forwards Nico Hischier and Timo Meier and defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler. The 16 teams are divided into two groups for the preliminary round. Canada is in Group A in Stockholm with Sweden, Finland, Austria, France, Latvia, Slovakia and newcomer Slovenia. Group B in Herning includes the Czechs, Switzerland, the U.S., Denmark, Germany, another newcomer Hungary, Kazakhstan and Norway. The top four in each group make the quarterfinals. From the semifinals, all games will be in Stockholm at the iconic Avicii Arena, previously known as Globen. The final and bronze-medal game are scheduled for May 25. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/ice-hockey-worlds-mackinnon-crosby-a01b569a7bcf20bb99649eb4abee67b1,sports
The year of the NBA playoff comeback continues. A look at how these 20-point rallies keep happening,"New York down by 20 on Monday. Indiana down by 20 on Tuesday. New York down by 20 again Wednesday. No problem. For the first time since play-by-play began being digitally tracked across the NBA about 30 years ago, there have been three consecutive days where the winning team in a playoff game came from at least 20 points down to win. The Knicks did it in Boston on Monday, the Pacers did it in Cleveland on Tuesday and the Knicks did it again on the Celtics home floor Wednesday. Add in a pair of similar rallies  a 29-pointer by Oklahoma City and another 20-pointer by Indiana  in Round 1, and that pushes the total of 20-point comebacks so far this postseason to five. Thats the most of any postseason in the digital play-by-play era, which goes back to 1997. A look at how the comebacks happened: The big lead: Memphis 69, Oklahoma City 40, 3:07 left first half The final score: Oklahoma City 114, Memphis 108 How it happened: Memphis undoing started when star guard Ja Morant got hurt and left the game on the possession where the Grizzlies took the 29-point lead. The Thunder outscored the Grizzlies 74-39 the rest of the way, with Chet Holmgren scoring 23 points for Oklahoma City in that span. Memphis missed 30 of its final 41 shots. The big lead: Milwaukee 33, Indiana 13, 11:26 left first half The final score: Indiana 119, Milwaukee 118, OT How it happened: The Pacers got the lead down to six by halftime, then the final 29 minutes were largely back and forth. The Bucks led by seven with 40 seconds left in overtime, before Indiana ended the game on an 8-0 run and won it on Tyrese Haliburtons layup with 1.4 seconds remaining. 
        
     The big lead: Boston 75, New York 55, 5:47 left third quarter The final score: New York 108, Boston 105, OT How it happened: The Celtics went up 20, then shot 23% the rest of the way (9 for 39) and relied almost entirely on the 3-point shot (6 for 28) over those 23 minutes. OG Anunoby and Jalen Brunson combined to outscore Boston 39-30 by themselves over that finishing stretch, and neither team scored in the final 1:16 of overtime. The big lead: Cleveland 81, Indiana 61, 6:51 left third quarter The final score: Indiana 120, Cleveland 119 How it happened: Over the games final 40 minutes, Indiana led for 0.00046% of the time  and won the game. The Pacers outscored Cleveland 59-38 over the final 18:51, Tyrese Haliburtons 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left capping an 8-0 burst in the final minute and giving Indiana a 2-0 series lead. The big lead: Boston 73, New York 53, 2:19 left third quarter The final score: New York 91, Boston 90 How it happened: The Knicks outscored the Celtics 38-17 in the final 14:19 of the game, as Boston  just like in Game 1  built a big lead and then couldnt hit a shot. The Celtics were 5 for 25 from the field in that stretch, 2 for 12 from 3-point range. Bostons starters were a combined 2 for 19 down the stretch, while New York shot 15 for 28 and got 14 points from Mikal Bridges over those minutes. Jayson Tatum couldnt get a good look on the last play, and the Knicks took a 2-0 series lead. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-comebacks-0ac7f24401d27abe5fc30e1700cc19b6,sports
"Tyrese Haliburton gets warning from NBA for dance, but no fine, AP source says","Tyrese Haliburton did the dance. He will not pay a fine. Haliburton, the Indiana guard who expected to be fined for his dancing celebration after Game 2 of the Pacers win at Cleveland in the Eastern Conference semifinals on Tuesday night, received only a warning from the league office instead, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because the decision had not been revealed publicly. Ive been waiting for that. Ive been waiting for that, man, Haliburton said after Game 2, when asked about the celebration and if he expected to hear from the league. It was just right in the moment. It was right in the moment. Yeah, man, Ive been waiting for that. Ill take that fine, gladly. It will be just a warning instead. Haliburton fully expected a fine because celebrations similar to the one he used  believed to be first brought to the league by Sam Cassell long ago  merited such penalties from the NBA in the past. LeBron James, Eddie House, Julius Randle, Fred Van Vleet and more have previously drawn fines for what the league has described as an obscene gesture. Haliburtons 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left capped an Indiana rally from 20 points down and gave the Pacers a 120-119 win. The Pacers now lead the series against the top-seeded Cavaliers 2-0, with Games 3 and 4 at Indianapolis on Friday and Sunday. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/pacers-tyrese-haliburton-nba-0f06b516327cf0924c1d8d938e02e4ce,sports
Paul Pierce says he walked 20 miles to work in a robe as punishment for guaranteeing a Celtics win,"Former Celtics great Paul Pierce was so confident in his team in Game 2 against the Knicks, he said he would walk to work barefoot in my robe if they lost for a second straight game in the second-round series. If the Celtics lose Game 2 at home, I promise you, I am walking here tomorrow, he declared on an FS1 show Wednesday. I guarantee this one. Put the house on this game. That didnt turn out so great. The Celtics blew a 20-point lead in Game 2, as they did in Game 1, and lost 91-90. Pierce appeared to honor his vow Thursday, saying he set out before the sun rose for what he said was a 20.2-mile commute to work in the Los Angeles area. He posted updates on Instagram Live. Pierce made the wise choice of not walking barefoot, but bath-robed? Yes. All right, time for me to get to steppin, he said after 5 a.m. Pacific time, calling himself a man of my word. I cant believe the Celtics got me out here like this, dog, he said in a later update. Im really walking out here like this.

Olympiakos rises into next Champions League and skips qualifying rounds after PSG reaches final,"ATHENS, Greece (AP)  Greek league winner Olympiakos will return to the Champions League next season after a five-year gap because Paris Saint-Germain advanced to the final late Wednesday. We are back! the new Greek champion posted Thursday on its social media accounts after its elevated status was confirmed by UEFA. PSGs win over Arsenal in the semifinals means it will play Inter Milan in the May 31 final in Munich. Both finalists already qualified for the next Champions League through their national league position so the entry reserved for the defending champion can be reallocated. That guaranteed place in the 36-team league format goes to the national champion in the qualifying rounds that has the best UEFA ranking, based on European competition results over a five-year period. Olympiakos has that high ranking  currently No. 37 in all Europe  fueled by winning the Conference League title last year, as the first Greek team to win a European trophy. The champion of Greece had been set to enter the 2025-26 Champions League qualifying rounds in July, needing to advance through three rounds to reach the lucrative league phase. Olympiakos sealed the Greek league title, the 48th in its history, last weekend and now avoids having to beat three opponents to reach the elite Champions League stage. The team, owned by shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis, last played in the Champions League in 2020-21, placing third in a group behind Manchester City and Porto. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/champions-league-greece-olympiakos-uefa-98fc1c4492c05f41fb25b0c8e8fb2452,sports
FIFAs Infantino plans Saudi visit during President Trumps tour as soccer world gathers in Paraguay,"GENEVA (AP)  FIFA President Gianni Infantino will go to Saudi Arabia next week during U.S. President Donald Trumps state visit while the soccer bodys 211 member federations gather at their annual Congress being held in Paraguay. It is unprecedented in modern times for a FIFA president to skip any part of the days-long congress program, where FIFA voters in soccers six continental bodies caucus ahead of the main meeting often called the sports parliament. The FIFA president has accepted invitations to attend a series of important events with world leaders, where FIFA World Cups will also be discussed, soccers governing body said in a statement. Infantino also is expected to visit Qatar, the 2022 World Cup host which also is on the U.S. presidents Middle East tour schedule. Infantinos close ties to Trump during the presidents first term have grown stronger in about 10 meetings together since December, including Tuesday at the White House with a task force to oversee federal plans for the 2026 World Cup being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. The FIFA leader also meets regularly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose kingdom will host the mens World Cup in 2034. Infantino helped steer those hosting rights to Saudi Arabia in an uncontested vote last December. Infantino is expected to return from the Middle East in time for the FIFA Congress on Thursday, the last meeting of all FIFA members before they come to the 2026 World Cup. It also is their first meeting together since before the online votes six months ago that confirmed the Saudi bid for 2034 and sent the 2030 edition to Spain, Portugal and Morocco plus single games in Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. 
        
     He had been due Tuesday in the Paraguayan capital Asuncion to chair an in-person meeting of FIFAs ruling council. It is now moved up four days for an online session Friday that clears Infantinos schedule for the kind of geopolitical trip he has seemed to relish detailing on his Instagram account. Infantino and FIFA have consistently said he needs to maintain good relations with the Trump administration to ensure the 48-team, six-week tournament is safe and successful. FIFA voters chose the North American bid in 2018 when it was backed by then-President Trump. However, there were no formal meetings for Infantino with President Joe Biden during his four-year term that ended in January. They did pose for a photograph together in 2022 at a G20 meeting in Bali, Indonesia. Infantino has forged close political and financial ties for FIFA with Saudi Arabia and its crown prince since before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. In Riyadh on Tuesday, when FIFA delegates are in Paraguay, Infantino is expected to attend a Saudi-U.S. investment forum where World Cup projects are on the agenda. Saudi Arabia is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on stadiums plus huge city and transport upgrades ahead of the tournament. Infantino attended a similar conference in Miami Beach in February, when he sat with Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner, Elon Musk and Saudi officials. They included the kingdoms ambassador to the U.S., Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud and the governor of its sovereign wealth fund, Yasir Al-Rumayyan. Soccer officials have privately expressed concern about Infantinos increasing focus on global politics as much as the sport FIFA runs. European soccer body UEFA said Thursday we were informed about the (Council) meeting being rescheduled to this week. However, we prefer not to comment on the reasons and suggest directing any queries to FIFA, UEFA said. President Trump is visiting Saudi Arabia plus Qatar and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, in what was originally planned as the first overseas trip since he took office for a second time in January. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/fifa-infantino-trump-saudi-arabia-world-cup-c7332dc43564a712d740ac85533818bb,sports
Chelsea advances to Conference League final against Real Betis,"Chelsea rested its regular starters and still comfortably advanced to the Conference League final by beating Djurgrden 1-0 in their semifinal second leg of Thursday. The Premier League club advanced 5-1 on aggregate to set up a May 28 title match against Real Betis, which prevailed in extra time for a 4-3 aggregate win over Fiorentina to reach its first European final. At Stamford Bridge, midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall collected a through pass from Tyrique George before scoring the winner with a low left-footed shot in the 38th minute. Amazing to be in the final, Dewsbury-Hall told TNT Sports. We set our sights at the start of the season to get as far as we can in this tournament and it has been a long couple of months but one more game to go and and hopefully we can lift that trophy. Chelsea remains on course to become the first club to win all major European competitions. The Blues have claimed the Champions League (2012, 21), the Europa League (2013, 19), Cup Winners Cup (1971, 98) and Super Cup (1998, 21). The final takes place in Wroclaw, Poland. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca used only Marc Cucurella from the team that beat the new Premier League champion Liverpool 3-1 on Sunday. Sixteen-year-old midfielder Reggie Walsh was given his first career start and drew frequent fouls from the opposition defense. When he was used as substitute in the first leg, he became the third youngest player for Chelsea, the club said. 
        
     The Conference League champion is rewarded with a place in the second-tier Europa League next season, hardly a desirable bonus for Chelsea given that it is fighting in the Premier League for a Champions League spot. Chelsea, in fifth place in the Premier League, should have fresh legs Sunday when it plays at Newcastle. In Florence, Antony crossed for substitute Abdessamad Ezzalzouli in the 97th minute to score past goalkeeper David De Gea for a 2-2 draw that sent Betis to the final. Ezzalzouli also scored in the first-leg 2-1 victory in Sevilla last week. Betis increased its aggregate lead from the first leg to 3-1 with a goal from Antony in the 30th. The midfielder, who is at Betis on loan from Manchester United, netted with a curling free kick that hit the post before bouncing into the net for his fourth goal in the competition. Fiorentinas equalizer  on the evening  came four minutes later from a header by Robin Gosens off a corner kick. Gosens made it 3-3 on aggregate before the interval, heading home again from another corner. Fiorentina was the runner-up in the third-tier club competition in the last two years, losing the finals to West Ham in 2023 and Olympiakos last year. In the second-tier Europa League, Manchester United eliminated Athletic Bilbao on a 7-1 aggregate score after a 4-1 victory at Old Trafford to set up an all English final against Tottenham, which won 2-0 at Bod/Glimt for a 5-1 overall win. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/conference-league-chelsea-fiorentina-betis-d1904d5e021b8406ca481f29bf7a22d6,sports
F1s Alpine announces resignation of Oliver Oakes as team principal,"LONDON (AP)  Alpine announced Tuesday that Oliver Oakes resigned as team principal after less than a year in the role. The Formula 1 team is ninth in the constructors standings and reportedly was on the verge of replacing rookie driver Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto. The team would like to thank Oliver for his efforts since he joined last summer and for his contribution in helping the team secure sixth place in the 2024 constructors championship, Alpine said in a statement. The team said Flavio Briatore will continue as executive advisor and will cover Oakes duties. At Sundays Miami Grand Prix, Doohan ran into another car on the opening lap and then crashed on the second lap. There have been media reports in Argentina that Colapinto will replace Doohan at F1s next race  later this month in Italy. It was dismissed at the start of the Miami weekend by Oakes, who had indicated that the Australian would still be in the seat at Imola.

Alpine promotes Franco Colapinto to replace Jack Doohan for the next 5 Formula 1 Grand Prix races,"LONDON (AP)  Formula 1 team Alpine has changed its driver lineup to promote Franco Colapinto for at least the next five Grand Prix races at the expense of Jack Doohan. Alpine confirmed the change Wednesday, a day after Oliver Oakes quit as team principal. The team said Flavio Briatore will continue as executive advisor and will cover Oakes duties. Colapinto will be paired with Pierre Gasly from the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, ahead of a new evaluation before the British Grand Prix in July, Alpine said in a statement. Alpine is ninth in the F1 constructors standings after six rounds. The next race weekend is May 16-18 at Imola. At Sundays Miami Grand Prix, Doohan ran into another car on the opening lap and then crashed on the second lap. Media reports of a driver rotation were dismissed ahead of the Miami GP weekend by Oakes, who had indicated that the rookie Australian driver would remain in the seat. Doohan, who didnt score a point in his seven GP races and had a best finish of 13th, will revert to being the teams reserve driver. The son of five-time motorcycle world champion Mick Doohan, Jack Doohan made his Formula 1 debut in the last race of 2024 and started this year for Alpine at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. He replaced Esteban Ocon, who left Alpine after a disappointing 2024. Colapinto joined Alpine as a reserve driver in January after racing in 2024 for Williams, where he earned five points after replacing Logan Sargeant in August. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-alpine-driver-colapinto-doohan-387c39d661a442515bb08e66e6d7379c,sports
Oakes resignation from F1 team Alpine came days after police charged brother,"LONDON (AP)  Oliver Oakes resignation as team principal of F1 team Alpine this week came several days after UK police charged his brother with transferring criminal property. Metropolitan Police said William Oakes, 31, was charged last Friday after being stopped the day before in the Silverstone Park area in possession of a large amount of cash. Police said he was remanded in custody after an appearance before the Northampton Magistrates Court on Saturday. It wasnt clear who his attorney is to seek comment. Oliver Oakes had joined Alpine from his junior team, Hitech Grand Prix, where William Oakes also was listed as a director. Hitech did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Oliver Oakes, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, had been Alpines team principal for less than a year when his resignation was announced on Tuesday. A day later, the team confirmed it had changed its driver lineup to promote Franco Colapinto for at least the next five Grand Prix races at the expense of Jack Doohan.

"Tom Wilson leads the Capitals past the Hurricanes 3-1 with blocks, a goal and an assist","WASHINGTON (AP)  Tom Wilson did a little bit of everything for the Washington Capitals  and he wasnt sure the box score properly reflected quite just how much he contributed Thursday night.  He produced the primary assist on John Carlsons go-ahead goal on a power play early in the third period of Washingtons 3-1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes to knot their Eastern Conference second-round playoff series at a game apiece.  Wilson put the puck into an empty net in the final minute to seal the outcome. He provided his usual brand of physical play, hitting and shoving and mixing it up right up until the end. Oh, yes, and he was credited with two of Washingtons 32 blocked shots, 22 more than Carolina, although Wilson was skeptical about his total. I only had two of them? a smiling Wilson asked reporters with mock indignation. The guys up top need to pay a little more attention. With Wilson leading the way physically and emotionally for the hosts, the Capitals managed to get going right away following a 2-1 overtime loss two nights earlier.  He was leading the charge tonight, I thought, coach Spencer Carbery said. He was really engaged. No other forward spent as much time on the ice as Wilson did Thursday, and Carbery credited him with being one of the players  along with Alex Ovechkin  who wanted to make sure the club would be better prepared for Game 2 than for Game 1. 
        
     Game 1 wasnt good enough, Wilson said. We knew that. As teammate after teammate lavished praise on him before the series shifts to Raleigh for Game 3 on Saturday, Wilson sought to deflect the compliments. He does everything the right way, goalie Logan Thompson said. We built off it. The whole stadium built off it. Connor McMichael, who scored the games opening goal for Washington on a breakaway after a turnover by the Hurricanes, explained Wilsons role this way: When we need a spark, hes there to provide it. You need a big play or a big goal, hes always the one doing it. Wilson kind of shrugged off a reporters question about a head-first dive that thwarted a chance for Carolinas Jordan Staal, describing the play a bit before ending by saying simply: Youve just got to hope that the puck hits you. Wilson also said he didnt think he was really doing anything more than everybody else on the team.  Ovechkins take on his long-time teammate? He set the tone. Hes our leader, the top goal-scorer in NHL history said. He plays smart. He plays physical.  ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/capitals-hurricanes-wilson-182daabfac8b29d9d06f887fa45e6e84,sports
Drake Baldwin drives in the winning run to lift Braves over Reds 5-4 in 11 innings,"ATLANTA (AP)  Drake Baldwin hit an RBI single in the 11th inning to drive in automatic runner Ozzie Albies and give the Braves their fourth win in their last five games, 5-4 over the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday night. Scott Blewett (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings to pick up the win.  The Braves forced extra innings with a two-run rally in the ninth inning. Eli White bunted home Albies with the first run and Michael Harris II drove in pinch runner Eddie Rosario with a single to left field. Harris was 3 for 5 with two RBIs. Taylor Rogers (1-1) took the loss. Rookie Rece Hinds hit a tie-breaking two-run homer off Raisel Iglesias in the ninth inning to give the Reds a 4-2 lead. He was 2 for 3 with two RBIs and a walk in his second game of the season with the Reds. Reds catcher Jose Trevino was 3 for 4 with three doubles and an RBI.  Spencer Schwellenbach lasted six innings and gave up five hits, one run, two walks, five strikeouts. It was his sixth quality start of the season in eight outings and came after he struggled against the Dodgers in his last start. Reds manager Terry Francona was ejected in the 11th inning for arguing a caught stealing call at second base. In the 11th, Baldwin threw out Blake Dunn stealing to end the inning and gives the Braves a chance to win. Braves reliever Pierce Johnson has retired 25 straight batters in his last eight appearances covering 8 1/3 innings. He has nine strikeouts during that stretch.

"Blue Jays rally from 4 runs down to beat Angels 8-5, avoid series sweep","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Anthony Santander hit a go-ahead, two-run single during Torontos four-run sixth inning, and the Blue Jays snapped their four-game losing streak with an 8-5 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday night. Daulton Varsho homered and drove in three runs on three hits for the Jays, who rallied from an early four-run deficit with 14 hits to avoid a series sweep. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. also had three hits as Toronto won for just the fifth time in 17 games. Taylor Ward and Jo Adell hit early homers for the Angels, who failed to earn their first series sweep. Chris Bassitt (3-2) persevered through six bumpy innings for Toronto, allowing eight hits and striking out six. Chad Green earned his first save of the season one night after Jeff Hoffman, who replaced Green as Torontos closer this year, blew a two-run lead in the ninth. Jos Soriano struggled through five innings for the Angels, yielding three runs on eight hits and four walks. Ward hit a two-run homer in the first, and Adell followed with a solo shot in the second before Zach Neto scored on Bo Bichettes error to put the Halos up 4-0. Varsho had an RBI double and Addison Barger added an RBI single before the decisive rally in the sixth. Varsho connected for his third homer in six games in the eighth. The Jays loaded the bases against Ryan Johnson (1-1) in the sixth before Santander delivered on Brock Burkes first pitch.

"Celtics-Knicks ticket for Game 3 in New York is commanding nearly $2,000 on resale market","NEW YORK (AP)  Ticket demand is so great for Saturdays Game 3 of the NBA playoff series between the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks that the average paid ticket price on the resale market approached $2,000 Thursday. The average was $1,956 for Game 3 and $1,716 for Game 4, both at Madison Square Garden, according to ticketing technology company Victory Live, which analyzes transactions, not listings, on the secondary market. The cheapest ticket for Game 3 was $626 on StubHub; for Game 4 it was $613 on Vivid Seats. The Knicks have become the most exciting story in the playoffs, having erased 20-point deficits to beat the defending champion Celtics in the first two games of the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals. The Knicks, eliminated in the conference semifinals the last two years, would reach the Eastern finals for the first time since 2000 if they win two more games against the Celtics.

Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson refuses to dwell on missed calls in Game 2 loss to Pacers,"INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP)  Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson refused to blame officials for what the NBA said were three incorrect no-calls in the final minute  including one that led to Tyrese Haliburtons game-winning 3-pointer  in Indianas 120-119 victory over Cleveland in Game 2 of an Eastern Conference semifinal series on Tuesday night. The NBA said Wednesday in its Last 2-Minute Report on the game that two lane violations and defensive 3 seconds call were missed. The NBA releases those reports the day after games where the margin is three points or fewer at any time in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime. The league said Haliburton should have been called for a lane violation for stepping over the plane of the free throw line before the ball touched the rim on a missed foul shot with 12.4 seconds remaining with Indiana trailing 119-117. Haliburton got the offensive rebound after it was deflected by multiple players, dribbled out to the 3-point line and made the game-winning, step-back shot from the top of the key as the Pacers rallied from a 20-point, second-half deficit to go up 2-0 in the series. Haliburton though wasnt the only player to commit a lane violation on the play. The NBA said multiple players entered the lane. Atkinson  honored as the NBAs Coach of the Year on Monday  said his bigger worries were about how the Cavs lost their lead and how Indiana scored the final eight points in 47.9 seconds to get the victory. 
        
     I think we always have recency bias. So what happened in the last 30 seconds? Its like, howd you lose that 20-point lead, Atkinson said after practice on Thursday. Id say it was coaching decisions, player decisions, and then referee decisions. And we all made mistakes. And then if you put it kind of a ledger, you add all those up and that their minus-20 goes to, oh my gosh. We had plenty of decisions where we could have made it. Im kind of there with that. The NBA also said multiple players committed lane violations with 48 seconds remaining on a missed free throw by Indianas Pascal Siakam. One of the players was Aaron Nesmith, whose dunk off the rebound got the Pacers with 118-113. Clevelands Donovan Mitchell should have been called for a 3-second violation with 15 seconds left. That would have been a technical foul where Indiana should have been awarded one free throw as well as maintaining possession of the ball. While Atkinson has been critical of some of the non-calls and his feeling that some of the physical play has been excessive, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle pointed out that his team has been called for nine more fouls than the Cavaliers. The series shifts to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday. Look, were not expecting any gifts from the refs and I dont think we got any in the first two games. I know they disagreed with some calls, its all part of it, Carlisle said. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-cavaliers-pacers-baba8f7a58206aac79682505f7853460,sports
"Pacers, Nuggets trying to hold court after swinging playoff series with road victories","INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  The Denver Nuggets accomplished one goal by stealing Game 1 of their second-round playoff series at Oklahoma City. The Indiana Pacers were even more productive in Cleveland, sweeping both games. Now the two lower-seeded teams head home for their respective Game 3s on Friday with a new goal  taking advantage of those early road wins by keeping the upper hand in their series. The series isnt over, its far from over, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton said Thursday. This is a team that earned the No. 1 seed for a reason. Its probably rare they lose two games in a row. I dont know the exact number, but it probably doesnt happen often. So were going to see a desperate team, a team thats coming in here to win two games. Actually, the Cavaliers lost three straight during a four-day stretch in late January and four straight during a seven-day stretch in mid-March. Otherwise, theyve been dominant on the road where they earned the leagues third-best mark at 30-11. The Cavs may not even be in this hole if the leagues Last 2-Minute Report is correct. It said Aaron Nesmiths late dunk off a missed free throw and Haliburtons final rebound should have been jump balls because of lane violations by both teams in both cases. Haliburtons rebound led to his winning 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left. Even Donovan Mitchells incredible game  48 points, 17 made free throws and nine assists  wasnt enough to salvage a split. This time, though, Cleveland could be closer to full strength. 
        
     NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley and key backup DeAndre Hunter could both return. They both missed Game 2, Mobley with a sprained left ankle and Hunter with a sprained right thumb. The bigger question is starting guard Darius Garland. Hes missed four straight games with a sprained left big toe.  All three are listed as questionable. They all touched the ball. They all got some reps up, but we didnt do anything live, Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said after Thursdays practice. They kind of participated in the walkthrough and you know, hoping for the best. Haliburton said he intends to play despite with a heavily taped left wrist that he injured in Game 2. Hes a perfect 9-0 when appearing in home playoff games. One person who wont be at the game is Haliburtons father. This will be Indianas first home game since John Haliburton confronted Giannis Antetokounmpo on the court moments after Haliburtons winning layup eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 5. Oklahoma Citys Game 2 performance also shows it can rally in its series. The Thunder endured just two two-game skids this season, making sure it didnt happen a third time with a 43-point victory Wednesday in Game 3. The Thunder also went 35-6 on the road, including an early regular-season split in Denver. Winning the 2023 NBA crown also has given the Nuggets some perspective on how to turn the page after such an embarrassing loss. They were being aggressive, they were hitting us, three-time league MVP Nikola Jokic said. We werent disciplined, and everybody was kind of doing their own thing and we cant play like that. Every single person needs to step up and be better. And playing at home should help  both the Nuggets and the Pacers. Clevelands building was so loud, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. So we need our fans to bring every ounce of energy and noise and everything they have. Each game going forward is going to be a monumental challenge. Their support has meant a lot to us this year and its important right now. When/Where to Watch: Game 3, 10 p.m. EDT (ESPN) Series: Series tied, 1-1. BetMGM says: Nuggets by 4.5. What to know: Oklahoma City became the first team to protect its home court in this round after road teams won each of the first five games, and they did it by setting franchise and league records with an 87-point first half. Nothing went right for the Nuggets. They shot 37.9% from the field, had 20 turnovers and never looked like the team that played Game 1. MVP finalist Shea Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging 33.5 points to lead the Thunder despite sitting out the fourth quarter Wednesday. Jokic knows what must be done: Watch the tape, learn the lessons and move on to a pivotal game that could swing the series. The Thunder need to replicate their Game 2 performance while the Nuggets need to rediscover their Game 1 form. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-2025-pacers-nuggets-thunder-cavaliers-5c5b265a7e1b764980653da997cc2847,sports
Uncomfortable replay of Nuggets blowout loss to OKC in Game 2 essentially a group therapy session,"DENVER (AP)  The Denver Nuggets held what essentially was a group therapy session Thursday after their 43-point demolition at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 2 of their second-round playoff series. You cant just say, Hey, lets just have a mental day. Move on. Were good, we split, interim coach David Adelman said. Thats not the case. If we want to win Game 3 things have to be different. Starting with their mentality, he said. In the NBA playoffs, a lot of the time the whistle and the way the game is played is who hits first, Adelman said. And I thought they hit first, second and third. ... And tomorrow we have to be the aggressor, and I expect us to be. Adelman said the film review, albeit uncomfortable, proved productive. A lot of guys had thoughts on what they felt last night, Adelman said. And that allows you to move on and do things better tomorrow night. Adelman said the general sentiment was one of embarrassment. There was a lot of people speaking up and saying, I can do better, which I love, Adelman said. And then theres the film never lies, that kind of thing. The series shifts to Denver on Friday night, the Nuggets sixth game since April 29 whereas the top-seeded Thunder entered this semifinal series on nine days rest after sweeping Memphis in Round 1.  Denver survived a brutal seven-game series with the Los Angeles Clippers and 48 hours later beat Oklahoma City in the opener on Aaron Gordons 3-pointer that capped a frenetic comeback in the final minutes. 
        
     It all caught up to them Wednesday night when they fell behind in the opening minutes of Game 2 and watched the Thunder run away with it without any real resistance. I dont want to say we werent ready to play, Adelman said. I think we werent ready to play at that level. And when they came out the way they did, I thought our reaction to it took a really long time to understand what kind of game it was. Adelman said of all the things the Nuggets need to correct, it comes down to the mentality of how we play tomorrow. And we had a great mentality in Game 1. People can say, Oh, you were behind in Game 1, too. But it never felt like we let go of the rope. And yesterday I felt we let go of the rope and I felt they also played at an extremely high level. Adelman acknowledged fatigue was a factor in Denvers dismal performance. Ill say this: fatigue is a word you can use when you lose in the playoffs and that is a factor, but fatigue is part of what the postseason is, Adelman said. And finding that next level, your second wind, your third wind, collectively finding energy from each other, is how you win these games. And theres a million ways to break things down: oh, theyre playing more people than you or they had eight days off. All those things are true. But the other truth is well, we had enough energy to win Game 1 two days after winning a Game 7. So, why not have enough energy last night? I think the guys have it in them and I think theyll bring it tomorrow night. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/denver-nuggets-nba-playoffs-thunder-b9d9d39b569d658f08cfc9bda96d1d8c,sports
Receiver George Pickens points north with Cowboys after Steelers tenure turned south,"George Pickens says he joins the Dallas Cowboys focused more on a future with quarterback Dak Prescott and fellow receiver CeeDee Lamb than a past of why the Pittsburgh Steelers would trade one of their top playmakers in his prime. Dallas gave up a third-round draft pick next year, and the teams swapped late-round choices in 2027 to end Pickens three-year stint with the Steelers.  There were enough questionable antics for coach Mike Tomlin to declare bluntly last year that the former Georgia star and 2022 second-round pick needed to grow up. He isnt worried about that perception following him to Dallas. I cant really change anyones opinion of me personally, Pickens said in a conference call with reporters Thursday, a day after the trade was announced. I feel like everybody in the world has to grow. You get older and older as you grow. Were trying to build a winning culture, which they already have at the Cowboys. Im just glad to be joining it. The Cowboys werent winners last season, finishing 7-10 to end a three-year stretch of 12-5 playoff seasons. All three of those ended without a trip beyond the divisional round of the playoffs. Dallas is the only NFC team that hasnt played in a conference championship game since the 1995 season, when the Cowboys won their fifth Super Bowl title. Looking to rebound under first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer, Dallas didnt address the need for a No. 2 receiver behind Lamb during the draft. The trade for Pickens might have been why. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones said before the draft the Cowboys were working on a couple of substantive trades. 
        
     Pickens has the skills to match Lamb, who was an All-Pro in 2023 when he set career highs in catches (an NFL-best 135), yards (1,749) and touchdowns (12). The 24-year-old Pickens  two years younger than Lamb  led the Steelers in receiving yards each of the past two seasons and is among the NFLs best in yards per catch. You guys making a 1A, 1B, and all this, honestly, thats the first time Ive heard any of that stuff, Pickens said. I feel like two receivers are kind of normal. When I used to watch football, there was always a good receiver, and then there was also another good receiver on the side of him. Pickens has consistently struggled to keep his emotions in check. Last season alone he twice ended games by getting into dust-ups with opposing defensive backs, first when he grabbed Dallas Jourdan Lewis by the facemask and then when he tussled with Clevelands Greg Newsome II rather than try to get in position for a last-second desperation pass. That doesnt include a fine for using an expletive on his eye black against the Cowboys, a rule he said he was unaware of at the time. Pickens also drew criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates. Pickens wont have to worry about making nice with Lewis, who signed with Jacksonville as a free agent in March. Prescott was among the first to reach out to Pickens, who will need time to get settled in his new home and meet most of his new teammates. I like the mojo here, Pickens said. I like the swag. Considering Pickens volatility, the Steelers didnt seem interested in a contract extension, and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March. Metcalf promptly signed a five-year contract. Pickens brushed off the question of signing an extension before the end of his four-year rookie deal this season. Im kind of where my feet are right now, to be honest, Pickens said. Im not really thinking about contract talks. Pickens led the league by averaging 18.1 yards per catch in 2023 and has 174 receptions for 2,841 yards and 12 scores in 48 games. Lamb was a model of consistency and improvement his first four years, and now Pickens is trying to prove he can be reliable in his fourth year. It excites me a lot because ... we can work off each other, Pickens said. Theres no, He gets the ball, I get the ball. Were working off each other. Thats why I always come back to building a winning culture. And thats kind of what weve been talking about in Dallas. ___ AP National Writer Will Graves in Pittsburgh contributed to this report. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/cowboys-george-pickens-c8fdd6ee722417d9b1921c26ccdf4a61,sports
Pakistan moves its T20 cricket tournament to Dubai because of concerns over India conflict,"ISLAMABAD (AP)  The Pakistan Cricket Board has shifted the remaining eight matches of its Pakistan Super League Twenty20 competition to the United Arab Emirates following rising military tensions between India and Pakistan. The PCB confirmed the relocation to Dubai in a statement released early Friday, citing growing concerns among overseas players and the need to prioritize their safety. Once logistical arrangements are completed, the final schedule, including revised dates and venues, will be announced. Rawalpindi, Multan and Lahore were due to host the remaining games. The PCB has always stood by the position that politics and sports need to be kept apart, PSB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement. However, the PCB has decided to shift the remaining matches to UAE. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-india-conflict-tournament-dubai-04ee4a8aa4fce6c8da6c25cd5400d21b,sports
Joel Quenneville hired by Anaheim Ducks for his 1st head coaching job since Blackhawks abuse scandal,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Joel Quenneville returned to hockey Thursday with contrition. He acknowledged mistakes and said he accepted full responsibility for his role in the Chicago Blackhawks sexual assault scandal. The second-winningest coach in NHL history said he is a changed man after nearly four years away from the game. As he took over behind the bench of the Anaheim Ducks, he vowed to continue to educate himself about abuse, to expand his work with victims, and to create an unimpeachably safe workplace with his new team. Quenneville also realizes thats not nearly enough to satisfy a significant segment of hockey fans who believe his acknowledged inaction during the Blackhawks scandal should have ended his career forever. I fully understand and accept those who question my return to the league, Quenneville said. I know words arent enough. I will demonstrate (by) my actions that I am a man of character. Ducks owner Henry Samueli and general manager Pat Verbeek strongly backed the 66-year-old Quenneville when they introduced him as the coach of a franchise stuck in a seven-year playoff drought and thirsting for the success Quenneville has usually orchestrated. He won three Stanley Cups with the Blackhawks and took 20 teams to the playoffs during a quarter-century with four NHL clubs, becoming the most consistent winner of his era. While Quennevilles on-ice record was remarkable, his off-ice behavior in 2010 eventually led to his resignation from the Florida Panthers in October 2021 and a lengthy banishment from the league  a ban that many feel should be permanent. 
        
     I own my mistakes, Quenneville said, occasionally pausing in his delivery of a written statement. While I believed wholeheartedly the issue was handled by management, I take full responsibility for not following up and asking more questions. Thats entirely on me. Over nearly four years, Ive taken time to reflect, to listen to experts and advocates, and educate myself on the realities of abuse, trauma and how to be a better leader. I hope others can learn from my inaction. Quenneville and Blackhawks executives Stan Bowman and Al MacIsaac were banned from the NHL for nearly three years after an independent investigation concluded the team mishandled allegations raised by former player Kyle Beach against video coach Brad Aldrich during the teams first Stanley Cup run. The trio was reinstated last July, and Bowman became the Edmonton Oilers general manager three weeks later. After an investigation and vetting process that lasted several days and included communication with Beach and other sexual assault victims and advocacy groups, the Ducks owners ultimately supported the decision made by Verbeek, Quennevilles teammate in New Jersey and Hartford more than three decades ago. Samueli and his wife, Susan, and their daughter, Jillian, all spoke at length with Quenneville. Henry Samueli said he is absolutely convinced Joel is a really good person. I think the four years that Joel spent out of hockey has really given him an opportunity to learn a lot, Samueli said. In my mind, he will be a model coach for dealing with situations like this. I think he will be a mentor to other coaches in the league who can come to him and talk to him. How do you handle situations like that? What do you do? And theyll trust him, because hes old-school whos changed. The fact that he comes from an old-school hockey culture, but now has transitioned and learned what it means to operate in 2025, not 1980 or whatever, I think that will make a big difference in how he operates. Quenneville understands just how badly his reputation and career were damaged by his role in the Blackhawks handling of the accusations against Aldrich. He remained out of hockey for another season after his ban ended, but became increasingly eager to continue his career last winter while watching games every night and staying closely informed on the league. I thought I had some work to do in growing as a person, Quenneville said. As far as doing work along the way, I felt I had progressed to an area where the education I had put me in a position where I know I can share some of these lessons and these experiences as well. Many people with a firsthand knowledge of Quennevilles attempts to change himself supported his desire to return. Quenneville said he has spoken to Beach several times recently, including Thursday morning. He has formed learning friendships with advocates including Chris Jensen, the former University of Wisconsin player and Maple Leafs draft pick who was abused by a coach as a teenager. I think most of the athletes that have played for him would argue that this guy has helped me be better, Jensen said. He brings all that expertise, and now hes got additional perspective about how to be available to help people deal with emotional injury. I think hes in a much better position to be successful. The Ducks charitable foundation is already involved in charitable and philanthropic work supporting survivors of sexual abuse, and Samueli expects Quenneville to support those efforts. Im very confident that Joel will be a star when it comes to working with those organizations, Samueli said. Before his ban, Quenneville spent parts of 25 NHL seasons behind the benches of St. Louis, Colorado, Chicago and Florida, most notably leading the Blackhawks to championships in 2010, 2013 and 2015. His 969 career victories are the second-most in NHL history, trailing only Scotty Bowmans 1,244. Quenneville takes over a team with the NHLs third-longest active playoff drought. Anaheim finished sixth in the Pacific Division this season at 35-37-10 after being in the bottom two for the previous four consecutive years. He replaces Greg Cronin, who was surprisingly fired by Verbeek after leading the Ducks to a 21-point improvement in his second season. Quenneville inherits an Anaheim team with an ample stock of young talent, and he was immediately impressed by their roster when he saw it in person during Anaheims road trip to Tampa Bay last January. He also coached Ducks captain Radko Gudas and forward Frank Vatrano in Florida. One of the best coaches Ive ever had, and I always tell people that, said Vatrano, who attended Quennevilles introductory news conference. As a person, hes a great person, too. Thats what always draws me to Q. Im a huge advocate for him, and Im glad hes here. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/anaheim-ducks-quenneville-c452a39d30e755665c162e270bd577ac,sports
"Derek Shelton knew it was time to win. The Pirates havent, and now the manager is out of a job","PITTSBURGH (AP)  Derek Shelton was booed loudly when he was introduced ahead of his sixth home opener as the Pittsburgh Pirates manager last month. He shook it off in the aftermath, attributing the reaction to understandable frustration from a fan base weary of a franchise-wide reset that looks and feels stalled. The man who arrived at spring training saying it was time to win pledged to get it cleaned up. A little over a month later, with the Pirates languishing in last place amid a flurry of missteps both on and off the field, Shelton was out of a job. Pittsburgh fired Shelton on Thursday, a decision general manager Ben Cherington  who hired Shelton months after taking over the clubs baseball operations in 2019  called difficult but necessary to salvage a season perilously close to essentially being over before Memorial Day. We arent performing the way we need to, Cherington said a few hours after Shelton became the first major league manager jettisoned this year. Were not performing in a way that our fans deserve. We know we need to be better. The move came with Pittsburgh mired in a seven-game losing streak and languishing at 12-26 overall. Shelton went 306-440 in five-plus seasons with the Pirates. He navigated the ugly early days of Cheringtons rebuild with good humor and grace but struggled to find the right buttons to push on a small-market team that has little margin for error. Longtime bench coach and former major leaguer Don Kelly will take over for the remainder of the 2025 season, a full-circle moment for the Pittsburgh native. Cherington called Kelly an elite human being and teammate with a teachers heart.  
        
     Those skills figure to be put to the test while overseeing a lineup that ranks among the worst in the majors in nearly every major offensive category. Cherington was quick to not put the onus for the teams failure entirely on Shelton. The GM who won a World Series with Boston a dozen years ago said multiple times that he was more responsible than anyone. Maybe, but Cherington will report to work on Friday as usual when the Pirates open a three-game weekend series against Atlanta. Shelton, believed to be in the final season of a contract extension he signed in 2023 during a 20-8 start that turned out to be a mirage, will watch from afar, if he watches at all. Its not what either envisioned when the season began.  The Pirates, ranked 26th out of 30 MLB teams in opening-day payroll, hoped to take a step toward contention with National League Rookie of the Year Paul Skenes leading the way.  While the starting rotation in general has been steady, Pittsburghs largely inept offense has been an issue. A 2-1 loss to St. Louis on Tuesday encapsulated both Skenes and the Pirates season. One of the games bright young stars made a single mistake in six innings. It was all the Cardinals needed to win on a night Pittsburgh when managed just four hits. St. Louis finished the three-game sweep less than 24 hours later in a 5-0 victory in which the Pirates showed little life. That was enough for Cherington to recommend to owner Bob Nutting and team president Travis Williams that it was time for a change. Nutting called Pittsburghs opening six weeks of the season frustrating and painful.  What it shouldnt have been, perhaps, is surprising.  The team did little in the offseason to address an offense that was the primary culprit in an August swoon that dropped the Pirates out of playoff contention. Rather than finding a way to make a significant investment in proven major league talent, Cherington instead retooled parts of the coaching staff and scouting department, including firing hitting coach Andy Haines and replacing him with Matt Hague. The teams modest personnel moves included bringing back franchise icon Andrew McCutchen, acquiring first baseman Spencer Horwitz and taking one-year flyers on veterans Tommy Pham and Adam Frazier on the eve of spring training. McCutchen remains one of Pittsburghs more productive hitters, even at 38. Pham, meanwhile, is batting .183 and has already been suspended one game for making an obscene gesture toward fans while playing in left field. Frazier is at .229, and Horwitz is currently in the minors rehabbing a wrist injury he sustained not long after coming to the team. Pittsburgh finds itself in the same position offensively it was a season ago. Cherington likened the teams opening 38 games a perfect storm but tried to express optimism, both in its ability to rebound and his own long-term prospects. I dont believe you have to squint too hard to see a better team in 2025, I really dont, he said. Im not blind to the fact that weve ourselves in a hole and we got to climb out of that. No way to do it but a pitch at the time. We all have that goal.  Asked if he still considers himself the right person to lead the Pirates out of a wilderness theyve been in for most of the last 30-plus years  save for a stretch from 2013-15 when McCutchen led a brief renaissance  Cherington nodded. I know that theres frustration  and maybe anger  that it hasnt happened yet, he said. I believe its going to happen. I believe strongly Im going to be a part of making it happen. I have a lot of confidence in our baseball operations group. We have to get better. I know that.

"Pope Leo XIV brings hope to Chicago sports fans, and the Knicks for their Villanova ties","The sports loyalties of Pope Leo XIV became a topic of conversation almost as soon as the white smoke emerged from the Vaticans Sistine Chapel. Elected on Thursday, Robert Prevost is the first pope from the United States in the history of the Catholic Church. The Chicago-born missionary, who took the name Leo XIV, also attended Villanova University near Philadelphia, where he received a Bachelor of Science in 1977. Chicagos two baseball teams were front and center as sports fans reacted to the news. It was initially reported that the new pope was a Cubs fan. The team congratulated Pope Leo XIV in a post on X that had a picture of Wrigley Fields iconic marquee with the message: HEY, CHICAGO. HES A CUBS FAN! But his brother, John Prevost, set the record straight in an interview with WGN-TV. The pope is a White Sox fan. He was never ever a Cubs fan, so I dont know where that came from. He was always a Sox fan, John said, adding that the confusion might stem from the fact their mothers side of the family were North Siders and Cubs fans. The White Sox posted a clip from the brothers WGN interview on X, along with a picture of the Rate Field videoboard with the message: HEY CHICAGO, HES A SOX FAN! The post read Well, would you look at that... Congratulations to Chicagos own Pope Leo XIV. Family always knows best, and it sounds like Pope Leo XIVs lifelong fandom falls a little closer to 35th and Shields, the White Sox said in a media statement. Some things are bigger than baseball, and in this case, were glad to have a White Sox fan represented at the Vatican. A pinstripes White Sox jersey with his name on it and a hat already are on the way to Rome, and of course, the Pontiff always is welcome at his ballpark. 
        
     The TV interview had White Sox fans wondering about the popes ability to convince owner Jerry Reinsdorf to sell the last-place team. Long-suffering Bears fans weighed in, too. One remarked on X that Chicago developed a pope before the Bears developed a quarterback. Another said the Bears now have a direct line to God. And another said the Bears no longer will be on the wrong side of Hail Marys, a reference to Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels 52-yard Hail Mary completion to Noah Brown to beat the Bears in October. Daaaaaa Pope, Bears quarterback Caleb Williams posted on X on Thursday night. The election of the new pope coincides with a trio of former Villanova players leading the New York Knicks on an NBA playoff run. It didnt take long for a photoshopped picture of the four of them together to show up on social media. The Knicks erased 20-point deficits in winning Games 1 and 2 against the defending champion Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals.  Now fans are praying the combination of the Villanova guys and the new pope can help the team to its first NBA title since 1973. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/pope-leo-prevost-villanova-cubs-bears-4cbba3bb0a8219059fffeb309e534dfd,sports
Stephen Curry says he knows patience will be required when dealing with his hamstring injury,"Stephen Curry sat down after the Golden State Warriors went through their gameday shootaround practice in Minneapolis on Thursday, quickly announcing that hes feeling great. He was not telling the truth. Sarcasm, the four-time NBA champion with the Warriors quickly clarified, just in case anyone missed the joke. Curry is going to be a postseason spectator for at least a few games, his Grade 1 hamstring strain bad enough that it took him out of most of Game 1 of the Warriors Western Conference semifinal series on Tuesday  and will sideline him not only for Game 2 on Thursday but likely Games 3 and 4 in San Francisco. Curry  who is with the team but isnt allowed to do anything basketball-related right now, even stationary shooting  isnt exactly sure why the strain happened. Hes never had any hamstring issue of significance before. Its hard to really predict this stuff is what Im learning, Curry said. There were no, like, warning signs or any weird feelings. I felt great the whole game up until that point. And then I made a little pivot move on defense and felt something. Curry thought he would be able to return to Game 1, then quickly realized that wasnt the case. Playing with the strain could have made the issue far worse, Curry said. And hamstrings, hes quickly learning, need time, no matter what sort of rehabilitation program he partakes in. Obviously, a tough break, Curry said. Hopefully Ill be back soon. 
        
     Curry scored 13 points in 13 minutes of Game 1, left in the second quarter and Golden State went on to finish off a 99-88 win. Buddy Hield, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green combined for 62 points for the Warriors, who held Minnesota to a 5-for-29 effort on 3-point tries and limited the Timberwolves to 60 points through three quarters. We have a lot of confidence that we can still win the series and guys will step up no matter how it looks, Curry said. And its obviously a situation where you want to think positively and optimistically that we can win games and buy me some time to get back and hopefully have another series after this and be able to be in a position where I can get back out there safely, where Im not putting too much risk on the body if its not ready. Curry, who is averaging a team-best 22 points in these playoffs for Golden State, can still contribute in small ways even if hes not playing.  The guys obviously revere Steph, and they love his presence and thatll matter to us tonight during the game, coach Steve Kerr said in his pregame interview. Im sure hell be talking to the guys on the sidelines and giving some thoughts. He may come into our huddle and make a suggestion, which I always welcome, so its good to have him here for sure. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/stephen-curry-warriors-hamstring-nba-playoffs-facfbc99e16a52099273a578ae6a3137,sports
Man United and Tottenham reach Europa League final and are one win away from Champions League,"MANCHESTER, England (AP)  For Manchester United or Tottenham, a miserable campaign will end in Europa League glory. Despite both teams languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, the Champions League is now just one game away. Thats the reward on offer after the two troubled English clubs advanced to the final of Europes second-tier competition on Thursday. United beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 in the semifinal second leg at Old Trafford and won 7-1 on aggregate. Tottenham won 2-0 away at Bod/Glimt to seal a 5-1 aggregate victory. It sets up an all-English Europa League final for the second time in six years after Chelsea beat Arsenal to lift the trophy in 2019. If we dont win the final, it means nothing for us, United coach Ruben Amorim said. Its hard to describe what its like to be manager of this club. You want to give them (the fans) something, because weve been so disappointing in the Premier League. United came back from 1-0 down at halftime against Bilbao, with Mason Mount coming off the bench to score twice after the break. Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund were also on target. Dominic Solanke and Pedro Porro struck for Tottenham against Bod/Glimt in Norway. The final is in Bilbao on May 21. Its an unbelievable feeling, Spurs defender Micky van de Ven said. Weve had a tough season, but were one game away from winning silverware. A major title, alone, would be enough to salvage what has otherwise been a season to forget for both United and Spurs. But the added prize of a place in the lucrative Champions League would put the winner back among Europes elite next term. 
        
     That hasnt looked likely for either team for most of the campaign as they have languished closer to the relegation zone than the top five.  United is 15th in the standings having lost a club record 16 games in the Premier League. It is also certain to record its worst-ever points total in the modern era, as well as its lowest finish. For Tottenham, its even worse  sitting one place below United after a club record-equaling 19 losses in the Premier League. Now, one of those teams has the chance to effectively erase their woeful domestic form by winning the final, which will be the fourth time they have faced each other this season. Spurs won all three of the previous encounters  twice in the league and also in the English League Cup. We are struggling, both of us, so I dont know what is going to happen, Amorim said. That is a good thing and a bad thing with this team. I never know. Uniteds two-legged victory over Bilbao defied its performances for most of the season, which saw former coach Erik ten Hag fired in October and his replacement, Amorim, oversee 12 losses in 24 league games. Bilbao, fourth in the Spanish league, trailed 3-0 from the first leg but mounted a fightback through Mikel Jauregizars curling long-range shot in the 31st minute at Old Trafford. There were signs of nerves in Uniteds play as the visitors applied more pressure, but the introduction of Mount in the 62nd turned the game. He spun and curled a low shot past Bilbao goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala 10 minutes after coming on. Casemiro headed United in front in the 79th and Hojlund scored from close range in the 85th. Mount got his second when he spotted Agirrezabala off his line in the first minute of stoppage time and fired home from near the halfway line. It is Uniteds third Europa League final in eight years, having won the competition in 2017. United won the FA Cup last year and the League Cup in 2023 and this would be a third trophy-winning season in a row. It would also be Amorims first for the club after winning two Portuguese league titles with Sporting Lisbon. He described it as massive. For me its the most important because its the next one, he said. Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou insists he always delivers a trophy in his second year in charge. That was true at his previous clubs Brisbane Roar, Yokohama F Marinos and Celtic. But even the most optimistic of Spurs fans must have questioned whether he could maintain that record, given the teams struggles this season. Now he is one game away from coming good on his statement. Spurs led 3-1 from the first leg against a Bod/Glimt team that became the first from Norway to reach a major European semifinal. But the trip to the Aspmyra Stadion, located north of the Arctic Circle, with an artificial playing field, meant there was still some prospect of a comeback. Two goals in six minutes in the second half killed off any thought of that, with Solanke scoring in the 63rd and Porro adding the second. Spurs last trophy was the League Cup in 2008. Chelsea will play Real Betis in the final of the UEFA Conference League. Chelsea advanced with a 5-1 on aggregate win against Djurgrden  winning the second leg 1-0 through Kiernan Dewsbury-Halls goal. In the other semifinal, Betis drew 2-2 away at Fiorentina after extra time and won 4-3 on aggregate. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/europa-league-man-united-tottenham-59ba06e01da363f926dd278e1163ea79,sports
Capitals look more like themselves in beating the Hurricanes 3-1 in Game 2 to tie series,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Knowing full well the chances of being competitive in their second-round series against the Carolina Hurricanes hung in the balance, the Washington Capitals flipped the script from the opener in a big way in Game 2. Tom Wilson had a monster performance with a couple of blocked shots, an assist on the winning goal and the empty-netter that sealed a 3-1 victory Tuesday night. From Wilson down, the Capitals looked far more like themselves and showed they could skate with the Hurricanes and seize some opportunities needed to beat them. It was much better, theres no doubt about that, coach Spencer Carbery said. We feel like we can punch back. Connor McMichael scored on a breakaway, John Carlson got a power-play goal off a textbook cross-ice pass from Wilson, and Thompson stopped 27 of the 28 shots he faced. The Capitals started slow before starting to look like the top seed in the Eastern Conference, dictating their style and not getting hemmed in their end for long stretches. That was essential after they were they were thoroughly outplayed in the series opener, an overtime loss. The first game didnt go our way, werent too happy with that: Got outplayed pretty bad there, so I think it was a really good response by our group, said McMichael, who scored after the puck hit Hurricanes defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere in the neck. We were moving pucks quicker. I think we werent hanging onto it and looking for the perfect play. We were kind of just getting it out of our zone and forcing them to make plays. 
        
     At the other end of the ice, Thompson kept up his stellar goaltending that helped the Capitals get past Montreal in five games in the first round. Chants of LT! LT! filled the arena just about every time Thompson made a stop and halted play. He kept us in the game, captain Alex Ovechkin said. He gave us confidence. The Hurricanes got 18 saves from Andersen and a power-play goal from Gostisbehere with 10:34 left but could not erase their deficit. The last team this postseason to be perfect on the penalty kill, entering 17 for 17, their streak was broken on Carlsons goal. We werent certainly great, thats for sure, and youve got to give Washington credit  they played a much better game, coach Rod BrindAmour said. They dug in. We knew it was going to be like this. This is not surprising. Just got to regroup. Game 3 is 6 p.m. EDT on Saturday in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Hurricanes won all three of their home games in the first round against New Jersey and 31 of 41 during the season. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-capitals-score-nhl-playoffs-4f1290707e0609c9b2d3833c2b140d26,sports
Anthony Edwards scares the Timberwolves with a sprained ankle before returning in strong finish,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Minnesota Timberwolves have seen Anthony Edwards writhing in pain on the floor several times throughout his career, before eventually welcoming their star guard back to the game. This looked a little different. The sprained left ankle that forced Edwards out in the second quarter of Game 2 against Golden State on Thursday night even gave him a scare. This one, I was really worried about, actually, coach Chris Finch said. There are lots of ways being an elite athlete pays off. Being able to shake those things off is certainly one of them. But this one, I was really planning on not seeing him the rest of the game, to be honest with you. Edwards managed to make it back yet again, causing a roar from the crowd when he walked back onto the court for warmups right before the start of the second half. The 23-year-old finished with 20 points, nine rebounds, five assists and three steals for the Timberwolves in the 117-93 victory over the Warriors that tied the second-round series. That one was crazy, Edwards said. But Ill be all right. Edwards tried to finish a fast break with a layup that Warriors center Trayce Jackson-Davis blocked before landing on Edwards left foot as they both came down. Edwards immediately grabbed for his ankle as he sat on the floor under the basket. He was unable to put weight on his left foot as he was eventually helped off the court, after Golden States Draymond Green even came over to check on him. 
        
     Once Edwards reached the locker room, David Hines, the vice president for medical operations and performance therapy, went to work. Once we got to like the third movement in my ankle, Im like, All right, its starting to feel good. If we tape it, Ill see how it feels, Edwards said. He does a great job of making sure Im good before I get out there, so big shoutout to David. Edwards, a three-time All-Star who was fourth in the NBA in scoring during the regular season, had just seven points on 2-for-7 shooting before he got hurt. His production once he returned was strong enough to assure the Wolves and their fans there wasnt anything to worry about moving forward in the series. Edwards went up to catch a lob from Julius Randle and dropped it in for a layup late in the third quarter, passing an important test for his ankle.  Superman, for real, teammate Jaden McDaniels said. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-timberwolves-edwards-injured-2da26414ccee9ebb3603b6c266cba851,sports
"Moreno hits grand slam off Yamamoto, lifts Diamondbacks to 5-3 win over the Dodgers","PHOENIX (AP)  Gabriel Moreno hit a grand slam off Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Brandon Pfaadt threw 6 1/3 scoreless innings and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3 on Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series between NL West rivals. Shohei Ohtani hit a solo homer in the ninth  his 11th long ball of the season  but the Dodgers have now dropped three of their past five games. Yamamoto (4-3) came into the game with an 0.90 ERA, which led the big leagues, but ran into trouble in the fourth. Pavin Smith walked, Josh Naylor singled and Eugenio Surez was hit by a pitch with no outs before Moreno drove a cutter to right, barely clearing the fence for his first homer of the season. Ketel Marte added a solo homer in the fifth to make it 5-0. Kevin Ginkel worked the ninth for his first save of the year. Pfaadt (6-2) continued his stellar start to the season, giving up four hits, walking three and striking out six. Yamamoto gave up five runs on six hits and a walk, striking out four. Max Muncys ground-rule double and Andy Pages single both scored runs as the Dodgers cut the margin to 5-2 in the eighth. Michael Conforto grounded into a double play to end the rally. The Dodgers were threatening in the eighth before Marte started a spectacular double play to end the threat. The second baseman ranged to his left and snagged Confortos grounder before wheeling and firing to Geraldo Perdomo at second, whose throw to Naylor at first was just in time. 
        
     The Diamondbacks won their 20th game of the year. The NL West is the only division that has four teams with 20-plus wins. The other team is the Colorado Rockies, who are 6-31. RHP Roki Sasaki (1-1, 3.86 ERA) will start for the Dodgers against LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (1-3, 5.92) and the Diamondbacks on Friday night. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-diamondbacks-score-8447f531cb087956ead2ca2affe4f132,sports
"Marsh, Turner have RBIs in 10th inning as Phillies sweep Rays with 7-6 win","TAMPA, Fla. (AP)  Brandon Marsh and Trea Turner each had two hits and drove in a run in the 10th inning to cap a comeback from four runs down and lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a 7-6 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday night. Philadelphia tied the score in the ninth, handing Pete Fairbanks his first blown save in nine opportunities. After Kyle Schwarber led off with a single to extend his on-base streak to 43 games, the Phillies lifted him for pinch runner Johan Rojas. Fairbanks then sailed a pickoff attempt over first base, allowing Rojas to advance to third and score on Max Keplers RBI grounder. Marsh led off the 10th with a double to left-center off Manuel Rodriguez (0-1) to drive in pinch-runner Edmundo Sosa, and he scored two batters later on Turners single to center. Junior Caminero hit a solo homer for Tampa Bay in the first and Yandy Daz hit a three-run shot in the seventh to give the Rays a 5-1 lead. Bryson Stott hit a three-run homer, his second hit of the game, off Edwin Uceta to cut the Rays lead to 5-4 in the eighth.  Matt Strahm gave up a run in a shaky 10th and stranded the tying run on second to register his second save. Philadelphia has won nine of its last 11 and handed the Rays their seventh straight loss at Steinbrenner Field, their temporary home this season.  With the score tied in the bottom of the ninth, Taylor Walls singled off Jose Alvarado (4-1). Then, J.T. Realmuto threw out Walls stealing second on a pitch that struck out Diaz. Replay review upheld the Tampa Bay challenge, which appeared to lack definitive footage to overturn the call. Alvarado retired Christopher Morel to send the game to extra innings. 
        
     Phillies starter Jess Luzardo had pitched 40 1/3 innings without allowing a home run until the first inning, when Caminero launched his 2-1 fastball over the left-field wall. Phillies RHP Aaron Nola (1-5, 4.61 ERA) goes against Guardians RHP Gavin Williams (2-2, 5.06). The Rays continue their homestand against Milwaukee, starting RHP Zack Littell (2-5, 4.61) against Brewers LHP Jos Quintana (4-1, 2.83). ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/phillies-rays-score-94b0872d319050c46db25ebc95eae95b,sports
"Gilgeous-Alexander scores 34 as Thunder roll past Nuggets 149-106, tie West semis at 1-1","OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points in three quarters, and the Oklahoma City Thunder set league and team records in a 149-106 win over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night that tied the Western Conference semifinal series at one game apiece. Oklahoma City set an NBA playoff record for first-half points with 87, surpassing the 86 scored by the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Golden State Warriors in Game 4 of the NBA Finals on June 9, 2017. Chet Holmgren, who missed two critical free throws late in Game 1, made a pair with one second remaining in the second quarter to set the record and give the Thunder an 87-56 lead. The Thunder tied the record for points in any half of a playoff game. Milwaukee had 87 in the second half against Denver on April 23, 1978. Basically it was one team playing tonight, Denver center Nikola Jokic said.  The top-seeded Thunder wanted to avoid taking a 2-0 deficit on the road. Oklahoma City became the first home team to win a game in the second round. Game 3 is Friday in Denver. We knew what was at stake tonight, Gilgeous-Alexander said. We came out desperate. We wanted to just take care and control the things that we knew we could. And we did a pretty good job of that, specifically to start the game. The start carried us through the rest of the night.  Gilgeous-Alexander made 11 of 13 field goals, all 11 of his free throws and had eight assists. He led eight players who scored in double figures. 
        
     Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Gilgeous-Alexander did much more than score. He made them pay when they overhelped on him, Daigneault said. He had the ball ahead of them all night, so he got his teammates shots, too. It wasnt just a one-man show. He was super efficient. I mean, he had an unbelievable blend tonight. Jokic, who had 42 points and 22 rebounds in a Game 1 win, had just 17 points and eight rebounds on Wednesday before fouling out late in the third quarter. Russell Westbrook led the Nuggets with 19 points. Oklahoma Citys crowd cheered for the ex-Thunder star when he entered Game 1 as a reserve, but the fans changed their approach and booed him shortly after he entered Game 2. Westbrook got called for a technical foul moments later, and Gilgeous-Alexander made the free throw to make it 34-13. The Thunder led 45-21 at the end of the first quarter after shooting 71.4% from the field and setting a team record for points in a quarter in a playoff game. We got punked, and we didnt play well enough and they came out with the right intensity, Denver interim coach David Adelman said. We didnt. Oklahoma City continued its dominance in the second quarter. A lob from Gilgeous-Alexander to Jalen Williams for a two-handed jam gave the Thunder a 78-43 lead. Oklahoma City led 124-76 after three quarters. The largest lead was 49 points.  Adelman said he wouldnt minimize the loss, even though the Nuggets head back to Denver with home-court advantage. Im not sitting here tonight talking about the 1-1 thing tonight, he said. Not tonight. Were not going to flush that. Weve got to be better. We know that. That being said, its nice to know that you got a win underneath your belt. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nuggets-thunder-score-nba-playoffs-50b7f402e366173a4971cb21302fbc59,sports
Dolphins release long snapper Blake Ferguson among four roster cuts,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  The Miami Dolphins released Blake Ferguson on Thursday, parting ways with the long snapper after five seasons. Ferguson, a sixth-round pick by Miami in 2020, was one of four players the Dolphins cut on Thursday to clear roster space. Cornerback Ryan Cooper Jr., defensive tackle Neil Farrell and offensive lineman Chasen Hines were also released. Ferguson appeared in 72 games with Miami, recording eight special teams tackles and one special teams fumble recovery. He did not play the second half of last season because of an undisclosed medical issue, and the Dolphins used practice squad long snappers in his place. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/dolphins-blake-ferguson-e4df84874b8812f9b7e3ae1abdd342b6,sports
Knicks take a 2-0 lead over the Celtics after coming from 20 down again to win 91-90,"BOSTON (AP)  For the second straight game, the New York Knicks found themselves in a hole the Boston Celtics have rarely let teams out of this season. The Knicks again found a way  almost the same way, in fact  to pull off the improbable. And now they are two wins away from knocking the defending champions out of the playoffs. Mikal Bridges sealed another 20-point comeback with his second straight game-ending steal and the Knicks stunned the Celtics again Wednesday night, winning 91-90 for a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Just finding ways to win, Bridges said.  Jalen Brunson scored 17 points for New York and made two free throws with 12.7 seconds left for a 91-90 lead. Jayson Tatum then couldnt get to the rim and Bridges moved in to bat the ball away and recover it.  Bridges also scored all of his 14 points in the fourth quarter. Josh Hart had 23 points and Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 21 points and 17 rebounds for the Knicks, who will host Game 3 on Saturday.  Going home we realize the opportunity we have. We just have to stay locked in, Brunson said. Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored 20 points apiece for the Celtics, who were 10 for 40 from 3-point range after going 15 for 60 in Game 1. Tatum was limited to 13 points on 5-for-19 shooting for the Celtics, who went more than eight minutes without a field goal in the fourth quarter. They missed 13 consecutive shots during the stretch. 
        
     Teams that win the first two games of a best-of-seven series on the road win the series 85.7% of the time. The Knicks took the opener when Bridges stole the ball away from Brown with a second left in overtime. Opportunity to show what were made of, Brown said of a Boston team that swept New York 4-0 in the regular season. Weve got to respond. Kristaps Porzingis didnt start after sitting out the second half of Game 1 with an illness. He came off the bench for just the fifth time in his NBA career and finished with eight points and four rebounds in 14 minutes. All eyes were on the Celtics offense after they missed an NBA playoff-record 45 3-pointers in their Game 1 loss. They went 24 for 54 from 2-point range Wednesday.  Despite their shooting struggles, the Celtics found some traction late in the third quarter, using a 16-6 run  keyed by their effort on the defensive end  to turn a 10-point lead into a 73-53 advantage late in the period. It was 84-68 after Payton Pritchards 3-pointer with 8:40 to play but the Celtics wouldnt make another basket until Tatums driving dunk with 18.5 seconds remaining.  New York cut it to 86-82 on a floater by Hart before Towns three-point play cut it to 86-85. Tatum missed a jumper, and Brunson made an 18-footer to put New York in front.  A jumper by Brown rolled off the rim on Bostons next trip up the floor. Brunson then found a lane to the basket and dropped in a layup to make it 89-86.  Tatum connected on a pair of free throws and then got it back following a New York miss that rolled out of bounds with 24.2 seconds left. Trailing 89-88, Tatum pushed the ball in to the front court and drove easily past Mitchell Robinson for a dunk to put the Celtics back in front.  Brunson was fouled and connected on both free throws.  Hart said they are going home knowing they can still play better. I dont even think we know what were capable of, he said.  ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-knicks-celtics-score-da5620e1a2559de5058f2ec5f7835579,sports
The Steelers move on from George Pickens by trading mercurial receiver to Cowboys,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  The Pittsburgh Steelers have run out patience with wide receiver George Pickens, agreeing Wednesday on a trade that sends the talented but mercurial 24-year-old to the Dallas Cowboys. The Steelers will get a third-round pick in the 2026 draft and a fifth-rounder in 2027. The Cowboys get a sixth-round choice in two years. The trade was first reported by ESPN. Pickens is about to enter the final year of the rookie deal he signed in 2022 when the Steelers took the former Georgia star in the second round. The 6-foot-3, 200-pound Pickens has spent his first three seasons in the NFL being equal parts productive and petulant, mixing highlight-reel catches with bouts of immaturity along the way. Pickens joins a Cowboys offense that could use another downfield threat to pair with star CeeDee Lamb. Dallas second-leading pass catcher behind Lamb last year was tight end Jake Ferguson, with Jalen Tolberts modest 49 receptions a distant third. Dallas didnt address the need for a No. 2 receiver in the draft, with first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer saying he liked the youth that was already on the roster. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones made reference before the draft to substantive trades the Cowboys were pursuing. This qualifies as one. The Steelers, particularly head coach Mike Tomlin, often backed Pickens as he endured what the team frequently described as a version of growing pains while he adjusted to life in the NFL. 
        
     Pickens has been one of the most dynamic receivers in the league when hes on the field and engaged, which is not always a given. Pickens led the league by averaging 18.1 yards per catch in 2023 and has 174 receptions for 2,841 yards and 12 scores in 48 games. Yet hes also consistently struggled to keep his emotions in check. Last season alone he twice ended games by getting into dust-ups with opposing defensive backs, first when he grabbed Dallas Jourdan Lewis by the facemask and then when he tussled with Clevelands Greg Newsome II rather than try to get in position for a last-second Hail Mary. That doesnt include a fine for using an expletive on his eye black against the Cowboys, a rule he said he was unaware of at the time. Pickens also drew widespread criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates. Considering his volatility, the Steelers didnt seem interested in signing Pickens to a contract extension and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March, whom they promptly signed to a five-year contract. ___ AP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon in Dallas contributed to this report. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/pittsburgh-steelers-dallas-cowboys-george-pickens-2fd4c79337748c82b66994180c6999aa,sports
Rams sign former Eagles kick returner Britain Covey to a 1-year deal,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Kick returner and receiver Britain Covey agreed to a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Rams on Monday. Covey spent the past three seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, who signed him as an undrafted free agent out of Utah. Covey returned two punts for the Eagles in the Super Bowl as a rookie in February 2023, and he led the NFL in punt return yardage during the 2023 season after being released and fighting his way back onto the roster from the Eagles practice squad. He missed all but five games last season because of a shoulder injury that was followed by a neck injury. He went on injured reserve in late December, sidelining him for Philadelphias Super Bowl championship run. Covey averaged 11.3 yards per punt return over the past three seasons, the fourth-highest mark in the NFL during that stretch. He also had 11 receptions for 76 yards while playing in 38 games during his Eagles tenure. Receiver Xavier Smith was the Rams primary punt returner last season, returning 16 punts for 149 yards. Los Angeles returned just 18 punts last season, the fewest in the NFL, while its 161 yards of punt returns were the third fewest. Covey was a prolific receiver and one of the nations top kick returners during his five collegiate seasons with the Utes. He made a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the Rose Bowl against Ohio State. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/rams-britain-covey-e8e808b5a41d079795e311e70e1720a3,sports
Former NFL coach Jon Gruden taking on ownership-advisory role with Nashvilles arena football team,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  Jon Gruden is getting back into professional football. The former NFL coach is joining the Nashville Kats of the Arena Football One league as both a part-owner and what the club called consulting and advisory roles in all aspects of the teams football and business operations. Gruden, 61, hasnt been involved in a U.S. professional team in an official capacity since resigning as head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders midway through the 2021 season over emails he sent before being hired that included racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments. Gruden did some consulting with the New Orleans Saints in 2023 but did not officially join the staff. The Super Bowl-winning coach later filed a lawsuit against the NFL, claiming contract interference and conspiracy. A three-justice panel of the Nevada Supreme Court sided 2-1 with the NFL last year, ruling the league could force the civil case out of state court and into private arbitration that might be overseen by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Gruden appealed the decision, and the lawsuit will not be reviewed by the full seven-person court. The Gruden family has deep ties to the AFL. Jons younger brother, Jay, won four league titles as a player and two more as a coach in the 1990s and early 2000s before eventually moving on to a coaching career in the NFL. The Nashville Kats, who announced Grudens partnership on Monday, have an ownership group that includes former Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher, who also serves as the Kats president. 
        
     I have been a fan of indoor football for a long time and jumped at the opportunity to be involved with Jeff and the Nashville Kats as part of the ownership group, Gruden said. I have so much respect for what Jeff has done over his career and continues to do with the Nashville Kats and as commissioner of AF1. Im excited to be part of the team. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/john-gruden-arena-football-d402d71fa645a75bf972cd7a2d6ae5ad,sports
Caitlin Clarks return to Iowa for Fever preseason game commands average paid ticket price of $440,"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP)  Caitlin Clark fans will have to pay a premium on the secondary market if they want to be at Carver-Hawkeye Arena for Sundays matchup between the WNBAs Indiana Fever and the Brazilian national team. The average paid price of $440 per ticket on the secondary market as of Wednesday has made it the most in-demand event involving Clark, according to ticketing technology company Victory Live, which analyzes sales across the secondary market. Clark will be playing on the court where she rose to stardom with the Iowa Hawkeyes. The all-time leading scorer in Division I history is from West Des Moines and played for the Hawkeyes from 2020-24. She was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft and the leagues rookie of the year. Asking prices on the secondary market Wednesday for the preseason game ranged from $146 to $2,368.

Victory Live also reported that the average paid price for a Fever away game in the 2025 season was $272, up from $171 in 2024.

Phoenix Mercury are heading into new era without Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner,"PHOENIX (AP)  The Phoenix Mercury will open their first season in 21 years without Diana Taurasi. Shes busy at home enjoying the first few months of retirement. Theres also no Brittney Griner for the first time since 2012. The game-changing center is now wearing an Atlanta Dream uniform. Two of the greatest players of their generation are gone, sending the Mercury into an uncharted new era. I came here with a lot of new faces, a lot of hungry people, new Mercury forward Alyssa Thomas said Wednesday during the teams media day. Its just going to be fun to be part of an organization thats known for winning has multiple championships and, just overall, has been the top of this thing for a long time. The Mercury had a good run with Taurasi and Griner. Taurasi staked her claim as one of the greatest players in womens basketball history since the Mercury selected her with the No. 1 overall pick of the 2004 WNBA draft. In the 20 years that followed, she racked up six Olympic gold medals, three league championships and numerous records before calling it a career earlier this year. The 6-foot-9 Griner was a force during her 11-year stay in the desert, throwing down dunks and swatting shots like no other player while helping the Mercury win their most recent championship, in 2014. She opted to test free agency and signed a one-year contract with the Dream, hoping to set herself up for a bigger contract when the leagues new collective bargaining deal is in place next year. Those are two big holes to fill, but general manager Nick URen already had the wheels in motion to start the Mercurys new era. 
        
     Phoenix first acquired Thomas in a trade with Connecticut, adding a veteran do-everything forward whos the WNBAs career leader with 15 triple-doubles. The 6-2 forward played her entire 11-year career with the Sun, leading them to the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022, and earned a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer. With Taurasis retirement looming, Phoenix pulled off a three-way trade that brought Sabally to the desert. The 6-4 forward was an All-WNBA first-teamer in 2023, then averaged 17.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.0 assists in a 2024 season limited to 15 games because of a shoulder injury. Pushing through uncomfortable times really makes us stronger and we are the pros at pushing through adversity, Sabally said. I think Ive been through a lot in my life, but it just really makes you appreciate times like this even more. Rounding out Phoenixs new Big Three is Kahleah Copper, a dynamic scorer and leader. The 6-1 small forward was a three-time All-Star with Chicago before being traded to Phoenix, where she had a massive impact in just one season. Copper was the WNBAs third-leading scorer at 21.1 points per game last season and became a leader on a team that already had two of the games best players. She also has a WNBA title under her belt, helping the Sky beat the Mercury in the 2021 finals. Now that Taurasi and Griner are gone, Copper fully will take the reins as the teams leader, pushing teammates new and old to continue the Mercurys long history of winning. I think youre really going to see her kind of like spread her wings and take pride, second-year Mercury coach Nate Tibbetts said. Youve seen it this whole offseason, adding the free agents, and shes really kind of bought into what were about. The Mercury had no choice but to take a new direction with Taurasi and Griner gone. Theyre hoping the new core can lead the franchise along the same winning direction. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/phoenix-mercury-wnba-5750713e32e8fe5247f5d4fb359d6f85,sports
"Road, sweet road: Visiting teams go 4-0 in Game 1 of NBA conference semifinals, a league first","Road, sweet road. Home-court advantage? It doesnt exist so far in the NBA conference semifinals  where visiting teams combined to go 4-0 in Game 1s, the first time that has happened during this round in the leagues playoff history. Indiana beat top-seeded Cleveland on Sunday in the opener of that East series, New York beat defending champion Boston and Denver beat West top-seeded Oklahoma City in their respective openers Monday, and Golden State topped Minnesota in Game 1 of their matchup Tuesday. Its an amazing group of guys, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after Golden States win, one that came with Stephen Curry out for much of the game with a strained hamstring. So far in these playoffs, road teams have gone 23-25. Thats on pace to be the third-best overall road playoff record in NBA postseason history, not counting the bubble season of 2020 when nobody technically was at home. 
        
     Road teams had gone 3-1 in the Round 2 openers of the NBA playoffs on three other occasions  2023, 2015 and 2011  in the current playoff format, which dates to 1984. (It also happened inside the bubble during the 2020 playoffs, when teams had home and road designations, but games were on neutral floors inside Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.) But 4-0 has never happened, until now. I always say a playoff series doesnt start until someone wins a road game, Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton said. Well, weve won two. 
        
     Thats true: Indiana doubled down on its road success by also taking Game 2 at Cleveland on Tuesday night, just before Golden State lost Stephen Curry early but won Game 1 at Minnesota. And all that led to even more road history: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday became the first three-day stretch in NBA playoff history where visiting teams combined to go at least 6-0. That run started Sunday with Indianas Game 1 win at Cleveland, then Golden States Game 7 road win at Houston in the conclusion of the first round of the playoffs. The wins by New York and Denver were Monday, then Indiana and Golden State won again on Tuesday. This team has fought all year, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. Its been a pretty good road team. Theyre not alone. Not this year, anyway, and this trend didnt start in these playoffs. Home teams won 54% of games in the regular season, the fourth time the leaguewide home winning percentage has dipped that low in the last five years. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-road-wins-058bbd4308df6252072ebe41c7690b15,sports
Wild GM Guerin aims for Kaprizov extension and aggressive summer spending with cap constraints gone,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP)  The Minnesota Wild have entered a critical offseason, able to fully participate in free agency again after two years of significant salary cap constraints. Without an NHL playoff series win in the last 10 years, the urgency for the club to build a deeper roster around a promising young core is high  putting the pressure on general manager Bill Guerin this summer and into the upcoming season. Im more excited than anything. Its been a long couple years, just dealing with this stuff and honestly just hearing about it, said Guerin, who has been in his role for six years. I want high expectations. Im not doing this job sit in the corner or anything. These are big jobs. These are important jobs. Theres a lot of people out there who love the Minnesota Wild, and Im trying to deliver something to them. We all are. The first order of business is clear: an extension for Kirill Kaprizov. The star left wing has one year left on his current contract. Im very confident were going to get a deal done with Kirill. I think he really loves this market and this team, Guerin said on Tuesday at Xcel Energy Center, five days after the Wild were eliminated on their home ice. I think he feels that were going in the right direction. Kaprizov, who has 386 points in 319 regular season games and 21 points in 25 playoff games with the Wild, said as much over the weekend. 
        
     I love everything here, Kaprizov said. Should be all good. The Wild barely got in the playoffs in part because Kaprizov missed half of the season with a lower-body injury that required surgery. With five goals and four assists in the six-game loss to Vegas in the first-round series, Kaprizov made clear he was fully recovered. He just wants to win, and I think this was a promising sign that our team can do it. We can get there. Were so close, said left wing Marcus Foligno, reflecting on the three straight one-goal losses that finished the series, including two in overtime. Ive got 100% confidence that well get him here long term. Or Ill just rip up his visa. Guerin made the bold move four years ago of buying out the contracts of franchise cornerstones Zach Parise and Ryan Suter. The fresh start for team chemistry came at a cost, particularly for the last two seasons with the buyout charges accounting for about 17% of their salary cap. Those hits will be drastically reduced for 2025-26 and beyond until theyre gone. I like to be aggressive. I dont want to sit on my hands at all. Im kind of tired of doing that, Guerin said. Since I walked through the door, my goal has been to build a championship-caliber team for this market, and thats what I want to do. I dont want to sign any stupid contracts or anything like that, but I want to make this team better than it is today. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/wild-guerin-kaprizov-salary-cap-d8d3c353404578477610ab34e1bbb6d5,sports
Paige Bueckers raised expectations and excitement level for Dallas Wings months before WNBA draft,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  Paige Bueckers raised the expectations and excitement level for the Dallas Wings and their fans many months before she was even drafted by the WNBA team. It started with the viral video of new Wings general manager Curt Millers reaction when the franchise won the draft lottery for the No. 1 overall pick only days after he was hired.  I absolutely lost my mind. ... We knew what that meant at that moment, the GM says even now.  That was in November, when Bueckers was only three games into the three-time AP All-Americans final season at UConn, which ended with the Huskies 12th national championship and coach Geno Auriemmas sixth No. 1 overall pick in the WNBA draft. Within days after the draft lottery  five months before the April 14 draft, and six months before the May 16 season opener  the Wings had sold out their season ticket allotment. The team also has an expanded regional TV broadcast deal to reach 6.2 million homes, and will move into a renovated arena in downtown Dallas next season.  Bueckers is generating the same kind of buzz around the Wings that Caitlin Clark did as the No. 1 overall pick for the Indiana Fever last year, when they made the playoffs for the first time in eight years. Clark was the WNBA Rookie of the Year, and was The Associated Press 2024 Female Athlete of the Year.  Shes going to impact us, and she just impacts winning, Miller said of Bueckers, referring to her as a humble superstar. 
        
     Arike Ogunbowale, the fifth overall pick by the Wings in 2019, was the All-Star Game MVP last season and second in the WNBA with 22.2 points a game. She is also one of only three returning players with Dallas coming off a 9-31 season and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2020.  The Wings did acquire DiJonai Carrington from Connecticut in a multiteam trade after she earned the leagues Most Improved Player Award last season. They also signed seven-year veteran and 2019 WNBA champion Myisha Hines-Allen in free agency. Theres a lot of new, theres going to be a new facility, new arena, new GM, new coaching staff ... mostly an entire new team, Bueckers said. So just to build from where we are now, continue to build for the future. ... Dallas is a sports city, so you feel the love already and the support and the excitement. Bueckers and the Wings other four draft picks were introduced last week before the start of training camp in a packed lobby at Dallas City Hall that included the mayor. The rally-like event was held only a couple of blocks from the historic downtown arena being fully renovated for the team, part of a 15-year agreement the Dallas City Council approved last year to facilitate the teams move to its namesake city.  Still, Bueckers isnt getting caught up in what everyone else expects from her as the No. 1 overall pick.  The best thing I did last year was build my approach to the game and my ability to not care about expectations, and not set any expectations, because then you set a ceiling of what you can accomplish or what you want to look like, she said.  But just maximizing what I am every single day, trying to get better every single day, trying to get better as an organization, as a team, as an individual player, and growing every single day, is all that Im really worried about. Miller knows Bueckers, like every new WNBA player, will have to make plenty of adjustments as a first-time pro, such as new rules and a different speed and physicality to the game.  Caitlin was one of the outliers that the adjustment was quicker for her, Miller said. Therell be an adjustment, therell be a spotlight on her. But shes handled so much of that throughout her young career already. Bueckers has plenty of people to turn to who have been where she is now.  I mostly talk to a lot of the UConn alums, and just being a part of that network, she said. And theyve been through every single thing that you can imagine with everybody whos been through there. So leaning on them a lot and obviously just embracing your own journey. The Wings in February announced their new television carrier in Dallas-Fort Worth market would be the same as the NBAs Dallas Mavericks, and since the draft said that network has expanded to 12 markets in Texas. Wings CEO and managing partner Greg Bibb said that is the largest footprint for WNBA local broadcasts in league history.  Bibb said the Wings also finalized the largest sponsorship agreement in organization history, with financial service provider Albert becoming their official jersey patch partner in what he called an eight-figure deal over the next five years.  A month before Bueckers was drafted, the Wings announced their June 27 game against Clark and the Fever would be at the 20,000-seat American Airlines Center, the home of the NBAs Mavericks.  Clark played in the Final Four with Iowa in that building two years ago. When the Fever return to North Texas on August 1, that game is still set for the Wings normal 6,251-seat home arena on the UT-Arlington campus.  ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/paige-bueckers-wnba-dallas-wings-5962cc1a2b088b6bc7c6346deaebc5f1,sports
The stars are still aligned in golf as the PGA Championship nears,"A different month, a different major and the stars are still aligned. Bryson DeChambeau finally cashed in on a Sunday, losing a five-shot lead before pulling ahead on the final three holes to win in South Korea. This was three weeks after Rory McIlroy picked up a Masters green jacket and the career Grand Slam. It was about 13 hours before Scottie Scheffler destroyed the field in Dallas. And as somewhat of a footnote, Jordan Spieth shot a 62 on the final day in Dallas that only stoked conversation about the chances of another career Grand Slam. The PGA Championship starts in nine days. Scottie is on a great run. Joaquin Niemann is on a great run. Jon Rahm has been playing well, DeChambeau said after his victory at LIV Golf Korea. Theres a lot of star-studded talent out there right now thats going to be in the PGA Championship. Were going to be battling it out. Most peculiar was how DeChambeau included Niemann  three wins in LIV Golf this year, but still without a top-10 finish in his 23 starts in the majors  and left out McIlroy, whose three wins this year have come at Pebble Beach, The Players Championship and the Masters. DeChambeau played with McIlroy in the final round at Augusta National, where he took the lead after two holes before fading to a 75 to finish four shots behind. He later said when asked about the dynamic in their pairing that McIlroy wouldnt talk to me. 
        
     Rahm has yet to finish out of the top 10 at LIV Golf, but he has gone quiet in the majors since joining the Saudi-funded league. Hes still Jon Rahm, however. It all sets up for high intrigue going into the second major of the year. That hasnt always been the case for the PGA Championship whether it was held in May or August. The Masters is forever linked with Augusta National and decades of high drama. The U.S. Open bills itself as the toughest test in golf, sometimes to a fault. The British Open is played on a links course. And how is the PGA Championship best defined? The other one, Geoff Ogilvy once said. The Masters, of course, will be hard to top the way it played out. McIlroy, with his best chance at the career slam, fell behind, built a big lead, shockingly lost his big lead, rallied with two magnificent shots and eventually won a playoff over Justin Rose. McIlroy is still buzzing over finally winning the green jacket, which he wore during appearances last week on NBCs Today and The Tonight Show, the latter with host Jimmy Fallon in which McIlroy replicated chipping into a washing machine from when he was a wee lad in Northern Ireland. The career Grand Slam is in the books. Is the calendar Grand Slam in play? Only four players since the modern slam came to life in 1960  Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Spieth  have even won the first two legs. The PGA Championship is at Quail Hollow, where McIlroy already has won four times. But he is no longer the betting favorite one week out. BetMGM Sportsbook has Scheffler as a slight favorite after a brand of golf from the No. 1 player not seen since last year. Scheffler missed two months recovering from minor surgery after he punctured his right hand while making ravioli. Something had been missing in his game since his return. But it was all there in Dallas, and it was frightening for those who had to face it. Scheffler was poised to break the PGA Tour scoring record of 72 holes until a chip rolled back to his feet on the 17th (bogey) and he failed to birdie the 18th (his first time all week not making birdie or better on a par 5). He still tied the mark at 253 and won by eight. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction, Scheffler said. Im excited to start the rest of the season. Its May and hes talking about a starting point. Three majors are still to come, and the PGA Championship could be a great indicator where this is headed. BetMGM Sportsbook has Scheffler at +400, with McIlroy at +500. That could change after this week because McIlroy is playing at Philadelphia Cricket Club and Scheffler is not. DeChambeau was listed at +1200 and always worth noticing. He had a burden lifted in South Korea, not just because it was his first win since the U.S. Open last year, but because it was his fourth straight time in the final group (in LIV Golf with its shotgun start, that means starting on the first hole). His scoring average the previous three times was 73.7. And then he shot 30 on the back nine in South Korea and won by two. Next stop: the PGA Championship, where last year in Kentucky DeChambeau was every bit the entertainer and lost to Xander Schauffeles birdie putt on the final hole. As for Spieth, hes still hard to predict as he returns from wrist surgery last August. But a 62 in the final round suggests his game isnt too far off. The only scars from Dallas might be spending the first two days with Scheffler. Spieth opened with rounds of 67-69 and was 12 shots behind. It wasnt that long ago I was definitely better than him, and now Im definitely not right now, Spieth said. I hate admitting that about anybody, but I just watched it those first two rounds, and Ive got to get better. Its very inspiring. Gary Player (1965) and Nicklaus (1966) completed the career Grand Slam one year apart. Is it possible for that to happen one month apart? As is often said about the Masters, the PGA Championship cant start soon enough. ___ On The Fringe analyzes the biggest topics in golf during the season.

No team orders: McLaren plans to let em race as Piastri and Norris battle for F1 championship,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Just five races into the Formula 1 season and theres already a compelling championship battle with inner organization implications. Oscar Piastri has aggressively shown he wont sit behind teammate Lando Norris, allowing Norris to become the anointed No. 1 driver at McLaren Racing. The Aussie did it by winning three of the first five races this season to take hold of the lead in the driver standings. Norris, at one time McLarens designated champion-in-waiting, sits 10 points back from Piastri with one victory on the season. And as F1 shifts to the United States for the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, McLaren boss Zak Brown insisted there will be no internal issues with this championship fight and, for now, hell let it play out naturally. Let em race, Brown vowed to The Associated Press. He will not designate a No. 1 and issue any team orders until a time comes in which one of the drivers has clearly separated himself in the title race. Well only make that decision if it becomes clear, like it did last year at a certain point, Brown said. Until then they will get the same treatment. There may be instances when one has an upgrade that the other doesnt have yet, but thats the extent of it right now. We want to let them race. Norris earned his first career victory at Miami last year when he snapped Max Verstappens two-race winning streak at the event staged around Hard Rock Stadium. Norris, hyped as McLarens great hope, had picked up the derogatory moniker Lando No Wins when he arrived in Miami, where he promptly shed the label and had a rowdy South Beach victory celebration. 
        
     I kind of envy Lando for getting his first race win here, because Im sure Sunday night was definitely a cool one, said rival Pierre Gasly. Its one of those races you want the Sunday to go well so you get a good reason to party on Sunday night. How was Norris party?  I dont remember, he said with a sheepish grin.  Norris was then asked if hes concerned that Piastri has seized momentum by winning three races since Norris lone victory. Not worried at all. Hes doing a good job and he deserves it. Nothing more than that, Norris said. I dont believe so much in the momentum stuff. Im doing what I can. Ive clearly made some mistakes and not at the level I need to be, but I believe I can be at that level soon enough. Its round six of 24. Im not going to say that forever, but I know I need to get a move on and get into gear a little bit, Norris continued. The speed is there, the pace is there, the race pace is definitely there. Its just one thing I need to tidy up. Its a difficult thing, but Im confident Ill get it. Lewis Hamiltons move to Ferrari this season has been slow going for the seven-time champion and hes admitted the struggles shown so far could continue the entire year. Hamilton is in his first year with Ferrari after 12 seasons at Mercedes. He won the sprint race in Shanghai with Ferrari but has yet to log a top-four finish in any Grand Prix. Hamilton trails teammate Charles Leclerc by 16 points in the driver standings. He likened his current transitioning to when he first joined Mercedes. The first six months were tough getting attuned to working with new people. Obviously, the engineers Im working with now are used to setting up a car for a different driver and a different driving style, and Im used to driving a car with a different driving style, Hamilton said. So its a combination of a bunch of different things. Im definitely working hard to adjust to this one for sure. Hes also trying to adjust to spending more time in Italy, a country where hes struggling to learn the language but gorging on the food. Trying to stay off the pizzas and the pasta, which Im not doing very well with, Hamilton said. I had like three pizzas in two days. I have my hookup  he keeps bringing me a pizza. Not living in Italy currently, but spending more time is still something I really want to try and figure out how to do through the year, he continued. My Italian is not really progressing, so Ive probably got to throw myself more into the thick of it. But the teams been well. Lots of changes, a huge amount of work has been going on from my first days there. F1 president Stefano Domenicali said he had no update to give on the series ongoing efforts to find a television partner in the United States. ESPN is in the final year of its current contract with F1 but informed the series it would not be renewing for 2026. ESPN reportedly pays Formula One Management an estimated $75 million to $90 million annually for the rights to air F1 content in the U.S. Domenicali has been touting the importance of F1s positioning in North America, and the series has dramatically grown the last five years. F1 now races three times a year in the U.S.  and announced a 10-year extension with Miami on Friday that takes the race through 2041  and five times total in North America. F1 next season will also have both Ford and General Motors in the series  Ford as a support partner with Red Bull and Cadillac as a factory-backed 11th team. There are discussions in place and there are several partners that are interested to talk, Domenicali said Friday. The good news is that there is a lot of interest and we need to make sure we are credible in the landscape where we know very well there are major league sports that are very, very important for this market. We need to find the right place with the right content to offer the supportive fans in the U.S. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-mclaren-hamilton-verstappen-ab372bbce36310559304569b9b5492a5,sports

Timberwolves beat Curry-less Warriors 117-93 in Game 2 to even series,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Minnesota Timberwolves were stewing over their rough start in Game 1 against Golden State, a reaction coach Chris Finch was pleased to see. Julius Randle had 24 points and 11 assists to help the Timberwolves capitalize on Warriors star Stephen Currys absence in a 117-93 victory Thursday that tied the second-round series at a game apiece. The foundation was laid in an ornery film session with Finch and his staff the day before. He was unhappy, and he let us know he was unhappy, and we felt that, Randle said. We were pretty motivated as a team. Anthony Edwards finished with 20 points after an injury scare for the Wolves, who more than tripled their 3-point output (going 16 for 37) from their Game 1 loss when Curry was sidelined by a left hamstring strain that likely will keep him out at least until next week. Nickeil Alexander-Walker added 20 points to spearhead a superb performance by the bench, combining with Donte DiVincenzo and Naz Reid to go 10 for 22 from deep.  We looked a lot more like ourselves, Finch said. Jonathan Kuminga (18 points) and Trayce Jackson-Davis (15) combined to shoot 14 for 17 from the floor for the Warriors. They took nearly five minutes to score, finally breaking through down 13-0 on Jimmy Butlers 3-pointer. With the NBAs career leading 3-point shooter next to him on the bench, coach Steve Kerr used a kitchen-sink experiment with 14 players getting time. 
        
     But I would still like to win, Butler said. I think the biggest lesson is dont start off in a hole like we did tonight, and the game maybe could have ended up a little bit differently. Kuminga, the seventh overall pick in the 2021 draft who dropped out of the rotation at times during the regular season and missed significant time with a sprained right ankle, was a bright spot off the bench. But this Warriors team was already thin on offense with a healthy Curry.  We have to figure out what were going to be able to do in this series without Steph, Kerr said. So we gave a lot of people a lot of chances, and some guys really stepped up.  Against the Wolves and their athletic, long and versatile defense, there wasnt much to lean on. Without Curry to worry about, the Wolves had an easier time keeping shooters Buddy Hield and Brandin Podziemski quiet. The Warriors put up their lowest first-quarter score (15) in the playoffs since Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals, according to Sportradar, when they had 11 in a loss to Cleveland. Draymond Green picked up his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, two short of an automatic one-game suspension, for elbowing Naz Reid after Reid had just fouled him. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-timberwolves-score-a2bb1ddb63982e7dd6a3fc64cfaf6c29,sports
Jeeno Thitikul happy to see putts go in and lead at Liberty National with a 64,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP)  Jeeno Thitikul of Thailand feels so much better when she sees putts going in, and Thursday was an happy occasion at the Mizuho Americas Open. She took only 26 putts, eight of them for birdie, in a clean start of 8-under 64 to lead by two shots. Thitikul was bogey-free at Liberty National and had the advantage of playing in the morning with virtually no wind on the course across the Hudson River from Manhattan. She finished strong, dropping a short iron into 5 feet on the 17th and judging the distance perfectly on the closing hole with a shot that stayed below the hole and left her only about 3 feet for birdie. Celine Boutier of France ran off five straight birdies in the middle of her round to account for not taking advantage of the par 5s. She was at 66 with Hye-Jin Choi of South Korea and Lindy Duncan, who lost in a five-way playoff at the Chevron Championship two weeks ago. I think my putter working well, better than Chevron week, said Thitikul, the No. 2 player in the womens world ranking. She opened with rounds of 71-75 at the Chevron Championship, the first major of the LPGA season. Thitikul took off last week and devoted a lot of time to her putting, almost to a fault. She found her emotions going all over the place depending on the result. First couple days Ive been back home and I putt a lot, a ton, she said. I feel good when I see it drop but I feel bad when I see it miss. ... And I was like, No, you cant be like this. Its in or its not. It has to be the same feelings and emotion. 
        
     I just going to putt less and think less. Thats pretty much I want to do, she said. Because mental-wise, pretty important to see all putts in. I dont want to be so tight and tense. Besides, she felt the greens were tough for everyone at the major. Were here, hit it good, and also making the putts, Thitikul said after her 11th round of 64 or lower over the last four seasons. Defending champion Nelly Korda had six birdies  three of them on the par 5s  to account for a few bogeys on her front nine and finished in the group at 68. Korda, the No. 1 player in womens golf by a big margin, has yet to win this year. She won the Mizuho Americas Open a year ago for her sixth victory of the season. Her game hasnt been as sharp this year, and Korda is more interested in looking ahead. Just got to focus on what my game plan was last year  that was one shot at a time, not to get ahead of myself, Korda said. I know at the beginning of the year I had a lot to defend, but I think that instead of putting pressure on myself I should be happy that I was in that moment, that I did achieve all that great success. So just go out here and do what I love. The group at 67 included Haeran Ryu of South Korea, coming off a victory last week at the Black Desert Championship in Utah that elevated her to No. 5 in the world. Her round included a bogey on her final hole. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/jeeno-thitikul-mizuho-americas-liberty-national-nelly-3f4eef57eca778c935000786178f885f,sports
Mitchell shoots 61 for 1-shot lead at Truist Championship; McIlroy shows rust in 66,"FLOURTOWN, Pa. (AP)  Keith Mitchell led a birdie spree at the Truist Championship on Thursday, shooting a career-best 9-under 61 to shatter the course record at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. The previous Wissahickon Course record of 65 was shared by Colin St Maxen, Zac Blair and Angus Flanagan. The 7,100-yard A.W. Tillinghast design with modest par 4s and gettable pin placements fell victim to the long hitters and aggressive shots with short irons and wedges. Mitchell was bogey-free and had an outside chance at 59 on his second shot from 102 yards on the ninth hole, his 18th. He hit his approach to just over 9 feet and settled for a closing par and a one-shot lead over Denny McCarthy. Colin Morikawa, Rickie Fowler, Sepp Straka and Akshay Bhatia shot 63. Rory McIlroy, making his first individual start since completing the career grand slam at the Masters, had a 66 and was one of 64 players who beat par on the seemingly defenseless Wissahickon layout in the sixth signature event of the PGA Tour season. Mitchell led the way despite a ho-hum start of five straight pars on the back nine. Things started to heat up for the 33-year-old with a birdies on the stout 17th and 18th holes. His run continued with birdies on two of the first three holes on his back nine before a four-birdie run for a 6-under 29 on the inward nine. Mitchell said he has a buddy who is a member at Philly Cricket and received some intel ahead of his arrival. But, he credited the work he and his caddie did early in the week studying the greens for setting the stage for his success. 
        
     I just plotted my way around Monday and Wednesday to figure out what to hit and where to kind of try to put the ball on the green, said Mitchell, who has one career win and six top-25 finishes this year with one missed cut. If you get above the hole really pin high on the wrong side, you can have a really fast putt and have a ton of breaks. The 32-year-old McCarthy, who has lost twice in playoffs and is winless on tour, was aided by a fast start that included five straight birdies at Nos. 11-15. He opened his inward nine with back-to-back birdies and added two more for a satisfying, but not surprising to him, opening round. Ive been playing really well lately, so it doesnt really surprise me, he said. Theres still a lot of golf left. This is a really nice start. Im excited for how my game has been trending lately. McIlroy, the defending champion and four-time winner of the event, stayed with his aggressive gameplan of trying to overpower the layout with driver off the tee. He had two stumbles along the way: a three-putt at the par-4 11th and a bogey at the 570-yard, par-5 15th, where he scrambled after missing the fairway with his drive and the green with his approach from 243 yards. McIlroy quickly moved past his first-round errors. I think it worked out fine, McIlroy said of his round of six birdies and two bogeys. I drove the ball pretty well. I missed it in a couple of spots, but was sort of able to get away with it. McIlroy is playing for the first time in about two weeks after celebrating his slam-clinching win at the Masters and 12th-place finish in New Orleans, where he and fellow Irishman Shane Lowry were defending champs. He acknowledged his game is not in top form. I felt like I was a little rusty out there, just hadnt played in a week and I hadnt really done a ton of practice, especially like on and around the greens, he said. I certainly can tidy a few things up, but overall a decent day. Alex Noren made his return to the tour, playing for the first time since August due to neck and leg injuries. The 42-year-old Swede opened with a 67 and was happy to be back and looked forward to fine-tuning his game. Its weird not to play for so long, he said. Ive been looking forward to get some nervousness and some adrenaline flowing and just be a little sharper. You go around practicing your short game for a while. Its not so inspiring in the end when you dont really know when you can come back. Finally, the last two weeks, it felt good for two weeks in a row. The hamstring is holding up. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-truist-championship-e1c5a8494e34515b38c69a17c361025e,sports
Fowler shows old spark with 8 birdies in strong start at the Truist Championship,"FLOURTOWN, Pa. (AP)  Rickie Fowler heard about the complaints  mostly from puzzled fans  after he received an invitation to play next weekend in the PGA Championship. His retort? Keep the whining coming. The negative stuff, I would say, kind of helps me in a way because it fuels me to kind of go out and prove people wrong, Fowler said. Fowler answered his critics at the Truist Championship with the kind of play that showed he can still be considered a threat to win, even if he actually hasnt taken a tournament since 2023. Ive been happy with where my games been at for quite a while. I just havent really seen the product of the work Im putting in or what I feel like I can produce, he said. This was a little better day. Fowler reeled off eight birdies and a bogey to shoot a 7-under-63 on Thursday at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, leaving him two strokes behind leader Keith Mitchell.  You obviously want to come out and prove yourself, Fowler said. I havent been playing all that well last year and the start of this year. It hasnt been very far off. The 36-year-old Fowler absorbed some criticism this week when the PGA Championship released its field for next week at Quail Hollow.  The PGA Championship offered an invitation to Fowler, who has plunged to No. 125 in the world and missed the Masters. There is a category for players in the most recent Ryder Cup  Fowler was at Marco Simone in Italy  provided they are among the top 100 in the world. 
        
     Fowlers first PGA Tour victory was at Quail Hollow in 2012. His best finish at the PGA Championship came in 2014 when he tied for third. Fowler was ranked 146th in the world when he received an invitation into the 2022 PGA Championship. Fowler, a six-time winner on the tour, has played in nine events this year without a top-10 finish and needed a sponsor exemption to play this weekend at the suburban Philadelphia course. Its not quite the way he wanted to qualify for tournaments  but Fowler will take it. A number of exemptions this year, which Im very, very happy for and appreciate it from the sponsors and the tournament directors, he said. You want to come out and play well. So off to a good start and looking forward to keeping it rolling. Fowlers winless streak stretches to July 2023 when he made a 12-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole of the Rocket Mortgage Classic and outlasted Collin Morikawa and Adam Hadwin to win in Detroit. His putting was strong at the Cricket Club.  Fowler made a 13-foot birdie putt on the par-4 seventh hole that kept him among the leaders and finished with a birdie on 18 to cap his outing. He called the the birdie the shot of his round after his bogey-5 on No. 17. I think making birdie there, hit a nice drive off of the last, good shot in there with 6-iron, he said. Hard to pick out one shot. Ill pick the 18th hole. Maybe his effort was the result of a course where 10 players shot under 65. He also didnt want to play catch-up with rain in the forecast. My bodys feeling better, kind of allowing me to go play golf, Fowler said. We made a minor adjustment yesterday, put my irons a degree up. I felt like I was making good swings and zeroing things out, and the ball was just hanging a little right from what I wanted to see. So it was good to kind of see things tighten up with irons today. For anyone else who thinks he cant win, Fowler recalled a 2015 Sports Illustrated player poll that named him one of the most overrated players on the tour. He promptly went out and won the The Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass. That worked out all right that week, he said. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-truist-championship-fowler-0f678799bd5ef932d0e044a039405fed,sports
Natalie Nakase is 1st Asian American WNBA head coach and unfazed by being the face of the Valkyries,"Dont tell Natalie Nakase she doesnt have what it takes to do something. The coach of the San Francisco Bay Areas first WNBA team got to where she is by learning to block out those who underestimated her. If I hear one negative thing about my goal, about my dream, its out, were done, Nakase told The Associated Press. It made my circle really small, but its made my circle really powerful and encouraging and supportive for me. That focus and grit is what led to Nakase, 45, to going from being a walk-on at UCLA to team captain as a 5-foot-2 freshman in 1998. Its what made her the first Asian American player to join the now-defunct National Womens Basketball League in 2003. Nakase is blazing a trail again as the WNBAs first Asian American head coach. That distinction adds to an already impressive rise to be the leader of the Golden State Valkyries, the leagues first expansion franchise since 2008. Their inaugural roster also happens to include championship-winning UConn guard Kaitlyn Chen, who last month became the first Taiwanese American drafted. 
        
     Its clear Nakase, who is of Japanese ancestry, isnt rattled ascending to a larger spotlight. The Golden State Warriors organization, of which the Valkyries are a part of, has prepared her for being more public and preparation builds confidence, she said. Coaching is something Nakase expressed interest in as far back as 20 years when she was on the San Jose Spiders. For people who may not see Asian American women as leaders, Nakase hopes her new role will change minds. I think its more like whats in your mind rather than like the exterior part of it, said Nakase, who at UCLA was often mistaken for a gymnast or tennis player. The negative opinions fuel my fire, though. Nakases leadership style is one of tough love. Its an approach she learned from her father. Compliments were not something given in her family. But candor was. Her father not only (held) me accountable but, he set higher and higher standards because I think if you believe in yourself  in this  then I want to push you to this, Nakase said. If your expectations are here, I want to push you even higher. Thats not to say she wont be there for players off the court. Nakase said her responsibility is to be with them every single day, every single moment, check in, Are we good today? Nakase will be one of four head coaches of color in the WNBA this season. The other three are Black, but that number is down from six in 2022. Within that subset, Seattle Storm coach Noelle Quinn is the only other female. In 2022, Latricia Trammell became the first Native American or Alaska Native head coach. The Dallas Wings, however, fired her after two seasons. Only one-fourth of the head coaches in the league are Black, which is a sharp contrast to the fact that roughly 64% of WNBA players are Black or African American, according to a 2023 report from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. Hispanic/Latina and Asian players each account for 1.4%. Those who identify as mixed race amount to nearly 11%. The WNBA is on track to expand to 16 teams by 2028. Toronto  the first outside the U.S.  and Portland, Oregon, will have franchises next year. This is all happening as womens sports at college and professional levels have seen a popularity surge in the last few years. Nakase was a Los Angeles Clippers assistant coach for 10 years before she joined the WNBAs Las Vegas Aces in a similar role. In 2023, after the Aces won back-to-back championships, Nakase noticed a shift in interest. She believes the opportunity to be part of the movement happening in womens sports as the coach of the Valkyries couldnt have come at a better time. Im exactly where Im supposed to be, especially going from the NBA, experiencing everything on a day to day on what it looks like, what they get and now coming here, Nakase said. Nakases presence has electrified Bay Area Asian Americans who already were stoked to have a hometown WNBA team to support. Teresa and Nathan Chan, who are Chinese American, had bought Valkyries season tickets for themselves and their daughters Adelaide, 16, and Ashlyn, 15. Both girls play for the San Jose Zebras, one of several Asian American youth teams around the Bay Area. Adelaide said she was freaking out when she found out an Asian American woman would be taking a lead in Dub Nation. She sees parallels with Nakase, who also grew up playing in an Asian American league. I thought that was just so cool and it felt more so like she was part of our community already, Adelaide said. Both Nakase and Chens presence have intensified Ashlyns interest. I didnt really watch the WNBA like that much before, Ashlyn said, but now that I see a lot of Asian representation ... Im more like, Oh, this is my team now. Teresa Chan, whose father founded a local basketball club over 30 years ago, said its the most wonderful thing that we could ever ask for. I think also it challenges the stereotypes and expands their views of whats possible. Its a symbol to all girls and boys alike in the Asian community, Nathan Chan added. Nakase embraces what she feels is a responsibility and thinks about how to use her new platform to encourage more girls on a daily basis. What I feel like Im going to connect more to also is more coaches, Nakase said. Because I think that, like I said, the impact of coaches is going to be the reason why other females  younger kids that look like me  that theyre going to be inspired. ___ Tang reported from Phoenix. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/golden-state-valkyries-natalie-nakase-wnba-aapi-225ff925866245dd982661f9b4858587,sports
Lynxs Napheesa Collier poised for another WNBA title run after an offseason playing with Unrivaled,"Napheesa Collier drove to her left, stopped and hit a turnaround jumper over Aaliyah Edwards to capture the 1-on-1 tournament crown in the Unrivaled 3-on-3 womens basketball league. When the shot went in, Collier let out a triumphant yell. The moment captured how the Minnesota Lynx All-Star forward spent her WNBA offseason: Physically and mentally working on her game and raising her profile. After Collier and the Lynx came up short in their bid for a title last season  falling to Breanna Stewart and the New York Liberty in the WNBA Finals  Collier went to work as a one of the marquee players in Unrivaled and co-founder of the league. You always want to keep building, Collier said during Lynx training camp. Even though I had a good year last year, theres always things you can improve on, things that I wanted to get better at from last year. Things that I worked really hard at during the offseason and at Unrivaled. So really looking to implement that for this year. All of Colliers skills were on display during her eight-week stint with Unrivaled in Miami. She dazzled chase-down blocks, tough fadeaway jumpers and 3-pointers. The reigning WNBA Defensive Player of the Year honed the pieces of her game that made her a matchup nightmare in the league last year, and Colliers poised to be even better in the 2025 season, which starts later this month.  Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve likes to compare Colliers work ethic to that of Las Vegas Aces forward Aja Wilson, a three-time MVP of the league. 
        
     They each add something (to their game) every year, Reeve said. I think when Aja Wilson comes back this year, shes going to be even better than last year, which is scary  Same for Phee. Collier has added something each year, whether thats becoming more aggressive in hunting her shot or being a more consistent scorer off the dribble. That was clear during her stellar 2024 season, when Collier finished fifth in the league in scoring, third in rebounding and was the MVP runner-up behind Wilson. Averaging 20.4 points per game last season, Collier led the Lynx to their deepest playoff run since 2017, when a Sylvia Fowles-led squad won the championship one year after falling just short.  Collier is hoping for a similar run in 2025. No one is going to feel sorry for us, she said. We dont feel sorry for ourselves, but it is something that we use to fuel us. Its just a feeling you dont want to feel again, so making sure were coming in every single day, starting today, with good energy. The coaches were telling us ... about how they lost in a heartbreaker in 2016, and they used that to fuel them for 2017. Thats the story that we want to have for this year. For Collier, writing that story began with Unrivaled, the league she co-founded with Stewart to provide a stateside offseason option for WNBA players to compete while supplementing their income. Collier was the most dominant individual competitor in the 36-player league, unveiling an assortment of shot-making and defensive aggression. She was voted Unrivaled MVP after leading the league in points (25.7), field goals (10.4) and steals (2) per game while shooting 61.3% from the floor. Collier averaged 10.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists for the Lunar Owls, who finished with the best record in the league at 13-1. Collier took home $200,000 and elevated her brand after breezing through the field during Unrivaleds 1-on-1 tournament. She scored the second-most points in an Unrivaled game when she dropped 38 on 16-of-27 shooting against Stewarts Mist BC in February. Phee shows why shes one of the top players in the league, said Colliers Lunar Owls teammate Allisha Gray, who plays for the WNBAs Atlanta Dream. Every day she comes in. She works hard. Her conditioning is elite, top level. Shes somebody that if you want to get better, youll definitely want get in the gym and work out with her. Collier said her goal this offseason was to work on her ball-handling, which has improved since she came into the league out of UConn in 2019. Becoming a better ball-handler, she added, will help her be stronger in the paint. She also shot 32.7% from 3-point range at Unrivaled, her best from that range since her second season in the WNBA. But remembering that feeling of defeat in the finals is fueling Collier. Ive talked ad nauseam about last year, she said, but I think just using it to my advantage, honestly, where it does give me that leg up where I want to push just that little bit more. I want to win just that little bit more. Thats what it feels like. Thats what it felt like when I was playing at Unrivaled, and I want to keep that same mentality coming into the W season. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-lynx-napheesa-collier-unrivaled-426177a091ed8bb5826ca7b554c12fca,sports

Olympic great Sue Bird to be first managing director of USA Basketball womens national team,"NEW YORK (AP)  Sue Bird is giving another assist to USA Basketball, becoming the managing director of the womens national team. The five-time Olympic champion was named to the newly created position Thursday and it marks a major change in the way the organization creates its roster and coaching staff. I played for USA Basketball for so long and always really enjoyed my time with them, Bird said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. I love representing my country. I love being competitive on that stage. To have that opportunity to do it in a different role is exciting. Before the change, a committee made those decisions, but now in a move similar to what the USA mens national team does, Bird will be the one responsible for putting things together. Grant Hill has the same role on the mens side. We are really, really excited about Sue for so many reasons, USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said in a phone interview. Her pedigree and standing in the sport is so strong. Not just in womens basketball, but all of sport. Shes a tremendous leader and were very excited that she took this on for us. The mens team has had a managing director for two decades with Jerry Colangelo serving in that spot from 2005-21 before Hill took over. Shes had five Olympic gold medals herself and understands whats involved, Tooley said. Having the managing director position makes it easier to work with the staff for long term vision of the program. Its hard to do that with a committee that comes and goes and gets together a handful of times. 
        
     Tooley said Birds term will be for four years  the same as the Olympic cycle  and the change to this structure has been in the works for a few years, well before the decision to not select Caitlin Clark for the 2024 Paris Games team that left some people upset. Discussions happened after the 21 Olympics and Sue served on the board last quad, Tooley said. We got in discussions about the managing director role and we sat with her awhile and she gave it a lot of consideration and thought. Its an enormous responsibility. Bird said shes used to the pressure of USA Basketball where its basically win a gold medal or bust. The Americans have won eight straight, including one at last years Paris Olympics. This is a different type of pressure, she said. Im hoping to bring all that I learned as a player, all my experience, all my understanding. The whole goal is to win a gold medal and it feels at times thats the only option. ... I know what its like to be a player, know what its like as a player to build teams and have teams come together and see what clicks. Before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the Americans will play in the FIBA World Cup in Germany next year. The first qualifying event will take place in November. Besides figuring out what players will be on that team, Bird will have to decide who will be coaching the squad. There is no clear-cut choice right now. Of course Ive started to think about it, jotting some names down here and there, Bird said. Its the first priority without a doubt. There are so many qualified coaches in college and the WNBA. Bird said that she doesnt have a specific time frame to have a coach in place. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/usa-basketball-olympics-bird-11d908122c676d3cfee6a9bf90770260,sports
"Panthers release veteran edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney, rule out Jonathan Brooks for the season","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  The Carolina Panthers released veteran Jadeveon Clowney on Thursday after selecting two edge rushers in the NFL draft. Clowney, the No. 1 pick in the 2014 draft, had 5 1/2 sacks last season for the Panthers. He had one year left on his two-year, $20 million contract. The Panthers drafted Texas A&Ms Nic Scourton in the second round and Mississippis Princely Umanmielen in the third round in last months NFL draft with an eye to getting younger at the position. Carolina also signed free agent Patrick Jones II in free agency. Carolinas other edge rushers include D.J. Wonnum, DJ Johnson, Amare Barno, Kenny Dyson, Thomas Incoom and 2021 second-round pick Boogie Basham. The Panthers also placed running Jonathon Brooks, the teams second-round pick in 2024, on the physically unable to perform list  meaning he will not play in 2025. Brooks re-tore the ACL in his knee as a rookie in Week 14 after suffering a similar injury to the same knee during his final season at the University of Texas. The Panthers had prepared for just such a scenario with Brooks, adding depth to the running back room this offseason by signing free agent Rico Dowdle from the Dallas Cowboys and drafting Trevor Etienne from Georgia in the fourth round.  Carolina also waived tight end convert Colin Granger, a former college basketball player, as part of an injury settlement. The team also released tight end Jordan Matthews and receiver Dax Milne, and waived receiver T.J. Luther, offensive lineman Andrew Raym and defensive tackle Jerrod Clark. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/panthers-jadeveon-clowney-d6851dabd115a559c5816ae191b0cb8f,sports
Robert Saleh plans to revive the 49ers defense in his 2nd stint as coordinator,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP)  Robert Saleh once again is tasked with reviving the San Francisco defense following a rough season when the Niners struggled to slow down opposing offenses. The main difference this time when Saleh returns for a second stint as Niners defensive coordinator following an unsuccessful run as head coach of the New York Jets is the talent that he inherits. Instead of building a defense up nearly from scratch as he did in his first tenure, Saleh inherits a unit that features a former Defensive Player of the Year in edge rusher Nick Bosa, four-time All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner and versatile defensive back Deommodore Lenoir. Theres a lot of really good talent on this defense, Saleh said Thursday. So its not nearly as what 17 was. Saleh was hired as head coach Kyle Shanahans first defensive coordinator in 2017 and struggled the first two seasons. But after the team drafted Bosa in 2019 and implemented the wide nine scheme that featured edge rushers lining up wide and focusing on getting up field, the defense took off. San Francisco went to the Super Bowl in the 2019 season and still had a strong season the following season when Bosa missed almost the entire year with a knee injury, leading to Saleh getting the head coaching job with the Jets. Saleh was fired midway through this past season in New York, but the Jets had a strong defense under his tenure. During Salehs last two full seasons with the Jets in 2022-23, New York ranked first in yards passing allowed per game (178.9) and yards per play allowed (4.7), and second in total defense (301.7 yards per game). 
        
     Obviously, Ive gone through the head coaching stuff and you learn a lot going through that, Saleh said. But Im happy to be back in this chair where I get to coach a little bit more football and not deal with all the administrative stuff that comes with being a head coach. Saleh said he never considered taking a year off when he didnt get another shot at being a head coach and returning to the 49ers was his first choice as a coordinator. Saleh had high praise for the way Shanahan and general manager John Lynch run the organization and appreciates the loyalty they showed early in his first time as coordinator.  If you think about those first two years as D-coordinator in 17 and 18, it wasnt easy, he said. It could have been very easy for them to move on from me. Im indebted to this organization, to those men for the rest of my life. They stuck with me and we made it happen. We did what we needed to do, and the rest is history. Im excited about the opportunity to get the chance to do it again with them. Saleh said his defensive system has evolved since he left San Francisco as he tries to stay ahead of whatever offenses are doing around the NFL. He plans to bring in those new elements along with some of the successful changes that the Niners have undergone to create a new defense. He also will have to incorporate in several rookies who could be key contributors to fill several holes created earlier this offseason. Some things are the same, some things are the same from the Jets, some things are meshed, some things are coming in that are new, he said. Were trying to stay a couple years ahead. A lot of it may seem similar, but theres a lot of nuance that makes a difference. Saleh will be the fourth defensive coordinator in four seasons for San Francisco. DeMeco Ryans, who replaced Saleh in 2021, left to become head coach in Houston following the 2022 season, and Steve Wilks and Nick Sorensen were each replaced after one season the past two years. The 49ers regressed this season under Sorensen as the injury-filled unit struggled to create turnovers, stop the run and create consistent pressure on the quarterback. San Francisco ranked 29th in the league in scoring defense, allowing 25.6 points per game, and was tied for the seventh-fewest takeaways with 17. The Niners had just two takeaways over the final nine games and ended the season allowing at least 40 points in back-to-back games for the first time since 2015. Theres a lot of empathy for what happened to the group last year, Saleh said. There was a lot of things that, through the halfway point, this defense was playing some really good football and there were a lot of injuries and the wheels kind of fell off during the last four weeks of the season. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/49ers-robert-saleh-b219c5306139c7b5c24797c9a7cf529c,sports
Cardinals rookie cornerback Will Johnson ready to show his talent,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP)  Will Johnsons first few moments as a member of the Arizona Cardinals werent the best, with the cornerback still seething because of his fall from a potential top-10 pick to the second round because of injury concerns. Two weeks later, hes in a much better mood. Happy to be here, happy to get to work and happy to see whats to come, Johnson said. Johnsons demeanor has improved for many reasons, but mainly because his drop to the No. 47 overall selection meant he landed in Arizona. The Cardinals believe theyre an up-and-coming franchise under third-year coach Jonathan Gannon after finishing with an 8-9 record last season, which was a four-win improvement over 2023. Now theyre embarking on a defensive overhaul in an effort to return to the postseason for the first time since 2021. The Cardinals have made it clear that the 22-year-old Johnson is one of the centerpieces for that effort.  Hell get his first chance to reward that confidence on Friday, when the team opens rookie minicamp. You can tell theyre trying to win, Johnson said. Theyve got a lot of pieces on offense and you can tell theyre trying to get those same pieces on defenses to make it all come together. Weve just got to get to work and prove were great players. The Cardinals used six of their seven picks during Aprils draft on defensive players, adding Ole Miss defensive tackle Walter Nolen III at No. 16 before grabbing Johnson, who was a vital contributor during Michigans run to a national title in 2023.  
        
     Arizona also added Oregon edge rusher Jordan Burch in the third round, Ohio State linebacker Cody Simon in the fourth, Ohio State cornerback Denzel Burke in the fifth and Nevada safety Kitan Crawford in the seventh. The only offensive player taken was Texas guard Hayden Conner. The Cardinals also spent plenty of money on the defense during free agency, adding several veteran pieces, including Josh Sweat, Calais Campbell and Dalvin Tomlinson. I wouldnt want to be anywhere else, Johnson said. There is little concern about Johnsons ability on the field, but slightly more angst about his injury history. He played in just six games last season with the Wolverines, missing several weeks while dealing with turf toe. There was also a hamstring issue that kept him out of Michigans pro day during the pre-draft process. But the real red flag seems to be a knee issue that required surgery in 2023. Johnson said the injury hasnt bothered him since and has been adamant there are no lingering effects. Its all good, Johnson said. Ready to go. Johnson said hes ready to play for Gannon, a high-energy coach who as a coordinator helped lead the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl in 2022 before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs. Gannons specialty is coaching defensive backs and the Cardinals have used lots of draft capital on the position the past few years, adding Garrett Williams in 2023, Max Melton in 2024 and now Johnson. Much like Johnson, Williams fell to the third round in the 23 draft because of injury concerns. He was coming off a torn ACL but has quickly grown into a key contributor. Williams, Melton and Johnson could all have a major role this fall. Hes just very passionate about it, and you got to love someone who is passionate, Johnson said of Gannon. He cares about his players and is a players coach. That the kind of guy I want to play for. Johnson called Gannons defensive system a cornerbacks dream because it gives players the opportunity to play several different styles. For a confident player who feels he was overlooked during the draft, its just the kind of opportunity he was expecting. Ive been able to move on, its just motivation, Johnson said. I know theres going to be something special here, so Im excited for it. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/cardinals-will-johnson-19e205253f531f39391fd72e4bf0f4a7,sports
Bears sign No. 10 overall draft pick Colston Loveland to his rookie contract,"LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP)  The Chicago Bears signed first-round draft pick Colston Loveland to his rookie contract on Thursday. The Bears wasted little time locking in the tight end from Michigan after taking him with the No. 10 overall pick two weeks ago. He gets a four-year deal with a team option for the 2029 season. Last year, the Bears didnt sign No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams and first-rounder Rome Odunze until mid-July. Loveland was one of five draft picks Chicago signed on Thursday. The others were linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II (fourth round), defensive back Zah Frazier (fifth round), offensive lineman Luke Newman (sixth round) and running back Kyle Monangai (seventh round). Second-rounders Luther Burden III (receiver), Ozzy Trapilo (offensive tackle) and Shemar Turner (defensive end) remain unsigned. The 6-foot-6 Loveland gives the Bears a potentially potent tandem at tight end with Cole Kmet. He set a school record for a tight end with 56 receptions for 582 yards and five touchdowns as a junior last season. He was second-team All-Big Ten and a finalist for the John Mackey Award given to college footballs top tight end. He was first-team all-conference in the 2023 national championship season, when he caught 45 passes for 649 yards and four TDs. Loveland had surgery to reconstruct the AC joint in his right shoulder on Jan. 29 to fix an injury he suffered in September. He is expected to be ready by training camp. The Bears finished last in the NFC North at 5-12. They fired former coach Matt Eberflus in the middle of a 10-game losing streak and hired Ben Johnson in the offseason to replace him. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/chicago-bears-colston-loveland-c2a57caaf135f7f4a6e8678eba7f3896,sports
Mikko Rantanen and other trade deadline additions are having big impacts on the NHL playoffs,"Mikko Rantanen is showing exactly why Dallas was willing to pay such a hefty price to put him the roster. One of the players the Stars traded for Rantanen is also making a positive impact for his new team. Nearly every team in the second round of the NHL playoffs is benefitting from moves they made at the trade deadline. That includes Toronto with Brandon Carlo and Scott Laughton; Florida with Brad Marchand and Seth Jones; Washington with Anthony Beauvillier; Edmonton with Jake Walman and Trent Frederic; Winnipeg with Brandon Tanev and Luke Schenn; and the Carolina Hurricanes also with Taylor Hall and Mark Jankowski. One of those teams  or maybe Vegas, which made a move to get Reilly Smith back  will hoist the Stanley Cup in June and have a trade or two to credit for the journey. The Stars and Hurricanes are co-Cup favorites according to BetMGM Sportsbook after making the biggest deadline deal: Rantanen to Dallas for Logan Stankoven, two first-round picks and a third-rounder to Carolina. Rantanen has had a hat trick in each of the past two games  last weekend in Game 7 to knock out the Colorado Avalanche who traded him in late January and then in Wednesdays series opener at Winnipeg. Its a treat, teammate Sam Steel said. Hes one of the best players in the world and hes just on fire right now, so were just trying to get him the puck. Stars coach Peter DeBoer said Rantanen had an easy transition. That may be an understatement, as the 28-year-old Finn leads the postseason with eight goals and 15 points. 
        
     We all know how elite he is, Jets winger Nino Niederreiter said. Hes really done it these last few games and throughout his whole career  always a fantastic player. That was the Hurricanes thinking when they sent Martin Necas, Jack Drury and two picks to Colorado for Rantanen in an unexpected, blockbuster trade more than a month before the deadline. Avalanche president of hockey operations Joe Sakic  who drafted Rantanen with the 10th pick in 2015  heard after that move that the possibility of another trade back West was possible. With the clock ticking toward the deadline on March 7, first-year Hurricanes general manager Eric Tulsky made the most of the situation and dealt Rantanen to the Stars, who then signed him to an eight-year, $96 million extension. Rantanen is a playoff producer (101 points in 81 games before this spring, including helping Colorado win the Cup in 2022).  Carolina has gotten three goals this playoffs from Stankoven and three points from Hall, while Jankowski was a big reason for a perfect penalty kill in the first round. Theyve all helped in a lot of different ways on both sides of the puck, captain Jordan Staal said. Three great players that have really kind of solidified our lineup and played really well for us. So has Marchand for defending champion Florida, so far scoring at a point-a-game pace this playoffs. He and Jones felt welcomed right away. This team is built to want to win, and they have that drive, Marchand said. And when you walk in the room, everyone was really excited for each and every one of us to come in and be part of the group. The Capitals got Beauvillier in part because he has had some high-scoring playoffs. He had 27 points combined over two New York Islanders trips to the Eastern Conference Final and put up five points in his first six games with Washington. Theres something about important games and meaningful games that get me, I guess, a little bit more fired up and get my a little bit more focused, Beauvillier said.  Some of the additions have been more subtle: Laughton has a couple of points and Carlo is playing important minutes for the Maple Leafs as they try to get past the second round for the first time in more than two decades. Schenn and Tanev toughened up Winnipeg, and Walman and Frederic helped the Oilers fill holes vacated by Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway leaving last summer. Dallas also loaded up beyond Rantanen. General manager Jim Nills February trade for Cody Ceci and Mikael Granlund, also involving a first-round pick, has paid dividends. I cant say enough about Granlund and what hes brought, Cody Ceci  (without them) we dont get through the first round, DeBoer said. ___ AP Sports Writers Tim Reynolds in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Aaron Beard in Raleigh, North Carolina, Stephen Hawkins in Frisco, Texas, Pat Graham in Denver and the Canadian Press contributed. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/trade-deadline-nhl-playoffs-5db6ec2b01cea30ff575e7361b71fc29,sports
Sullivan makes sure to speak with every player on the roster as he starts anew as Rangers coach,"For Mike Sullivan, the latest coach of the New York Rangers, there will be many priorities in taking over a team that missed the playoffs a season after winning the Presidents Trophy. Foremost will be communication. I have spoken to every player on the roster over the last three days, Sullivan said Thursday at his introductory press conference. I think there is a fair amount of leadership in that room. Theres a lot of character in that room. Sullivan, the 38th coach in franchise history and fifth since 2018, agreed to lead the Rangers on May 2 after parting ways with Pittsburgh, where he won the Stanley Cup twice. He replaces Peter Laviolette, who was fired April 19 after the Rangers slid 29 points to miss the postseason despite their raft of talent. It will be up to Sullivan to resuscitate a power play that fell from the leagues top echelon to 28th overall in 2024-25 and help the defense improve in front of elite goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who is coming off his worst NHL season. Sullivan spent four seasons as a Rangers assistant under then-coach John Tortorella from 2009-13. He also coached current Rangers president and general manager Chris Drury during that time. They also worked together through USA Hockey at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February and will be part of the U.S. contingent for the 2026 Milan Olympics. Sullivan will have top scorers Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad and Adam Fox on his side after years guiding Penguins stars Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang in Pittsburgh, where he won the Cup in 2016 and 2017. 
        
     Ive grown so much respect over the years for the talent that the Rangers have, said Sullivan, who lost a seven-game first-round playoff series to the Rangers in 2022. I look forward to the opportunity to get to know these guys on a more personal level. I look forward to the opportunity to work with them, both on the ice and off the ice, to try to become the most competitive team that we can become. Also pressing for the 57-year-old Sullivan  who was drafted by the Rangers in 1987 and later played 709 NHL games for four other franchises  is how he will handle younger Rangers such as 22-year-old Brennan Othmann and 20-year-old Gabe Perreault, a first-round pick in 2023 who joined the team briefly at the end of last season. Part of coaching or the art of coaching, I guess, is trying to figure out what that daily recipe is thats best for the player, Sullivan said. Sometimes its time in the American League as a young player, sometimes its time in the National League depending on the types of minutes that that player can play. What I will tell you is that I think its important that every player earns their opportunities, that no ones entitled to an opportunity. Sullivan was joined Thursday by Drury, who was awarded a contract extension last month. Drurys previous two coaching hires  Laviolette and Gerard Gallant  each lasted two seasons. The 48-year-old executive expressed enthusiasm for the addition of Sullivan, the only U.S.-born coach with multiple Stanley Cup wins. The second Mike was available, we quickly and aggressively pursued him, Drury said. We are certainly thrilled that pursuit led us to this moment today. Theres a lot of work to be done. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-rangers-sullivan-71597d590ab7e5079a20288a28e5ff70,sports
"Fridays NHL games: Leafs seek 3-0 lead in Florida, Rantanen and Stars aim at 2-0 lead over Jets","Mikko Rantanen is on a history-making tear. The Florida Panthers need a history-making comeback. The Toronto Maple Leafs will seek a 3-0 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers on Friday night, while Rantanen  on a scoring roll the likes of which hockey hasnt seen in generations  will lead the Dallas Stars into Game 2 of their Western Conference semifinal series against the Winnipeg Jets. Florida lost a pair of one-goal games at Toronto to open their series, which resumes on the Panthers home ice for Game 3 on Friday. History says the Panthers are in big trouble: Toronto has won all 11 of its previous best-of-seven series when taking a 2-0 lead at home, Florida is 0-5 all-time in series where it dropped both Games 1 and 2, and leaguewide, teams facing 0-2 deficits come back to win those series only about 14% of the time. There are no magic words to say now, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Thursday. If there was, you would have said it two games ago, right? Were not holding back any gems, Maurice said. Thats probably the most important thing that you realize. We went on the road and lost two one-goal games. Our games not perfect. Neither is theirs. So, youre looking for an adjustment to foundation more than an adjustment to something unusual. Over in the West, where Dallas stuck first in Winnipeg with a 3-2 win, Rantanen is indeed doing something unusual  lots of things that are unusual, actually. 
        
     Hes the third player in NHL playoff history to have a hat trick in back-to-back games: Jari Kurri for Edmonton in 1985 and Doug Bentley for Chicago in 1944 are the others. Hes had a hand in each of Dallas last 12 goals, a streak unmatched by any player on any team in playoff history. Hes the first player in playoff history with at least eight goals and six assists in a four-game span. The first player with two three-goal periods in the same postseason. And on, and on, and on. Lets see how long he can run this for, Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. Hes rolling. Hes feeling it. Pretty impressive, what hes doing. I mean, considering the opponent and the time of year and how hes dominating games, really impressive. When/Where to Watch: Game 3, Friday, 7 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max) Series: Maple Leafs lead 2-0 If losing a pair of one-goal playoff games wasnt bad enough  5-4 in Game 1, 4-3 in Game 2  the Panthers can look at two goals given up in those games and really lament how those scores factored into creating their current situation. In Game 1, Seth Jones scored to get Florida within 2-1  and the Panthers gave up a goal to Morgan Rielly 19 seconds later. In Game 2, Anton Lundell scored early in the third to pull Florida into a 3-3 tie  only to have Mitch Marner score what became the game-winner 17 seconds later. The Leafs held serve at home, which is what they were supposed to do. Toronto became the first team to get to six wins in these playoffs and will be feeling very good about its game going into Game 3. It doesnt change how we go about our day today, Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said Thursday before Florida hopped aboard its charter flight back home. Its about recovering and putting the best foot forward to play our best game tomorrow night and get back in this thing. When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Friday, 9:30 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max) Series: Stars lead 1-0 Playoff hockey is different. Every opponent at this time of year is obviously proven. But the Winnipeg Jets  who needed seven games and a Game 7 miracle to escape St. Louis in Round 1  are right back into some hot water, in large part because theyre giving up a lot of goals. The Jets have given up 26 goals in the last six games, after not giving up more than 20 in any six-game span of the regular season. Rantanens hot streak is one thing, but Winnipegs defense wasnt exactly airtight going back to Round 1 either. And while the Jets survived a Game 7 at home to get here, the last thing they need is to go back to Dallas in a 2-0 hole. That starts with doing more against Rantanen. Hes just somebody that you always have to know when hes on the ice, Jets coach Scott Arniel said of facing Rantanen. Whenever you face elite players, youve got to know where they are. And hes feeling it. Weve got to know when hes on the ice. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-playoffs-panthers-leafs-stars-jets-a818f333aef5c649d391e941c2016a2c,sports
"Tom Wilson leads the Capitals past the Hurricanes 3-1 with blocks, a goal and an assist","WASHINGTON (AP)  Tom Wilson did a little bit of everything for the Washington Capitals  and he wasnt sure the box score properly reflected quite just how much he contributed Thursday night.  He produced the primary assist on John Carlsons go-ahead goal on a power play early in the third period of Washingtons 3-1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes to knot their Eastern Conference second-round playoff series at a game apiece.  Wilson put the puck into an empty net in the final minute to seal the outcome. He provided his usual brand of physical play, hitting and shoving and mixing it up right up until the end. Oh, yes, and he was credited with two of Washingtons 32 blocked shots, 22 more than Carolina, although Wilson was skeptical about his total. I only had two of them? a smiling Wilson asked reporters with mock indignation. The guys up top need to pay a little more attention. With Wilson leading the way physically and emotionally for the hosts, the Capitals managed to get going right away following a 2-1 overtime loss two nights earlier.  He was leading the charge tonight, I thought, coach Spencer Carbery said. He was really engaged. No other forward spent as much time on the ice as Wilson did Thursday, and Carbery credited him with being one of the players  along with Alex Ovechkin  who wanted to make sure the club would be better prepared for Game 2 than for Game 1. 
        
     Game 1 wasnt good enough, Wilson said. We knew that. As teammate after teammate lavished praise on him before the series shifts to Raleigh for Game 3 on Saturday, Wilson sought to deflect the compliments. He does everything the right way, goalie Logan Thompson said. We built off it. The whole stadium built off it. Connor McMichael, who scored the games opening goal for Washington on a breakaway after a turnover by the Hurricanes, explained Wilsons role this way: When we need a spark, hes there to provide it. You need a big play or a big goal, hes always the one doing it. Wilson kind of shrugged off a reporters question about a head-first dive that thwarted a chance for Carolinas Jordan Staal, describing the play a bit before ending by saying simply: Youve just got to hope that the puck hits you. Wilson also said he didnt think he was really doing anything more than everybody else on the team.  Ovechkins take on his long-time teammate? He set the tone. Hes our leader, the top goal-scorer in NHL history said. He plays smart. He plays physical.  ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/capitals-hurricanes-wilson-182daabfac8b29d9d06f887fa45e6e84,sports
Witt and Bubic help the Royals beat the White Sox 10-0 for 4-game series sweep,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  Bobby Witt Jr. had four hits, Kris Bubic pitched seven innings and the Kansas City Royals beat the Chicago White Sox 10-0 on Thursday to complete a four-game series sweep.

Reds plan to place Hunter Greene on IL with Grade 1 groin strain,"ATLANTA (AP)  Cincinnati Reds right-hander Hunter Greene suffered a Grade 1 groin strain and will be placed on the injured list. Its not terrible, Reds manager Terry Francona said Thursday. But it is going to be an IL placement because we need him to miss maybe a start or two. Greene threw two warmup pitches prior to the fourth inning during Wednesday nights 4-3 victory at Atlanta. He felt a pull and was removed from the game. You dont want to miss him for even a day, Francona said. But all things considered, hes going to be OK. Greene is 4-2 with a 2.36 ERA in eight starts this season. He has 61 strikeouts in 45 2/3 innings. Greene has averaged 24 starts in his first three seasons in the big leagues and made his first All-Star team last season. Francona said the team is still weighing its options regarding a roster move and will have more information Friday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/hunter-greene-reds-groin-bded059f5d97915afd2df3ca1030715f,sports
Coroner finds UNLV football player died from heart disease and irregular heartbeat,"LAS VEGAS (AP)  UNLV senior offensive lineman Ben Christman died three months ago from heart disease and an irregular heartbeat, the Clark County Coroners Office announced Thursday. Christman, who transferred from Kentucky, was found dead in an off-campus apartment on Feb. 11. He was 21. He began his college career at Ohio State as a highly ranked prospect in the 2021 recruiting class. Christman redshirted that season and played in one game in 2022 before transferring to Kentucky. Christman did not play in 2023 because of a knee injury, but appeared in all 12 games last season on special teams. He then transferred to UNLV. Our teams heart is broken to hear of Bens passing, UNLV coach Dan Mullen said in a statement issued after Christmans death. Since the day Ben set foot on our campus a month ago, he made the Rebels a better program. Ben was an easy choice for our leadership committee as he had earned the immediate respect, admiration and friendship of all his teammates. Our prayers go out to his family and all who knew him. Ben made the world a better place and he will be missed. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

"Shohei Ohtani could have landed 15-year deal, agent says, but he didnt want to risk skills decline","INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP)  Shohei Ohtani could have pursued a 15-year contract through age 44, agent Nez Balelo said Thursday, explaining the two-way superstar didnt want to risk a decline in his skills while under the big deal. Balelo pulled back the curtain that shrouds Ohtani a bit when he spoke at Sporticos Invest West conference featuring decision-makers in sports, entertainment and finance at the new Intuit Dome, home of the NBAs Los Angeles Clippers. Ohtanis $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers that he signed in December 2023 was the largest in professional sports. He won his third MVP award and first World Series title in his first season after moving from the Los Angeles Angels. A year later, Juan Soto went even bigger. The left fielder landed a $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in which none of the money will be deferred. We wouldnt do anything different, Balelo said afterward. He won a championship. He went to the right team. No regrets. Ohtanis deal includes $680 million in deferred payments. Those deferrals reduce the net present value of the contract to about $461 million for baseballs luxury-tax system, instead of an average of $70 million a year had there been no deferrals. Ohtani will be 38 when the contract ends after the 2033 season. We could have went to 13, 14, 15 years, Balelo said. But Shohei wanted to always kind of keep the integrity of where hes at as a player. He just didnt want to have the end of his storybook career tail off and then on year 13, 14 and 15, its just like who is this guy? You cant even run down first and hes not a guy anymore. 
        
     Balelo prefers operating behind the scenes and carefully controlling the narrative around Ohtani. But even he couldnt tamp down a cottage industry of rumors about which team would land Ohtani and how much it would cost. It was quite a ride, he said in a discussion moderated by Ben Verlander, MLB analyst for FOX Sports. A social media frenzy ensued when it was reported Ohtani was on a plane to Toronto to sign with the Blue Jays. Well, that was reckless reporting. We actually tried to let the individual know, No, were not on a plane, Balelo said. I felt bad for the country of Canada. I felt horrible for the organization because clearly they knew we werent. Ohtanis goals were to keep his new team competitive by allowing the club money to sign other players and to allow him to win championships and continue to be a two-way player. The Dodgers gave us their word thats what they were going to do, said Balelo, who works for CAA Sports baseball division. Ohtani is MLBs top endorser, with his earnings jumping from $65 million in 2024 to $100 million this year. Yeah, absolutely, those are real numbers, Balelo said. It continues to take on a life of its own. According to Balelo, Ohtani endorses just over 20 brands that are carefully vetted and chosen based on his use or belief in the product and the people behind it. His priority is his on-the-field performance and the training that goes into it. He takes that very, very serious and everything really becomes secondary other than his family, Balelo said. We just have to make sure that we dont overexpose him or put him in a situation where its too heavy of a lift. Balelo first spotted the future superstar as a high school junior in Ohtanis native Japan and followed him closely as Ohtanis pro career began with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. There were some things that that I did differently than I typically would when I recruit, he said, declining to elaborate when asked afterward. It was definitely a battle, thats for sure, but we came out on top and I was very fortunate. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/shohei-ohtani-dodgers-13f40a19b9eeac3202e2546143c57008,sports
Mackenzie Hughes with a 63 leads at Myrtle Beach,"MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.

The winner of the PGA Tour event  held opposite a signature event at the Truist Championship this week  gets a spot in the PGA Championship if not already eligible. Thats not the case for Hughes or two of the players one shot behind him  Seamus Power and Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark  both already in the field next week at Quail Hollow. Will Chandler also shot 64. He has yet to qualify for the PGA Championship. Hughes finished with a flurry, making five birdies over the last six holes. He is a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, though it has been more than two years since his last title. He felt like his putting has let him down in recent week, so he changed up his routine by being quicker and more instinctive on the greens. Putted nicely today, he said. Then at the end there I kind of caught fire. I cant remember the last time I birdied the last four holes. But its definitely a nice finish.

"Chet Lemon, a star on the Detroit Tigers 1984 championship team, dies at 70","CHICAGO (AP)  Chet Lemon, a three-time All-Star outfielder who helped the Detroit Tigers win the 1984 World Series, has died after a lengthy battle with blood cancer. He was 70. The Tigers announced his death in a post on X on Thursday.  The Detroit Tigers join all of baseball in mourning the passing of Chet Lemon, the team said. While he was a World Series champion and All-Star on the field, perhaps his biggest impact came off of it. That includes creating the Chet Lemon Foundation and dedicating much of his post-playing career to youth baseball development. Our thoughts are with Chets family, friends and all those he coached, mentored and inspired. Lemons wife, Gigi, told the Detroit Free-Press her husband had gone to sleep on his reclining sofa at their home in Apopka, Florida. He just wasnt responsive, she said. Lemon batted .273 with 215 homers and 884 RBIs over 16 seasons with Chicago and Detroit from 1975 to 1990. A first-round draft pick by Oakland in 1972, he played his first seven years with the White Sox and made All-Star teams in 1978 and 1979. Lemon was traded to Detroit following the 1981 season for fellow outfielder Steve Kemp. Three years later, he made his third All-Star team and helped Detroit bring home its first championship since 1968.  Lemon made a memorable catch in Game 3 of the World Series when he raced back and turned around to snare Terry Kennedys drive a few steps from the warning track in Tiger Stadiums notoriously deep center field. The Tigers won that game to go up 2-1 in the series and took the next two to capture the championship. 
        
     Chet was the kindest of men and always had that great smile on his face, Lance Parrish, an All-Star catcher on the 1984 team, said in a statement. He was also a fierce competitor on the baseball field and a great teammate. I loved him like a brother. In retirement, Lemon coached youth and high school and travel baseball in Florida. He also established the Chet Lemon Foundation, which helps athletes earn scholarships and provides support for people affected by strokes and aphasia. Lemon had battled health issues for the past three decades. He was diagnosed with polycythemia vera  a type of blood cancer that can lead to blood clots, according to the Mayo Clinic  and suffered a series of strokes that left him unable to walk or talk in recent years. Ill never forget his laughter and infectious smile, former Tigers pitcher Dan Petry said. His athleticism on the field always stood out. But he was an even better teammate and friend. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/chet-lemon-dead-detroit-tigers-9969d1ce16e94c5919ecf3b40ab535ae,sports
Mize and Torkelson spark Tigers to 10-2 romp over Rockies in 1st game of doubleheader,"DENVER (AP)  Casey Mize pitched six effective innings, Spencer Torkelson had three RBIs and the Detroit Tigers beat the Colorado Rockies 10-2 on Thursday in the first game of a doubleheader. Andy Ibez had two hits and two RBIs for AL Central-leading Detroit, which won for the sixth time in seven games. Trey Sweeney had two hits and scored twice. Mize (6-1) struck out eight in his fourth consecutive win. He permitted one run and three hits while moving into a tie with Yankees left-hander Max Fried for the most wins in the majors.

War of words highlights buildup to UFC 315 in Montreal where political hostilities could overflow,"MONTREAL (AP)  The verbal gloves are off when it comes to the buildup to UFC 315, with the tension between the U.S. and Canada spilling into the card. Even the style of trash talk came up for debate in the headline event between welterweight champion Belal Muhammad and challenger Jack Della Maddalena. After Maddalena said it was time for Muhammad to retire, the champ countered that his Australian opponent isnt really good at trash talk. I just cant wait for him to eat his words and eat these fists, Muhammad said. Muhammad (24-3-0 with one no-contest) will put his championship on the line for the first time and is one of two title fights. Kyrgyz-Peruvian champion Valentina Shevchenko defends her flyweight crown against Manon Fiorot of France in the co-main event. Muhammad walked into the news conference room with his championship belt, wearing shades and a black basketball jersey with Bully written across the chest  a nod to his Bully B nickname. I do see myself as a bully, he said. I bully all these guys in the cage. The 36-year-old from Chicago is aiming for his 12th straight win after snatching the welterweight crown off Englands Leon Edwards at UFC 304 in July. Doing so in front of Canadian and mixed martial arts legend Georges St-Pierre  a three-time welterweight champion  would be a cherry on top. Hes on everybodys Mount Rushmore, a guy that I looked up to, Muhammad said. Thats what Im trying to chase, right? 
        
     My first goal was the gold. Now my next goal is the GOAT. So Im chasing him, and to be chasing him starting here in Montreal and in front of him is going to be great. Della Maddalena (17-2-0), meanwhile, is on a 17-fight win streak  including seven straight in the UFC  since dropping his first two bouts as a pro. A +145 underdog at BetMGM Sportsbook, he faces his stiffest test yet in Muhammad, but the calm-as-can-be 28-year-old doesnt expect the winning to stop in Montreal.  You learn a lot from losses. I learned a lot from both those ones, skill-wise and then mentally as well, and just been on a tear ever since, he said. Im glad to have got the losses behind me and all wins going forward. Shevchenko (24-4-1) is facing a new opponent for the first time in two years after three consecutive title bouts against Mexicos Alexa Grasso, having reclaimed the flyweight crown in September. Fiorot (12-1-0) is undefeated in seven UFC fights and trending as the slight -135 favorite to dethrone Shevchenko. Its because my past three fights have been total domination compared to her, whos had closer and tougher fights, Fiorot said. Shevchenko, 37, said shes never felt better. If compared myself to like (a) few years ago, Im a better version of myself  faster, stronger, more confident, she said. I feel the best shape that Ive been in my entire career. Its the UFCs eighth event in Montreal and first since 2015. Its also the 35th overall in Canada. Saturdays card is the first in Canada since Donald Trump was re-elected American president in November. It comes amid growing political tensions between Canada and the United States, as Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. I dont even think about that at all, UFC President and CEO Dana White said. That doesnt have an impact on what we do. Much like the 4 Nations Face-Off, however, political tensions between Canada and the U.S. could spill over into the arena. Bell Centre also was the site of three hockey fights in nine seconds when nations met at Februarys 4 Nations Face-Off. At least, thats how American welterweight Charles Radtke views his bout with Ontarios Mike Malott  especially amid the widespread booing of The Star-Spangled Banner at Canadian sports events. I dont (care) about hockey. Thats not my gig, Radtke said. But what I do hold dear is I grew up on a bison ranch with my grandfather, who was a sergeant major in the Marine Corps, and when you all boo the national anthem, somebodys gonna have to pay for that. Radtke has in recent months promoted Trumps 51st State rhetoric  the source of many boos during performances of the American national anthem north of the border  and spent much of his news conference trash-talking Canada. When asked about his message to the more than 20,000 Canadian fans likely to fill the building with jeers when he steps into the arena, he responded with an expletive. Mallott said he doesnt need to draw extra motivation from Radtkes noise. If thats where you want to put your energy, go for it, he said ahead of their preliminary card bout. Thats not where Im putting my energy. Im putting my energy into the octagon. It seems like were both really focused on me. Thats what I think about that. I dont care what this guys doing. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/ufc-315-muhammad-maddalena-montreal-6a14400cc9594ef3be450896abf69893,sports
Australian field hockey player who tried to buy drugs at the Paris Olympics returns from ban,"SYDNEY (AP)  Field hockey player Tom Craig was recalled to the Australian national team on Friday after serving a six-month suspension for trying to buy drugs at the Paris Olympics. The Australian player was stripped of his Olympic privileges when he was arrested in Paris following the sides Games quarterfinal exit last year. He spent the night in a Paris jail after attempting to buy drugs but escaped without a fine or conviction. The 29-year-old Craig was later handed a 12-month suspension by Hockey Australia, of which six were suspended. That didnt prevent him from playing overseas. Craig kept his contract in Germany where he pushed for a test recall under new Kookaburras coach Mark Hager. Craig, who has played 142 games for Australia, will remain in Europe ahead of the sides next Pro League legs in Belgium, England and Germany. Keeping the gratitude front of mind, Craig said of his mindset during the suspension. I cant really put to words how grateful I am for everyone whos supported me. Craig won Olympic silver with the team in Tokyo four years ago. ___ AP Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",https://apnews.com/article/australian-olympian-drugs-suspension-ac5c665e7f5af9cbea3e7f800c49ff16,sports

Rafael Devers tells Red Sox he wont move to first base,"BOSTON (AP)  Rafael Devers is the Boston Red Soxs designated hitter. And hes not interested in another position switch. Speaking with reporters for the first time since Triston Casas was ruled out for the season after rupturing his left knee tendon and undergoing surgery, Devers said on Thursday that Red Sox management approached him about the idea of filling in as Bostons first baseman.  The three-time All-Star doesnt see it in his best interest to make another position switch after being asked to move from third base to DH during spring training after the Red Sox signed Alex Bregman to play third. They came to me and talked to me about it, Devers said after homering and driving in two in Bostons 5-0 win over Texas.  I know Im a ballplayer, but at the same time, they cant expect me to play every single position out there. In spring training, they talked to me and basically told me to put away my glove. I wasnt going to play another position other than DH. Right now, I dont think it would be an appropriate decision by them to ask me to play another position. Devers said he spoke with Red Sox Chief Baseball Officer Craig Breslow about the prospect of playing first in Casas absence.  For now, Boston is filling the first base spot with a platoon featuring Romy Gonzalez and Abraham Toro. He (Breslow) played ball. I would like to think that he knows that changing positions isnt easy, Devers said through Red Sox interpreter Daveson Perez.  
        
     They put me in this situation. They told me they didnt want me to play any other positions. Devers offered a suggestion to Breslow, who pitched 12 major league seasons and was a key member of Bostons bullpen when the team won the World Series in 2013. Breslow is in his second season leading the Red Sox baseball operations department. Now, they should do their jobs essentially and hit the market and look for another player. Im not sure why they want me to be an in-between, Devers said. Next thing you know, someone in the outfield gets hurt and they want me to play in the outfield. I know the kind of player that I am and thats where I stand. Asked about changing his mind in the event the Red Sox receive little production from the current group of first basemen, Devers reiterated that hes a full-time DH.  He also stated that he was upset that Boston would consider him taking over a position where hes logged zero innings as a big leaguer. They told me that Im a little hard-headed, but they already asked me to change (positions) once. This time, I dont think I can be as flexible, Devers said. I dont feel they stayed true to their word. They told me I was going to play this position, DH. Now theyre going back on that. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/rafael-devers-boston-red-sox-6b555bbf156f83bcc4f2ce6ce9d6b29a,sports
A psychiatrist accused of negligence in Maradonas death does not regret the treatment provided,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  Psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov, one of the seven healthcare professionals on trial accused of negligence in the death of soccer great Diego Maradona testified on Thursday that she does not regret the treatment she provided to the former national team captain and blamed the private medical company for the deficiencies in his home care. Maradona had surgery for a hematoma that formed between his skull and brain and stayed in intensive care at Los Olivos clinic between Nov. 4-11. He then was sent recover to a private home where he died on Nov. 25. 2020 at the age of 60. I acted convinced that what I was doing was best for the patient, said the psychiatrist, the first of the defendants to testify in the courts of San Isidro, a northern suburb of Buenos Aires. In my role, I did what I could and even more. Cosachov was part of Maradonas medical team during the final stages of his life, along with neurosurgeon Leopoldo Luque and psychologist Carlos Daz. The three are on trial with doctors Nancy Forlini and Pedro Di Spagna; Mariano Perroni, a representative of the company that provided the nursing service; and nurse Ricardo Almirn. Maradona died in a rented house in Tigre, a northern suburb of Buenos Aires. Cosachov broke down in tears twice during her testimony, once when the presiding judge asked her what she thought happened to Maradona, to which she responded simply: I dont know. 
        
     Three judges will decide whether those charged are guilty of manslaughter. The maximum jail time for those sentenced is 25 years. According to the prosecution, the accused professionals didnt provide adequate medical care. We were all in agreement for home hospitalization, the psychiatrist stated, referring to Maradonas daughters, his sisters, his ex-wife, and the companys doctors. Involuntary hospitalization was also considered but the family didnt want that and home hospitalization was the only option. According to testimony of the director of the clinic where Maradona had surgery, the soccer star requested alcohol during the post-operative period, and was difficult to deal with. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/maradona-trial-argentina-6f9955067932f5fc33d7e7970d41027c,sports
"Montero, Keith lead Tigers over slumping Rockies 11-1 to sweep doubleheader","DENVER (AP)  Keider Montero pitched eight strong innings, Colt Keith homered, and the Detroit Tigers beat the Colorado Rockies 11-1 in the second game on Thursday to sweep their doubleheader. Spencer Torkelson had three hits and Brewer Hicklen singled in the third for his first career hit for Detroit. The Tigers won the first game 10-2 and finished 7-3 on their 10-game road trip. Montero (1-1) allowed a run and five hits to earn his first victory since Sept. 15, 2024. Two of Monteros seven career wins have come against the Rockies. He blanked them on Sept. 10, 2024, for his only complete game and has a 0.53 ERA against them. Colorado has lost six in a row and is a major league-worst 6-31. The Tigers trailed 1-0 but rallied in the third against Tanner Gordon (0-1), who was making his first start of the season. With bases loaded and no outs, Kerry Carpenter hit a grounder to Ryan McMahon at third base. The ball went through the webbing of McMahons glove for a base hit, and Gleyber Torres followed with his three-run double. Torkelson doubled and Jace Jung singled to drive in two more and make it a six-run inning. Keith homered off Tyler Kinley in the seventh, his fourth of the season. The Rockies had bases loaded and one out in the third when Michael Toglia topped a ball right in front of the plate. Catcher Dillon Dingler picked it up, stepped on home and threw to first to complete the inning-ending double play.

Ottawa Charge beat the Montreal Victoire 3-2 in Game 1 of PWHL semifinal series,"LAVAL, Quebec (AP)  Shiann Darkangelo broke a third-period tie, Gwyneth Philips made 31 saves and the Ottawa Charge beat the Montreal Victoire 3-2 on Thursday night in Game 1 of the PWHL semifinal series. Darkangelo took a pass from Emily Clark, and beat goalie Ann-Renee Desbiens with a wrist shot from the right side at 9:17.  Clarky made a great pass out to me and kind of made my job easy to get the puck on net  and in back the net, Darkangelo said. Just try to hit the net there, and good things happen. Charge captain Brianne Jenner had a power-play goal and Ashton Bell also scored. Game 2 of the best-of-five series is Sunday in Laval. Regular-season champion Montreal elected to face third-place Ottawa instead of fourth-place Minnesota. We dont need external motivation, Ottawa coach Carla MacLeod said. Weve come into this playoffs confident in what allowed us to get to this point. Its not about who were playing or where were playing. Its that we are playing, and were playing Ottawa Charge hockey right now. Maureen Murphy and Marie-Philip Poulin had power-play goals for Montreal. Desbiens stopped 24 shots. Its tough. Hockey is tough, Montreal forward Laura Stacey said. I had to take a deep breath before coming in here, because it hurts. Losing hurts, especially in the playoffs when you want it that bad. Jenner opened the scoring on a power play at 4:54 of the first period, and Murphy tied it on a power play with 7:47 left in the period. 
        
     Bell put Ottawa back on top at 5:07 of the second, and Poulin tied it on a power play at 7:12 of the period. We have a lot of respect for them and a lot of respect for the way that they play, Jenner said. But at the same time, were confident. When we bring a solid 60 minutes, we have a great chance of beating any club. ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/charge-victoire-score-pwhl-hockey-playoffs-62cb44212dfbb9ca009d88e6d8eb6e93,sports
Former Australian test cricketer Stuart MacGill is spared jail time over supplying cocaine,"SYDNEY (AP)  Former Australian test bowler Stuart MacGill was spared jail time and given a community service order when he appeared in court on Friday for sentencing over supplying cocaine. MacGill was convicted of supplying drugs for a deal between his regular supplier and his brother-in-law in April 2021. He appeared at Downing Centre District Court where a statement from former test captain Steve Waugh supported his former colleague. MacGill was sentenced to an intensive corrections order of one year and 10 months. MacGill must complete 495 hours of community service work and undergo drug testing as part of the order, in lieu of a prison term. The former legspinner, who began using cocaine after he retired from cricket, was found guilty in March of supplying an indictable quantity of the drug. A jury determined the 54-year-old MacGill knew about the deal between his regular dealer and his brother-in-law but was oblivious to the fact a one-kilogram (2.2-pound) brick was changing hands. He was acquitted of taking part in a large commercial drug supply. His role in the lucrative cocaine deal led to his alleged violent kidnapping days later. He was shoved into the back of a car by several men and taken to an abandoned building in Sydneys western suburbs, where he was assaulted and threatened before being released. Six days later, MacGill went to police but denied any involvement in the drug deal. He was arrested in 2023. 
        
     Judge Nicole Noman said Friday that MacGill played an indispensable role setting up the cocaine deal. His role was essential to bring the parties together and for the transaction to occur, she said. The offenders colossal lapse of judgment has been causative of a very public fall from grace. MacGills international career from 1988 to 2008 which featured 208 wickets in 44 test matches was largely overshadowed by fellow Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, who is second on the list of all-time leading wicket takers in test cricket. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/cricket-stuart-macgill-drugs-b494820be78811f0b10cf9f07f78c480,sports

PSG vs. Inter Milan in the Champions League final? Few expected that,"Its a Champions League final few could have predicted. No Real Madrid. No team from the mega-rich Premier League. No rejuvenated Barcelona. And no Harry Kane-inspired Bayern Munich. Instead, it will be Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan facing off to be a somewhat unlikely winner of the biggest prize in club soccer. Neither club was among the favorites when the new-look, 36-team league phase of the competition rolled out in September. Indeed, PSG  without Kylian Mbapp and at the start of the post-galacticos era  guaranteed its place in the knockout stage only by winning its final game of the league phase. Months later, however, PSG has been widely admired as perhaps the most stylish team in the competition after ending the title hopes of a succession of English opponents in its latest bid for its first European title. Meanwhile, three-time champion Inter, another team lacking superstars but well-coached and with a never-say-die spirit, has gone under the radar once again like it did when reaching the final in 2023 and losing to Manchester City. Heres a closer look at the details of the final, the teams and their route to the title match: Munichs Allianz Arena will host the final on May 31. Its the fifth time the German city has staged the European Cups title match. The first three  1979, 1993, 1997  were at Munichs previous home, Olympiastadion. The Allianz Arena was the host for Chelsea beating Bayern in a penalty shootout in 2012. American rock band Linkin Park will play the pre-match show. Real Madrid earned almost 139 million euros ($154 million) from its title-winning campaign in the Champions League last season and this seasons winner should get more. Last years prize fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) rose by 25% this season in the expanded format featuring more teams (36, up from 32) and more games (eight instead of six in the first stage). So expect PSG or Inter earn at least 150 million euros ($170 million) if the team winds up as champion. These coffers can be further boosted across June and July, when both teams will be in the United States for the expanded 32-team Club World Cup. Winning that competition could net PSG or Inter more than $100 million from the $1 billion prize money fund. The finalists have never met in the Champions League. Thats a refreshing rarity for two big clubs who regularly compete in Europe. PSG became the third French team to reach the European Cup final on two occasions, after Reims (1956 and 59) and Marseille (1991 and 93). PSGs other time was in 2020, when losing to Bayern Munich 1-0 in Lisbon. PSGs road to Munich has gone mostly through England. After seeing off fellow French club Brest in the playoffs, PSG has beaten Liverpool, Aston Villa and lastly Arsenal in successive rounds in the knockout stage  having also defeated then-Premier League champion Manchester City in a key victory in the next-to-last round of the league stage. Qualification was in the balance at that stage, with PSG having won just one of its first five league games only to win its last three. Inter was a two-time European champion before PSG was even founded in 1970, after titles in 1964 and 1965, while the Italian team added a third European crown in 2010. Unlike PSG, Inter qualified directly to the last 16 after finishing in fourth place, conceding just one goal in its eight league games. In the knockout stage, Simone Inzaghis team overcame Feyenoord in the round of 16, Bayern in the quarterfinals and Lamine Yamal and Barcelona in a pair of epic legs in the semifinals. PSGs relatively brief history was underwhelming until the club was bought in 2011 by Qatar Sports Investments. Then came the soccer boom in the capital and the arrival of trophy after trophy  well, at domestic level anyway. PSG has won 11 of the last 13 Ligue 1 titles but now the hardware the Qatari owners want is the Champions League. There will be extra satisfaction if it happens after a change in approach that has seen the club shed the superstars  Lionel Messi, Neymar and Mbapp  and rely on mostly young and hungry replacements, such as midfielder Joo Neves and forward Dsir Dou. It has been a more financially turbulent story at Inter, which has been owned by U.S. investment fund Oaktree since May last year after the eight-year tenure of Chinese retail giant Suning came to an end amid mounting debts. For three years before that, Inter was owned by a consortium led by Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir, which bought out Massimo Moratti. PSG has already clinched another French league this season, while Inter is still in a fight with Napoli to retain the Serie A title. ___ Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80 ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/champions-league-final-psg-inter-milan-a3ccc78740bdd82b85c20347aada197f,sports
"Texas regents approve basketball coach Sean Millers 6-year, $32 million contract","AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  The University of Texas System Board of Regents approved Longhorns basketball coach Sean Millers six-year, $32 million guaranteed contract on Thursday, as the school tries to boost a program that struggled in its first year in the Southeastern Conference. Texas will pay Miller about double that of his predecessor Rodney Terry. Terry still had three years left on a five-year contract that paid him about $3 million per year when he was dismissed in March. Millers deal starts at $4.8 million for the 2025-26 season and increases by $200,000 every year through the 2030-31 season. He also got a one-time $250,000 relocation payment, and can earn up to $850,000 in bonuses every season depending on conference championships, personal awards and how far Texas advances in the NCAA Tournament. Texas hired Miller from Xavier after the Musketeers beat Texas in the NCAA Tournament in a First Four matchup just a few days earlier. The 56-year-old Miller had two stints at Xavier and also coached at Arizona. He coached the Musketeers from 2004-09 before leaving for Arizona. He then returned to Xavier in 2022 after he was fired at Arizona. Millers teams have made the NCAA Tournament 13 times with four trips to the Elite Eight. He is 487-196 overall in 20 seasons. He now inherits a Texas program looking to find its footing in the SEC, college basketballs dominant league this season. Texas finished 14th in the 16-team conference and barely scraped its way into the NCAA Tournament before its early exit. 
        
     Terry led Texas to the Elite Eight as interim coach in 2023, but pressure mounted as he struggled to maintain that success. Texas made quick exits from the tournament the past two seasons, and was just 6-12 in league play in its first season in the SEC. Miller faces a significant rebuild of the Texas roster. Tre Johnson, the SEC freshman of the year and the Longhorns scoring leader last season, declared for the NBA draft and eight other players either finished their college eligibility or transferred. Texas has signed transfers Simeon Wilcher from St. Johns, Lassina Traore and Dailyn Swain from Xavier, Matas Vokietaitis from Florida Atlantic and Camden Heide from Purdue. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Alcaraz back from injury hoping to renew rivalry with Sinner at Italian Open,"ROME (AP)  Carlos Alcaraz says he has recovered from the muscle injuries that forced him to withdraw from the Madrid Open and is 100% ready for the Italian Open  where he hopes to renew his rivalry with Jannik Sinner. Alcaraz had an upper leg ailment that bothered him during the Barcelona Open final, plus a left leg injury. Im in a good shape. Im 100% ready to start the tournament, Alcaraz said in Rome on Thursday. Alcaraz opens against Serbian qualifier Dusan Lajovic on Friday. During the Spaniards Rome debut last year, he lost to then-135th-ranked Hungarian qualifier Fabian Marozsan in the third round as he dealt with a bothersome right forearm issue. But Alcaraz then went on to win back-to-back Grand Slam titles at the French Open and Wimbledon. Last year was even more difficult, Alcaraz said, noting how this clay season he has already won the Monte Carlo Masters and reached the final in Barcelona, where he lost to Holger Rune. I wasnt worried at all, Alcaraz said. Right now I have confidence. The practices (have gone) well. ... I cant wait for tomorrow. I think my level is in a good spot. The Rome tournament also marks the return of top-ranked Sinner from a three-month doping ban. Sinner and Alcaraz are in opposite sides of the draw. Im really happy to have him around again, Alcaraz said. Obviously for him was tough and Im pretty sure was super long.  It is great for me, for tennis, for the fans, that hes able to play a tournament again. Hopefully, the third-ranked Alcaraz added, Im going to meet him at the final. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/carlos-alcaraz-italian-open-6d1cb1c1ddaed229a0104a9ffcb99b29,sports

Punjab vs Delhi game in Indian Premier League abandoned after power outage,"DHARAMSALA, India (AP)  A power failure led to the abandonment of the Indian Premier League game between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals on Thursday with both teams awarded one point. One of the light towers at the stadium malfunctioned due to the outage, and the game was called off. Rain and a wet outfield had delayed the start by an 90 minutes and Punjab cruised to 122-1 in 10.1 overs before the outage. Due to a power outage in the area, one of the light towers at the HPCA stadium malfunctioned, the IPL said in a statement. BCCI regrets the inconvenience caused to the in-stadium attendees. Priyansh Arya (70) and Prabhsimran Singh (50 not out) both took on the new ball bowlers Mitchell Starc and Dushmantha Chameera as Punjab raced to 50 in the first four overs. Arya completed his third half-century of the season soon after the batting powerplay of six overs off just 25 balls. Prabhsimran became the first uncapped batter to score four successive half-centuries in the IPL that featured seven boundaries. Arya smashed six sixes and five boundaries in his aggressive knock of 34 balls before he top-edged fast bowler T. Natarajan and the players walked off the field due to power failure. It was the last game of the season in Dharamsala after the organizers shifted Punjabs scheduled game on Sunday against Mumbai Indians from Dharamsala to Ahmedabad because of India-Pakistan tensions. 
        
     The IPL cited logistical challenges on Thursday. Airports in Dharamsala and Chandigarh  where Punjab Kings are based  have been closed for civilian and commercial purposes since Wednesday.

Brooks Lees go-ahead double in 8th leads Twins to 5-2 victory over Orioles for series sweep,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Brooks Lee had a tiebreaking two-run double with two outs in the eighth inning to propel the Minnesota Twins to a 5-2 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday, completing a three-game sweep with their fifth straight victory. Lees double came off reliever Gregory Soto, who entered after Yennier Cano (0-2) walked Harrison Bader leading off and Byron Buxton with one out. Soto struck out Trevor Larnach before Lee doubled to center. Ty France followed with an RBI single for a three-run lead. Buxton went 0 for 2 after homering in three straight games, but he walked twice, scored twice, stole a base and threw a runner out at home. Emmanuel Rivera and Ramn Laureano had RBI doubles in back-to-back innings off Twins starter Bailey Ober for a 2-1 lead in the third. Buxton threw out Rivera, who doubled and was trying to score on Gunnar Hendersons single in the sixth. The Twins tied it in the bottom half on a leadoff homer by Larnach  his fifth. Kremer has surrendered eight of Baltimores MLB-high 55 homers. Ober allowed two runs  one earned  on eight hits in five innings. Griffin Jax (1-2) pitched a scoreless eighth and Jhoan Duran earned his sixth save. Kremer went seven innings, allowing two runs on three hits with eight strikeouts for the Orioles, who have lost five straight and 9 of 11.

Rafael Devers homers and drives in two runs as the Red Sox beat the Rangers 5-0,"BOSTON (AP)  Rafael Devers homered and drove in two runs, and five Boston pitchers combined for a five-hit shutout as the Red Sox defeated the Texas Rangers 5-0 on Thursday afternoon. Devers hit a solo shot for his sixth home run of the season, sending it into the Green Monster seats in the seventh inning. His first RBI of the game came on a single in the fifth inning. Carlos Narvaez also produced a run-scoring single for the Red Sox, which took two of three against the Rangers. Red Sox starter Bryan Bello teamed up with four relievers to produce Bostons third shutout of the season. Justin Slaten (1-3) earned the win with 1.1 scoreless innings. Garrett Whitlock tossed one inning with Liam Hendricks finishing off Texas with two innings. Texas starter Jack Leiter (2-2) took the loss, giving up four runs and walking four in 5.1 innings. No. 9 hitter Tucker Barnhart collected two of the Rangers five hits. Texas has now dropped nine of its last 12 games. Boston took advantage of Leiter issuing two walks and throwing a wild pitch in the second inning en route to building a 2-0 lead. Trevor Story led off with a single and scored on a wild pitch while Jarren Durans grounder to second plated the second run of the frame. Bello ran into control problems that left him one out short of qualifying for his third win. Boston manager Alex Cora turned to the bullpen after Bello issued his fifth walk to set up a two-on, two-out scenario for the Rangers in the fifth inning. Slaten came on and got a grounder for the final out and closed the book on Bello, who tossed 4.2 innings but only threw 44 of his 83 pitches for strikes. 
        
     Whitlock found himself in trouble in the seventh after throwing a wild pitch that moved the two Texas baserunners into scoring position with two down. Trying to avoid getting charged with his third blown save in as many outings, Whitlock kept Bostons shutout bid alive by getting Rangers No. 3 hitter Joc Pederson to fly out to center for the innings final out. Bello lowered his ERA to 1.10 in three starts at Fenway Park this season.

Marquette announces addition of womens swimming to its list of varsity programs,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Marquette is launching a womens swimming program, marking the first time it has added a varsity sport since 2013. School officials have launched a national search for someone to coach the program, which could begin competition as early as the 2025-26 school year. Marquette plans to compete in the Big East championships in womens swimming, but it wont have a diving program. Big East schools that already have womens swimming include Butler, UConn, Georgetown, Providence, Seton Hall, Villanova and Xavier. Adding womens swimming will improve gender equity in athletics and provide a revenue generation opportunity for the university, while offering a competitive Division I experience for our student-athletes, athletic director Mike Broeker said in a statement. Its a win-win for our department and university. The team will train and compete in the recently renovated Wellness + Helfaer Recreation facility, which includes a six-lane, 25-yard pool plus seating for nearly 150 spectators and a dedicated team locker room. The facility would be able to host dual competitions, though any larger meets would take place off campus. Womens swimming becomes Marquettes 17th varsity sport, which includes nine womens programs. Marquette last launched a new program in 2013, when it added mens and womens lacrosse. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",https://apnews.com/article/marquette-women-swimming-47dfc06e55810627f38d681a96a402fa,sports
Los Angeles Coliseum and SoFi Stadium to share opening and closing ceremonies for 2028 Olympics,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Itll be a mix of old and new for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and Paralympic Games. The historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in nearby Inglewood will share the ceremonies, city officials announced Thursday, confirming what was part of the citys bid in 2017. It will be the Coliseums third time hosting the ceremony  the most in Olympic history  and itll be the first time two locations have shared it. SoFi will also host swimming at the Games.

US striker Baloguns return to fitness boosts Monacos Champions League hopes,"MONACO (AP)  Folarin Balogun is back in form and thats excellent news for Monaco as the race for Champions League places draws to a close in Ligue 1. The United States forward last weekend played his first full match since shoulder surgery in December and was excellent throughout, helping Monaco to a crucial 3-1 win at Saint-Etienne that kept the Principality side in contention for a place in Europes elite competition.  Playing 90 minutes is definitely a positive thing for my fitness and confidence, Balogun said after scoring his first league goal this year. Its good to have helped the team win by scoring. Its always difficult to return to 100% when you injure your shoulder. Monaco next has a tough game against Lyon on Saturday. With two rounds left and Paris Saint-Germain already crowned champion, second-placed Marseille has just a one-point lead over Monaco. A trio of chasing teams  Nice, Lille and Strasbourg  lag one point further back. The top three qualify for the group stage of the Champions League, and the fourth team grabs a spot in the qualifying rounds. Marseille travels to struggling Le Havre on Saturday. PSG, which qualified for the Champions League final on Wednesday, is at last-placed Montpellier. Balogun returned to action in March with the clubs reserve team in a friendly against Brighton Under-23s. The American international scored a hat trick in the first half and gradually came back to full fitness, making five substitute appearances before getting a starting nod last week. 
        
     The forward was previously sidelined for about two months by the injury and returned to competition at the end of November. But he took a hit during a match against Marseille that aggravated the problem and he opted for surgery. It takes time to regain ones full capacity, and I didnt know when I would be back, Balogun said. I was a little anxious but Im glad I took the time because Im now completely confident. Baloguns presence against Lyon is also timely if fellow forward Mika Biereth is not fully fit after getting injured at Saint-Etienne. The American striker started alongside Biereth up front and the chemistry was obvious.  Weve played together in the past at Arsenal, so hes a player Im familiar with, Balogun said. We have a very good connection, and I love playing with him. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/ligue1-balogun-monaco-bfd7247cf5aa327dfe3042c3561cb204,sports
Bundesliga Preview: What to watch in German soccer this weekend,"BERLIN (AP)  Beers and tears are set to flow in the Bundesliga amid Bayern Munichs title celebrations, farewell tributes, and two teams potentially relegated from the division this weekend. Bottom two Bochum and Holstein Kiel could be demoted on Saturday if their and other results dont go their way. Bayern, which clinched its 34th German championship last weekend with two rounds to spare, will be presented with the trophy after its home match against Borussia Mnchengladbach on Saturday, when the departing Thomas Mller will be honored after 25 years at the club. England star Harry Kane will finally get to take part in title-winning celebrations. Meanwhile, a host of teams are fighting for European qualification with just two points between Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund and Leipzig in the race for the last Champions League qualification spot. Only the top four teams qualify for Europes premier competition. 
        
      Bochum needs to avoid defeat at Mainz to stave off demotion. Even a win might not be enough if Heidenheim wins at Union Berlin at the same time. Heidenheim is third from bottom, four points clear of Bochum, in the relegation playoff place.  Kiel would be demoted by a defeat to Champions League-chasing Freiburg if Heidenheim beats Union. Freiburg, which should have beaten Bayer Leverkusen last weekend, will be targeting three points to defend the all-important fourth place.  Borussia Dortmund has put itself in contention for the Champions League with three straight wins since its 2-2 draw with Bayern. Niko Kovas team next visits Leverkusen on Sunday, when the home team will be under pressure to produce a good showing to appease fans frustrated by the speculation over Xabi Alonsos future as coach.  Third-placed Eintracht Frankfurt can secure Champions League qualification with a win over visiting St. Pauli on Sunday. Even a draw will be enough if Freiburg fails to beat Kiel or Dortmund fails to beat Leverkusen earlier. But St. Pauli could be playing for its survival, depending on other results on Saturday. A win would guarantee the Hamburg teams place in the Bundesliga next season.  Dortmund forward Serhou Guirassy scored twice against Wolfsburg last weekend and already has 19 goals in his first season with the club. His goals could prove vital if Kovas team is to complete its renaissance with Champions League qualification. Dortmund was 11th when Kova took over.  Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya is the fastest player in the Bundesliga, clocked at more than 37 kph (23 mph) against Bochum in the 26th round. The 19-year-old French forward has made 32 appearances for Frankfurt this season.  Jamal Musiala is still working on his comeback for Bayern. The 22-year-old Germany star hasnt played since early April because of a left thigh injury but the club is hopeful hell be fit for the revamped Club World Cup in the United States next month.  Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano has returned to training after a knee operation, but Kim Min-jae needs more time after an Achilles problem.  Heidenheim goalkeeper Kevin Mller left hospital on Monday after a serious head injury in last weekends game against Bochum, which also took a heavy toll on Bochum forward Philipp Hofmann. Hofmann broke a rib causing his lung to collapse and will miss the rest of the season.  Mainz defender Dominik Kohr is out for the rest of the season with a left knee injury from Sundays 1-1 draw with Frankfurt.  St. Pauli winger Elias Saad is also out with a right thigh injury from last weekends 0-0 draw with Werder Bremen, becoming the clubs fourth player to miss the rest of the season after James Sands, Karol Mets and captain Jackson Irvine.  The Bild tabloid reported this week that Dortmund has decided against offering new deals to Emre Can, Julian Brandt, Pascal Gro and Niklas Sle.  The Ruhr Nachrichten reports that Dortmund is interested in bringing another Bellingham to the club, Jobe, the younger brother of Jude, who had a successful stint in Dortmund before his big-money move to Real Madrid. The 19-year-old Jobe Bellingham plays for Sunderland in Englands second division.  Liverpool is targeting Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller, according to the Stuttgarter Nachrichten. The local newspaper reports Stuttgart would demand a club record fee of 60 million euros to let the defensive midfielder go. The 24-year-old Stiller has played almost every game for Stuttgart this season and made four appearances for Germany. Some are calling him the new Toni Kroos.  Im definitely keen to leave my comfort zone at some point and experience something new.

Beckham and Neville part of new ownership group at English soccer club Salford,"David Beckham and Gary Neville are part of a new consortium to have taken ownership of English fourth-tier soccer club Salford City. The club was previously owned by Beckham, Neville and other former Manchester United teammates in its so-called Class of 92  Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville  along with Singapore businessman Peter Lim. A new ownership group, containing Beckham, Gary Neville and other shareholders from the United States, India and England, has bought Salford and have committed to invest significantly in the club, the team and its facilities, Salford said on Thursday. Butt, Giggs, Scholes and Phil Neville are no longer shareholders but will continue to contribute to the next step of this journey with roles in the club, Salford said. Beckham grew up in Salford and said he had such fond memories of my time living there and the place and its people played such an important part in my early life in football. Salford City is at the heart of its community ... it has a rich history and I am delighted to be a part of the next chapter. Beckham also is a co-owner of Major League Soccer club Inter Miami. Neville said the consortium contains a diverse range of minds and expertise, held together by a love of football. Football will come first, however its critical that we drive the club towards sustainability in the next four, five years, Neville said. I cant wait for the next part of this journey. 
        
     Salford finished in eighth place  outside the playoff spots  in League Two this season. Beckham said he has been inspired by Wrexhams rise through English soccer under the ownership of Hollywood celebrities Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney since 2021. Im not saying this is why were doing it because its not, Beckham told The Athletic in an interview. But Ive spoken to Ryan about it so many times now and he said the feeling around the city, the feeling around the club, is so exceptional. Thats the kind of thing that we want to create. Beckham added that the dream was to take Salford to the Premier League. But theres a lot of hard work and a lot of investment to be done up until that point, he said. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/beckham-neville-salford-d215e9251cbd51eb0877000dc30af9d9,sports
Ferrari frustration mounts as Hamilton and Leclerc struggle at Miami Grand Prix,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Lewis Hamilton arrived at the Miami Grand Prix admittedly frustrated with his slow start to the Formula 1 season driving for Ferrari.  There was little improvement to his performance, and Hamilton was ordered by Ferrari to give up seventh place in Sundays race to teammate Charles Leclerc. Hamilton settled for eighth, his worst finish since he was disqualified from the second race of the season.  Even so, the seven-time F1 champion was upbeat after the race.  I generally enjoyed the race, Hamilton said. I think this weekend, while we were not as quick as we want to be, I feel like I had a better weekend in general. The result might not show it, but I was 12th to seventh. Hamilton even briefly thought hed have a fantastic day when a change to medium tires made him feel the car really come alive and I felt super optimistic in that moment. Even so, Ferrari had nothing for McLaren Racing, which went 1-2 with Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. I think it wasnt a good weekend ... we cant be satisfied with P7 and P8, said Ferrari team principal Frdric Vasseur. You start P8 and P12, its almost impossible to fight your way back and challenge the cars ahead. The other thing is that McLaren was probably on another planet. We had enough pace to battle with Red Bull and Mercedes, but not with McLaren. Piastri has four victories this year  three in a row  and Norris has one as McLaren has won five of the first six races. Four-time defending F1 champion Max Verstappen has one win, while Ferrari has yet to even challenge with Hamilton and Leclerc.  
        
     Compounding problems for Ferrari in Miami was a crash on Saturday when Leclerc lost control of his car as he headed out to the track for the sprint race. He wasnt able to compete in the sprint and Ferrari had to hustle to even have him ready for qualifying.  Hamilton finished third in the sprint race but then failed to carry the momentum into qualifying. His only complaint after the race, though? Not the team orders to give Leclerc position, but in how slow Ferrari was to communicate the plan.  It seemed that Ferrari told Leclerc before the team told Hamilton, so when Leclerc first attempted the pass, it didnt work. Once Hamilton got the message, the British driver let Leclerc by on the next lap.  This is not good team work. Thats all Im going to say, Hamilton said on the Ferrari team radio.  After the race, Hamilton said he thought he was actually pretty fast when Ferrari called for the position swap.  I was clearly quick at that moment and I didnt think the decision came quick enough, Hamilton said. And then for sure, in that time, youre like Come on. I have no problems with the team or Charles. I think we can do better, but the car is where we really need to go to work.  Leclerc said he knows Ferraris drama in Miami will make for a compelling controversy in F1, but that the true problem is the car just isnt good enough.  We need to do better, thats for sure. Today was not ideal and was far from maximizing our potential, he said. Weve got to regroup as a team and be better. He admitted that like Hamilton, Leclerc is also frustrated by Ferraris performance so far this season. His best finish to date was third at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix last month.  Theres frustration already that you are, I was fighting for P8 and I was not making any gains, Leclerc said. I was really struggling with the car, so theres a frustration of that and then all the rest and it all adds up.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-ferrari-hamilton-leclerc-4021aec691671c3f5e3665aa00e5ce1c,sports
Reigning Cup champion Joey Logano gets 1st win this season in overtime at Texas,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)  Reigning NASCAR Cup champion Joey Logano overcame a lot to finally get his first victory this season.  It came a week after Team Penske teammate Austin Cindrics win at Talladega, where Logano had a fifth-place finish that became 39th after a postrace inspection found an issue with the spoiler on his No. 22 Ford. There was also Loganos expletive-laden rant on the radio toward his teammate in the middle of that race that the two smoothed out during the week. Oh, and he started 27th at Texas after a bad qualifying effort on the 1 1/2-mile track.  But Logano surged ahead on the restart in overtime Sunday to win in the 11th race this year. He led only seven of the 271 laps, four more than scheduled.  After what happened last week, to be able to rebound and come right back, its a total 22' way of doing things. So proud of the team, Logano said.  On the final restart after the 12th caution, Logano was on the inside of his other teammate, Ryan Blaney. But Logano pulled away on the backstretch and stayed easily in front the final 1 1/2 laps, while Ross Chastain then passed Blaney to finish second ahead of him. Just slowly, methodically, Logano said of his progression to the front. Just kept grinding, a couple here and a couple there and eventually get a win here. Logano got his 37th career victory, getting the lead for the first time on lap 264. He went low to complete a pass of Michael McDowell. 
        
     I mean theres always a story next week, right, Logano said. So I told my wife last week before we left, I said watch me go win this one. Its just how we do stuff. On a caution with 47 laps left, McDowell took only two tires and moved up 15 spots to second. He ended up leading 19 laps, but got loose a few laps after getting passed by Logano and crashed to bring out the caution that sent the race to overtime. He finished 26th.  We were giving it everything we had there to try to keep track position, McDowell said. Joey got a run there, and I tried to block it. I went as far as I think you could probably go. When Blaney slid in front of me, it just took the air off of it and I just lost the back of it. I still had the fight in me, but I probably should have conceded at that point. William Byron, Kyle Larson, Denny Hamlin and Chase Elliott remained the top four in season points. ... Elliott left Texas last spring with his first victory after 42 races and 18 months without one. He hasnt won since, and now has another long winless drought  this one 38 races and now nearly 13 months after finishing 16th. ... A crew member for Christopher Bell crawled in through the passenger side of the No. 20 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota and was fully in the car to reconnect an air hose the drivers helmet during a caution in the second stage. It took two stops during that caution, and twice climbing into the car, to resolve the issue.  Hamlin had finished on the lead lap in 21 consecutive races, but a fiery finish on lap 75 ended that streak that had matched the eighth-longest in NASCAR history. He was the first car out of the race.  After the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota lost power, something blew up when Hamlin recycled the engine. There were flames coming out from under the car and it was engulfed in smoke by time it rolled to a stop on the inside of the track and Hamlin climbed out unharmed.  Carson Hocevar, the 22-year-old driver who is McDowells teammate with Spire Motorsports, was the youngest polesitter ever in Texas. He led only the first 22 laps of the race, losing it while pitting during the first caution. He finished 24th after a late accident. Both in-race stages finished under caution. Cindric won Stage 1 after Hamlins issues and Kyle Larson took the second after a yellow flag came out because of debris on the track after the right rear tire on Chris Bueschers car came apart.  Larson got his 68th overall stage win and his sixth at Texas, with both marks being records. He has won a stage in each of the last five Cup races at Texas, starting in his 2021 win there.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-texas-logano-57237c018b7ff8ecb7dac17f6bbe5395,sports
Cadillac F1 makes its entrance as official team at Miami Grand Prix as questions swirl about lineup,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  The new Cadillac F1 team officially announced its arrival at a glitzy South Beach extravaganza packed with industry executives and influencers and highlighted by a musical showcase from Janelle Mone and actor Terry Crews Jr., who shared an anecdote about how hed never been born had his father not relocated at age 20 to Flint, Michigan, in search of a job with General Motors.  A splashy video ultimately unveiled the Cadillac F1 team logo at a multimillion-dollar party jammed elbow-to-elbow in the Queen Miami Beach venue.  What wasnt revealed? Cadillacs car, a bit of a disappointment for those who expected to see all the bells and whistles at the brand launch introduction to F1s newest team.  No worries, promised the leaders of the new team: Cadillac F1 is on pace to be on the grid in 2026.  Were building cars, weve been in the wind tunnel for a long time, said Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports, the team owner. Chassis has arrived, were continuing to add (personnel) to the team, there are so many work streams that are happening all at once. But I want to make sure everybody understands just how deep the partnership is with General Motors and with Cadillac. I think thats something that really will set apart this team, this entry, on the grid.  Cadillac will debut in 2026 with a two-car lineup that will push the F1 field to 22 cars  the first time since 2016 the grid will have more than 20 cars. It was a long road for Cadillac F1 to get to this point. The project started with Michael Andretti, who failed to buy Sauber in his effort to create a true American team that would feature at least one American driver. When he didnt close the Sauber deal, Andretti petitioned F1 and governing body FIA to expand the field for Andretti Global, which led to the equivalent of an IRS audit during a grueling application process. F1 denied the application. Towriss and Cadillac pressed on  they spent the last year saying work on the project continues on pace  and when Towriss bought out Andretti late last year, F1 changed course and the new team was suddenly fast-tracked. General Motors President Mark Reuss was finally able to attend an F1 race  the Miami Grand Prix over the weekend  in an official capacity. So geeked to finally be in the club, Reuss pulled out his phone to play an audio clip for reporters of the first Cadillac engine being fired.  Cadillac will initially race with Ferrari engines before GMs power unit is ready for 2029. Reuss said the Cadillac approach is deliberate to have a reliable, fast engine rather than rush one out for next season.  You have to go slow to go fast, Reuss said. Cadillac will have the largest U.S. presence of any F1 team and will operate out of facilities in Fishers, Indiana, as well as in Charlotte, North Carolina. The team also has a satellite facility at Silverstone, England. When Andretti first launched this project, he was adamant it was for an American driver, specifically California native and current IndyCar driver Colton Herta.  Now the list of potential drivers is rather long. Towriss and Reuss were adamant theyve yet to sign a driver amid reports that Sergio Perez has already signed. The need for there to be an American is not a pressing issue to TWG. Theres a lot of interest in this team and were very appreciative of that, Towriss said. We want that person set up for success, and want that seat respected when that American driver does come in for the team. ... Well find the right way and the right time to bring the right driver into Formula 1. IndyCar driver Pato OWard, who races under the Mexican flag but spent most of his childhood in Texas, wants a seat. Towriss said they had a funny run-in two weeks ago at the Indianapolis 500 open test when the elevator Towriss was in opened and there was OWard; they joked they would talk.  McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown said he wouldnt prevent OWard from pursuing a seat with Cadillac. OWard drives for McLaren in IndyCar and is the teams F1 reserve driver. I wouldnt like it, but I wouldnt stop him, Brown said. Valtteri Bottas, now an F1 reserve driver for Mercedes, told The Associated Press he is very interested while IndyCar driver Colton Herta has recently hedged on whether he wants the seat. There are a number of Americans who could be candidates, especially if the team is willing to wait until deeper into its existence to hire one. NASCAR driver Connor Zilisch, an 18-year-old quickly climbing through the stock car series ladder system, initially pursued European racing in his career. Sebastian Wheldon, who is deep into the Andretti Global driver development program, on Saturday won his debut Italian F4 race at Misano with Prema Racing. Another idea could put a long-debated topic to the test: NASCAR champion Kyle Larson, who often comes up as potentially the only driver in the world who could match F1 standout Max Verstappen in talent.  When AP asked Reuss about the possibility of Larson, Reuss said lets focus on Indianapolis first. Larson will run for McLaren and Chevrolet for a second consecutive year in the Indianapolis 500 later this month.  Reuss said GMs F1 efforts will not be affected by President Donald Trumps proposed tariffs despite a potential $5 billion (3.8bn) impact. Despite reversing a number of the planned tariffs on imports in recent weeks, a 25% tariff is still in place.  This is a long-term footprint that we have that are very old in some cases, that have been there a long time, Reuss said. So were working to bring as much as we can into the United States and avoid the tariffs. But not at all cost, and it doesnt happen overnight. Theres no light switch that says, Oh, all of a sudden were tariff-free. You probably would have seen over the last few days, we did earnings on the early part of the week, and then we came back and did the earnings review and guidance. In that second one, theres about $5 billion of impact for us. But its not going to affect this (F1) project. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-cadillac-miami-2026-895ff9f4e321ce964ddb65ed3447e870,sports

"Lions squad for Australia: Itoje captain, Pollock in but no Doris or Farrell","Maro Itoje will captain a British and Irish Lions squad for the tour of Australia that contains 15 Irish players, just two Welshmen and an Englishman with barely 30 minutes of international rugby to his name. A 38-man touring party was announced on Thursday in front of an audience of more than 2,000 rugby fans at The O2 arena in London, with the 30-year-old Itoje becoming the first English player to captain the Lions  one of the biggest honors in the sport  since Martin Johnson in 2001. Itoje will be heading on his third tour, after 2017 and 2021, and completes his rise as a leader, having become the captain of England and Saracens only this season. When his name was read out by Lions coach Andy Farrell, Itoje walked out in full Lions uniform  holding the lion mascot, Bill  to warm applause. Its a tremendous honor and a tremendous privilege, said Itoje, who has 93 caps for England. Its a bit of a surreal experience, to be honest. Farrell phoned Itoje on Tuesday to give him the good news but they could barely hear each other because of a poor signal, so Farrell hung up. He soon phoned back and quickly offered him the captaincy. Itojes path to the Lions captaincy might have been cleared by Caelan Doris, the Ireland captain, who injured his shoulder playing for Leinster against Northampton Saints in the Champions Cup semifinals last weekend. Doris, a star No. 8, would have been a certainty to make the squad but had to be left out. 
        
     As you can imagine, he is devastated, Farrell said. Commiserations to those who thought they would be selected today. But things happen on tour or before you get on the plane as well. So everyone who has ambition, keep fighting, stay fit and we will be watching. Injuries are expected before the tourists leave for Australia in late June. In 2021, Ireland prop Andrew Porter withdrew because of a toe injury. Hes been picked again. Tour captain Alun Wyn Jones and Dan Lydiate were injured in the warm-up win over Japan. Jones recovered from a dislocated shoulder to play in the tests in South Africa. That Leinster-Northampton game was significant in another way, too. Henry Pollock, a 20-year-old flanker who was largely unknown before this season, produced a man-of-the-match display for Northampton in its improbable win to cement his place in the Lions squad and continue his dramatic rise in rugby. His only appearance for England was as a second-half, try-scoring replacement against Wales in the final round of the recent Six Nations. He started the championship with the England Under-20s and had played only one game in Englands top league before this season. Pollock  the surprise name selected by Farrell in a squad containing the best players from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales  was watching the squad announcement on TV with his Northampton teammates and was mobbed when his name was read out. If youre good enough, youre old enough, Farrell said. An Englishman not picked was Owen Farrell, the son of the coach and someone hoping to go on a fourth straight Lions tour. Fellow Englishmen Fin Smith and Marcus Smith and Scotlands Finn Russell were the preferred options at flyhalf. Farrell hasnt played international rugby since the 2023 World Cup, after which he stepped down from national duty to protect his mental health. He has since quit English rugby and moved to France to play for Racing 92 in Paris, but he suffered a head injury last weekend in an injury-plagued season. He was in the conversation, Andy Farrell said of his son. We feel Owen is still trying to find his way back to fitness. Beside Farrell, other flyhalves contenders to miss out included Ireland starter Sam Prendergast and England veteran George Ford. Only Ireland has more players than Englands 13. Scotland will have eight representatives and one was born in Melbourne  center Sione Tuipulotu. Just two players are from Wales  scrumhalf Tomos Williams and flanker Jac Morgan  with their nation on a losing run of 17 tests stretching back to 2023. Its Wales smallest representation since World War II. I didnt feel any pressure at all to pick Welsh players, Farrell said. Williams said he shed a tear when he heard his name, adding: Its the top of the mountain  you cant get higher than this achievement. Its an inexperienced squad, with 26 players set to be first-time tourists and nine going on a second tour. Scotland centers Tuipulotu and Huw Jones  nicknamed Huwipulotu  were chosen on long-ago form. Tuipulotu was considered a nailed-on Lions starter until he tore a pectoral muscle in late January, dealing a damaging blow to Scotlands Six Nations hopes. Hes close to returning to action. Jones hasnt played since the Six Nations because of an ankle injury. Scotland record try-scorer Duhan van der Merwe was also picked even though he hasnt played since late March after ankle surgery. Rugged lock Scott Cummings was another to miss the Six Nations and has just returned from a three-month layoff. Their national teammate Blair Kinghorn is also in, but if his Toulouse club reaches the French Top 14 final again on June 28, he wont join the Lions until after their opening match in Australia. The Lions won the test series against the Wallabies the last time they toured Australia, in 2013. They have since drawn the series against New Zealand in 2017 and lost in South Africa in 2021. For the latest tour, the Lions will play three tests against the Wallabies, along with six more games in Australia  against Western Force, Queensland Reds, NSW Waratahs, ACT Brumbies, an Invitational Australia and New Zealand XV, and a First Nations and Pasifika XV. The tour begins with a match against Argentina in Dublin on June 20 and ends with the series-closing third test on Aug. 2.

Rog aiming to do a Pog by winning the Giro-Tour double. First up is conquering Italy again.,"MILAN (AP)  Anything Pog can do so can Rog. Primoz Roglic will try to step out of the shadow of the all-conquering Tadej Pogacar by emulating his Slovenian compatriot when the Giro dItalia starts on Friday in Albania. Last season, Pogacar, who rides for UAE Team Emirates, became the first cyclist in 26 years to win the Giro and Tour de France in the same year. Now Roglic and his Red Bull Bora Hansgrohe team have their eyes on the double. You can get some inspiration by looking at how UAE approached it, and seeing the ideas, team head of performance Dan Lorang says. You have to focus on yourself, but it would be stupid to close the eyes and not look left and right. You get inspiration when you see whats possible, and thats motivating. Pogacar proved the Giro and the Tour is possible. In the absence of cyclings dominant duo, Pogacar and two-time Tour winner Jonas Vingegaard, Roglic is the favorite going into the Giro  although it is unlikely to be the demolition job it proved last year, when the question almost from the start was not if Pogacar would win but by how much. In the end, Pogacar won by the races biggest margin of victory in nearly six decades. The previous year, Roglic won the Giro by one of the smallest margins. Five-time Grand Tour winner Roglic will head into the gruelling three-week race backed by a strong team that includes 2022 winner Jai Hindley and last years runner-up Dani Martnez. 
        
     The goal is to win, of course, Lorang said. Having Primoz on board now changes things for us. He knows how to win three-week stage races and the Giro. We planned for a victory at the Giro from winter until now. Pogacar wont be one of Roglics main rivals at the Giro but one of his teammates will be. With a reputation as the rising star of Spanish cycling, Juan Ayuso will regard anything less than a podium finish a disappointment. Ayuso told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport that he wouldnt see it as failure if he failed to win on his Giro debut. He wasnt finished. But at the same time, Im not saying that I would be happy with a podium, either. It would be a disappointment not to finish in the top three, because I would consider that a step backwards. It will be a fight between experience and youth. The 22-year-old Ayuso is already a winner in Italy this season after success at the week-long Tirreno-Adriatico but he was pipped on home turf by the 35-year-old Roglic at the Volta a Catalunya. This Giro wont just be a two-man race, however. There are other potential winners, up-and-comers and those with tested general classification potential. The peloton includes five former Giro winners  beside Roglic and Hindley were Nairo Quintana (2014), Richard Carapaz (2019) and Egan Bernal (2021). All have their names etched on the Trofeo Senza Fine (Trophy With No End). Theres a saying that you cant win the Giro in the first week but you can certainly lose it. There is no major set-piece mountain battle in the first half of the race unlike in other editions, and  as usual  a brutal final week. But riders will still face plenty of difficulties right from the start. Three tricky stages in Albania are followed by the Giro moving to the heel of Italy and the route snaking north. Stage seven sees the first summit finish and two days later there is a mini Strade Bianche on the white, gravel roads of Tuscany. The winner of the maglia rosa will be decided in the Alps, which hosts four of the five hardest mountain stages in the final week and more than 9,000 meters of climbing in the two days before the climax in Rome. The 3,443-kilometer (2,140-mile) route ends on June 1 and includes a homage to the late Pope Francis by passing through an area of the Vatican rarely seen by the general public. ___ AP cycling: https://apnews.com/hub/cycling",https://apnews.com/article/roglic-ayuso-giro-ditalia-cycling-b6896f308cd27f42fc9b05eb68e1b2aa,sports
Dubai police make several arrests over disturbances after a local soccer match,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Dubai police arrested several people involved in fights after a weekend soccer match between UAE Pro League clubs Shabab Al Ahli and Al Wasl in a rare disturbance in the tightly policed sheikhdom. Officers used surveillance footage to identify suspects, Maj. Gen. Abdullah Al Ghaith said in a statement Wednesday. Police didnt say how many people were arrested. Al Wasl won the match on Saturday 2-1. Angry Shabab Al Ahli fans threw water bottles at Al Wasl fans and on the soccer field, while Al Wasl fans lit smoke flares and hurled water bottles. Local media reported that fans threw stones, clashed outside the stadium and confronted Shabab Al Ahli defender Bogdan Planic as he made his way to the team bus before security guards intervened. The UAE Football Association on Tuesday demanded both soccer clubs pay fines over the fights and swearing. Shabab Al Ahli was fined $19,000, while Al Wasl was fined more than $21,000.  Political parties and labor unions are banned in the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms including Dubai. Broad laws severely restrict freedom of speech and protests. A middle finger raised in a traffic dispute, a text message calling someone a name or swearing in public easily can spark criminal cases  something that foreign tourists may not realize until its too late.",https://apnews.com/article/emirates-dubai-soccer-arrests-06e31f873cb16b81e7e51b876f5f1004,sports
Sinner not naming names for messages he did and didnt receive during doping ban,"ROME (AP)  Jannik Sinner was just as surprised by which fellow players sent him messages of support at the start of his three-month doping ban as those who sent nothing. The top-ranked player is returning to tennis at the Italian Open this week after his settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency raised questions, since it conveniently allowed Sinner not to miss any Grand Slams and come back at his home tournament.  At the start of the suspension I received some surprising messages from some players, whereas there were others who I would have expected to hear from that didnt send anything, Sinner said. But Im not going to name names. The settlement was made after WADA appealed a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency to fully exonerate Sinner for what it deemed to be an accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid in March 2024. Many fellow pros feel Sinner was treated too lightly and Sinner recently discussed how he didnt really feel comfortable in the locker room and the players lounge during his run to a second straight Australian Open title in January, noting that players were looking at me differently. Coach Simone Vagnozzi said that he and Darren Cahill, Sinners other coach, also sensed the glares. When something like that happens I think its almost inevitable to have everyone looking at you. But there have also been some nice things said, Vagnozzi said, highlighting comments he appreciated from Holger Runes mom, Casper Ruud and Alexander Zverev. In the final month of his ban, Sinner practiced with Jack Draper, Lorenzo Sonego and Rune at his training base in Monaco. 
        
     At the start of his suspension, Sinner was banned from entering any sanctioned sports event. I wanted to support my friends in cycling or motorsport, Sinner said. I couldnt go there. That for me was the toughest part. In March, professional cyclist Giulio Ciccone posted a photo on Instagram of himself posing during a bike outing with Sinner and Ferrari endurance drivers Alberto Giovinazzi and Alessandro Pier Guidi. Cahill has announced he will retire at the end of the year and Vagnozzi was asked if he would consider then coaching Sinner on his own. I would be able to do it on my own, Vagnozzi said. But with players of this level its important to have another viewpoint. And its important to sometimes split up the weeks you spend with the player. Otherwise its a 365-day/year job and thats a bit much. But Im hoping that Darren stays on for another five years, because we have such a great relationship. He might be the best coach ever in terms of results and other factors. Vagnozzi referred to how Sinner is the fourth player the Australian has coached to No. 1 after Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep. But most of all, hes a special person. Sinner will play his opening match on Saturday against No. 99 Mariano Navone, who beat 18-year-old Italian wild card Federico Cin 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday. Sinner enters on a 21-match winning streak but hasnt played an official match since January. Also, the red clay at the Foro Italico is not Sinners best surface. Only one of his 19 career titles has come on the dirt, in Umag, Croatia, in 2022. Its definitely the surface where he is the least sure of himself, Vagnozzi said. But last year he had a good clay season, reached the semifinals in Monte Carlo and the French Open and the quarterfinals in Madrid.  So I think he can do well here, too. The last Italian man to win the Rome title was Adriano Panatta in 1976. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/jannik-sinner-doping-italian-open-1a3dd689c8675d61515c195e353d4f99,sports
Olympic rugby medalist Josaia Raisuqe of Fiji has died at 30,"CASTRES, France (AP)  Josaia Raisuqe, a Paris Olympics medalist, was killed in a road crash on Thursday, his Castres rugby club said. He was 30. Raisuqe was reportedly on his way to training when his vehicle was hit by a train. Castres Olympique is in mourning, the club said in a statement on its website. It is with heavy hearts that we learned of the death this morning of our player Josaia Raisuqe in a road accident. The entire CO family is devastated by this terrible news. Josh had been a member of the club since 2021. He was a wonderful teammate, much loved by everyone, including the Castres supporters who had embraced him. We extend our sincere condolences and thoughts to his family and loved ones. Raisuqe appeared on the wing for the Top 14 club less than two weeks ago. He was in the Fiji team which won the Olympic silver medal in rugby sevens in Paris last year. He scored a try against the United States in pool play and started in the final against France. Hes been playing club rugby in France since 2015, when he joined Top 14 champion Stade Francais. He also played for second-division side Nevers, and got into an infamous incident in 2021 when, overjoyed by a win, he hoisted the referee over his head after the fulltime whistle. The ref gave him a red card. The following season, Castres deployed Raisuqe as a flanker en route to the 2022 Top 14 final. 
        
     He was a radiant boy on and off the field, a pillar of the Fijian community we have at the club and to which we are very attached, Castres chairman Pierre-Yves Revol said. It is also difficult at this time not to mention the faith of all these (Fijian) players and of Josaia. My thoughts are with his fiance and his entire family. ___ AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby",https://apnews.com/article/josaia-raisuqe-fiji-rugby-death-6054e70242a4707e10e9b465dcc506f6,sports
Swiatek gets back on track in Rome after being routed by Gauff in Madrid,"ROME (AP)  Iga Swiatek bounced back from one of the worst losses of her career with a comfortable 6-1, 6-0 rout of home player Elisabetta Cocciaretto in the second round of the Italian Open on Thursday. Swiatek said she was dealing with personal stuff when she was beaten 6-1, 6-1 by Coco Gauff in the Madrid Open semifinals last week. The second-ranked Swiatek is a three-time Rome champion but has not reached a final on tour this year. She improved to 21-2 in Rome since 2021.

"Olympic medalists Snyder, Dake and Brooks sign with Real American Freestyle wrestling","Olympic medalists Kyle Snyder, Kyle Dake and Aaron Brooks headline the newest additions to the Real American Freestyle wrestling league. The announcement of the signings Thursday comes off the heels of the Tampa, Florida-based companys launch last week. The league, with pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan as the commissioner, will hold its first event Aug. 30 in Cleveland. Snyder earned gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and silver in Tokyo in 2021. Hes a three-time world champion who won three national titles at Ohio State. Dake is a four-time world champion and two-time Olympic bronze medalist. He was a four-time national champion at Cornell. Brooks, a four-time national champion at Penn State, earned bronze at the 2024 Paris Olympics. David Carr and Trent Hidlay also have signed. Carr was a two-time national champion at Iowa State. He was an under-20 world champion, and bronze medalist at the under-17 world championships. Hidlay was a two-time national runner-up at North Carolina State. David, Kyle, Aaron, Trent, and Kyle represent the best of the best, and thats who were targeting for Real American Freestyle, Hogan said in a statement. Our goal is to give these athletes an opportunity to continue their careers, create a platform for greatness, and inspire a legacy that lasts. Kennedy Blades, a silver medalist at the Paris Games, had already signed on the womens side. She believes the input of people such as Hogan will help it be sustainable. Her longtime coach, Israel Hernandez, is the leagues chief operating officer, and shes excited that hes teaming up with Hogan, chief media officer Eric Bischoff and co-founder Chad Bronstein. 
        
     I think the Real American Freestyle wrestling is going to be huge for the sport. I know coach Izzy, at the end of the day, wants to push wrestling to the highest level. The goal is to get people outside who dont know anything about wrestling to come watch and invest in the sport financially, being there at the events, stuff like that, she said. So Im really excited about it. Events will feature eight weight classes with eight matches for men and four for women. Wrestlers will have the opportunity to win a championship purse and bonuses  in adherence to NCAA regulations  for victories. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/hulk-hogan-real-american-wrestling-6d6bc5d1dff53e0b9c9e6af755898676,sports

The Braves lose their 17th in a row in Turners debut, as coach Vern Benson makes most of the strategic decisions. After the game, the National League removes Turner from the dugout, citing a rule that prevents an owner from doubling as manager. Dave Bristol, who was given a sabbatical to allow Turner to step into the dugout, will be brought back to finish the year at the helm of the team. 1980  39-year-old Pete Rose steals second base, third, and home in one inning for the Phillies. The last National League player to pull this feat had been Jackie Robinson in 1954. 1996  Al Leiter, the wildest pitcher in the American League the previous season, pitched the first no-hitter in Floridas brief history as the Marlins beat the Colorado Rockies 11-0. 1998  Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs set the major league record for strikeouts in consecutive games (33) by fanning 13 Arizona Diamondbacks in a 4-2 victory. The record for strikeouts in two starts had been 32, set by Luis Tiant in 1968 and matched by Nolan Ryan (1974), Dwight Gooden (1984) and Randy Johnson (1997). 2000  The Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 14-8 in the longest nine-inning game in National League history  4 hours, 22 minutes.

In a 17-10 win, Palmeiro hit a full-count fastball into the right field stands off Cleveland right-hander David Elder. 2009  In the tallest pitching matchup in baseball history, 6-foot-10 Randy Johnson beat 6-9 Daniel Cabrera.

Johnson struck out nine for his 298th career victory as San Francisco topped Washington 11-7. 2011  Tim Wakefield takes the mound for the Red Sox at age 44 years and 282 days.

He now shares the mark with Roger Clemens, Kerry Wood and Randy Johnson. Scherzer does not issue a single walk in the game. 2020  Major League Baseball owners agree on a tentative plan to resume the season that has been put on hold since spring training was shut down in early March by the coronavirus pandemic. Training would resume in June and an 82-game season would start around July 1-4, with games played in home ballparks, but without spectators. Teams would play games only against divisional opponents, or teams from the corresponding division in the other league, and the postseason would be expanded to 14 teams from the current 10. Rosters would be expanded to 30 players, with an additional 22-man taxi squad available as replacements in the absence of minor league games. Owners insist that the Players Association will need to accept that salaries will be based on total revenues for the plan to go ahead, something that is unlikely to be acceptable, however. This exact plan will be rejected, but the two sides will agree on a 60-game season starting in late July along the same general parameters. 2021  The Oakland Athletics receive permission from MLB to start exploring relocation options, as their most recent attempt to come to an agreement with local authorities on replacing the outdated Oakland Coliseum, has gone nowhere. 2022  Christian Yelich becomes the 5th player to hit for the cycle for the third time when he does so in a 14-11 Brewers loss to the Reds. His previous two cycles had also come against the Reds, within a three-week span in 2018. 2024  Paul Skenes, the first overall pick of the 2023 amateur draft and considered the best pitching prospect since Stephen Strasburg, makes his much-anticipated major league debut for the Pirates against the Cubs. He allows only one run through the first four innings, on a solo homer by Nico Hoerner in the 4th, and strikes out seven, but allows the first two batters in the 5th to reach base before giving way to reliever Kyle Nicolas, who allows both inherited runners to score. The Cubs, who were trailing 6 - 1 at one point, eventually tie the score but Pittsburgh comes out on top, 10 - 9, after a two-hour rain delay. _____ May 12 1910  Chief Bender of the Philadelphia Athletics pitched a 4-0 no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians. 1926  Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators records his 400th career win when he defeats the St. Louis Browns, 7-4. 1937  St. Louis Joe Medwick hit two home runs and two doubles to lead the Cardinals to a 15-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. 1955  Sam Toothpick Jones of the Cubs got a no-hitter the hard way. In the ninth inning against Pittsburgh, he walked the bases full and then struck out the next three batters for a 4-0 victory. 1956  Carl Erskine of the Brooklyn Dodgers pitched a 3-0 no-hitter against the New York Giants. 1958  Willie Mays hits the first grand slam in the history of the San Francisco Giants. 1966  Lou Brocks RBI single in the 12th inning gave the St. Louis Cardinals a 4-3 victory over Atlanta in the opening of Busch Memorial Stadium.

Burnett pitched an unlikely no-hitter  overcoming a record nine walks  to lead Florida over San Diego 3-0. 2004  In one of the most remarkable at-bats in major league history, Alex Cora fouls off 14 consecutive pitches and then hits the 18th pitch over the right field fence for a two-run home run off Cubs pitcher Matt Clement. 2008  Indians second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera turned the 14th unassisted triple play in major league history, accomplishing the feat in the second game of a doubleheader against Toronto. Cabrera made a diving catch on a line drive by Lyle Overbay, touched second base and then tagged out Marco Scutaro to quickly end the fifth inning of Clevelands 3-0 loss in 10 innings. 2009  Ryan Zimmerman extended his hitting streak to 30 games, getting a first-inning single in the Washington Nationals 9-7 loss to San Francisco. 2010  Homer Bailey became the latest Cincinnati Reds starter to pitch a gem against the Pittsburgh Pirates, tossing his first career complete game in a 5-0 win. The Reds became the first team in the majors in nearly 10 years to pitch back-to-back, complete-game shutouts without a walk  Oaklands Tim Hudson and Barry Zito did it on Sept. 9-10, 2000, against Tampa Bay. 2015  The Mariners tie a team record by hitting six homers in an 11-4 win over the Padres at Safeco Field. Nelson Cruz hits his major league-leading 15th home run, while Mike Zunino hits two, and Kyle Seager, Justin Ruggiano and Logan Morrison complete the barrage. 2017  Buster Posey homers in the 17th inning to send the Giants to a 3-2 win over the Reds, in a game that takes 5 hours and 28 minutes. _____",https://apnews.com/sports/daniel-cabrera-randy-johnson-boston-red-sox-st-louis-cardinals-bryce-harper-d31d8e185175afffc643c655444aae8b,sports

FCS teams would be allowed to play 12 regular-season games every year under recommendation,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  FCS teams would be allowed to play 12 regular-season games every year under a Division I Football Championship Subdivision Oversight Committee recommendation. The NCAA announced Tuesday the one-game extension would go into effect in 2026 if the Division I Council gives its approval during its June 24-25 meeting. Current legislation permits 12 regular-season games in years when there are 14 Saturdays from the first permissible playing date through the last playing date in November. In all other years, only 11 regular-season contests are permitted. The recommendation also would standardize the start date of the FCS season as the Thursday 13 weeks before the FCS championship bracket is released, which is the Saturday before Thanksgiving.

Punjab-Mumbai IPL game shifted to Ahmedabad because of India-Pakistan tensions,"MUMBAI, India (AP)  The Punjab Kings-Mumbai Indians game in the Indian Premier League scheduled for Sunday was shifted from Dharamsala to Ahmedabad because of India-Pakistan tensions. The IPL cited logistical challenges on Thursday. Airports in Dharamsala and Chandigarh  where Punjab Kings are based  have been closed for civilian and commercial purposes since Wednesday. Airports across Indias northwestern corridor have been similarly closed owing to the cross-border tensions between India and Pakistan. With the airports shut down, there was no way for Mumbai Indians to reach Chandigarh or Dharamsala. There was another logistical challenge awaiting the Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals squads, as well as broadcast crews, to travel from Dharamsala to their next respective venues. Punjab takes on Delhi in Dharamsala in a crucial game on Thursday. Both teams will take a 10-hour road journey to New Delhi after the game. The Capitals play Gujarat Titans at home next, and the Kings fly from Delhi to Ahmedabad for their next game against the Mumbai Indians. Punjab, Delhi and Mumbai are all in contention for the four knockout spots. Despite shifting Sundays game to Ahmedabad, there were other operational challenges as well: Narendra Modi Stadium was adorned with Gujarat Titans sponsor branding as its home ground.

Yankees rally past Padres 4-3 in 10 innings after breaking up Ceases no-hit bid in 7th,"NEW YORK (AP)  Pinch-hitter J.C. Escarra came through with a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning and the New York Yankees, held hitless into the seventh, rallied past the San Diego Padres 4-3 on Wednesday night. Cody Bellinger homered with one out in the seventh for New Yorks first hit off Padres starter Dylan Cease, who exited moments later with a cramp in his right forearm. Max Fried tossed seven splendid innings in a pitchers duel with Cease before San Diego scored twice against the Yankees bullpen to build a 3-1 lead in the eighth. Pinch-hitter Trent Grisham tied it with a two-run homer in the bottom half after Oswaldo Cabrera drew a leadoff walk from Jason Adam. It was Grishams 10th home run, eclipsing last years total. Cabrera led off the 10th with a sacrifice bunt that moved automatic runner Jasson Domnguez to third. Escarra, the backup catcher and former Uber driver, then came off the bench and lofted a long fly into the left-field corner against Jeremiah Estrada (1-2) that allowed Domnguez to score easily for New Yorks first walk-off win this season. In his second game since coming off the injured list, Jackson Merrill hit a solo homer in the fourth and a tiebreaking single in the eighth for the Padres. Xander Bogaerts added a sacrifice fly off Luke Weaver to make it 3-1. Even as San Diego was taking the lead, a huge roar went up in the Yankee Stadium crowd of 42,302 when the New York Knicks finished off their rally for a 91-90 victory in Boston that gave them a 2-0 lead over the Celtics in their NBA playoff series. 
        
     With the bases loaded and two outs in the 10th, embattled reliever Devin Williams (1-2) struck out Bogaerts with a full-count changeup. Williams screamed and pumped his fist before hopping off the mound. He ended up with his first win for the Yankees, who took two of three in the series. Fried was drafted seventh overall by the Padres in 2012 before they traded him to Atlanta. He is 6-0 with a 1.05 ERA for New York since signing a $218 million contract as a free agent in December, and the Yankees have won all eight of his starts. Padres: Following a day off, RHP Randy Vsquez (1-3, 3.90 ERA) starts Friday night in Colorado. Yankees: Rookie RHP Will Warren (1-2, 5.65 ERA) pitches Friday at the Athletics. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-padres-score-cease-fried-bellinger-grisham-0302f814d1d4dab584203ed3b9bfd75d,sports

White Sox place OF Andrew Benintendi on the 10-day injured list with a calf strain,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  The Chicago White Sox placed outfielder Andrew Benintendi on the 10-day injured list on Wednesday with a left calf strain. The 30-year-old Benintendi got hurt during Sundays win against Houston. He is batting .224 with five homers and 12 RBIs in 24 games this season. Benintendi missed much of spring training after he broke his right hand when he was hit by a pitch on Feb. 27. He made it back in time for opening day, but he was placed on the 10-day IL on April 9 with a left adductor strain. Benintendi signed a $75 million, five-year contract with Chicago before the 2023 season. The last-place White Sox also brought up infielder Nick Maton from Triple-A Charlotte before their game at Kansas City. Maton, 28, made Chicagos opening day roster and hit .173 (9 for 52) in 23 games before he was designated for assignment on April 26. He cleared waivers and was outrighted to Charlotte. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/white-sox-benintendi-3809f4bb928e8cb27b2459c747b9ebc7,sports
Robbie Ray pitches 6 effective innings as the Giants beat the Cubs 3-1,"CHICAGO (AP)  Robbie Ray pitched six sparkling innings, Wilmer Flores had three hits and the San Francisco Giants beat the Chicago Cubs 3-1 on Wednesday. Ray (5-0) allowed one run and three hits in his second straight win. Camilo Doval and Tyler Rogers each got three outs before Ryan Walker handled the ninth for his seventh save. San Francisco took two of three at Chicago to improve to 24-14. The Giants scored nine runs in the 11th inning in a wild 14-5 victory over the Cubs on Tuesday night. Nico Hoerner had two of Chicagos four hits. Ben Brown (3-3) struck out nine in five innings, but was charged with three runs and six hits. The Cubs scored their only run in the fourth. Pete Crow-Armstrong was credited with an RBI double when it looked as if left fielder Heliot Ramos lost his two-out flyball in the afternoon sun. Mike Yastrzemski walked and scored on Flores two-out single in the first, and the Giants added two more runs in the fourth. LaMonte Wade Jr. doubled in Matt Chapman, and Christian Koss singled in Flores. Carson Kelly hit a leadoff single in the ninth for the Cubs. But Justin Turner bounced into a double play before Hoerner grounded out. Three Giants logged multihit games. Wade and Willy Adames each went 2 for 4. The Giants continue their six-game trip on Friday night at Minnesota.

Dodgers place right-hander Evan Phillips on 15-day injured list with right forearm discomfort,"MIAMI (AP)  Injuries to Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers continued to pile Wednesday as right-hander Evan Phillips went on the 15-day injured list with right forearm discomfort. Phillips reported soreness the last few days when he pitched, but manager Dave Roberts said the move was mostly precautionary and wasnt too worried about the relievers long-term availability. He added he doesnt think Phillips will require an MRI. Could he have pitched today? Absolutely, Roberts said after the Dodgers 10-1 win over the Marlins. I just dont know  No one knows how he would respond going forward, so for us, it just made the most sense to IL him. Our expectation is on that 16th day, hell be back out there. Right-hander Matt Sauer was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City in a corresponding move and pitched four strong innings of relief Wednesday for his first career save. Phillips had just been activated from the injured list on April 19 after missing 21 games with a right rotator cuff strain. The reliever has made seven appearances this season with one save, striking out six and walking two while allowing no runs. I do feel like I can still contribute, but I think what it comes down to is you dont want to mess around with something, Phillips said, and youre in May, so we dont really have the luxury of giving me a couple days off here to figure it out. So we decided it was best to just be cautious with it. 
        
     Phillips injury adds to a series of health woes for the Dodgers pitching staff. Three Dodgers starters  Blake Snell (shoulder inflammation), Tyler Glasnow (shoulder inflammation) and Clayton Kershaw (recovery from toe and knee surgery)  are on the injured list. And two-way star Shohei Ohtani is still a few months away from returning to the mound as he continues his recovery from 2023 elbow surgery. Ahead of Wednesdays game at Miami, Roberts said Snell and Glasnow will start playing catch Friday. Kershaw looks to be near a return after tossing six no-hit innings in a rehab start on Tuesday. The 10-time All-Star is scheduled for another rehab start with Triple-A Oklahoma City on Sunday, which Roberts said could be his last before re-joining the Dodgers from the 60-day injured list. Hes eligible to be activated on May 18. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-injuries-evan-phillips-aff7ebe6e612ae53d83c0817c12300b1,sports
Cam Rising announces medical retirement from football because of lingering hand injury,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Utah quarterback Cam Rising is giving up football  at least for the foreseeable future  because of his struggle to recover from a hand injury early last season. I have been advised by two orthopedic surgeons that I will never be able to return to playing football, Rising wrote in a social media post on Wednesday in which he announced that he will be forced to medically retire from the game I love. Rising added that he will seek a third medical opinion and proceed with recommended surgery and rehab, but stopped short of indicating that he foresees a path to playing again. Rising played parts of four seasons at Utah between 2020 and 2024. He passed for 2,493 yards and 20 touchdowns in 2021 and followed that up with 3,034 and 26 TDs in a 2022 season that landed the Utes in the Rose Bowl. But a knee injury in the bowl game sidelined Rising for all of 2023. The Ventura, California, natives return in 2024 was shortened against Baylor in the Utes second game of the season, when he was pushed across the sideline as he released a throw and ran into a hydration table, appearing to jam his finger on a cooler.  Rising tried to come back a little more than a month later, but struggled in a loss to Arizona State in October in which he was intercepted three times. He did not play again after that. ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/utah-cam-rising-retires-523531d38c34cf4b26fa22985d78f93e,sports

It was the 25th multihomer game of Sotos career, tied with Mel Ott, Eddie Mathews and Alex Rodriguez for the second-most by a player before turning 27 years old  one behind Jimmie Foxx. Soto wont be 27 until Oct. 25. Senga (4-2) allowed two hits, struck out four and walked five  all in the first three innings  to lower his ERA to 1.16.  Arizonas Corbin Carroll hit his 11th homer of the season, a solo shot in the eighth. Kelly suffered his latest cramping bout in his last start, leaving after five innings against Philadelphia due to a hamstring cramp. The right-hander was right against the Mets  maybe it was all the pickles concerned fans have been sending him  until he left a pitch up in the zone to Soto in the sixth inning. The Mets slugger turned it into a towering homer to right-center.  Kelly gave up two more runs in the seventh, on Luisangel Acuas single and Jeff McNeills triple. Kelly allowed three runs and six hits with six strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings. 
        
     Lindor made a perfect relay throw to get Eugenio Surez at the plate on Alek Thomas double in the second inning. Mets first baseman Pete Alonso went 0 for 5, ending his streak of reaching base at 18 straight games. The Mets have a day off before RHP Clay Holmes (4-1, 2.95 ERA) pitches the opener of a three-game series against the Chicago Cubs on Friday.

Mariners rally from 5-run deficit to beat Athletics 6-5 and win 9th straight series,"WEST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Leody Taveras hit a game-tying two-out single in the eighth inning of his debut with Seattle before scoring the go-ahead run on Dylan Moores base hit and the Mariners rallied from a five-run deficit to beat the Athletics 6-5 on Wednesday and win their ninth straight series. Andrs Muoz gave up a leadoff single to Luis Uras in the ninth, before striking out Jacob Wilson looking to earn his 13th save. Muoz hasnt allowed an earned run in 18 innings. Taveras drove in pinch runner Miles Mastrobuoni with one out then stole second before scoring on Moores single off Noah Murdock (1-1). Wilson had two doubles and drove in a run in his first four-hit game to help the Athletics jump to a 5-0 fourth-inning lead off Mariners starter Bryan Woo. JJ Bleday had a two-run double, and Lawrence Butler added a solo homer. Seattle got a run back in the fifth when Moore singled, stole second and scored on Ben Williamsons double.  Gunnar Hoglund left leading 5-1 in his second career start after issuing a one-out walk to Cal Raleigh in the sixth. Mitch Spence entered and issued a walk before Rowdy Tellez hit his fifth homer to get the Mariners within 5-4. Hoglund was charged with two runs in 5 1/3 innings. Woo allowed a season-high five runs on eight hits in six innings. Eduard Bazardo (1-0) got four outs for the win. Taveras struck out twice and flied out before hitting a single to left on a 1-2 pitch to tie it. 
        
     Seattles J.P. Crawford went 1 for 5 to extend his hitting streak to a career-high 15 games.

Darvish set to face hitters and Cronenworth close to return for Padres,"NEW YORK (AP)  Already off to a strong start this season, the San Diego Padres are getting healthier, too. Baseballs top bullpen received a boost Wednesday when the Padres (23-13) reinstated Sean Reynolds from the 15-day injured list. Second baseman Jake Cronenworth is expected back Friday  and pitcher Yu Darvish is scheduled to face hitters Thursday for the first time in his recovery from right elbow inflammation. Its a substantial step, manager Mike Shildt said before the rubber match of a three-game series at Yankee Stadium. The welcome news comes after 22-year-old All-Star center fielder Jackson Merrill returned from the injured list Tuesday night and went 2 for 4 with a double in the cleanup spot against New York. Picked up right where he left off, Shildt said. Merrill followed that up Wednesday night with a homer and two RBIs, but the Yankees rallied for a 4-3 victory in 10 innings. He was hit on the left forearm by a 93 mph fastball from Devin Williams in the 10th, but remained in the game and said afterward he was fine.  Darvish threw a bullpen Tuesday at the clubs spring training complex in Arizona. The five-time All-Star has been sidelined all season, and its still too soon to project a timeline for his return. Tomorrows a good indicator, Shildt said. Itll get more crystal from there. Cronenworth, however, played the second of back-to-back rehab games Wednesday for Triple-A El Paso. He went 1 for 2 with a walk and scored twice against Round Rock after going 1 for 2 with a two-run homer and three walks Tuesday night. 
        
     Following a day off Thursday, the two-time All-Star is likely to come off the 10-day IL in time for Friday nights series opener at Colorado. Thats where were trending, Shildt said.  Cronenworth has been out since April 9 with a fractured right rib after getting hit by a pitch. He will probably wear a piece of equipment to protect his ribs when he returns, Shildt said. Reynolds is looking to make his 2025 debut after recovering from a stress reaction in his right foot. The rookie right-hander threw 5 1/3 hitless innings in four rehab outings for El Paso. The 6-foot-8 Reynolds reached the majors for the first time last season and was extremely effective in nine appearances, racking up 21 strikeouts and a 0.82 ERA in 11 innings. His four-seam fastball averaged 96.9 mph.  Hes ready to compete for us, Shildt said. San Diegos bullpen entered Wednesday with the lowest ERA (2.34), WHIP (1.01) and opponents batting average (.191) in the majors  even after Adrian Morejon and Wandy Peralta were tagged for a combined 10 earned runs and seven hits in the seventh inning of Tuesday nights 12-3 loss to the Yankees. To open a roster spot for Reynolds, the Padres optioned right-hander Ryan Bergert to Triple-A, where he will build his pitch count back up to resume his regular role as a starter. The 25-year-old Bergert went 1-0 over four scoreless relief appearances for San Diego in his first taste of the major leagues. I thought Bergert was outstanding. Its hard to break into the big leagues, Shildt said. Really pleased for him. Happy about how hes progressed, how he accepted that role. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/padres-darvish-cronenworth-e1d3cdd06bb9a469d2b0b189b4e14e44,sports
Freemans bases-loaded triple helps Dodgers beat Marlins 10-1,"MIAMI (AP)  Freddie Freeman singled twice and hit a bases-loaded triple and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Miami Marlins 10-1 on Wednesday.  Freeman drove in four runs and extended his hitting streak to 12 games as the MLB-leading Dodgers (25-12) took two of three at Miami and won their fourth straight series. Freeman went 8 for 13 in the series with six RBIs and two home runs. Shohei Ohtani tripled and drew three walks Wednesday, including an intentional pass during a six-run seventh against reliever Lake Bachar.  Pinch-hitter James Outman padded the Dodgers lead with a three-run homer in the ninth. Landon Knack (2-0) allowed four hits and no runs while striking out five after being called up earlier Wednesday from Triple-A Oklahoma City. Matt Sauer, who was also recalled, relieved Knack and pitched the final four innings for his first career save. Miami starter Valente Bellozo allowed just one hit and struck out seven over 5 1/3 scoreless innings. He was relieved by Cade Gibson one batter into the sixth before having to face Ohtani for a third time. Ohtani tripled off Gibson (0-1) the next at-bat. Rookie catcher Augustin Ramirez singled and doubled for the Marlins (14-22), who dropped to 2-9 in their last 11 games.  Jess Snchez singled in the sixth and drove in Miamis only run with a sacrifice fly ninth. The Dodgers blew the game open in the seventh against Bachar, who came in and gave up a walk, a single and run-scoring single. With first base open, Bachar intentionally walked Ohtani before walking Mookie Betts with the bases loaded.. Freemans bases-clearing triple came next, followed by another run-scoring single.  
        
     The Dodgers had only one hit through the first five innings against Bellozo before getting 11 hits off four Miami relievers. The Dodgers begin a four-game series at Arizona on Thursday with RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto (4-2, 0.90) on the mound. The Marlins are off Thursday before RHP Max Meyer (2-3, 3.92) starts the first of a three-game series at the Chicago White Sox on Friday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mlb-dodgers-marlins-score-ohtani-f75ed92884f55310b5c73f913d15a2a4,sports
NCAA settlement plan for roster limits gets do-over to save players who lost spots on teams,"Attorneys handling the $2.8 billion NCAA settlement proposed a massive do-over Wednesday when it comes to roster limits, offering athletes who lost their spots a chance to play without counting against the new caps for as long as they have eligibility.  Under court order to come up with an updated plan, the attorneys in court filings suggested that schools compile lists of all the players they cut in anticipation of the settlement being approved  a number that certainly could be in the hundreds and perhaps far more.  Those Designated Student-Athletes, as theyre called in the new legal filing, can be invited back to compete for roster spots  no guarantees  or go to new schools.  Either way, those athletes wont count against the new roster limits that are coming under the plan unveiled last fall and given initial approval by U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in October. The proposal would also give the exemption to high school recruits who were promised spots that were later rescinded; the exemptions would last for as long as those players are eligible in college. Wilken has already signed off on the key components of the settlement, which includes allowing each school to share up to $20.5 million each year directly with their athletes and the nearly $2.8 billion in back pay that will go to players who said the NCAA and five biggest conferences wrongly kept them from earning name, image and likeness money. The latest proposal capped a two-week scramble after Wilken sent attorneys for both sides back to the negotiating table, saying the roster limit details of the plan as written were unacceptable.  
        
     The plan calls for replacing scholarship limits (85 for football and 9.9 for mens wrestling, for example) with roster limits (105 for football, 30 for wrestling). A school can offer scholarships to every player on a team, but that will cost money and most predict that walk-ons or partial scholarship athletes will be left out.  Wilken clearly sympathized with the hundreds of players who lost roster spots as schools began preparing to implement terms of the settlement. About a dozen told their stories during an April 7 hearing. Wilken asked lawyers to rework that part of the deal. The NCAAs first response to Wilkens request  which included the idea of grandfathering in current players to their roster spots  was to change nothing, arguing that undoing roster moves already in play would create more turmoil in an already chaotic process. Wilken told them to do it anyway or put the whole plan at risk. The plaintiffs attorneys said they did Wilken one better, not only giving schools a chance to bring back players they cut without it counting against their limit, but putting the exemption in play for a new school, as well. Plaintiffs believe that these changes to the settlement agreement exceed the protections that the court requested, their court filing read. The attorneys noted there is no guarantee that the athletes will win their roster spots back.  While defendants insisted that the changes to the settlement agreement recognize that individual schools and their athletics departments retain discretion to independently determine which athletes will be on their rosters, that has always been the case; and it remains unchanged whether or not there are roster limits, they wrote.  The judge is expected to give opponents to the plan a brief window to file updated objections before her final decision. As Steve Berman, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, predicted earlier this week, some of those objecting to the plan were not satisfied with the new proposal. While the NCAA and Class Counsel have acknowledged our objection to roster caps is valid, their proposed mushy modification doesnt go far enough, said attorney Steven Molo, who represents a group of objectors. Many, many student athletes have had something taken away from them. The fight will continue. The clock is ticking for the NCAA and its 1,200 member schools that have more than 500,000 athletes on various teams. Terms of the settlement were supposed to go into effect July 1 and football practice starts soon after.  ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",https://apnews.com/article/ncaa-lawsuit-roster-limits-d829dee23830e6ccc034381d02fef576,sports
Rockies designated hitter Kris Bryant slated for a procedure on his back Thursday in Los Angeles,"DENVER (AP)  Colorado Rockies designated hitter Kris Bryant is scheduled to undergo a procedure on his balky back Thursday in Los Angeles.  Bryants currently on the injured list with lumbar degenerative disk disease, which involves the deterioration of the spinal disks that act as cushions between the vertebrae. Its his ninth stint on the IL since 2022 due to a series of health issues.  The upcoming procedure for Bryant is referred to as an ablation, which is designed to interrupt pain signals being sent from the back to the brain. From what the doctors feel, it should help alleviate some discomfort, Rockies manager Bud Black explained before opening a three-game series against the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night. He should be back in a day or two resuming activities. The 33-year-old Bryant is hitting .154 this season with no homers, one RBI, 13 strikeouts. Bryant has been limited to 170 games with Colorado since signing a $182 million, seven-year contract before the 2022 season. His injuries have included plantar fasciitis, a bone bruise in his foot, heel issues, a broken finger, a back strain, a lower rib contusion and back problems.  Hes hit .244 with 17 homers and 61 RBIs with the Rockies. Bryant was the 2016 NL MVP as he helped the Chicago Cubs end a 108-year World Series drought.  ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/kris-bryant-rockies-96ecb77f47b05d0ab18d845d15db469a,sports
Blue Jays RHP Max Scherzer throws to hitters for the 1st time since going on injured list,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Max Scherzer took what the Toronto Blue Jays hope is a significant step in his return from a right thumb injury on Wednesday when he threw to hitters for the first time since going on the injured list in March. I thought his stuff was really good, Blue Jays manager John Schneider said before Wednesday nights game against the Los Angeles Angels. Afterward, he said he felt good, so thats a really good step in the right direction. Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner who signed a one-year, $15.5 million deal with Toronto in February, threw 20 pitches. Barring a setback, Schneider said he will repeat the workout but with more pitches over the weekend. It felt good, Scherzer, 40, said. Ive gotten all the inflammation out, so I can finally grip the ball again and not blow out my shoulder. But Im not celebrating this until Im back starting in a major league game. Scherzer has taken two cortisone injections to relieve inflammation in the thumb this season. He was transferred to the 60-day injured list earlier this week and is not eligible to be activated until May 29. He went 2-4 with a 3.95 ERA in nine starts for Texas last season, starting the year on the injured list while recovering from lower back surgery. He said Tuesday that his problematic right thumb, which also impacted his 2022 and 2023 seasons, was just as big of an issue in 2024.  
        
     This is what knocked me out in 2023, and (I had it) all of last year, Scherzer said. It wasnt so much the back injury, it was this thumb injury giving me all the fits in the world. I thought I addressed it. I thought I had done all the grip-strength work, but I came into spring training, and it popped back out. Scherzer left his debut start with the Blue Jays against Baltimore on March 29 after three innings because of soreness in his right lat muscle. He said after the game that his thumb issue was to blame for that soreness. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/max-scherzer-blue-jays-thumb-7ebe24d670eeeb5e3a11f5ce2448fdd4,sports
Reds right-hander Hunter Greene leaves game against Braves after only 3 innings with groin injury,"ATLANTA (AP)  Cincinnati right-hander Hunter Greene has been scheduled for tests on Thursday to determine the severity of a right groin injury that forced him to leave Wednesday nights 4-3 win over the Atlanta Braves after only three innings. Greene struck out six batters and allowed only two hits before he was unable to complete his warmup on the mound in the fourth inning. Greene threw only two warmup pitches, including a last pitch that hit the dirt, before stopping his routine. I felt fantastic tonight, Greene said. It sucks because the momentum was great and all my stuff felt good. In the top of the fourth, my first two warmup pitches I felt my groin grab so I just didnt feel like I would be at my best or really honestly keep my team in it continuing to throw if I stayed in. So that was the decision. Greene said he hopes he doesnt have to miss a start but said this is his first groin injury and he couldnt predict what Thursdays tests will show. Im looking forward to going back out this week or so, however long it takes to get back out on the mound, Greene said. Im going to put my best foot forward, making sure I put myself in the best position to get back out there. Hopefully I dont miss any starts but I dont know what the future holds on this. Greene immediately attracted a crowd on the mound that included the Reds infielders, a trainer and manager Terry Francona. Following a brief meeting, Greene was escorted off the field with the Reds leading 4-0. 
        
     Greene was coming off a season-high 12 strikeouts, the second-highest total of his big league career, in a 6-1 win over Washington on Friday night. He threw 114 pitches in the game, the most for any pitcher in the major leagues this season. Greene said he didnt believe the high pitch count in his last start contributed to the injury. I dont think so, he said. I felt fantastic all the way up to that last pitch. The recovery was great this past week going into tonight. Id be really surprised if that had any correlation to tonight. I dont think it did. Francona noted Greene said he felt a grab, not a pop, in the groin. I dont think anything happening to him is a good thing, but I dont think its bad, Francona said.  Greene was sharp again against the Braves. The 25-year-old right-hander struck out the side in the second. Alex Verdugo whiffed on Greenes 101-mph fastball in the third inning to give the right-hander six strikeouts. Left-hander Brent Suter replaced Greene on the mound. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/reds-braves-greene-831f45bfe9a8b7934363dc2b5cc2531c,sports
Jets and Stars meet in second round of NHL playoffs after both had epic Game 7 rallies to advance,"There was that natural inclination for Dallas Stars coach Pete DeBoer to start paying more attention to St. Louis while watching the game that would determine who his team would play next in the NHL playoffs. But he never really started preparing for the Blues, even as they had a multigoal lead over Winnipeg much of that game.  That would have been a mistake, DeBoer said Tuesday. Just like, you know, whoever was watching our game with Colorado. Dallas will instead play the top-seeded Jets after both teams had epic Game 7 rallies at home by overcoming two-goal deficits the third period. Now the teams that finished 1-2 in the Central Division, and have never met in the postseason before, open the second round Wednesday night in Canada.  Winnipeg scored twice in the final 1:56 of regulation against St Louis, tying the game with 1.6 seconds left and winning 4-3 when Adam Lowry scored 16:10 into the second overtime late Sunday night. I think we can ride the momentum from the last series win, but at the same time, reset and get ready for a new challenge with Dallas, Jets defenseman Dylan Samberg said.  The Stars trailed Colorado 2-0 in the third period, but rode Mikko Rantanens four-point period that included a hat trick against his former team to win 4-2. He had 11 points (five goals, six assists) in the last three games of that series.  When your life flashes before your eyes like it did the last 10 minutes of that Game 7 the other night, when you get that close to your season ending, I think you appreciate every day you can come to work, DeBoer said. Those are always emotional wins, and we both had them. Its how do you recover from that quickly and get reengaged in the next series. Im sure both teams are talking about that. Two-time Vezina Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck, one of three finalists to win the top goalie award again this season, has been at his best against the Stars.  Winnipeg was 3-1 this season against Dallas, while Hellebuyck had a .965 save percentage, stopping 109 of 113 shots for a 1.01 goals against average. His Game 7 win came after the Jets failed to get past the first round the last two seasons after not even making the playoffs in 2022. He gave up 16 goals in three road games against the Blues, but only 10 in four at home.  At this point, the pressure has kind of fallen off. The weight of the world is off my shoulders. And that had nothing to do with anyone else. Its just the mental grind of that series, Hellebuyck said Tuesday. That being said, in that moment it was a second chance for me. I just had to go and play my game and do what I do best. Hellebuyck is 22-30 in his 52 career playoff games, with a .902 save percentage and 2.98 GAA.  Jake Oettinger, the 26-year-old Stars goalie who backed up Hellebuyck for Team USA in the 4 Nations tournament this year, has a better playoff record at 27-25. He has a .915 save percentage and 2.52 GAA in 54 playoff games.  You always want to play against the best goalies in the world, Oettinger said. This is going to be a great series. Goals arent going to be easy to come by for us. The Stars have lost eight consecutive series openers in the NHL playoffs since 2022, including all seven under DeBoer after a 5-1 loss in Game 1 to the Avs. Well, were going on the road, DeBoer said when asked if there was anything he could do to try to change that trend. Other than that, not really. Theres only so much you can do. I like our preparation. The way we prepare for a Game 7 is the same way we prepare for a Game 1. Six of Dallas seven Game 1s under DeBoer have been at home. So have all three Game 7s, like Saturday against the Avs that made DeBoer 9-0  the most wins by any NHL coach or player in such games.  Top centers and top defensemen are hurting for both teams.  Winnipegs center Mark Schiefele didnt play the last two games of the first round after exiting early in Game 5 with an undisclosed injury. Defenseman Josh Morrissey then got hurt two minutes into Game 7.  Jets coach Scott Arniel said Tuesday that both would be game-time decisions. Dallas has been without top goal scorer Jason Robertson, who got hurt in the regular-season finale, and defenseman Miro Heiskanen since late January. Both have lower-body injuries.  Robertson skated with a line in practice Tuesday, and DeBoer said his availability would depend on how he feels Wednesday. Heiskanen could return later in the series.  Rick Bowness was on an NHL bench as a head coach or an assistant for a record 2,726 regular-season games over 38 seasons. The last two teams he coached were the Stars (2019-22) and the Jets (2022-24), making him the predecessor to DeBoer and Arniel.  Bowness, now 70, was 89-62-25 in Dallas and took the Stars to the Stanley Cup Final in the Canadian bubble during the pandemic-impacted 2020 playoffs. He was 98-57-9 and made the playoffs each of the past two seasons in Winnipeg before retiring.  ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-playoffs-stars-jets-a68e312cad3878aa81edb6c8813ecf29,sports
Witt and Wacha lead Royals to 2-1 victory over White Sox,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  Bobby Witt Jr. hit a two-run homer to give Michael Wacha all the support he needed as the Kansas City Royals defeated the Chicago White Sox 2-1 on Wednesday night.  It was the third straight quality start for Wacha (2-4), who allowed just three hits in seven innings, walked one and struck out five. The Royals, who won for the 14th time in their last 16 games, lead the majors with 18 quality starts. The White Sox got a run in the ninth off Carlos Estvez on a single by Luis Robert, but left the tying run stranded at third. Estvez allowed one run and three hits, but struck out two, including Josh Rojas for the final out to earn his 11th save. Jonathan Cannon (2-4) took the loss, allowing two runs and nine hits in six innings. The White Sox have lost nine straight against Kansas City and 10 in a row at Kauffman Stadium. Both are franchise records against the Royals and in Kansas City. Both starting pitchers were effective early on a damp, cool night. With a mist falling and game-time temperatures in the low 60s, Wacha and Cannon each threw four scoreless innings. But while Wacha threw up another zero in the top of the fifth, Cannon ran into trouble in the bottom of the inning. Luke Maile led off with a single and, with two outs, Witt hit his fifth homer of the season to left field. The White Sox had runners on first and second with two outs in the second inning, but Wacha got Lenyn Sosa to line out to right. That was Chicagos only inning with two runners on base against Wacha. 
        
     The Royals have scored four runs or fewer in 32 of 38 games this season. Theyre 16-16 in those games. The White Sox and Royals will conclude their four-game series with an afternoon game Thursday.

"Snchez allows 1 hit, Turner, Stott and Harper combine for 6 RBIs in Phillies 7-0 win over Rays","TAMPA, Fla. (AP)  Cristopher Snchez allowed one hit over six innings, Trea Turner, Bryson Stott and Bryce Harper each drove in two runs, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-0 on Wednesday night. Snchez (4-1) allowed a single by Junior Caminero in the first and walked Danny Jansen but didnt allow a player past first base the rest of the night, finishing with three walks and five strikeouts. He lowered his ERA from 3.45 to 2.89. Turner hit a line-drive solo homer to left-center in the third off Shane Baz (3-2). The Tampa Bay starter then unraveled in the fourth, when Johan Rojas dropped a squeeze bunt to score J.T. Realmuto from third. Philadelphia followed with three straight hits in a five-run inning, and Harpers two-run double chased Baz. Realmuto was the only Philadelphia starter without a hit. He left the game in the seventh with a left foot contusion after fouling a pitch off his shoe. Kyle Schwarber singled in the first to reach safely in a 42nd consecutive game, the longest active streak in the majors. Philadelphia is 8-2 since an April 25 loss. Snchez fanned Curtis Mead on a 1-2 sinker in the fourth. Tampa Bay originally signed Snchez at age 16 in 2013, then traded him to Philadelphia after the 2019 season for Mead. Facing Snchez for the first time since the trade, Mead was 0 for 2 against him Wednesday. In three starts against his former team, Snchez is now 1-0 with a 0.50 ERA. Taijuan Walker earned his first career save, retiring nine of 10 batters faced with seven strikeouts over the final three innings.

Haliburtons 3 with 1.1 seconds left gives Pacers 120-119 stunning win over Cavs and 2-0 series lead,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Tyrese Haliburton said he knows hes trusted to deliver in big moments. In three straight playoff games, the Indiana Pacers guard has delivered when it has mattered most. Haliburton made a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds remaining as the Pacers scored the final eight points in 47.9 seconds to stun the short-handed and top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers 120-119 on Tuesday night to take a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinals series. Haliburton scored 11 of his 19 points in the final 12 minutes. After Andrew Nembhard stole an inbounds pass by Clevelands Max Strus with 27.5 seconds remaining, Indiana tried to find a potential tying 3-pointer before Haliburton drove inside and got fouled. He made the first free throw, but missed the second. Haliburton got the offensive rebound and dribbled out to the 3-point line, where he made it from the top of the key. I was (ticked) I missed the layup because I couldnt hang onto the ball, so I backed it out. I just saw Ty Jerome, top of the key and knocked it down, Haliburton said. Its the NBA, crazier things have happened. Thats just what basketball is. We dont give up and were battle tested. We just find a way. After making a layup with 1.3 seconds remaining in overtime to help the Pacers eliminate the Milwaukee Bucks, Haliburton has continued to hit key shots against the Cavaliers. He scored 22 points in Sundays 121-112 victory in the series opener, including a go-ahead 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter. 
        
     Obviously, we got lucky. Ty hit another amazing shot to win the game, Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. You dont see this very often, let alone twice in one week. Tyrese, he came through again. Were very fortunate. Myles Turner and Aaron Nesmith led No. 4 seed Indiana with 23 points apiece. Its the first time the Pacers have won the first two games of a playoff series on the road since a 1994 first-round set against Orlando. Game 3 is Friday night in Indianapolis. Donovan Mitchell scored 48 points for Cleveland, who were missing three key players, including two starters. NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley (left ankle) and key reserve DeAndre Hunter (right thumb) were injured in Game 1, while Darius Garland (left big toe) missed his fourth straight postseason game.  I feel like we outplayed them for the majority of the game and then towards the end we had our mental lapses. They capitalized on every single mistake that we made, said Jarrett Allen, who had 22 points and 12 rebounds. Mitchell scored 15 points in the third quarter as the Cavaliers built a 98-81 lead late in the period. But the Pacers rallied with a 17-6 run to get back in it. Cleveland looked as though it got some breathing room with 1:06 remaining when Max Strus hit a 3-pointer off an assist by Mitchell to put them up 117-110. But the Cavs couldnt hold on again as they committed two turnovers and the Pacers had a pair of offensive rebounds that led to points in the final minute. Its the first time Cleveland dropped its first two at home in the playoffs since 1996 in the first round against the Knicks. Its hard to put all this in words, Carlisle said. Cleveland hit us with a hellacious punch early in the game. In the fourth, we just hung on. We maintained enough energy to get it done. Give the guys credit, they somehow found a way. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-pacers-cavaliers-haliburton-3ab13caac21987ef156ea8c2e8cb9dab,sports
"Curry leaves Warriors win vs. Wolves with hamstring strain, putting rest of series in question","MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Golden State star Stephen Curry was sidelined by a strained left hamstring early in the second quarter at Minnesota, and the Warriors were bracing for an extended absence of their sharpshooting leader after opening the series by beating the Timberwolves 99-88 on Tuesday. Curry will have an MRI on Wednesday. His status is day to day, but coach Steve Kerr acknowledged its unlikely hell be available to play in Game 2 on Thursday. Hes obviously crushed, but the guys picked him up and played a great game, Kerr said. Obviously were all concerned about Steph, but thats part of the game. Guys get hurt, and you move on. Our guys did a great job of moving on and getting a great win 48 hours after a Game 7 road win. Its an amazing group of guys. They compete. Theyre together. Curry started grabbing at the back of his left leg early in the second quarter shortly after hitting a 26-foot step-back 3-pointer. He powered through some discomfort for a bit, and after getting a 14-foot floater to fall for a 27-20 lead he started motioning to the bench that he needed to come out. Once a timeout by the Timberwolves finally stopped the clock, Curry jogged gingerly to the locker room with 13 points in 13 minutes on 5-for-9 shooting.  A little deflating, but we knew he did a great job of helping us build a comfortable lead, teammate Draymond Green said.  
        
     The 37-year-old Curry helped Golden State beat Houston in Game 7 of their first-round series two nights earlier. Going the distance after taking a 3-1 lead in that series cost Curry and the Warriors some valuable rest time, and theres only one day off between games for the first five games. There are three off days between Game 5 on May 14 and Game 6 on May 18.  After a five-year period during which he had a hard time staying healthy, with a variety of injuries to both hands and feet, Curry played in 70 games this season after logging 74 games last season. The four-time NBA champion and 11-time All-Star averaged 24 points per game against the Rockets for the sixth-seeded Warriors.  The spirits were high for the Warriors in the aftermath of their all-hands-on-deck dismantling of the Wolves, despite the ominous departure of their most important player. We have the best coaching staff in the NBA. We know theyll put us in a good spot, said Jimmy Butler, who finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. We all want 30 back. Until then, we can all hold down the fort. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-timberwolves-curry-ea429388284d38dc4726c7a504a6a898,sports
Warriors take Game 1 from cold-shooting Wolves 99-88 despite Currys departure with hamstring strain,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Stephen Curry was already in the locker room with a bag of ice against his leg when his Golden State teammates arrived for halftime with a comfortable lead. The Warriors sure made the best of a bad situation. Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and Jimmy Butler gave the Warriors a vintage all-around performance in an inspired 99-88 victory over the stumbling Timberwolves that opened the second-round series on Tuesday night. It was beautiful to see, Green said. Everybody who came into the game gave us something.  Hield picked up where he left off in the Game 7 win at Houston that finished the first round by scoring 24 points on 5-for-8 shooting from 3-point range. Butler had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and Green had four first-half 3s on his way to 18 points, as the Warriors used 12 players, plenty of hustle and lockdown defense to overcome the concerning departure of the franchise cornerstone Curry. Its about the intensity and the heart and the fight, and if you do that, you give yourself a chance, coach Steve Kerr said. The home teams have yet to win in the second round of these NBA playoffs. Minnesota has another chance to get one in Game 2 on Thursday. The big question: Will Curry will be available? The leagues career-leading 3-point shooter and four-time NBA champion exited early in the second quarter after hitting a 14-footer and grabbing the back of his left leg. The Warriors ruled him out for the remainder of the game soon after that. 
        
     Kerr frequently sent a zone defense at a Wolves team that went 7 for 47 from 3-point range in a convincing win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Game 5 clincher in the first round, and the bricks piled up even higher after nearly a week off. People are going to try to blame whatever, blame whoever, said star Anthony Edwards, who had one point in the first half. They can blame me. I just didnt play good enough.  The Wolves missed their first 16 shots from 3-point range until they were down by 20 and Naz Reid drained one from the wing with 8:32 left in the third quarter. Edwards had 23 points and 14 rebounds after the rough start, finishing 9 for 22 from the floor. Reid had 19 points and Julius Randle added 16 points for the Wolves, who finished 5 for 29 from behind the arc and trailed by 23 points late in the third. We had opportunities to run out. Our transition decision making was diabolical, coach Chris Finch said. Obviously we couldnt hit a shot, but I didnt like the fact that we couldnt repeatedly generate good shots. We shouldve been able to. Butler, Green and the Warriors had a big hand in that. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-timberwolves-score-bb7b767b70afb93617db7d4894a4800e,sports
Mitchell and shorthanded Cavaliers dont have enough at the end and go down 2-0 in series to Pacers,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Donovan Mitchell did everything he physically could to try to get the Cleveland Cavaliers back on equal footing in their Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Indiana Pacers. It wasnt enough, though.  Now, the Cavaliers face their most daunting task of the season  down two games, having to go on the road and being shorthanded. Weve got to go get two in Indy. Simple as that, Mitchell said after scoring 48 points in Clevelands 120-119 loss to Indiana on Tuesday night. The top-seeded Cavaliers entered the game without three key players, including two starters. NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley (left ankle) was injured in Game 1, while Darius Garland (left big toe) missed his fourth straight postseason game. DeAndre Hunter (right thumb) was also injured Sunday night. TNT reported during the game that Mitchell was also hampered by a calf strain, but that was not listed on the NBAs injury report. He also started cramping late in the game as Indiana rallied from a 119-112 deficit with eight straight points in the final 47.9 seconds. Im banged up, we all are. Its tough, but thats what the playoffs are, said Mitchell, who had the second-most points in a playoff game at Clevelands Rocket Arena. Mitchell played 36 minutes, went 15 of 30 from the field and tied a playoff career high with 17 made free throws. He also had nine assists that resulted in 24 Cleveland points. Six of the assists came on 3-pointers, including one to Max Strus to give the Cavs a 117-110 advantage with 1:06 remaining. 
        
     Cleveland did not have enough at the end.  Mitchell committed an offensive foul with 45.9 seconds remaining, leading to Pascal Siakams layup to bring them within 119-116. Mitchell then couldnt get a rebound after Tyrese Haliburton missed a free throw with the Cavs leading by two. Haliburton got the loose ball and hit a step-back 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to give the Pacers the victory. I should have grabbed the ball. I was right there. Thats on me, Mitchell said. On the charge call, I tried to be strong with the ball. I knew they were going to trap. I understood it was coming, but the elbow was too high. Cleveland led most of the game despite going with a shorter rotation of nine players. Defensively, they did a better job of dealing with Indianas quick pace until the end. I thought we outplayed them, thats the shame of this game, coach Kenny Atkinson said. We had some poor decision-making plays at the rim, turnovers. A couple bad decisions, I felt like. So that was part of the collapse. The Cavaliers are hoping to possibly get Mobley, Garland or Hunter back for Game 3 in Indiana on Friday night. If not, Mitchell has faith his shorthanded group can find a way to make it a series. Cleveland has rallied from a 2-0 series deficit three times previously  the 2007 Eastern Conference finals against Detroit, the 2016 NBA Finals against Golden State and 2018 Eastern Conference finals against Boston. Weve shown how deep we are as a team, how great we are as a unit. Its tough losing like that, but we got to find a way, Mitchell said. We can sit here and dwell on this and be home in about four or five days, or we can move on and take some things that we did really well and go from there.  Weve got to go out there and take care of business. Otherwise, thats it. Jarrett Allen  who had 22 points and 12 rebounds  said Mitchells performance made him realize he has to try harder as well. You cant let one guy, especially your leader, go into something alone like that and give it his all, Allen said. It pushes everybody on the bench to try their hardest and try to replicate that. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-cavaliers-pacers-f7f0f008ad0680a8ca055ab399a54deb,sports

No team orders: McLaren plans to let em race as Piastri and Norris battle for F1 championship,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Just five races into the Formula 1 season and theres already a compelling championship battle with inner organization implications. Oscar Piastri has aggressively shown he wont sit behind teammate Lando Norris, allowing Norris to become the anointed No. 1 driver at McLaren Racing. The Aussie did it by winning three of the first five races this season to take hold of the lead in the driver standings. Norris, at one time McLarens designated champion-in-waiting, sits 10 points back from Piastri with one victory on the season. And as F1 shifts to the United States for the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, McLaren boss Zak Brown insisted there will be no internal issues with this championship fight and, for now, hell let it play out naturally. Let em race, Brown vowed to The Associated Press. He will not designate a No. 1 and issue any team orders until a time comes in which one of the drivers has clearly separated himself in the title race. Well only make that decision if it becomes clear, like it did last year at a certain point, Brown said. Until then they will get the same treatment. There may be instances when one has an upgrade that the other doesnt have yet, but thats the extent of it right now. We want to let them race. Norris earned his first career victory at Miami last year when he snapped Max Verstappens two-race winning streak at the event staged around Hard Rock Stadium. Norris, hyped as McLarens great hope, had picked up the derogatory moniker Lando No Wins when he arrived in Miami, where he promptly shed the label and had a rowdy South Beach victory celebration. 
        
     I kind of envy Lando for getting his first race win here, because Im sure Sunday night was definitely a cool one, said rival Pierre Gasly. Its one of those races you want the Sunday to go well so you get a good reason to party on Sunday night. How was Norris party?  I dont remember, he said with a sheepish grin.  Norris was then asked if hes concerned that Piastri has seized momentum by winning three races since Norris lone victory. Not worried at all. Hes doing a good job and he deserves it. Nothing more than that, Norris said. I dont believe so much in the momentum stuff. Im doing what I can. Ive clearly made some mistakes and not at the level I need to be, but I believe I can be at that level soon enough. Its round six of 24. Im not going to say that forever, but I know I need to get a move on and get into gear a little bit, Norris continued. The speed is there, the pace is there, the race pace is definitely there. Its just one thing I need to tidy up. Its a difficult thing, but Im confident Ill get it. Lewis Hamiltons move to Ferrari this season has been slow going for the seven-time champion and hes admitted the struggles shown so far could continue the entire year. Hamilton is in his first year with Ferrari after 12 seasons at Mercedes. He won the sprint race in Shanghai with Ferrari but has yet to log a top-four finish in any Grand Prix. Hamilton trails teammate Charles Leclerc by 16 points in the driver standings. He likened his current transitioning to when he first joined Mercedes. The first six months were tough getting attuned to working with new people. Obviously, the engineers Im working with now are used to setting up a car for a different driver and a different driving style, and Im used to driving a car with a different driving style, Hamilton said. So its a combination of a bunch of different things. Im definitely working hard to adjust to this one for sure. Hes also trying to adjust to spending more time in Italy, a country where hes struggling to learn the language but gorging on the food. Trying to stay off the pizzas and the pasta, which Im not doing very well with, Hamilton said. I had like three pizzas in two days. I have my hookup  he keeps bringing me a pizza. Not living in Italy currently, but spending more time is still something I really want to try and figure out how to do through the year, he continued. My Italian is not really progressing, so Ive probably got to throw myself more into the thick of it. But the teams been well. Lots of changes, a huge amount of work has been going on from my first days there. F1 president Stefano Domenicali said he had no update to give on the series ongoing efforts to find a television partner in the United States. ESPN is in the final year of its current contract with F1 but informed the series it would not be renewing for 2026. ESPN reportedly pays Formula One Management an estimated $75 million to $90 million annually for the rights to air F1 content in the U.S. Domenicali has been touting the importance of F1s positioning in North America, and the series has dramatically grown the last five years. F1 now races three times a year in the U.S.  and announced a 10-year extension with Miami on Friday that takes the race through 2041  and five times total in North America. F1 next season will also have both Ford and General Motors in the series  Ford as a support partner with Red Bull and Cadillac as a factory-backed 11th team. There are discussions in place and there are several partners that are interested to talk, Domenicali said Friday. The good news is that there is a lot of interest and we need to make sure we are credible in the landscape where we know very well there are major league sports that are very, very important for this market. We need to find the right place with the right content to offer the supportive fans in the U.S. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-mclaren-hamilton-verstappen-ab372bbce36310559304569b9b5492a5,sports
Antonelli becomes youngest pole winner in F1 history by taking top stop for Miami sprint race,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Kimi Antonelli became the youngest pole-winner of any Formula 1 event in history when the 18-year-old Mercedes driver won the top starting spot Friday for the sprint race ahead of the Miami Grand Prix.  Antonelli is in his first season in F1, where Mercedes hired him to replace seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton. Mercedes has great faith the Italian can deliver, and he did in qualifying for the second sprint race of the season. I am feeling over the moon, I did not expect this, Antonelli said. He will start Saturdays sprint race alongside current F1 points leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who lost the pole by .045 seconds to Antonelli. Its the first time since 2009 an Italian driver has won any pole in F1. It was a very intense qualifying, Antonelli said. I felt very since this morning and I felt very confident going into qualifying. Really happy to get the first pole. Its going to be nice to start on the front row and see how we can do in the sprint.  Lando Norris, second in the standings, qualified third for McLaren and was followed by Max Verstappen, who arrived in Miami in time for Friday practice after skipping Thursday activities as he welcomed his first child with partner Kelly Piquet. George Russell, the lead driver at Mercedes, qualified fifth and was followed by Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Hamilton. Alex Albon of Williams was eighth and followed by Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls and Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/fi-miami-sprint-qualifying-antonelli-1a363ecbda3c4b282253004bd21ad7d0,sports
Tire Water: McLaren boss calls for rule designed to curb bogus allegations made by rival teams,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla, (AP)  McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown wants the FIA to adopt a rule that prohibits teams from making baseless allegations against their rivals. Brown floated the idea after using a water bottle on pit lane that had multiple large  TIRE WATER labels affixed on the bottle. It was Browns way of trolling Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner, who allegedly complained to Formula 1s governing body that McLaren was using water to manage its tire temperature. (The water bottle) was poking fun at a serious issue, which is teams have historically made allegations of other teams. Most recently, one team focuses on that strategy more than others, Brown said Saturday at the Miami Grand Prix. Theres a proper way to protest a team at the end of the race, and you have to make it formal, disclose where it comes from, put some money down, he continued. I think that process should be extended to all allegations to stop the frivolous allegations which are intended only to be a distraction. The protest policy F1 currently has in place requires a monetary deposit from the team that makes a formal complaint. Brown now wants the same process to apply to publicly aired concerns from rival teams so that the allegations are put on paper and also to curb the practice. If you had to put up some money and put on paper and not backchannel what your allegations are, I think that would be a way to clean up the bogus allegations that happened in this sport, which are not very sporting, Brown said. And if someone does believe theres a technical issue, by all means youre entitled to it. Put it on paper, put your money down. It should come against your cost cap if it turns out youre wrong, and I think that will significantly stop the bogus allegations that come from some teams in the sport. 
        
     Brown said the pay to complain fee should be meaningful to be effective, and, if an allegation is proved true, the money would be returned to the complaining team. It needs to be meaningful from a Im choosing to spend money on that instead of my own racing car (point of view). Were all right at the limit of the budget gap, Brown said. I know we will not waste a dollar on anything that we dont think brings performance, so its probably 25 grand. Would I spend $25,000 on a distraction tactic or develop my own race car? Id spend it on my race car all day long. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-brown-tire-water-mclaren-protest-6ab4ee786733f8ccc5b3a93e11073718,sports
Cindric all good at Texas after week celebrating a Cup win and talk with teammate over radio rant,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)  Austin Cindric will start on the second row for the NASCAR Cup race at Texas after a week of celebrating a win at Talladega and a lot of attention paid to an expletive-laden radio rant directed toward him by his own teammate during Team Penskes first win of the season. There also was the conversation with Joey Logano, who was furious midway through the race when he didnt get the help he needed in his Ford from Cindric, which allowed rival Toyota driver Bubba Wallace to win the second stage and earn valuable bonus points. Definitely needed, right? I mean, I think youve got to talk about that. Youve got to talk about what happened on track. I think thats a lot more of the substance of the conversation, Cindric said Saturday. I feel like Ive got pretty thick skin, and I also feel like I know Joey fairly well, so Im not overly concerned or have too many emotions at all about what was said, he said. But I think for us, sorting out where we both stood on track and what we can do in the future to be better there and capitalize on those opportunities. They are back on the track Sunday at Texas, the 1 1/2-mile track where Cindric qualified third for the 11th Cup race this season. All good for me, man, Cindric said when asked if the teammates were good. Carson Hocevar earned his first Cup pole with a qualifying lap of 191.659 mph in the Spire Motorsports Chevrolet. The 22-year-old Hocevar is the youngest pole winner ever at Texas Motor Speedway, which will host its 45th Cup race. His 56th career Cup race will start on the front row with Cup points leader William Byron (191.564 mph), also in a Chevy. 
        
     Cindric ran a qualifying lap of 191.523 mph. Logano will start 27th, two spots ahead of defending race champion Chase Elliott. Logano said this week that he probably spouted off more than he should have against his teammate during the Talladega race, and that it came in the heat of the moment. Among the reactions this week was Baseball Hall of Famer Chipper Jones criticizing reigning NASCAR champion Logano in a series of social media posts. Jones congratulated Cindric, called Logano selfish and celebrated Logano being disqualified for failing postrace inspection. Cindric said he knows who the former Atlanta Braves slugger is even though he doesnt follow much baseball. But to have something like that with eyes on our sport, a Hall of Famer is really cool, Cindric said. The rest of its a lot of noise. But its cool to have someone like that behind me. As for that Braves cap Cindric keeps in his truck, that isnt about being a fan of the MLB team, and he didnt wear it at all this week. Well, the funny thing is, thats like my neutral hat ... because I dont want to walk around like advertising, Hey, Im a NASCAR driver if I can help it, he said. So its usually either that or my Colts (cap) that I snag in my truck. Chase Elliott left Texas last spring with his first victory after 42 races and 18 months without one. He is back with another long winless drought, this one 37 races and nearly 13 months since crossing the finish line under caution after taking the white flag as the leader there. Definitely not a conversation you want to be having, but nonetheless, I think weve been going in the right direction, said Elliott, who is fourth in the NASCAR Cup standings, with six top-10 finishes and none outside the top 20. The sports most popular driver shouldnt be hard to find on the track Sunday, when he will drive a gold car to help NAPA Auto Parts mark its 100th year as a company. NAPA has been his primary sponsor since he was racing in the Xfinity Series in 2014. Elliotts win last year was the eighth at Texas for Hendrick Motorsports, twice as many as any other team. Hendrick has won three of the last four there with different drivers each time. William Byron won the tracks last fall race in 2023, two years after Kyle Larson won a playoff race and the non-points All-Star race. Its not the best race track, but its unique enough that its different and its a challenge. Theres that positivity to it. They didnt do a good job with the remodel of it, Larson said, referring to a 2017 total repave with significant changes to Turns 1 and 2. I mean you can still have success somewhere and not love it. But, yeah, I dont hate it either. Larson at +375 is the betting favorite to win Sunday, per BetMGM Sportsbook, followed by Byron at +550 and Tyler Reddick at +700. ... Kyle Buschs 35th race at Texas will come two days after his 40th birthday. He has four wins at Texas, where he has led in 20 different races overall, a track record. His 1,069 laps led are second only to Jimmie Johnsons 1,152. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-texas-preview-cindric-penske-5e5dd419ade3f03711a08dc0b1a000f1,sports
Haeran Ryu pulls away for a wire-to-wire win at Black Desert Championship,"IVINS, Utah (AP)  Haeran Ryu made an 8-foot eagle putt during a flawless back nine that allowed her to pull away Sunday with an 8-under 64, giving her a five-shot victory at the inaugural Black Desert Championship in the LPGA Tours return to Utah after a 61-year absence. Ryu became the second player to go wire-to-wire on the LPGA Tour this year, and it was her second time winning a new event. She won the FM Championship at the TPC Boston last year. She was coming off a rough finish at the Chevron Championship last week, sharing the 54-hole lead at the first major of the year until closing with a 76. This one was closer than the five-shot margin indicated. Ryu was clinging to a one-shot lead over Esther Henseleit of Germany going to the back nine. She missed a 6-foot birdie putt on the 10th  her third straight miss from short range for birdie. But then she made a 15-foot birdie putt at the 11th, and her eagle at the 13th put her ahead by four shots. Incredible day, said Ryu, who now has won in each of the last seven years dating to her first win as an 18-year-old on the Korea LPGA. Henseleit, who started three shots behind, went out in 31 to get within one shot. She cooled on the back nine, not making another birdie until the 18th hole for a 66. She tied for second with Ruoning Yin (67), the final challenge to Ryu. Started out great on the front nine and then couldnt quite keep up on the back, Henseleit said. Haeran played amazing and she really deserved to win it today. 
        
     Yin, who got back into the mix with a 62 on Saturday, was four shots behind at the turn. She ran off four straight birdies starting at the 11th, all of them inside 8 feet. The last one got her to within three shots of Ryu. The South Korean responded with an approach into 3 feet on the 15th for a birdie to restore her lead to four shots, and Yin fell back with a double bogey from the bunker on the 16th. I play 70 good holes, Yin said. I made a triple on the first day and then a double on 16 today. But overall, I think my game is really solid. Yan Liu closed with a 65 to finish alone in fourth. Stephanie Kyriacou of Australia finished with the shot of the day, a fairway metal on the par-5 18th that rolled in for an albatross, giving her a 67 to tie for sixth. Ryu is the 10th winner in 10 tournaments on the LPGA Tour this season. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/haeran-ryu-lpga-black-desert-henseleith-yin-a653ed837917639509e134c4baecd2ef,sports
Scottie Scheffler matches PGA Tour 72-hole scoring record in 8-shot win at the Byron Nelson,"McKINNEY, Texas (AP)  Scottie Scheffler cradled his year-old son Bennett  the reason he missed his beloved hometown CJ Cup Byron Nelson in 2024  and struggled to keep his emotions in check for a TV interview, just as he did a few minutes later during the victory speech. The top-ranked player had time to prepare for the moment because of the giant lead he took into Sundays final round, and he even added a little drama by chasing the PGA Tours 72-hole scoring record. Scheffler matched that mark of 253 set by Justin Thomas at the 2017 Sony Open and equaled six years later by Ludvig Aberg at the RSM Classic, closing with a 63 to finish at 31 under par. The runaway victory came 11 years after his PGA Tour debut at the Nelson as a high school senior, and 22 years after a photo was taken of then-6-year-old Scheffler with the tournament namesake.  Scheffler couldnt help but think about that day in 2014, when his now-wife, Meredith, was his girlfriend  not yet the mother of their first child  and sister Callie, now a mother of two, was his caddie. My family was all able to be here, and it was just really, really special memories, and I think at times it all comes crashing down to me at once, Scheffler said. We have a lot of great memories as kids coming to watch this tournament. I just dreamed to be able to play in it, and its more of a dream to be able to win it. Scheffler was in position to break the tour scoring record before a flubbed chip that led to bogey on the par-3 17th hole and a par from a greenside bunker on the par-5 closing hole. His 8-foot putt for birdie and the record slid by the left side of the hole. 
        
     Hideki Matsuyama has the lowest score in relation to par this season, 35 under on the par-73 Plantation Course at Kapalua. Scheffler tied the 54-hole Nelson record with an eight-shot lead, and nobody got closer than six during the final round. Erik van Rooyen of South Africa matched Schefflers 8-under 63 to finish at 23 under, three shots ahead of Sam Stevens and four ahead of another hometown favorite, Jordan Spieth. We spoke last night, and I told you it was going to be a steep mountain to climb, and it was, van Rooyen said. Scottie was practically flawless, which is kind of what you expect from the world No. 1. Really proud with the golf I played. Scheffler and Spieth finished with the two lowest rounds of the tournament. Scheffler opened with a 10-under 61 on Thursday at the defenseless par-71 TPC Craig Ranch in a suburban community about 30 miles north of Dallas. Spieth shot 62 in the final round, knowing his friend and fellow Texas alum was about to become the first of the pair to win the event they both cherish. Spieth was the first to make his tour debut at the Nelson, four years before Scheffler. On top of that, Spieth contended as a 16-year-old in 2010, leading many to believe that surely he would have won it by now. Scheffler stole those bragging rights. I think Ill take it easy on him, Scheffler said with a chuckle. Spieth played with Scheffler the first two days and was 12 shots behind him going into the weekend, so he understands how things have changed. They started the tournament with 13 PGA Tour wins apiece. Now Spieth trails for the first time. It wasnt that long ago I was definitely better than him, and now Im definitely not right now, said Spieth, a three-time major champion. I hate admitting that about anybody, but I just watched it those first two rounds, and, like, Ive got to get better. Its very inspiring.  It was the first victory this year for Scheffler after he won a total of 10 times before May in the previous three years combined, including two Masters victories.  Schefflers previous best Nelson finish was a tie for fifth in his most recent appearance two years ago. Now hes the first wire-to-wire Nelson winner since Tom Watson 45 years ago. Im not jealous of him winning this event over any other, Spieth said. Im jealous of anyone that wins any week. When Scottie wins, Im happy. It doesnt matter where it is. If Im not going to win, I like when he wins. Scheffler shattered the previous Nelson scoring record of 259 set by Steven Bowditch in 2015. That tournament was played at the TPC Four Seasons. Normally a par 70, that course had a par-69 layout the final three days when heavy rain forced officials to convert a par 4 into a par 3. Bowditch finished 18 under. The margin of victory was the second-largest at the Nelson behind Sam Sneads 10-shot win in 1957, when it was known as the Dallas Open Invitational. This is a golf course where you can kind of make a run, and I knew that I couldnt just coast to the finish line today, Scheffler said. I knew I had to put together a good round. Because of heavy rain Wednesday and Friday, players were allowed to lift, clean and replace their golf balls in the fairway for the first three rounds, but not in the final round. Aberg had so-called preferred lies during the first rounds at the 2023 RSM Classic.  ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/scottie-scheffler-byron-nelson-pga-tour-scoring-record-72047ee609a52573394cdd3d39b9ed2d,sports
The stars are still aligned in golf as the PGA Championship nears,"A different month, a different major and the stars are still aligned. Bryson DeChambeau finally cashed in on a Sunday, losing a five-shot lead before pulling ahead on the final three holes to win in South Korea. This was three weeks after Rory McIlroy picked up a Masters green jacket and the career Grand Slam. It was about 13 hours before Scottie Scheffler destroyed the field in Dallas. And as somewhat of a footnote, Jordan Spieth shot a 62 on the final day in Dallas that only stoked conversation about the chances of another career Grand Slam. The PGA Championship starts in nine days. Scottie is on a great run. Joaquin Niemann is on a great run. Jon Rahm has been playing well, DeChambeau said after his victory at LIV Golf Korea. Theres a lot of star-studded talent out there right now thats going to be in the PGA Championship. Were going to be battling it out. Most peculiar was how DeChambeau included Niemann  three wins in LIV Golf this year, but still without a top-10 finish in his 23 starts in the majors  and left out McIlroy, whose three wins this year have come at Pebble Beach, The Players Championship and the Masters. DeChambeau played with McIlroy in the final round at Augusta National, where he took the lead after two holes before fading to a 75 to finish four shots behind. He later said when asked about the dynamic in their pairing that McIlroy wouldnt talk to me. 
        
     Rahm has yet to finish out of the top 10 at LIV Golf, but he has gone quiet in the majors since joining the Saudi-funded league. Hes still Jon Rahm, however. It all sets up for high intrigue going into the second major of the year. That hasnt always been the case for the PGA Championship whether it was held in May or August. The Masters is forever linked with Augusta National and decades of high drama. The U.S. Open bills itself as the toughest test in golf, sometimes to a fault. The British Open is played on a links course. And how is the PGA Championship best defined? The other one, Geoff Ogilvy once said. The Masters, of course, will be hard to top the way it played out. McIlroy, with his best chance at the career slam, fell behind, built a big lead, shockingly lost his big lead, rallied with two magnificent shots and eventually won a playoff over Justin Rose. McIlroy is still buzzing over finally winning the green jacket, which he wore during appearances last week on NBCs Today and The Tonight Show, the latter with host Jimmy Fallon in which McIlroy replicated chipping into a washing machine from when he was a wee lad in Northern Ireland. The career Grand Slam is in the books. Is the calendar Grand Slam in play? Only four players since the modern slam came to life in 1960  Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Spieth  have even won the first two legs. The PGA Championship is at Quail Hollow, where McIlroy already has won four times. But he is no longer the betting favorite one week out. BetMGM Sportsbook has Scheffler as a slight favorite after a brand of golf from the No. 1 player not seen since last year. Scheffler missed two months recovering from minor surgery after he punctured his right hand while making ravioli. Something had been missing in his game since his return. But it was all there in Dallas, and it was frightening for those who had to face it. Scheffler was poised to break the PGA Tour scoring record of 72 holes until a chip rolled back to his feet on the 17th (bogey) and he failed to birdie the 18th (his first time all week not making birdie or better on a par 5). He still tied the mark at 253 and won by eight. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction, Scheffler said. Im excited to start the rest of the season. Its May and hes talking about a starting point. Three majors are still to come, and the PGA Championship could be a great indicator where this is headed. BetMGM Sportsbook has Scheffler at +400, with McIlroy at +500. That could change after this week because McIlroy is playing at Philadelphia Cricket Club and Scheffler is not. DeChambeau was listed at +1200 and always worth noticing. He had a burden lifted in South Korea, not just because it was his first win since the U.S. Open last year, but because it was his fourth straight time in the final group (in LIV Golf with its shotgun start, that means starting on the first hole). His scoring average the previous three times was 73.7. And then he shot 30 on the back nine in South Korea and won by two. Next stop: the PGA Championship, where last year in Kentucky DeChambeau was every bit the entertainer and lost to Xander Schauffeles birdie putt on the final hole. As for Spieth, hes still hard to predict as he returns from wrist surgery last August. But a 62 in the final round suggests his game isnt too far off. The only scars from Dallas might be spending the first two days with Scheffler. Spieth opened with rounds of 67-69 and was 12 shots behind. It wasnt that long ago I was definitely better than him, and now Im definitely not right now, Spieth said. I hate admitting that about anybody, but I just watched it those first two rounds, and Ive got to get better. Its very inspiring. Gary Player (1965) and Nicklaus (1966) completed the career Grand Slam one year apart. Is it possible for that to happen one month apart? As is often said about the Masters, the PGA Championship cant start soon enough. ___ On The Fringe analyzes the biggest topics in golf during the season.

New York Liberty open up camp ready to defend their first WNBA championship,"NEW YORK (AP)  Breanna Stewart and her New York Liberty teammates are focused on the present and that includes defending the WNBA championship. The Liberty opened camp Sunday along with the other 12 teams in the league. Stewart knows exactly how hard it is to repeat as champion, having won two titles in Seattle and failing to repeat each time. The only repeat champion in the past two decades in the WNBA was the Las Vegas Aces in 2022 and 2023.  The mentality is turning the page, she said. Knowing what we did last year, we had a lot of time to celebrate it and now its, building to be better. You know, we talked about, being consistently great night in and night out. And that starts with building great habits in training camp and keeping them sustainable throughout the entire season. The Liberty have most of the core back from last seasons title run that was the first in franchise history. They also added Natasha Cloud and Isabelle Harrison. I thought it was a great start. And like, I always said, you cant bring back the same when you win and we have a real good, nice freshness about us, New York coach Sandy Brondello said. Weve got some players that were really going to help us. Obviously, you know, no one greater than Natasha Cloud, Brondello wasnt concerned that Stewart is working her way back from offseason meniscus surgery last month. Stewart took part in the early part of practice Sunday and said shes feeling great. She will integrate more fully into live practice next week.  
        
     Stewart said she felt she did something to it in Game 5 of the WNBA Finals last year and waited until after the inaugural season of Unrivaled was over to take care of it. I just needed to kind of clean up things in there and clean up the meniscus, she said. And, it was just a little bit uncomfortable to be dealing with. And I want to when Im on the floor, I want to be playing and, free flowing and not really thinking about other things. While Stewart will be back before the regular season begins, the Liberty are going to be missing Betnijah Laney-Hamilton for a few months as she recovers from her own knee injury. Were definitely gonna miss her a lot this season, Stewart said. I think, you know, with her being out, it gives people opportunities. You know, Leonie (Fiebich) will have a bigger role. Marina (Johannes) coming here. ...Its just going to be like next woman up mentality and knowing that theyre not going to take her place. But theyre going to be the best version of themselves. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-liberty-ca54d4f643819f4f9996eee8c65db83a,sports
"Caitlin Clark, Angel Reeses return to college for WNBA preseason games to be shown on national TV","NEW YORK (AP)  Caitlin Clark and Angel Reeses return to college for WNBA preseason games will be two of a record four exhibition games shown on national TV. Clark will head back to Iowa for an exhibition between her Indiana Fever and the Brazilian national team on Sunday, a game airing on ESPN. The Fevers exhibition game against the Washington Mystics a day earlier will be on NBA TV. Reese will lead the Chicago Sky back to her alma mater, LSU, on Friday to face the Brazilian team. Sky teammate Kamilla Cardoso played for that Brazilian team in February 2024, trying to help it qualify for the Paris Olympics. That game will be part of a doubleheader on ION. The WNBA will be showing all 15 of its preseason games either on national television or league pass. Weve seen the demand for WNBA content grow exponentially and we are meeting that demand by working with our broadcast partners and our teams to make a significant investment by making all 15 preseason games available to WNBA fans, Chief Growth Officer Colie Edison said. The league showed two exhibition games in 2023 and four last year, including Clarks debut, which was on league pass. Reeses preseason debut against Minnesota wasnt televised, but a fan livestreamed it on social media. The livestream drew significant attention, getting millions of views. The two rookies last season helped the league draw record-breaking viewership. ESPN games averaged 1.2 million viewers in the regular season, a 170% increase from the previous year. The postseason averaged 1.1 million viewers, making it the leagues most-viewed playoffs in 25 years. 
        
     The other game that will be nationally televised will be when Dallas plays Las Vegas at Notre Dame in the first game of the ION doubleheader Friday. Three former Irish stars  Dallas Arike Ogunbowale and Las Vegas Jewell Loyd and Jackie Young  are coming back to campus. The game also will mark the debut of Paige Bueckers, the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft two weeks ago. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-preseason-caitlin-clark-angel-reese-ff8c777fa04417596c7bea188133cae0,sports
Stronger Caitlin Clark gears up for 2nd WNBA season with a revamped and upgraded Fever roster,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark slapped the court with both hands and started gesturing in her sides direction after forcing a 5-second call near the end of Tuesdays practice. It was only Day 2 of training camp, yet this is what Clark has yearned for these past seven months  going back to work with a new coach, a revamped roster and even higher expectations in her second WNBA season. After leading the Fever to their first playoff berth in eight years, winning the leagues Rookie of the Year Award, being named Associated Press 2024 Female Athlete of the Year and Time magazines 2024 Athlete of the Year, Clark returned to Indianapolis a stronger, wiser player, more determined to win the championship that eluded her in college. It was an adjustment sure, because I was so used to playing minutes for, well, basically a year of my life. Thats all I did, Clark said. So the rest was good. I thought it was going to feel long and it really didnt. We were in here all the time. But that rest aspect, just getting my body where it needed to be and really on things I needed to work on was super important. But Im ready to compete again.  It was a well-deserved vacation for perhaps the busiest player in womens basketball. She capped her final college season by playing a 39-game schedule while leading Iowa to a second straight national championship game. One week after losing to South Carolina, the Fever drafted her No. 1 overall and 13 days after that, training camp opened. 
        
     Following a brief preseason, Clark made her regular-season debut May 10. That started a grueling 42-game grind during which the Fever overcame a 1-8 start to finish 20-20. Then they were swept out of the playoffs. The only real stoppage for Clark during that 81-game, 10 1/2-month span was the monthlong Olympic break.  Clark turned sellouts at college and WNBA games into the norm as she found her every move scrutinized on social media. Fans complained she was being treated poorly by the leagues older players and some even argued the physical play was racially motivated. Her friendships and relationships became all the rage, and nothing seemed to be off limits. But Clark never complained, never bowed to the pressure and used this seven-month break to focus on being herself. She completed one bucket list item  attending the final round of The Masters earlier this month  and had her college jersey retired. She attended a Taylor Swift concert, an NFL game with Swift and, of course, Pacers games. Now, though, she sounds refreshed as she sings the praises of a veteran team full of title dreams and championship resumes from coach Stephanie White to teammates Natasha Howard and 37-year-old DeWanna Bonner. And the early returns seem to show the personalities are a perfect match. Everything is just absolutely good, All-Star guard Kelsey Mitchell said. It feels fresh. It feels kind of like when you take your clothes out of the dryer. It just feels different and it feels good because we have new leadership. Its not just the overhauled roster, either. Mitchell, one of the few holdovers left from last season, also sees a different version of Clark, one showcased in a photo posted on social media last month. From a physical standpoint, her strength and her ability to make plays that people dont think about  that skip pass from here to here, Mitchell said. A person of her caliber, it seems small but its going to help her go from having 10 assists to 12. And then after that the professional learning, watching film, knowing what you need. Just the thought of an improved Clark this season could make opponents jittery. Clark led the Fever in minutes (35.4 per game) and steals (1.3), shared team scoring honors with Mitchell (19.2 points), and broke the WNBAs single season mark for assists with 337. Not bad for a rookie trying to fit in and find her way. But the intensity and passion Clark plays with, even in practice, seem to have her more comfortable playing the leading role from the start of this season, too. She doesnt waste reps and she literally embodies the value that how you do anything is how you do everything  whether its a ball-handling drill or a shooting drill or setting screens, White said. She approaches it with such a discipline that she doesnt waste time, and I appreciate that. Clark, meanwhile, is just focused on winning games. The Fever will play at her alma mater and Notre Dame in the preseason, with the real tests set to begin with Indianas season opener May 17 at Chicago and her old rival, Angel Reese. And you can bet, Clark will be just as eager to celebrate then as she was in practice. Dont get me wrong, I love basketball, like thats one of the most fun things in the world, she said. We had a great year and eventually getting away from that, I came to a point where I was itching to get back in here after like a month. So Im happy to be back. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-fever-caitlin-clark-a57296074672f8ac81123312ef3ea257,sports
Jalen Milroe is cheerful but diligent as he begins his first minicamp with the Seahawks,"RENTON, Wa. (AP)  For all the million-dollar smiles Jalen Milroe flashed following his first practice with the Seahawks, its clear Seattles third-round draft pick means business. Milroes diligent approach stems from his being raised by military parents. His father, Quentin, served in the Marine Corps while his mother, Lola, served in the Navy. Both were on hand for the opening of the Seahawks rookie minicamp on Friday. Having two military parents, you definitely emphasize determination. Grit. Goals, short-term goals and long-term goals, and understanding that it takes a team, Milroe said. I dont believe in the word self-made at all. It takes a team to accomplish what you want to accomplish. So, my team was here today at practice. So, too, was Milroes passing potential. He worked through the route tree and showed impressive touch on deep throws. Milroe, who completed 64% of his passes at Alabama with 45 touchdowns and 20 interceptions, has spent the last year and a half working on his mechanics with former NFL quarterback Jordan Palmer in San Clemente, California. Palmer has also worked with Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and even Seattles new starter, Sam Darnold. Milroe has gained a better understanding of the role his lower body plays in making strong, accurate throws. Every quarterback is different, Milroe said. And so, doing a really deep understanding of how my body functions at the quarterback position for how I throw the ball. And so, understanding how to distribute my body when it comes to my lower-half mechanics and things like that. Thats been a focus for us. And so with that, its all about being an efficient passer. 
        
     Tight end Elijah Arroyo, a second-round pick, appreciated catching passes from Milroe. I cant really explain it. Im not a quarterback, Arroyo said. But just the way he throws the ball, the way he moves. He has a chance to be an elite quarterback at the highest level. Odds are Milroe will do a lot more sitting than competing early in his NFL career. Darnold, after all, signed a three-year, $100.5 million contract this offseason. The Seahawks also brought in veteran backup Drew Lock. None of that is to suggest the 22-year-old Milroe intends on coasting in his first year as a pro. He said he began studying the Seahawks playbook the day after he was drafted. It was a quick turnaround for sure, Milroe said. Its definitely now, this is my job. Now I know where Im going to be. Its a long process for sure. Milroe has some familiarity with having to learn new a new offensive system. He worked alongside three offensive coordinators with the Crimson Tide. Last season, Milroe operated with an entirely new coaching staff, too, after Nick Saban called it quits on as decorated a coaching career as any in college football. Seattle also has a new offensive coordinator this year. Klint Kubiak was hired in January after one season in the same position with the New Orleans Saints. We saw football in different lenses with each coordinator, Milroe said. You have different terminology. You have different formation adjustments. One familiar thing for Milroe on his first full workday as a pro: having his parents with him. My parents made a joke, Its like your first day of class today, and they took a bunch of pictures after practice, Milroe said. But no, its definitely cool to be an NFL quarterback, to get my feet wet, get acclimated with everything. It was definitely a dream come true for sure. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/seahawks-jalen-milroe-rookie-camp-859730a9faa86994e5623f208ed065a7,sports
"Washington to host the 2027 NFL draft on the National Mall, President Donald Trump says","WASHINGTON (AP)  The 2027 NFL draft is heading to the nations capital on the National Mall, President Donald Trump said Monday, bringing the widely popular event back to Washington for the first time in more than eight decades. After word of Washington getting the draft two years from now surfaced Sunday night, Trump made the formal announcement in the Oval Office flanked by Commissioner Roger Goodell, Commanders controlling owner Josh Harris and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.  I dont think theres ever been anything like that, Trump said. Its going to be beautiful. Its going to be something that nobody else will ever be able to duplicate that, I dont suspect. Its very exciting. It is the latest off-field victory for the Commanders, who a week ago reached an agreement with the D.C. government to build a new home on the old RFK Stadium site, pending council approval. Trump also endorsed that plan in his remarks, saying, I dont think there is a better site anywhere in the world. Under former owner Dan Snyder, the team previously tried multiple times to land the draft and was unsuccessful. Now, itll happen behind the teams new Harris-led ownership group, which bought the Commanders from Snyder in 2023. What a great day for Washington, Harris said. I believe well get over a million people, and its going to be an amazing day and itll showcase what Washingtons all about. 
        
     Washington last hosted the draft in 1941 at the Willard Hotel. We believe in investing in sports because they have helped us transform neighborhoods, and the NFL bringing this event to the nations capital will help us fill hotel rooms, our restaurants, Bowser said. Americans from all 50 states will come to their nations capital and enjoy our beautiful city and museums. Green Bay, the NFLs smallest market, hosted the most recent draft in late April outside historic Lambeau Field. The NFL announced a crowd of 600,000 fans attended over the three days. The draft has really become one of the great entertainment and sports events, Goodell said, trumpeting the popularity of the draft in recent years. It will not just be an event. It will be something that will show the world how far the nations capital has come and where its going. The NFL draft used to be a fixture at Radio City Music Hall in New York and has become an even bigger hit since it hit the road in 2015. Chicago hosted the draft in 2015 and 16. Philadelphia had it in 17, followed by Dallas and Nashville.  Goodell announced the picks from his house in 2020 during the pandemic. It went to Cleveland in 2021 followed by Las Vegas, Kansas City and Detroit. A record crowd of 750,000 attended Detroits draft in 2024. Pittsburgh will host next year. The draft in Washington in 27 will mark the third anniversary of the franchise-altering selection of quarterback Jayden Daniels with the second pick. The Commanders made the playoffs and reached the NFC championship game in Daniels rookie year and look to be a Super Bowl contender for years to come. I have to say that Josh had a very good draft a short while ago, Trump said. You have a very good quarterback  a great quarterback, I think. Success on the field under Harris-hired general manager Adam Peters and coach Dan Quinn has made Washington a premier market again, decades after the organizations glory days that included three Super Bowl championships.  After the news conference last week unveiling plans to build a 65,000-seat stadium, Goodell said the turnaround from losing to winning is immeasurable in so many ways. This market is obviously critical, Goodell said. To be able to have a franchise here that everybody here is proud of thats gotten back on the football field in a positive way and now to have a stadium that brings their team back into D.C., I think thats a really big step and something thats going to be great for the NFL, too. ___ AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed from Tampa, Florida.  ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/nfl-draft-commanders-trump-15860d4e1d55f9bc8428d75e9dda0d44,sports
Well-traveled WR Dionate Johnsons tour of the AFC North makes another stop in Cleveland,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Diontae Johnson is making another stop in the AFC North. The well-traveled wide receiver signed a one-year deal with Cleveland on Monday. The Browns are Johnsons third stop within the division in the last 14 months. Johnson spent the first five seasons of his career in Pittsburgh, where he was a Pro Bowler in 2021. He was traded to Carolina in March 2024 before being sent to Baltimore in the middle of last season. Johnson played in just four games with the Ravens before being released and signing with Houston, where he appeared in a single game. The 28-year-old Johnson had career lows in receptions (33) and yards (375) in 2024.

LA Kings president expects coach Jim Hiller to remain in charge after GM Blakes replacement hired,"EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP)  Los Angeles Kings president Luc Robitaille expects coach Jim Hiller to remain in charge after the team selects its new general manager. Robitaille expressed strong support for Hiller on Tuesday, one day after GM Rob Blake and the Kings mutually agreed to end Blakes eight-year tenure. Your general manager, you want to give him the freedom, you dont want to lock up a new person thats coming in, but the record of what Jimmy has done this year is really, really good, Robitaille said at the Kings training complex. It would be really hard for any GM to say, Well, this guy shouldnt come back. Hes been really good. I think Jimmys a great coach, and I fully think that this guy is coming back, for sure. Hiller has been in charge of the Kings bench since February 2024, when the former assistant took over for the fired Todd McLellan. The Kings are 69-37-10 in Hillers first job as an NHL head coach, and they matched franchise records with 48 victories and 105 points this season before losing to Edmonton in the first round for the fourth consecutive postseason. Robitaille emphasized that the new GM would have the final say on the coaching staff, but the longtime team president reiterated his overall happiness with the state of the Kings roster, their coaching staff and even their style of play despite their repeated playoff disappointments. Robitaille made it clear that Blake supported the decision to seek new team leadership. Robitaille plans to hire a general manager who can provide a fresh perspective on how to change a talent-filled roster that cant get it done in the postseason. 
        
     Blakey and I have been talking about it for probably a year, Robitaille said. He always said he wanted to wait to sign (a contract extension). Im not going to get into detail about our conversation, but its something we talked about ... and we both agreed this was better for the franchise. The former Kings teammates agreed that it was time to probably bring a new voice just to get us to that next level, Robitaille added. Los Angeles hasnt won a playoff series since raising the Stanley Cup in 2014, and the Oilers have bounced the Kings in four straight springs. Los Angeles has won only eight total games in those four first-round series, and Hillers club lost its final four in a row last week after winning the first two at home. Robitaille didnt sound close to hiring Blakes replacement. He plans to examine multiple candidates, including Marc Bergevin, the former Montreal GM who was a senior adviser to Blake for the past 3 1/2 years. Robitaille isnt waiting until he hires a new GM to begin preparations for next season. Working with assistant general manager Nelson Emerson, Robitaille has already spoken to pending unrestricted free agents Andrei Kuzmenko and Vladislav Gavrikov, who both played significant roles in Los Angeles late-season success. When asked what he sought in a replacement for a general manager of a team coming off one of the best regular seasons in franchise history, Robitaille emphasized the importance of evaluating the Kings roster with fresh eyes. We had a good year ... but its sports, and you want to win the last game of the season, Robitaille said. Thats our goal. Robitaille doesnt necessarily want to see the Kings abandon their regimented, defense-oriented style of play under McLellan and Hiller, however. Fans often criticize Los Angeles style as old-fashioned and not offense-forward, but Robitaille offered a passionate defense of a team that stopped relying so heavily on the neutral-zone trap this season and finished 14th in the NHL in goals scored (249). We had three of the best lines in hockey, Robitaille said. We scored goals. We had a 40% power play (at the end of the season). We felt like we needed to tweak our power play, and credit to our guys, they figured it out. Some teams have a 60-goal scorer. We dont, but we have a lot of guys that can score goals. We play hard.

Wild GM Guerin aims for Kaprizov extension and aggressive summer spending with cap constraints gone,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP)  The Minnesota Wild have entered a critical offseason, able to fully participate in free agency again after two years of significant salary cap constraints. Without an NHL playoff series win in the last 10 years, the urgency for the club to build a deeper roster around a promising young core is high  putting the pressure on general manager Bill Guerin this summer and into the upcoming season. Im more excited than anything. Its been a long couple years, just dealing with this stuff and honestly just hearing about it, said Guerin, who has been in his role for six years. I want high expectations. Im not doing this job sit in the corner or anything. These are big jobs. These are important jobs. Theres a lot of people out there who love the Minnesota Wild, and Im trying to deliver something to them. We all are. The first order of business is clear: an extension for Kirill Kaprizov. The star left wing has one year left on his current contract. Im very confident were going to get a deal done with Kirill. I think he really loves this market and this team, Guerin said on Tuesday at Xcel Energy Center, five days after the Wild were eliminated on their home ice. I think he feels that were going in the right direction. Kaprizov, who has 386 points in 319 regular season games and 21 points in 25 playoff games with the Wild, said as much over the weekend. 
        
     I love everything here, Kaprizov said. Should be all good. The Wild barely got in the playoffs in part because Kaprizov missed half of the season with a lower-body injury that required surgery. With five goals and four assists in the six-game loss to Vegas in the first-round series, Kaprizov made clear he was fully recovered. He just wants to win, and I think this was a promising sign that our team can do it. We can get there. Were so close, said left wing Marcus Foligno, reflecting on the three straight one-goal losses that finished the series, including two in overtime. Ive got 100% confidence that well get him here long term. Or Ill just rip up his visa. Guerin made the bold move four years ago of buying out the contracts of franchise cornerstones Zach Parise and Ryan Suter. The fresh start for team chemistry came at a cost, particularly for the last two seasons with the buyout charges accounting for about 17% of their salary cap. Those hits will be drastically reduced for 2025-26 and beyond until theyre gone. I like to be aggressive. I dont want to sit on my hands at all. Im kind of tired of doing that, Guerin said. Since I walked through the door, my goal has been to build a championship-caliber team for this market, and thats what I want to do. I dont want to sign any stupid contracts or anything like that, but I want to make this team better than it is today. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/wild-guerin-kaprizov-salary-cap-d8d3c353404578477610ab34e1bbb6d5,sports
Frederik Andersen returns from missing end of 1st round to help Hurricanes beat Capitals in Game 1,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Frederik Andersen had no choice but to sit and watch his Carolina Hurricanes teammates clinch their first-round series victory and move on in the NHL playoffs. A week later, he was back in net and delivered the kind of quality goaltending theyve gotten from him whenever he has been healthy. Andersen stopped 13 of the 14 shots he faced as the Hurricanes beat the Washington Capitals 2-1 in overtime in Game 1 of their second-round series. Just really been looking forward to this for a while, Andersen said. Happy we could start off on the right foot. Andersen was Carolinas starter to begin the postseason and turned aside 88 of 94 shots before getting injured when New Jersey forward Timo Meier barreled into him in the second period of Game 4 last round. He gave way to backup Pyotr Kotchekov, who finished the job that night and did enough to advance with an overtime victory in Game 5. Extra time off allowed Andersen, a 35-year-old Dane in his 12th season in the league, to heal up. He was not tested much in the opener at Washington, but even the lack of action he had made it more challenging for a veteran coming off a long layoff.  Well thats tough  it seems easy, coach Rod BrindAmour said. Hes been here long enough (to know) you got to stay focused. And I thought he did a good job. The Hurricanes pummeled the Capitals with 94 shots attempts: 33 that got on net  two of which went in past Logan Thompson  and 36 that got blocked before reaching him. After Logan Stankoven tied it midway through the third period, Andersen took space away on Ryan Leonards breakaway with just under six minutes, a play that did not count as a save but contributed to sending the game to overtime. 
        
     You could tell he was on it, BrindAmour said. That was a huge one for us. Carolina has been used to playing without Andersen, who missed half of 2023-24 getting treatment for blood clots and was out for a few months this season after knee surgery. But the organization showed how important Andersen is, signing him between rounds to a contract for next season, one that could see him earn up to $3.5 million. In his first game since getting that deal, Andersen rewarded the Hurricanes by making the saves he needed to make to give them a series led. Hes huge for us, Stankoven said. Were trying at the other end to create offense, and when we do give up chances or there are breakdowns, hes there for us. And hes been great all playoffs for us, so were going to need him to keep playing like that. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/frederik-andersen-carolina-hurricanes-capitals-553e8b1b5d209218d1f7844f97b4846c,sports
Torkelsons double in the 10th lifts Tigers to 8-6 win over struggling Rockies,"DENVER (AP)  Spencer Torkelson hit a go-ahead double in the 10th inning and the Detroit Tigers beat the stumbling Colorado Rockies 8-6 on Wednesday night to give A.J. Hinch his 900th win as a big league manager. Torkelson hit a liner to right-center off Zach Agnos (0-1) that brought in Riley Greene, who began at second base under baseballs extra-innings rule. Trey Sweeney added another run when left fielder Jordan Beck couldnt snare his two-out blooper that was changed from a double to an error on Beck. Will Vest (2-0) pitched out of a ninth-inning jam by striking out pinch hitter Kyle Farmer. He got Adael Amador to fly out in the 10th to end the game. Javier Bez hit a pair of two-run singles to help make it a milestone night for Hinch, who became the 75th major league manager to reach 900 wins.  The Rockies dropped to a major league worst 6-29, tied for the second-worst record through 35 games in the live-ball era that began in 1920. They trail the 1988 Baltimore Orioles, who opened at 5-30. The Rockies Ryan McMahon finished with four hits, including two doubles and a two-run homer. Michael Toglia added two doubles and a two-run homer.  Both starters were knocked out of the game early. Detroits Jackson Jobe gave up six runs in 3 2/3 innings, while Colorados Chase Dollander surrendered six runs over three innings. Tommy Kahnle worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth.  
        
     The path doesnt get any easier for the Rockies, who are in the thick of playing 29 straight games against teams above .500. They wont face another team below .500 until Miami on June 2-4. The Tigers and Rockies will play a doubleheader Thursday. In the first game, the Tigers will throw right-hander Casey Mize (5-1, 2.70 ERA) while the Rockies go with lefty Kyle Freeland (0-4, 5.70).  ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/tigers-rockies-score-b91e4e2f7ecd9f50696d28b9c187fb9a,sports
Jorge Solers 3-run double in the 9th inning gives Angels 5-4 win over Blue Jays,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Jorge Soler lined a double into the left-field corner with the bases loaded to drive in three runs in the ninth inning and lift the Los Angeles Angels to a 5-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday night. Trailing 4-2, the Angels loaded the bases with no outs against Blue Jays closer Jeff Hoffman (3-1) when Kyren Paris drew a four-pitch walk and Zach Neto and Nolan Schanuel singled. Hoffman struck out Taylor Ward for the first out, but Soler drove a ball that rolled into the corner and past left fielder Jonatan Clase for the comeback win. The Blue Jays opened the seventh with five straight hits, including Myles Straws go-ahead RBI single and Bo Bichettes two-run single, to take a 4-1 lead.  Toronto starter Jos Berros gave up two runs  solo homers by Paris and Yoan Moncada  and five hits in six innings, striking out nine, walking five and inducing 18 swinging strikes. Angels starter Yusei Kikuchi gave up one run and five hits in six innings. Brock Burke (3-0), Los Angeles fifth pitcher, got the win with one scoreless inning. With the score tied at 1, Ernie Clement opened the seventh with a double off Reid Detmers. Andrs Gimnez beat out a sacrifice bunt for a single and Straw singled home Clement to give Toronto a 2-1 lead. Bichette singled in two runs to make it 4-1.  Paris homered in the seventh off Berros to pull the Angels within 4-2. 
        
     With two on and one out in the eighth, Moncada made a diving backhand stop of Straws grounder down the third-base line, got up, stepped on the bag and threw to first to complete an inning-ending double play and preserve a 4-2 deficit. The Angels have allowed nine bunt hits this season, tied with Miami for the most in the majors. RHP Chris Bassitt (2-2, 2.95 ERA) will start Thursdays series finale for the Blue Jays against RHP Jose Soriano (2-4, 3.83 ERA).

"Road, sweet road: Visiting teams go 4-0 in Game 1 of NBA conference semifinals, a league first","Road, sweet road. Home-court advantage? It doesnt exist so far in the NBA conference semifinals  where visiting teams combined to go 4-0 in Game 1s, the first time that has happened during this round in the leagues playoff history. Indiana beat top-seeded Cleveland on Sunday in the opener of that East series, New York beat defending champion Boston and Denver beat West top-seeded Oklahoma City in their respective openers Monday, and Golden State topped Minnesota in Game 1 of their matchup Tuesday. Its an amazing group of guys, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after Golden States win, one that came with Stephen Curry out for much of the game with a strained hamstring. So far in these playoffs, road teams have gone 23-25. Thats on pace to be the third-best overall road playoff record in NBA postseason history, not counting the bubble season of 2020 when nobody technically was at home. 
        
     Road teams had gone 3-1 in the Round 2 openers of the NBA playoffs on three other occasions  2023, 2015 and 2011  in the current playoff format, which dates to 1984. (It also happened inside the bubble during the 2020 playoffs, when teams had home and road designations, but games were on neutral floors inside Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.) But 4-0 has never happened, until now. I always say a playoff series doesnt start until someone wins a road game, Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton said. Well, weve won two. 
        
     Thats true: Indiana doubled down on its road success by also taking Game 2 at Cleveland on Tuesday night, just before Golden State lost Stephen Curry early but won Game 1 at Minnesota. And all that led to even more road history: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday became the first three-day stretch in NBA playoff history where visiting teams combined to go at least 6-0. That run started Sunday with Indianas Game 1 win at Cleveland, then Golden States Game 7 road win at Houston in the conclusion of the first round of the playoffs. The wins by New York and Denver were Monday, then Indiana and Golden State won again on Tuesday. This team has fought all year, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. Its been a pretty good road team. Theyre not alone. Not this year, anyway, and this trend didnt start in these playoffs. Home teams won 54% of games in the regular season, the fourth time the leaguewide home winning percentage has dipped that low in the last five years. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-road-wins-058bbd4308df6252072ebe41c7690b15,sports
"Celtics Jrue Holiday wins NBAs social justice award, a week after winning sportsmanship award","Jrue Holidays commitment to off-court work continues to be noticed and appreciated within the NBA. Holiday, the Boston Celtics guard, was revealed Wednesday as the recipient of the leagues Social Justice Champion award for this season. The announcement came less than a week after Holiday won the leagues sportsmanship award for the second time his career. The NBA will donate $100,000 to the Jrue and Lauren Holiday Social Impact Fund and he will receive the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Trophy. Holiday was selected from a group of finalists that also included Miamis Bam Adebayo, San Antonios Harrison Barnes, Torontos Chris Boucher and New Orleans CJ McCollum. The award, the NBA said, pays tribute to those who are pursuing social justice and advancing Abdul-Jabbars life mission to engage, empower and drive equality for individuals and groups who have been historically disadvantaged. The fund started by Holiday and his wife Lauren, commonly called the JLH Fund, has distributed over $5.3 million in grants and delivered more than 400 hours of coaching and support to nearly 200 businesses across the U.S. It was founded five years ago after Holiday, when he decided to play in the bubble during the 2019-20 season, pledged the $5 million that remained on his salary that season to help businesses and communities affected by systemic racism and economic injustice. Since entering the league, Jrue Holiday has dedicated himself to helping others in their times of greatest need and pursuing a more just society for all, NBA deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Mark Tatum said. The selflessness that defines his game is even more evident in the work he and his wife Lauren do off the floor to create more opportunities for a generation of youth who might have otherwise been overlooked. 
        
     The JLH Fund has expanded its scope since, with some of its recent efforts including helping those affected by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area earlier this year, providing grant capital to businesses and helping entrepreneurs and others have access to coaching from schools like MIT, Harvard and Suffolk University. The award is decided upon by a panel that includes Tatum, Abdul-Jabbar, human rights activist Richard Lapchick, National Urban League President and CEO Marc Morial, UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murgua, and youth representative JJ Mandaquit from the Jr. NBA and Jr. WNBA Court of Leaders. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/jrue-holiday-social-justice-award-celtics-508fc9dbe6013d3899b48fc689f067ff,sports
"Warriors sideline Curry for at least a week with hamstring strain, putting rest of series in flux","MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Golden State Warriors are planning to play without Stephen Curry for at least the next three games of their second-round series against Minnesota, after an MRI exam on Wednesday confirmed a mild strain of the star guards left hamstring. The Warriors said Curry would be sidelined at least a week after the injury on Tuesday night forced him out early in the second quarter of Game 1, which they went on to win 99-88. He had 13 points in 13 minutes to help Golden State build a comfortable lead and take home-court advantage away from the Timberwolves. Every year the playoffs are about adapting, whether its a game plan or an injury or a lineup, so we just have to adapt, coach Steve Kerr said. Weve done this before, and were confident we can do this again. Game 2 is in Minneapolis on Thursday, before the series moves west to San Francisco for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday. The earliest return for Curry appears to be Game 5 on May 14, which is conveniently followed by three straight off days before Game 6 on May 18. Curry has never had a significant hamstring injury in his career, creating yet more mystery around the length of this absence and whether the Warriors can tread water long enough without the all-time leading 3-point shooter in NBA history to get him back near the end of the series. Theyd be unwise to bank on that, though. We think we have the best defense in the league, and thats been proven over the last couple of months, Kerr said. 
        
     Curry missed multiple games because of injuries during the 2016 and 2018 playoffs, absences the Warriors adeptly endured on their way to the NBA Finals in both scenarios. They lost to Cleveland in seven games for the 2016 championship, and they swept the Cavaliers in 2018 for a third title in four years. Without Curry during those two postseason runs, they went 9-3. This Golden State roster hardly stacks up to those predecessors, however, when Curry and Draymond Green were much younger and other standouts like Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala were integral to their success. By 2018, they had Kevin Durant, too. For now, the Warriors were feeling good about the all-hands-on-deck effort led by Jimmy Butler, Buddy Hield and Green in Game 1, in which Kerr used 12 different players. Without Curry, the ball will go through Butler on most possessions, as it did on Tuesday. The six-time All-Star, whose acquisition in a trade with Miami three months ago helped spark and solidify the Warriors on both offense and defense, had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists in Game 1. He scored 20 or more points in four of the five full games he played in the first round against Houston. Everybody is live. Everybody who comes into the game is looking to make plays, Timberwolves guard Mike Conley said. So you have to be almost even more so locked in on the game and who youre matched up with and the tendencies. Because theyre not looking for just Curry. Obviously, Buddy is going to be more aggressive, Jimmy is going to be more aggressive, but theyve got guys who can put the ball in the hole, and they may try to do that collectively as a group. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-curry-injury-7ff9bd8b9e6b0f4215577e5c540c52aa,sports
Ex-Matildas midfielder Heather Garriock to take over as Football Australia interim CEO,"SYDNEY (AP)  Long-time Matildas midfielder Heather Garriock will take over as Football Australias interim chief executive officer after James Johnson resigned from the role on Thursday.

Barcelona must regroup after Inter loss to face Real Madrid in crucial La Liga clasico,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  Barcelona must recover from its painful Champions League exit in time to face Real Madrid on Sunday with the La Liga title on the line. Hansi Flicks team was moments away from reaching its first European final in a decade when Inter Milan conjured a 4-3 extra-time comeback on Tuesday. The Italian side won 7-6 on aggregate in one of the most memorable knockout ties in recent soccer history. Barcelonas youthful team was left reeling from the loss, but Flick immediately tried to put the focus on the upcoming clasico with only four days separating the two crucial games. This game is over and now we have to pick ourselves up and look ahead as we have the clasico coming up, Flick said after the defeat at San Siro. I will wake the team up. Barcelona leads Madrid by four points and a victory would give it a comfortable cushion, but a Madrid win would throw open the title chase in the three remaining rounds. Barcelona is seeking a double after having beaten Madrid 3-2 in extra time in the Copa del Rey final two weeks ago. A Barcelona triumph would also complete a sweep of all four clasicos this season; it beat Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup in January after winning 4-0 at Madrid in the league in October. Madrid, in contrast, is trying to salvage a disappointing season by successfully defending its La Liga title ahead of this summers expanded Club World Cup. 
        
     Lamine Yamal, who played superbly against Inter only to be denied a second-leg goal, pledged that Barcelona take another run at the Champions League title next season. But he ended that message with a rallying cry ahead of Madrids visit. Sunday is another final and we have to stick together. Go Bara! Yamal wrote after the game. The wear and tear of the season has taken its toll and left several players, especially in defense, on the injured list. Madrid will be without its entire first-choice backline of Antonio Rudiger, Eder Milito, Dani Carvajal and Ferland Mendy. Midfielder Eduardo Camavinga, who moonlights as a left back, is also out. That means youth player Ral Asenscio and midfielder Aurlien Tchouamni will likely anchor Madrids defense with Lucas Vzquez and Fran Garca as full backs. Barcelona is hoping left back Alejandro Balde will recover from a left-thigh injury that ruled him out of the series against Inter. Right back Jules Kound, who netted the winner in the Copa del Rey final, has been ruled out by a left-thigh injury. Ronald Arajo, or perhaps ric Garca, will take his place and face off against Madrids Vincius Jnior. Flick will have to decide if Robert Lewandowski or Ferran Torres starts at striker. Lewandowski missed several matches before he came on as a late substitute against Inter this week but was unable to prove effective. Watch out for the midfield battle between Barcelonas Pedri Gonzlez and Madrids Jude Bellingham. The playmakers are critical to directing their teams attacks. All three prior clasicos have been high scoring  at least for Barcelona with 12 total goals to Madrids four, so expect more goals against the depleted defenses at the Olympic Stadium. Led by Raphinha, Yamal and Lewandowski, Barcelona has a league-high 91 goals, compared to Madrids 69. Both sides have conceded 33 goals this campaign. Lewandowski leads the league with 25 goals. Madrids Kylian Mbapp is right behind with 24. But while Yamal and Raphinha are having breakout seasons, Vincius and Rodrigo have been inconsistent. With Barcelona ruling the statistics and recent meetings, Madrid will have to capitalize on its extra days of rest and hope that Barcelonas morale was damaged by Inter. The vibe in Spain is that Sundays game will likely be the last big contest for Carlo Ancelotti as the Madrid coach. He is under contract through the next campaign but is widely expected to leave the club after a rough season in which the team played worse despite adding Mbapp to its squad. Brazil has been courting Ancelotti for over a year and it appears talks are still ongoing with the veteran manager. Ancelotti has repeatedly deflected questions regarding his future by saying he will announce his plans when the season ends. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-real-madrid-clasico-laliga-56dd70f110951a72a5f5b30e05a98a11,sports
"New father Max Verstappen wins pole in Miami, his third through six F1 races this season","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Max Verstappen celebrated the birth of his first child with a pole-winning run at the Miami Grand Prix. The four-time defending Formula 1 champion edged Lando Norris of McLaren by .065 seconds to take the top starting spot for Sundays race. It was a rebound for Verstappen, who was penalized earlier Saturday in the sprint race and finished 17th. Its been a great qualifying, it worked out well and Im very happy to be on pole, Verstappen said of his 43rd career pole. It is his third pole through six races this season and second consecutive. It wasnt the result Norris hoped for from F1s newest father. Theres a myth that having children can slow drivers because they suddenly become a bit more conservative. Verstappen and his partner, Kelly Piquet, announced the birth of a baby girl on Friday. Nod to Max, especially being a dad now, Norris said. I was hoping it was going to slow him down a little bit, but it clearly didnt. Verstappen agreed. Clearly it didnt make me slower, being a dad. We can throw that out the window for people mentioning it, he said. And although he didnt reveal when Lily was born, he indicated the reason he skipped Thursday activities in Miami was to spend a few days at home to make sure everything is OK. He also said the myth that parenthood can change a drivers style is ridiculous. I dont really listen to these kinds of silly things, you know, Verstappen said. I just do my thing. There are enough racing drivers in the past that they became world champion after having kids. I dont even know where that (myth) comes from. 
        
     Norris is both the defending race winner  his Miami victory last year was the first of his F1 career and ended Verstappens two-year winning streak at Hard Rock Stadium  and the winner of Saturdays sprint race. Kimi Antonelli, who at 18 years old became F1s youngest pole winner in history when he started first in Saturdays sprint race, qualified third for Mercedes. It is the first time he qualified higher than teammate George Russell, who was fifth behind current F1 points leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren. Williams qualified sixth and seventh with Carlos Sainz Jr. and Alex Albon, while Charles Leclerc rebounded from crashing before the sprint race started to qualify eighth. He did not compete in the sprint race as his team worked to repair his Ferrari in time for qualifying. Esteban Ocon qualified ninth for Haas and Yuki Tsunoda was 10th to give Red Bull both its cars in points-paying position. Lewis Hamilton failed to carry momentum from his third-place finish in the sprint race held four hours before qualifying as the Ferrari driver was eliminated in the second round. His 12th-place effort was his lowest qualifying run since joining his new team. I dont feel in my heart that Im  I mean, as I said, Im trying everything, were trying everything, I mean like the smallest, the smallest (margin) of time today I was out, Hamilton said. It doesnt make a huge difference, but the fact is, you know, we are trying. It rained early Saturday  hard enough to delay the sprint race  and the forecast calls for more weather issues on Sunday. The uncertainty on if it will be a wet or dry race has made it impossible for drivers to predict how the event will unfold.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-qualifying-verstappen-cd4de7490b53f98f70abd505d7a21ded,sports
"Much improved Haas Racing ready for challenge at Miami Grand Prix, its first home race of season","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Oliver Bearman considers the Miami Grand Prix a highlight on the F1 calendar for many reasons: The sunny South Florida weather. The fanfare. Its the first of three United States races for his American-led Haas Formula 1 team. But Bearman, Haas 19-year-old rookie who will be racing at the Miami International Autodrome for the first time on Sunday, acknowledged that it will be a challenge for his team. I expect a difficult weekend, Bearman said, considering the circumstances, particularly that I havent been here and its a Sprint weekend. But I also had that in Brazil last year. I also had that in China this year. And I wouldnt say those are particularly simple shots either. I dont really know how its going to go, but I expect that if I have a good feeling with the car, I hope to be able to get as much as I can out of it. The Miami Grand Prix is the first opportunity of the season for Haas  the only American-owned team in F1  to compete in front of its home fans, but the weekend got off to an uneven start. Bearman, in his first ever action at the track, caused an early end to Fridays practice with a crash, and his teammate, Esteban Ocon, was given a warning for impeding McLarens Lando Norris during the session.  In Saturdays Sprint race in Miami, Bearman started at the back of the grid but zipped through the field for what would have been an eighth-place finish and a point for Haas, but he was hit with a five-second penalty after the race for an unsafe release and stripped of the point. That was followed by a disappointing showing in qualifying later that evening, where the British driver again finished last in the field.  
        
     I dont know (what happened), Bearman said afterward. Just didnt have the feeling. Too messy of a lap. ... It was a messy session overall. Still, Haas will have a good chance at scoring points on Sunday. Ocon qualified ninth in his first top-10 qualifier since joining Haas this season. He said it was his best qualifying session of the year, but the team still has work to do after Bearmans surprising outing. This is what we need to work on, our consistency, Ocon said. The window of our car is really, really small. And even though you try and put the cars together in the same setup, we still see big differences in those cars. We need to work on that. Mostly inconsistent since its debut season in 2016, Haas improved its on-track performance the past year under Ayao Komatsu, who replaced longtime team principal Guenther Steiner for a change of direction after several dismal seasons. Haas finished seventh in the constructor standings in 2024 with 58 points, its best result since finishing fifth with 98 points behind drivers Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen in 2018, and up from a last-place finish in 2023. Haas still has never won an F1 race or scored a podium finish, but there is excitement about its trajectory behind the new lineup of Bearman, the prodigy who raced as a substitute for Ferrari last year before joining Haas as a fulltime driver, and Ocon, winner of the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix with Alpine and the only Grand Prix winner to race for Haas. Esteban and Ollie have been instrumental in providing direction and working with the team every day, Komatsu said, not to mention some of the incredible race drives theyve produced already. In a busy start to the 2025 season with five races in six weeks, Haas has placed in the top eight in three races and is currently sixth in standings with 20 points. Bearman has accounted for 13 points. He and Ocon jointly accumulated 14 points at the Chinese Grand Prix in late March, when disqualifications boosted Ocon from his seventh-place finish to fifth and Bearman from 10th to eighth.  Bearman has already established himself as a solid points scorer for Haas as the team continues its climb. His season debut at the Australian Grand Prix was spoiled by a crash, but the British driver grabbed points in three straight races after that. Hes a super quick driver, Ocon said of his teammate. Super talented, very professional, very detailed on the car set up. I think thats straight away the thing I saw (at first). Technically, hes above any rookies that Ive seen in the past. Hes much more prepared than I was when I arrived in F1. Ocon has taken points finishes in all three of his races in Miami, with his best coming at the inaugural race in 2022 when finished eighth. Sunday will be his first Miami race with Haas. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-grand-prix-haas-bearman-ocon-657972190743453121683e349ff6c78d,sports
"Ryder Cup officials will give away 3,000 tickets to unsuspecting golf fans","Thousands of golf fans in the New York area could be in for a big surprise over the next five months: The PGA of America is giving away free tickets to the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black. In a giveaway being called, The Peoples Perk, the PGA of America will be giving away tickets randomly to New York residents  no notice when or where  who are at Bethpage Black and several other public golf courses on Long Island and the New York City metro area. The Metropolitan PGA Section will help choose the public courses, and the PGA of America then will conduct randomly selected visits to distribute the tickets. There also will be a series of special visits to give Ryder Cup tickets to area first responders and community groups. In both cases, the giveaways will feature PGA of America leaders and special Ryder Cup guests. The Ryder Cup is Sept. 28-30 on the notorious Black course at Bethpage State Park, which has hosted two U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. The first U.S. Open at a true public course was at Bethpage Black in 2002 and was referred to as The Peoples Open. The Ryder Cup is one of the toughest tickets in golf next to the Masters. The ticket price for competition days (which includes food and nonalcoholic drinks) was $750 for the 2025 matches, more than double what it was at Whistling Straits in 2021, the last time the Ryder Cup was held in the United States. More than 500,000 people registered to buy tickets. They went on sale Nov. 13 and tickets for match days (Friday through Sunday) sold out in a matter of hours. 
        
     The random giveaway is 500 tickets a day from Tuesday through Sunday. Each person chosen will get vouchers for two tickets. Anyone getting a free ticket on the Tuesday-Thursday practice days can use the junior admission policy in which kids 15 or under get in for free with a ticketed adult. Don Rea Jr., the president of the PGA of America, said The Peoples Perk is a special way for us to celebrate the unparalleled dedication and enthusiasm of the New York golf community by providing them with a memorable experience at the 2025 Ryder Cup. The PGA of America is proud to share the excitement of golfs greatest team event with our host community, Rea said. We cannot wait to welcome the lucky ticket recipients this September as we all rally behind Captain Keegan Bradley and the United States team. The Europeans won two years ago at Marco Simone in Italy, and they have won eight of the last 11 times in the Ryder Cup. Their last win on U.S. soil was in 2012 at Medinah. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/ryder-cup-free-tickets-bethpage-black-dcb4189443e8a40d27b18828275c9805,sports
Washington rookie Georgia Amoore injures the ACL in her right knee during practice,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Washington Mystics rookie Georgia Amoore injured the ACL in her right knee at practice, the team announced Wednesday. The No. 6 pick in the WNBA draft was injured a day earlier. She averaged 19.6 points for Kentucky last season and was expected to help the franchise rebuild this year along with fellow rookies Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen, who were selected third and fourth earlier this month. Amoore played four years at Virginia Tech before transferring to Kentucky last season, following head coach Kenny Brooks. The 5-foot-6 guard will examine treatment and rehabilitation options, according to the franchise. Amoore, who had her draft night outfit styled by Russell Westbrook, became the highest player drafted from Australia since Liz Cambage went second to the Tulsa Shock in 2011. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/amoore-mystics-acl-5a866b1cf7723385cf84a5ea161ecec0,sports
"With WNBA camps open, eyes already turning to 2026 free agency with so many players possibly moving","NEW YORK (AP)  WNBA training camps just opened and there already are so many eyes on the 2026 season when more than 100 players will be free agents. Nearly all of the leagues top players could be on the move, including 20 of last seasons All-Stars. Its a fact that the majority of veterans will be unrestricted free agents after this season based on current contracts. Its unclear if that will equate to a ton of player movement, Atlanta Dream general manager Dan Padover said. But everything is set up that it could be the most player movement in WNBA history. I think every franchise is looking at it differently. Our most important priority is taking care of our Dream players in 2025 and beyond. Though teams and players say the focus now is winning a championship in 2025, the uncertainty of what beyond looks like is keeping front office staff around the league up at night. Everything can change. Its kind of fascinating. we wont really know what the gameboard looks like until we get the new CBA, ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said. Any team could theoretically become a super team. It could be Golden State, it could Toronto or Portland in their first year. It could completely change the power dynamic as we see it. Aja Wilson and Breanna Stewart are among the star-studded group on one-year contracts knowing that a new collective bargaining agreement will hopefully be in place next season that is expected to monumentally increase salaries. The WNBA begins an 11-year $2.2 billion media rights deal in 2026 which is where the shift will come from. 
        
     Most of the players who wont be free agents are the ones on rookie contracts  including Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The pair, who were rookies last season, earn about $75,000 in base pay. Currently WNBA players can have a maximum base salary of $250,000. While there hasnt been a media rights deal like this in the WNBAs 28-year history, when the NBA had an exponential increase in its TV deal in 2016, that leagues salary cap increased about 35%. Its not just increased salaries, however, that will entice free agents to move. Many of the players who changed teams this offseason cited practice facilities as a factor in choosing where theyll go. Currently Phoenix, Las Vegas, Golden State and Seattle have dedicated practice facilities for their WNBA teams while Minnesota and Washington share their facilities with NBA franchises. New York, Dallas, Chicago and Indiana have ones in the works. I think facilities are a huge piece of it, Lobo said. You heard how much players talked about that with Vegas a few years ago. Players were posting about Phoenixs new facility at All-Star last year. Its also about the culture around a franchise that makes it inviting to players. Atlanta made a splash in free agency this winter, signing Brittney Griner and Brionna Jones. Padover hopes to keep them beyond this season. Both will be free agents again next year. Free agency has never lined up like this before for the league. While New York, Las Vegas, Minnesota and Indiana are considered the top teams heading into this season, that could all be different next year.  ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-free-agency-2026-aa8db44f7cbb3b6db7cc194535b89d93,sports
Phoenix Mercury are heading into new era without Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner,"PHOENIX (AP)  The Phoenix Mercury will open their first season in 21 years without Diana Taurasi. Shes busy at home enjoying the first few months of retirement. Theres also no Brittney Griner for the first time since 2012. The game-changing center is now wearing an Atlanta Dream uniform. Two of the greatest players of their generation are gone, sending the Mercury into an uncharted new era. I came here with a lot of new faces, a lot of hungry people, new Mercury forward Alyssa Thomas said Wednesday during the teams media day. Its just going to be fun to be part of an organization thats known for winning has multiple championships and, just overall, has been the top of this thing for a long time. The Mercury had a good run with Taurasi and Griner. Taurasi staked her claim as one of the greatest players in womens basketball history since the Mercury selected her with the No. 1 overall pick of the 2004 WNBA draft. In the 20 years that followed, she racked up six Olympic gold medals, three league championships and numerous records before calling it a career earlier this year. The 6-foot-9 Griner was a force during her 11-year stay in the desert, throwing down dunks and swatting shots like no other player while helping the Mercury win their most recent championship, in 2014. She opted to test free agency and signed a one-year contract with the Dream, hoping to set herself up for a bigger contract when the leagues new collective bargaining deal is in place next year. Those are two big holes to fill, but general manager Nick URen already had the wheels in motion to start the Mercurys new era. 
        
     Phoenix first acquired Thomas in a trade with Connecticut, adding a veteran do-everything forward whos the WNBAs career leader with 15 triple-doubles. The 6-2 forward played her entire 11-year career with the Sun, leading them to the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022, and earned a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer. With Taurasis retirement looming, Phoenix pulled off a three-way trade that brought Sabally to the desert. The 6-4 forward was an All-WNBA first-teamer in 2023, then averaged 17.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.0 assists in a 2024 season limited to 15 games because of a shoulder injury. Pushing through uncomfortable times really makes us stronger and we are the pros at pushing through adversity, Sabally said. I think Ive been through a lot in my life, but it just really makes you appreciate times like this even more. Rounding out Phoenixs new Big Three is Kahleah Copper, a dynamic scorer and leader. The 6-1 small forward was a three-time All-Star with Chicago before being traded to Phoenix, where she had a massive impact in just one season. Copper was the WNBAs third-leading scorer at 21.1 points per game last season and became a leader on a team that already had two of the games best players. She also has a WNBA title under her belt, helping the Sky beat the Mercury in the 2021 finals. Now that Taurasi and Griner are gone, Copper fully will take the reins as the teams leader, pushing teammates new and old to continue the Mercurys long history of winning. I think youre really going to see her kind of like spread her wings and take pride, second-year Mercury coach Nate Tibbetts said. Youve seen it this whole offseason, adding the free agents, and shes really kind of bought into what were about. The Mercury had no choice but to take a new direction with Taurasi and Griner gone. Theyre hoping the new core can lead the franchise along the same winning direction. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/phoenix-mercury-wnba-5750713e32e8fe5247f5d4fb359d6f85,sports
Caitlin Clarks return to Iowa for Fever preseason game commands average paid ticket price of $440,"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP)  Caitlin Clark fans will have to pay a premium on the secondary market if they want to be at Carver-Hawkeye Arena for Sundays matchup between the WNBAs Indiana Fever and the Brazilian national team. The average paid price of $440 per ticket on the secondary market as of Wednesday has made it the most in-demand event involving Clark, according to ticketing technology company Victory Live, which analyzes sales across the secondary market. Clark will be playing on the court where she rose to stardom with the Iowa Hawkeyes. The all-time leading scorer in Division I history is from West Des Moines and played for the Hawkeyes from 2020-24. She was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft and the leagues rookie of the year. Asking prices on the secondary market Wednesday for the preseason game ranged from $146 to $2,368. The previous high average paid price for a Clark game was $411. That was March 3, 2024, when she scored 35 points against Ohio State to pass Pete Maravich as the Division I career scoring leader. Victory Live also reported that the average paid price for a Fever away game in the 2025 season was $272, up from $171 in 2024.

Former NFL coach Jon Gruden taking on ownership-advisory role with Nashvilles arena football team,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  Jon Gruden is getting back into professional football. The former NFL coach is joining the Nashville Kats of the Arena Football One league as both a part-owner and what the club called consulting and advisory roles in all aspects of the teams football and business operations. Gruden, 61, hasnt been involved in a U.S. professional team in an official capacity since resigning as head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders midway through the 2021 season over emails he sent before being hired that included racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments. Gruden did some consulting with the New Orleans Saints in 2023 but did not officially join the staff. The Super Bowl-winning coach later filed a lawsuit against the NFL, claiming contract interference and conspiracy. A three-justice panel of the Nevada Supreme Court sided 2-1 with the NFL last year, ruling the league could force the civil case out of state court and into private arbitration that might be overseen by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Gruden appealed the decision, and the lawsuit will not be reviewed by the full seven-person court. The Gruden family has deep ties to the AFL. Jons younger brother, Jay, won four league titles as a player and two more as a coach in the 1990s and early 2000s before eventually moving on to a coaching career in the NFL. The Nashville Kats, who announced Grudens partnership on Monday, have an ownership group that includes former Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher, who also serves as the Kats president. 
        
     I have been a fan of indoor football for a long time and jumped at the opportunity to be involved with Jeff and the Nashville Kats as part of the ownership group, Gruden said. I have so much respect for what Jeff has done over his career and continues to do with the Nashville Kats and as commissioner of AF1. Im excited to be part of the team. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/john-gruden-arena-football-d402d71fa645a75bf972cd7a2d6ae5ad,sports
Rams sign former Eagles kick returner Britain Covey to a 1-year deal,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Kick returner and receiver Britain Covey agreed to a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Rams on Monday. Covey spent the past three seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, who signed him as an undrafted free agent out of Utah. Covey returned two punts for the Eagles in the Super Bowl as a rookie in February 2023, and he led the NFL in punt return yardage during the 2023 season after being released and fighting his way back onto the roster from the Eagles practice squad. He missed all but five games last season because of a shoulder injury that was followed by a neck injury. He went on injured reserve in late December, sidelining him for Philadelphias Super Bowl championship run. Covey averaged 11.3 yards per punt return over the past three seasons, the fourth-highest mark in the NFL during that stretch. He also had 11 receptions for 76 yards while playing in 38 games during his Eagles tenure. Receiver Xavier Smith was the Rams primary punt returner last season, returning 16 punts for 149 yards. Los Angeles returned just 18 punts last season, the fewest in the NFL, while its 161 yards of punt returns were the third fewest. Covey was a prolific receiver and one of the nations top kick returners during his five collegiate seasons with the Utes. He made a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the Rose Bowl against Ohio State. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/rams-britain-covey-e8e808b5a41d079795e311e70e1720a3,sports
Ravens release Justin Tucker after accusations by massage therapists of inappropriate behavior,"The Baltimore Ravens are describing it as a football decision, and it came before the NFL completed its investigation into Justin Tucker. Whatever the underlying reasons, the team is moving on from its star kicker. The Ravens announced Monday theyve decided to release Tucker, months after reports that he was accused of inappropriate sexual behavior by massage therapists. A five-time All-Pro, the 35-year-old Tucker has played his entire 13-year career with Baltimore. Hes considered one of the best kickers in NFL history, although 2024 was his worst season. The Baltimore Banner has reported that over a dozen massage therapists have accused Tucker of inappropriate sexual behavior. The NFL said it would investigate, and the Ravens drafted kicker Tyler Loop late last month. Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances, Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement issued by the club. Considering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker. That comment was consistent with what coach John Harbaugh said at rookie camp Sunday, when he indicated a decision on Tucker might come before the NFL completed its investigation. Every decision we make has to be based on football, Harbaugh said. Youve got a rookie kicker in here. You took him in the sixth round, early in the sixth round. Hes a talented guy. Just from a football standpoint  salary cap, all the different things that you just take into consideration  whatever we decide to do over the next few weeks will be based on football. 
        
     Tucker has maintained he did not act inappropriately while receiving professional treatment. A message seeking comment was left with his publicist Monday. Tucker holds the record for the longest kick in NFL history at 66 yards, and his success rate of 89.1% on field goals is the best all-time among players with at least 100 attempts. He was the last remaining player on the Ravens from their most recent Super Bowl title, which occurred when he was a rookie. In 2022, he agreed to a four-year contract extension through the 2027 season. That deal included $17.5 million guaranteed. Tucker missed a career-high eight field goal attempts last season, although he rebounded a bit down the stretch. Then came the Banners report in January that left his future in doubt. Justin created many significant and unforgettable moments in Ravens history, DeCosta said. His reliability, focus, drive, resilience and extraordinary talent made him one of the leagues best kickers for over a decade. We are grateful for Justins many contributions while playing for the Ravens. We sincerely wish him and his family the very best in this next chapter of their lives. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/ravens-justin-tucker-massage-therapists-1a29a2b49d3563bf4effad67969ed6f9,sports
Oilers rally for NHL-record fifth straight time to beat Golden Knights 4-2 in Game 1,"LAS VEGAS (AP)  One thing is becoming clear during this years NHL playoffs: Dont count out the Edmonton Oilers. They rallied from a 2-0 series deficit to oust Los Angeles in six games in the first round. Then they opened the second round Tuesday night by setting a league record with their fifth consecutive playoff comeback victory in a single postseason. Zach Hyman scored from just above the right circle with 3:02 left to put Edmonton ahead for good in its 4-2 victory over Vegas Golden Knights after falling behind 2-0. Thats part of having a mature, older group, Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. Players have seen a lot, a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. In the playoffs, things fluctuate. Theres a lot of things that can stress out the team. No matter what happens, I think we handled it really well tonight. Vegas, which had just seven shots on goal over the final two periods, lost a playoff game in regulation after leading by at least two goals for the first time. The Golden Knights are 47-4 overall in the postseason with that kind of lead. Game 2 is Thursday night in Las Vegas. Well go over it and get ready for Thursday nights game, said Mark Stone, who scored both Vegas goals. Its going to be a big one for us. Leon Draisaitl had a goal and an assist for the Oilers, and Corey Perry and Connor Brown scored the other goals. Evan Bouchard and Connor McDavid each had two assists. McDavid now has four consecutive postseasons with at least 10 assists for fourth-best in league history. Calvin Pickard was barely tested after the first period and finished with 15 shots. 
        
     We have experience to win games in a lot of different ways, a lot of untraditional ways, Hyman said. Any time you get a win, its a big day. Weve got to take what we did in the second and third and do in the first. Stone tied Jonathan Marchessaults franchise record with 36 goals for his Vegas career. He also extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. Adin Hill made 24 saves. Both star-studded top lines delivered in the first period, with Stone scoring twice, the first on a double-minor power play. Edmontons top unit cut the deficit in half with 3:34 left when Perry deked Hill for an open net with McDavid and Draisaitl getting assists on the play. Neither team scored in the second period even though the Oilers outshot Vegas 12-1. The Golden Knights had never been held to fewer than two shots on goal in a regulation playoff period. Edmonton didnt waste a chance early in the third, tying the score 57 seconds in when Draisaitl backhanded a shot off the boards and off Hill. Hyman, who earlier in the shift took a stick to the face from Kaedan Korczak, broke the tie in the closing minutes, and Brown sealed the win 1:16 later. Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo did not play because of an illness, allowing Korczak to make his first career postseason start. Vegas also was without Pavel Dorofeyev, who led the team with 35 goals this season, for the second game in a row because of an undisclosed injury. Coach Bruce Cassidy has descibed him as day to day. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/oilers-golden-knights-score-nhl-playoffs-9741061ec6e71f1be1574c1b1b26d1d4,sports
Utah Mammoth is the permanent name of the NHL team in Salt Lake City,"After a mammoth undertaking of buying an NHL team, moving players, coaches and a full staff more than 600 miles and getting it all together in a matter of months before the puck dropped on a new season, it is perhaps a fitting identity that owners Ryan and Ashley Smith chose after rounds and rounds of fan voting. They unveiled Utah Mammoth as the franchises permanent, full-time name Wednesday, with a profiled logo of the ice age creature featuring nods to the shape of the state, its mountain range and the same light blue, black and white color scheme that quickly became synonymous with the team in its first season in Salt Lake City. Our fans made it very easy for us, Ryan Smith said at a news conference at Delta Center celebrating the branding efforts competition after more than 850,000 votes were cast over the past 13 months. Every single night we were doing the voting, Mammoth just started running away with it. ... And for us, it was like, Thats it. Mammoth replaces the 2024-25 placeholder name Utah Hockey Club, which was also one of the three finalists. Yeti was taken out of consideration when the cooler company bearing that name could not come to a copyright agreement with Utah ownership, and Wasatch  a reference to the states mountain range  was quickly replaced as an option by Outlaws. The Mammoth are maintaining the road jerseys with UTAH diagonally down the front. The logo, along with mountains and a hidden M and more of what Smith called Easter eggs, also has a curved tusk that forms a U. 
        
     Mammoth fossils have been found throughout Utah, including a complete skeleton in Huntington Canyon in 1988. The team said Tusks Up will be its rallying cry. We uncovered a little bit of the mammoth history in this state, Smith said. It was daunting  of how close and tied and whether it was Lake Bonneville or Fairview, Utah, or Lake Powell and the size of the mammoth and how fast they go, it became like this really cool thing. Utah has an exciting summer ahead holding the fourth pick in the draft, the first phase of arena renovations taking place and more than $20 million in salary cap space for general manager Bill Armstrong to make a splash in free agency and trades. With young talent like captain Clayton Keller, budding star forward Logan Cooley, two-time Stanley Cup champion Mikhail Sergachev and emerging goaltender Karel Vejmelka, the Mammoth could contend for a playoff spot as soon as next season. Sitting next to Commissioner Gary Bettman, Ashley Smith said the goal was to bring him back with more to celebrate. Next time, Stanley Cup, she told Bettman, who responded, It would be my pleasure. Bettman, who turns 73 in July, added, When you win the Stanley Cup, I hope Im still doing this to present it. Hockey in Utah has already been a win after Smith Entertainment Group bought the team previously known as the Arizona Coyotes from former owner Alex Meruelo and moved it to Salt Lake City. The Coyotes played in the Phoenix area since 1996 after moving there from Winnipeg, where the team was the original Jets. The first year has been almost mind-blowing in terms of how successful Utah and you and everybody in SEG has been, Bettman said. This has been the ultimate team effort for the ultimate team sport. And while you may be thrilled to have us, were thrilled to be part of Utah and are grateful. The rollout of Mammoth even included a fan holding a Stanley cup  lower-case C  Yeti coolers biggest competition in that market. In the midst of a formative day in the organizations history, Ryan Smith almost seemed to want to manifest another one sometime in the future, not for a mug but the sports most hallowed trophy.

Buffalo Sabres hire former NHLer Eric Staal as special assistant to general manager Kevyn Adams,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)  Former NHL forward Eric Staal is rejoining the Buffalo Sabres, this time in a front-office role as special assistant to general manager Kevyn Adams, the team announced Wednesday. Staal will be involved in all aspects of the hockey department in the newly created role, which comes after Sabres executives completed end-of-season meetings with owner Terry Pegula. The 40-year-old, who retired after 18 NHL seasons two years ago, joins a front office that features three assistant GMs in Jason Karmanos, Mark Jakubowski and Jerry Forton. Staal is reunited with Adams, who were teammates on the 2006 Carolina Hurricanes Stanley Cup-winning team. And he played 32 games for the Sabres in 2021 before being traded to Montreal. As I looked for ways to enhance our existing staff, I wanted to add somebody to our group that has a fresh perspective and the direct experience of winning at all levels of hockey, Adams said of Staal, who also won an Olympic gold medal in 2010 and world championship in 2007 representing Canada. He has done it all as a player and I know his experience and knowledge will be invaluable to our team as we look to take the next step. Staals hiring comes as Adams faces increasing criticism over his five-year tenure as GM, in which the Sabres extended their NHL-record playoff drought to 14 seasons. One of four players to have his number retired by the Hurricanes, Staal spent 12 seasons playing for Carolina in a career that also included stops with the New York Rangers, Minnesota and Florida. Throughout my career I was fortunate to be on so many successful teams and I hope I can lean on some of those experiences to help the organization moving forward, Staal said. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/sabres-eric-staal-b1b110126c5c7d5fd0e99b4c4a84b7ca,sports
Maple Leafs goaltender Joseph Woll gets chance against Panthers amid concerns about Stolarz,"TORONTO (AP)  Joseph Woll is back under the postseason spotlight, a place the Toronto Maple Leafs goalie has thrived in the past. Woll was given the start for Game 2 of the teams second-round Stanley Cup playoff series against Florida on Wednesday night and finished with 25 saves in the Maple Leafs 4-3 win for a 2-0 series lead.  The 26-year-old Woll entered the opener midway through the second period after starter Anthony Stolarz took an elbow to the head from former teammate Sam Bennett and wound up at the hospital. On Wednesday, Woll made his first start since April 17. Its been something Ive had to focus on and come up with a plan to stay ready, Woll said. Its a different challenge than playing every night, but a challenge nonetheless. Woll, who entered with a .950 save percentage in his four previous playoff starts, also performed well when called upon in both the 2023 and 2024 postseasons because of injury. Calm and cool, Maple Leafs coach Craig Berube said. On his toes and fighting through traffic. Very impressed. Veteran Matt Murray, who spent most of this season in the American Hockey League, served as Wolls backup over Dennis Hildeby. The rookie was on the bench in the third period of Game 1. Experience, I think, more than anything, Berube said of turning to Murray, a two-time Cup winner with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Hes been there, done it. 
        
     The Maple Leafs have not disclosed details of Stolarzs injury, though Berube said the 31-year-old is recovering and doing well.  Chris Nowinski, chief executive officer of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, said he was concerned with how the situation was handled at Scotiabank Arena. Stolarz was hit in the head twice where he exhibited possible signs of concussion and neither time was he removed and assessed, Nowinski told the Canadian Press. I cant remember the last time I saw a player vomiting on the ice, but it makes you very concerned about what was happening in his brain and whether (he) not only had a concussion, but a possible brain bleed. Stolarzs mask came off in the first period of Torontos 5-4 victory when he stopped a shot by Sam Reinhart. Stolarz appeared to shake his head before putting the mask back on and resuming play. In the second period, he was elbowed in the head as Bennett skated through the crease. Stolarz immediately grabbed his head as he fell to the ice. He later leaned over the boards and vomited into a bucket. He left the game midway through the period and was replaced by Woll. According to the NHL/NHLPAs concussion protocol, the identification and removal of a player is a club-level responsibility. The actual diagnosis and whether to play is up to the team doctor. League spotters also observe players behavior during games to help. A Maple Leafs team spokesman said spotters were not involved in Stolarzs departure from the game.  Nowinski said he was concerned about the head shake by Stolarz; he said research has shown many athletes who do that end up having a concussion. The fact that he was left out there (to) vomit in front of the entire world shows that the NHL was not conservative enough in their decision of how to execute their protocol, he told CP. Woll was solid off the bench and held off the Panthers late, stopping 17 of 20 shots as Florida rallied after trailing 4-1 through 40 minutes. The Panthers got defenseman Aaron Ekblad back after he served a two-game suspension for a head shot on Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brandon Hagel in the first round. I was aiming for his chest and I caught him in the chin, Ekblad said in his first comments since the incident that knocked Hagel out of the series. Im never out to hurt anybody on the ice. Its unfortunate the way that the outcome happened. The 29-year-old Ekblad was selected No. 1 overall at the 2014 draft had recently returned after getting suspended 20 games for violating league policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Ekblad returned for Game 3 of the Tampa series before the Hagel incident in Game 4. Whirlwind of a season, he said. Its not the way I scripted it, but were here now. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/toronto-maple-leafs-goalie-joseph-woll-b400590cd9c7aac63056ce324bbe41e4,sports
Warriors will rely on the Jimmy-Buddy show to help stay afloat vs. Wolves with Curry out,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  With the superhero of the Golden State Warriors out for the rest of the game, the sidekicks stepped up.  Jimmy Butler and Buddy Hield have become quite the sideshow, on and off the court. When Stephen Curry went down with a strained left hamstring early in the opener of this second-round series against Minnesota, Butler and Hield delivered the both-ends-of-the-floor production necessary to fend off the Timberwolves for a 99-88 victory. Im Batman. I saved the day, Hield said. Hes still Robin. Butler was willing to concede that interim role to Hield with Curry out, but not without reminding Hield the Warriors had to burn a timeout in the first minute of the game because the shorts he was wearing didnt match the team uniform. Thats not real Robin and/or Batman like, Butler said, turning to Hield as they shared a table for their joint postgame interview. Butler pitched in 20 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and sound defense. Hield hit five 3-pointers among his 24 points to go with eight rebounds and no turnovers for a team-leading plus-22 rating. Both of them will have to keep that up now that the Warriors have ruled Curry out for at least the next three games. Two of the newest players to the team have also developed a unique odd-couple bond, with Butler constantly needling the softer-spoken Hield with his wry sense of humor. They clearly get on each others nerves at times, to the point of shouting at each other in one of the huddles during a timeout on Tuesday.  
        
     Since Butler arrived in a trade with Miami, the Warriors are 29-11. Hield was acquired from Philadelphia last summer.  They have an incredible relationship. Yall dont get to see everything, but theres times where they really go at it. Thats just the nature of the game we play, teammate Draymond Green said. They have a great dynamic, both of them playing great basketball for us. The Warriors, who were the last team to advance to the second round after finally beating second-seeded Houston in that seven-game series on Sunday, took a much-needed day off on Wednesday. Theyll need to bring their intensity back for Game 2 on Thursday, when the Wolves are bound to be fired up from the way they flailed through Game 1. Coach Chris Finch sounded irritated on Wednesday for a number of reasons, including what he described as football-like contact by the Warriors against Rudy Gobert that went uncalled and prevented the big man from grabbing several rebounds. The Wolves sent in multiple video clips to the league to plead their case.  They look like pulling guards and linemen out there just taking shots at Rudy, Finch said. Warriors center Kevon Looney was one of those guys jockeying for position in the paint with the 7-foot-1 Gobert. Last series, I feel like was way worse than anything I did last game, Looney said, recalling the physical tone of the first round against the Rockets as he smiled. Its the playoffs. Im going to grab and push until they call it. Not to be outdone by Finchs gamesmanship, Warriors coach Steve Kerr offered his own measured take on the officiating. I think they couldve called a foul six, seven straight possessions with them guarding Steph, so Ive got my complaints, too, Kerr said. Trust me, we all do, and this is how it works in the playoffs. The Timberwolves had practice after a sobering film session for admonishment and dissection of the many deficiencies that were on display throughout the previous night. Finch was particularly pointed in his commentary, starting with star Anthony Edwards for his decision-making with the ball and adrift first-half performance. We didnt look at all like ourselves. The game plan discipline was really poor, Finch said. Our resiliency was poor. Physicality was also poor. Edwards had 22 of his 23 points in the second half after missing his first 10 shots from the floor. The fifth-year guard, who moved into second place on the franchises career list for postseason games played behind Kevin Garnett, has never shied from constructive criticism. Were lucky. Our guys will take it, Finch said. If you want the ball in your hands or you want to be in the center of the action or you want to be playing all the minutes, then youre going to be on that film. When/Where to Watch: Game 2, 8:30 p.m. EDT (TNT) Series: Warriors lead 1-0. BetMGM says: Timberwolves by 10.5. What to Know: Including their series-clinching win over the Los Angeles Lakers a week ago, the Wolves have missed 64 of their last 76 attempts from 3-point range over the last two games. Just keep shooting. Thats the name of the game, Edwards said. We cant worry about the last shot. Take the next one and shoot it with confidence. The Warriors had a 51-41 edge in rebounding in Game 1.  ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-timberwolves-curry-edwards-butler-9a918ce85399e09b637e5151bf2cdba9,sports
Knicks take a 2-0 lead over the Celtics after coming from 20 down again to win 91-90,"BOSTON (AP)  For the second straight game, the New York Knicks found themselves in a hole the Boston Celtics have rarely let teams out of this season. The Knicks again found a way  almost the same way, in fact  to pull off the improbable. And now they are two wins away from knocking the defending champions out of the playoffs. Mikal Bridges sealed another 20-point comeback with his second straight game-ending steal and the Knicks stunned the Celtics again Wednesday night, winning 91-90 for a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Just finding ways to win, Bridges said.  Jalen Brunson scored 17 points for New York and made two free throws with 12.7 seconds left for a 91-90 lead. Jayson Tatum then couldnt get to the rim and Bridges moved in to bat the ball away and recover it.  Bridges also scored all of his 14 points in the fourth quarter. Josh Hart had 23 points and Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 21 points and 17 rebounds for the Knicks, who will host Game 3 on Saturday.  Going home we realize the opportunity we have. We just have to stay locked in, Brunson said. Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored 20 points apiece for the Celtics, who were 10 for 40 from 3-point range after going 15 for 60 in Game 1. Tatum was limited to 13 points on 5-for-19 shooting for the Celtics, who went more than eight minutes without a field goal in the fourth quarter. They missed 13 consecutive shots during the stretch. 
        
     Teams that win the first two games of a best-of-seven series on the road win the series 85.7% of the time. The Knicks took the opener when Bridges stole the ball away from Brown with a second left in overtime. Opportunity to show what were made of, Brown said of a Boston team that swept New York 4-0 in the regular season. Weve got to respond. Kristaps Porzingis didnt start after sitting out the second half of Game 1 with an illness. He came off the bench for just the fifth time in his NBA career and finished with eight points and four rebounds in 14 minutes. All eyes were on the Celtics offense after they missed an NBA playoff-record 45 3-pointers in their Game 1 loss. They went 24 for 54 from 2-point range Wednesday.  Despite their shooting struggles, the Celtics found some traction late in the third quarter, using a 16-6 run  keyed by their effort on the defensive end  to turn a 10-point lead into a 73-53 advantage late in the period. It was 84-68 after Payton Pritchards 3-pointer with 8:40 to play but the Celtics wouldnt make another basket until Tatums driving dunk with 18.5 seconds remaining.  New York cut it to 86-82 on a floater by Hart before Towns three-point play cut it to 86-85. Tatum missed a jumper, and Brunson made an 18-footer to put New York in front.  A jumper by Brown rolled off the rim on Bostons next trip up the floor. Brunson then found a lane to the basket and dropped in a layup to make it 89-86.  Tatum connected on a pair of free throws and then got it back following a New York miss that rolled out of bounds with 24.2 seconds left. Trailing 89-88, Tatum pushed the ball in to the front court and drove easily past Mitchell Robinson for a dunk to put the Celtics back in front.  Brunson was fouled and connected on both free throws.  Hart said they are going home knowing they can still play better. I dont even think we know what were capable of, he said.  ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-knicks-celtics-score-da5620e1a2559de5058f2ec5f7835579,sports
Fire alarm causes brief evacuation after Knicks Game 2 win over Celtics,"BOSTON (AP)  A fire alarm was triggered at TD Garden in the aftermath of the New York Knicks 91-90 playoff victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night, causing a brief evacuation. TD Garden officials released a statement late Wednesday saying that an alarm was tripped and that no one was injured. The cause of the alarm is under investigation, the statement said. Alarms began blaring while New Yorks Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart were still at the podium concluding a post game interview. Bostons Jaylen Brown had just completed his interview session in a separate room when officials directed members of the media toward the exits. Due to the evacuation, Jayson Tatums planned interview session was canceled.  New York leads the series 2-0. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/knicks-celtics-fire-alarm-7ea4a8cc3d84282460136479e62a6eb8,sports
"NASCAR championship weekend goes to Homestead in 2026, starting a rotating formula","MIAMI (AP)  NASCAR asked its fans where they would prefer seeing championship weekend held, and the majority of those who responded picked Homestead-Miami Speedway. And NASCAR listened. The 2026 NASCAR season will end in South Florida, with stock car racings championship weekend returning to Homestead-Miami next year. Itll be the first time since 2019 that the title-winners will be crowned there and will start a rotation where NASCAR will move its final weekend around various tracks. How thatll work in 2027 and beyond remains unclear. But in 2026, Homestead is the spot. I like that we move it around, said reigning NASCAR champion Joey Logano, who won the crown last fall at Phoenix  this years title-deciding spot as well  and the first of his three titles at Homestead-Miami in 2018. That was one of the things that I always thought would be a great idea if we were able to pull it off, right? The Super Bowl doesnt stay in the same place every year. Why should our Super Bowl, our championship race, stay in same place every year? NASCAR made the announcement Tuesday, and it was not exactly a stunner. (Im sure everyone was surprised to see this coming, Logano said, smiling.) Its three series  the truck series, the Xfinity Series and the Cup Series  will see their seasons come to a close at Homestead from Nov. 6-8, 2026. It isnt a permanent return, though: NASCAR said that championship weekends are going to be on a rotation to ensure that the seasons exciting conclusion is shared amongst NASCARs marquee venues and key markets. Phoenix will be part of that rotation, somehow, but NASCAR isnt ready to say which other tracks may be involved and when all that will be announced. 
        
     We have a lot of confidence, when we go to Homestead-Miami Speedway, its going to deliver from a racing product perspective, NASCAR executive vice president Ben Kennedy said. Its also going to create a good amount of unpredictability for many of our fans that come to that race or tune in on TV just going to a different championship venue and having it on the line. Were excited to see all that. Part of NASCARs commitment to Homestead-Miami, Kennedy said, includes a capital investment to make sure it is a championship-caliber facility when we show up next year. NASCAR routinely makes tweaks to schedules and now will tinker again with where seasons end, but one non-negotiable appears to be the start of the season: Daytona will remain the first points race for the foreseeable future, Kennedy said. We ran a survey a couple years ago, and it was over 95% of our fan base wants to see their first points race be the Daytona 500, Kennedy said. That was a statistic that was strong enough for us to say were not even going to explore that for now. Homestead-Miami was the championship weekend site from 2002 through 2019. There are three active drivers who were crowned NASCAR champions at Homestead  Kyle Busch in 2015 and 2019, Brad Keselowski in 2012 and Logano in 2018. Logano has also won the title at Phoenix in two of the last three seasons, including last year. And all seven of Jimmie Johnsons NASCAR titles came at Homestead, which has renamed a tunnel in his honor to commemorate those championships. If youre asking drivers, its about the track, right? The environment obviously is really cool. Its different being in Miami. Thats a neat thing, Logano said. But the drivers, what we care about is the racing, right? Can we move around the racetrack, can we do different things, are the tires falling off, is that fun. To us, yeah, thats fun. NASCAR decided after the 2001 season to move its truck and Cup series races to one track, in order to create a season-ending championship celebration. Homestead-Miami was the original site after that decision, and then things moved to Phoenix starting in 2020. Kennedy said racing in early November isnt exactly possible at all of the tracks on the NASCAR schedule, meaning that the series would prefer a warm-weather climate for its finish  something that Phoenix and Homestead-Miami provide. And Homestead-Miamis history isnt lost on NASCAR, either. Homestead has put on some of the most phenomenal finishes, especially when we had the championship there, Kennedy said. But even since then, and weve crowned so many legends and Hall of Famers over the past 15 years when we did have the championship at Homestead-Miami Speedway. So, competition is a part of it, variability, and I think diversity in where youre crowning the champion was another consideration. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-homestead-2026-finale-9f2da920a3ba2947471c03d511dc63fb,sports
Rory McIlroy getting back to normal as defending champ of Truist at the Philadelphia Cricket Club,"FLOURTOWN, Pa. (AP)  Things are getting back to normal for Rory McIlroy, and its anything but routine for this weeks Truist Championship at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the sixth of eight signature events on the PGA Tour this season. McIlroy is playing in an individual tournament for the first time since winning the Masters and becoming the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam. He teamed with fellow Irishman Shane Lowry at last months Zurich Classic and the pair finished 12th. Now, hes returning to action after a short break. Im excited to get back to being a golfer, McIlroy said. Its nice to get back into the routine again and get back to what I know how to do. McIlroy is the defending champion and a four-time winner of this event. The 36-year-old said celebrating his Masters victory is behind him and hes looking forward to the next few months. First, his attention is on the Truist that begins Thursday. A winner of the event in 2010, 2015, 2021 and 2024, McIlroy doesnt have the luxury of trying to go back-to-back on the same course. The event was moved to Philly Cricket this year while the tournaments usual home, Quail Hollow in North Carolina, prepares to host next weeks PGA Championship. The last two times Ive won the Truist Championship, I havent been able to defend on the same golf course the next year, McIlroy said. We won in 21 and then played Potomac, and won last year and then were here. 
        
     So it doesnt quite feel like a defense. This weeks field in the no-cut event will be tested by Philly Crickets Wissahickon Course for the first time. The layout in the golf-rich Philadelphia suburbs plays just over 7,100 yards and a par 70. The oldest country club in the U.S., founded in 1854, the layout was designed by club member A.W. Tillinghast and opened in 1922. It underwent restoration just over a decade ago and has hosted a number of notable events, including last years USGA Amateur Four-Ball Championship and the 2016 Constellation Senior Players Championship. The signature event is missing world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who won for the first time in 2025 last week at his hometown Byron Nelson, where he matched the PGA Tours 72-hole scoring record. Third-ranked Xander Schauffele returns to competition for the first time since a tie for 18th place at the RBC Heritage in April and will defend his PGA Championship title next week. Justin Thomas is coming off a victory at the RBC Heritage and, at No. 5, has his highest ranking since holding the same spot in 2022. McIlroy and others have described the Wissahickon layout as old school and seemed excited to have the event staged at the venerable layout. The players will face large landing areas, not-so-penal rough and tricky greens. Expectations of how the course holds up against todays pros drew varied responses. Its very similar to a lot of these old school courses that have been renovated over the past few years. A lot of trees have been taken out. The green complexes are, for me, the interesting thing about the golf course, McIlroy said.  A little simple off the tee ... but making sure with the second shots that youre below the hole and trying to get to learn the greens a little bit more. Thomas is a fan of Philly Cricket and was hopeful that an early forecast of inclement weather on Thursday and Friday doesnt diminish the courses defenses against the top-flight field. I love these kinds of designs, he said. Theyre fun. ... Theyre very specific in terms of what the conditions give us. ... It is meant to play firm and fast, especially the greens. Schauffele expects a low score to win. For some reason, whenever courses seem to be really, really hard, guys seem to shoot low, he said. I think this course is kind of the middle of the road in terms of difficulty. I think theres some hard holes on there and some holes that are really gettable. The Truist Championship is a one-off stop for the PGA Tour in the Philadelphia area, yet is leaving a lasting mark. Truist earlier this week announced a $750,000 donation to the Cobbs Creek Foundation in support of the continued revitalization of the late Charlie Siffords home course and one of the nations first inclusive golf facilities. Cobbs Creek opened in 1916 and is one of eight golf courses in the National Black Golf Hall of Fame. The restoration includes a Tiger Woods foundation TGR Learning Lab and Jordan Spieths foundation contributed $250,000 that funded the construction of a practice putting green. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-truist-mcilroy-339cf7cf927cbbcb12846337593dd445,sports
"Go Birds and birdies: Retired Eagles great Jason Kelce takes his swings, advice at PGA Tour pro-am","FLOURTOWN, Pa. (AP)  Jason Kelce flubbed his pitch shot from the thick rough next to a green on the ninth hole  on a round that featured more Go Birds chants than birdies  and muttered a common refrain from most weekend golf warriors: Hey, thats why Im an amateur, Kelce said. Kelce could have crowd-sourced some golf tips from the scores of fans that followed him hole after humbling hole on Wednesday during a rare PGA Tour stop in the Philadelphia area. The retired Philadelphia Eagles center has tried in his first year of retirement to up his golf game and lower his score, taking the task of trying to get it in the hole as seriously as he did opening them as he once did on the offensive line. Kelce posted a video of his swing on Reddit this week and asked readers  anyone from pros to casual players  for advice on how to get better. Jason Kelce here. Now that Ive hung up the cleats, Im trying to get serious about my golf game, he wrote. Ive uploaded 6 different angles of my swing from a session yesterday. Looking for any tips you can give me  especially on my backswing and follow-through. Kelce said the early feedback was crazy. Some of this stuff is like stuff other pros have put out and its kind of generic stuff that everybody can use, Kelce said. But theres been some stuff so far thats been like, Holy cow, I never thought about it like that. So Im excited about that. 
        
     Kelce  who retired following the 2023 season after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles, played his role as man of the people to perfection during a pro-am ahead of the Truist Championship. He took time to answer questions from 14-year-old Benji Panzer, a middle school student who had credentials as part of an area sports broadcasting camp. Panzer asked Kelce about his New Heights podcast that he tapes with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The ability of players to connect with fans directly has never been greater, Kelce told Panzer. Kelce connected with plenty of Eagles fans, signing everything from aluminum beer bottles, T-shirts, golf balls and all types of Eagles memorabilia. He accepted gifts, too, including a Kelly green Eagles beer koozie. One fan who called himself T-Shirt Phil  did we mention the tourney was near Philly?  said he wanted to introduce Kelce to Phillies slugger Nick Castellanos. The 37-year-old Kelce  who with wife and social media star Kylie, welcomed their fourth child Finnley Finn Anne Kelce in March  refused to name his favorite golf course in the area but seemed to enjoy the fast greens his first time at Philly Crickets Wissahickon Course. The course is in great shape, he said. Its gorgeous. All the guys we played with agreed. The guys included PGA pros Stephan Jager and Shane Lowry. One unspecified member of the group sliced a ball into the crowd and struck the left hand of 25-year-old spectator Hudson Mokrejs, of Elverson, Pennsylvania, who needed an ice pack on his reddened wrist. We were talking beforehand like, Man, wouldnt it be great to get hit by Jason Kelces ball? And then he shot it over the green, Mokrejs said. I was talking and all of a sudden I hear, Look out! I turned and it just smacked me in the hand. I covered my hand. I didnt spill my drink. I had a Transfusion. Classic golf drink, you know what I mean? Chugged that real quick to get me healthy. Kelce noted the serene golf atmosphere made for more Go Birds chants more than the popular E-A-G-L-E-S chant that punctuates the Eagles fight song. Its just so quick, Kelce said. The E-A-G-L-E-S youve got start in halfway through. Someones got to get it going. He can expect to hear more of them on the course on big-time golf events in the area. The 2026 PGA Championship will be held at Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square and the 2030 U.S. Open is at Merion Golf Club. Philly is an unbelievable golf hub, Kelce said. Theres a lot of fans in the game. Theres a lot of incredible courses with a lot of history to it. Who knows? Thanks to social media, Kelce the amateur golfer just might get good enough to take some swings when it counts. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-truist-proam-kelce-f6398858e43813b1def88f54f675a101,sports
PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 25: Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth pursue different grand slams at Quail Hollow,"Before golf fans have had a chance to exhale after an exhilarating Masters, the next major is at the door selling an equal dose of anticipation. Chatter about a Grand Slam had gone largely quiet for the better part of 25 years since Tiger Woods knocked it out in a span of 35 days  winning the U.S. Open and British Open for the last two legs by a combined 23 strokes  in 2000.  Now its a big part of the conversation going into the PGA Championship. Rory McIlroy is playing the best golf of his career and still buzzing over his playoff victory at Augusta National. That Masters green jacket he proudly wears has given him newfound freedom now that he is the sixth player with the career Grand Slam. Is a calendar slam out of the question?  The next step is the PGA Championship, which starts Thursday at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, where McIlroy has won four times, including last year, the most titles for him on any golf course in the United States. Im obviously going to feel more comfortable and a lot less pressure, and Im also going back to a venue that I love, McIlroy said. Its nothing but positive vibes going in there next week with what happened (at the Masters) and ... how well Ive played at Quail. I probably wont be quite as on edge as I have been for the last few years when Ive been at major championships, he said. Ill probably be a little bit better to be around for my family, and Ill be a little more relaxed. I think overall it will be a good thing. 
        
     Thats the freedom he has to go along with his three victories this year at Pebble Beach, The Players Championship and his crown jewel, the Masters. And his peers have taken notice. That was really good for golf, Xander Schauffele said. It was good for Rorys psyche, maybe worse for us now that he feels free. High praise also comes from Jordan Spieth, who could be next in line. This will be his ninth PGA Championship with a chance to get the final leg of the career slam. It took McIlroy 11 tries. It was obviously a very challenging week for him. It was harder than anybody maybe ever to win a Masters, Spieth said. To be that far from his most recent major as well, and then to go and do it, I mean, it was very inspiring. Spieth hasnt attracted nearly as much attention, mainly because he hasnt won any tournament in three years while coping with a wrist injury that finally led to surgery last August. But then he shot 62 in the final round in Dallas, a subtle reminder he hasnt disappeared and is still more than capable. Gary Player completed the Grand Slam in the 1965 U.S. Open. Jack Nicklaus followed a year later in the British Open. But then it was 34 years until Woods joined them, and 25 years before McIlroy finally got it done. Could you just imagine if we get to the weekend and we have a possibility to have two players do this in the same year after having waited so long? said Trevor Immelman, a former Masters champion and lead analyst for CBS. My goodness, every eyeball in the world that loves sport and loves golf will be enthralled by that. Such is the backdrop going into the PGA Championship, the major that rarely lacks for drama but often gets overlooked compared with the other three.  Not this year. Not with so many players at the top of their games. Scottie Scheffler showed off his No. 1 form by matching the PGA Tour record for 72 holes at 253 with an eight-shot victory in the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, his first win of a season that started slowly because of a freak injury. And then theres Bryson DeChambeau. He played in the final group at four straight tournaments before he broke through with a LIV Golf win in South Korea. In three of the last four majors, DeChambeau finished one behind in the PGA Championship, won the U.S. Open and was in the last group with McIlroy at the Masters. In between, Justin Thomas  he won the PGA Championship the last time it was at Quail Hollow in 2017  got back on track by winning a playoff at the RBC Heritage. At stake for Thomas is a chance to join Woods as the only players to win the PGA Championship twice on the same course. Woods won at Medinah in 1999 and 2006. Quail Hollow is a rare major championship course that breeds familiarity, at least for PGA Tour players. It has been on the PGA Tour schedule since 2003 except for years it has hosted the PGA Championship or the Presidents Cup. Its a big course at 7,626 yards playing to a par 71, though the par 5s are reachable and theres a par 4 on each nine where players can try to drive the green. The closing stretch starts on the reachable par-4 14th with water down the left side, followed by a par 5 and then the Green Mile  two long par 4s with water hazards and a peninsula-green in between at the par-3 17th. You really have to be in play to be successful on that property, said Schauffele, the defending PGA champion. Its a hard place to scramble ... if youre not hitting many fairways and in the rough and trying to work your way up to holes. I dont know if youd call it a second-shot golf course or predominately a tee-shot golf course. But it does feel like you have to do everything really well around that property. While McIlroy has won four times at Quail Hollow, Schauffele has been runner-up the last two years. He won two majors last year but, much like Scheffler, had a slow start to the season because of a rib injury that kept Schauffele out for two months.  Still, there has been no shortage of star power in the weeks leading to the PGA Championship. The Masters is always a tough act to follow, particularly this year with that storybook finish by McIlroy. The PGA Championship at least has the ingredients in place. Ill leave it up to the golf gods to deliver the script, CBS lead announcer Jim Nantz said. Theyve been quite prolific so far at their creative writing best. And I cant wait to see what theyre going to hand deliver to the world. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-championship-quail-hollow-mcilroy-spieth-scheffler-60f429ca61cc52b99ffc16c8499b80a3,sports

Back to school: WNBA teams open preseason in college arenas as star alums return to campus,"Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Sabrina Ionescu are among the players who will get a chance to play one more game in their college arenas as WNBA teams return to campuses for preseason contests. Its a trend, started by the Las Vegas Aces last season when they played at South Carolina in a return for Aja Wilson to her alma mater. It gives WNBA teams a chance to capitalize on the popularity of players and they hope it also brings new fans to the league. Reese will headline the Chicago Skys trip to LSU on Friday to face the Brazilian national team and then on Sunday Clark will lead the Indiana Fever to Iowa for an exhibition game against the same Brazilian squad. Im really excited, Clark said. It should be fun. I cant believe its already here. I honestly havent been back to Iowa City a ton since I left a year ago now -- only been back once for a football game and once for the jersey retirement. But it will be fun to get back there, see some of my former teammates, my friends that are there. Both the Fever and Sky games will be on national television. The WNBA will be showing all 15 of its preseason games either on national television or league pass. Clark did have one concern about the trip to Iowa; the basketball arena doesnt have air conditioning. A lot of my family will be coming, so I know theyre excited. I warned everybody, Im like theres not air conditioning in Carver-Hawkeye (Arena), usually dont play basketball games there in May, so hopefully it stays a little cool in there, she said, laughing. 
        
     A trio of former Notre Dame standouts will take the court in South Bend, Indiana, on Friday when the Dallas Wings open the preseason against Wilson and the Aces. WNBA All-Stars Jewell Loyd and Jackie Young both starred for the Irish while Wings standout Arike Ogunbowale also excelled there. Ogunbowale, who was the second-leading scorer in the WNBA last year, hit two of the most historic shots in NCAA Tournament history to lift Notre Dame to the national championship in 2018. The opener will also mark the debut of No. 1 pick Paige Bueckers for the Wings.  Ionescu and the New York Liberty will close out the preseason schedule on May 12 when the team goes to Oregon to play at her alma mater against the Japanese team  the Toyota Antelopes. The NCAAs career triple-double leader never got a chance to say goodbye to the school or the fans because the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the NCAA Tournament her senior season in 2020. I dont really know how Im going to feel, especially suiting up and stepping on that court again. I might get emotional, just knowing that I finally get to say goodbye to that chapter of my life and get a little bit of the closure that I never got. Some storylines to watch as the preseason tips off: Washington rookie Georgia Amoore suffered an injury to her right ACL in practice on Tuesday and is sidelined indefinitely. The No. 6 pick in the draft averaged 19.6 points for Kentucky last season and was expected to help the franchise rebuild this year along with fellow rookies Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen, who were selected third and fourth last month. The Mystics also announced that second-year forward Aaliyah Edwards is out with a lower back contusion and will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Eight of the 13 WNBA teams will have new head coaches this season. Atlanta and Los Angeles turned to college coaches Karl Smesko and Lynne Roberts, respectively. Indiana brought back former coach and player Stephanie White to lead the Fever. White had been in charge of the Connecticut Sun, who replaced her with former Belgium national team coach Rachid Meziane. Chicago, Dallas and Washington turned to former WNBA assistant coaches Tyler Marsh, Chris Koclanes and Sydney Johnson, respectively. Golden State also brought in a former assistant coach, Natalie Nakase, to be the first head coach in the expansion franchises history. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-clark-reese-bueckers-91431df20e98615db4d6e8f9e9c1905f,sports
Paige Bueckers has bumpy WNBA preseason debut as Wings lose to Aces in South Bend,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP)  Dallas Wings guard Paige Bueckers drove into the teeth of the Las Vegas Aces defense during the first quarter of her WNBA preseason debut. Launching from the left side, Bueckers connected on a left-handed floater from 5 feet, and then fell hard to the baseline. It was a welcome-to-the-league moment that might leave a bruise. Bueckers, the No. 1 overall selection in the WNBA draft after leading UConn to a national title a month ago, scored 10 points in 23 minutes on Notre Dames home floor as the rebuilding Wings lost 112-78 to the perennially title-contending Aces. Jackie Young scored 28 points for Las Vegas. She was one of three former Notre Dame players in the game, joined by teammate Jewell Loyd and Dallas Arike Ogunbowale. Bueckers is hoping to turn around a franchise that went 9-31 in 2024. The playmaking guard averaged 24.8 points in the womens NCAA Tournament for UConn, finally delivering the title that shed been chasing since her sensational freshman season. Now shes trying to reset after grinding her way through a 40-game college season that ended a month ago. Its super surreal in terms of the turnaround from where I was two weeks ago to where I am today, Bueckers said. Im just soaking it up and enjoying every moment, getting used to new routines, traditions, new teammates, new organization. Im just excited to be playing basketball again with this new group and continue to grow and get better every day. 
        
     Bueckers said the pace of the game and the level of talent in the WNBA are much different from anything shes experienced. She noted the Aces had five former Olympians in their lineup. The physicality of the league appeared to get to Bueckers at times. She questioned a no-call when she was trying to ignite a fast break and ran into Young, who made a steal and turned it into a pair of free throws for the Aces. She looked unhappy with the three fouls called on her. Fighting her way through screens was an issue. A year ago, Caitlin Clark came into the league with unusual star power and immediately boosted attendance and ratings while clashing at times with the WNBAs more established players.  The Wings hope to help Bueckers have a smooth transition into the pro game. We have that example (of Clarks first season) to learn from already, and I think were prepared, Wings coach Chris Koclanes said. Paige is unique and special, and shes prepared to be able to handle everything that comes her way, on and off the floor, and well do everything we can to support her. You try to prepare and teach and put her in positions to be able to find success, and then youve got to let her go, and you got to let her live and let her experience it, Koclanes said. So its a balance just feeling out what that ultimately ends up looking like. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/paige-bueckers-wnba-dallas-wings-south-bend-e507a05c1140dc9dcf33c32484ae96e6,sports
Angel Reese has a rousing return to Baton Rouge in an exhibition for the Sky vs. Brazil,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP)  Former LSU star Angel Reeses homecoming in the Chicago Skys WNBA exhibition opener was a smashing success. Reese had 15 points and 10 rebounds, helping the Sky to a rousing 89-62 victory over the Brazilian national team on Friday night at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Reese was smiling the moment she entered the arena where her college career took off after transferring from Maryland. She earned All-America honors twice and led LSU to the national title in 2023. Im just happy to be back to see all the fans, even down to the security guards, because I know how much was put into this program, said Reese, whos entering her second season with the Sky after earning WNBA All-Rookie honors last year, when she set a league single season rebounding record. A crowd of 6,373, many of whom wore Sky T-shirts and Reese No. 5 jerseys, cheered her and rookie teammate Hailey Van Liths every move. Van Lith was an LSU teammate of Reese in 2023-24 before playing her final collegiate season at TCU. Van Lith entered the game to a loud ovation with 5:43 left in the third quarter and finished with seven points, five assists and three rebounds. Reese and Van Lith were honored before the game with video highlights of their time at LSU. Tigers coach Kim Mulkey gave the duo bouquets and hugs. Kia Nurse added 11 points for the Sky. Chicagos Kamilla Cardoso, playing against her Brazilian countrywomen, had six points and eight rebounds. Manu Alves led Brazil with nine points. 
        
     Fridays game was the first for new Sky coach Tyler Marsh. The Sky also debuted a revamped starting lineup, with veteran free agent signees Nurse and Courtney Vandersloot and trade acquisition Ariel Atkins joining Reese and Cardoso. The result was a smooth offense guided by Vandersloot, a four-time all-league guard in her first 12 WNBA seasons with the Sky. She spent the last two years with the New York Liberty. Brazils next stop in its U.S. tour will be an exhibition against Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever on Sunday at the University of Iowas arena in Iowa City, where Clark starred in college. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-sky-angel-reese-baton-rouge-brazil-d8c427cfb17d1ece6b13c63a7890c955,sports
Caitlin Clark returns to Iowa in Fevers preseason game against Brazil despite leg injury,"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP)  Caitlin Clark made the shot everyone came to see. Clark stopped late in the third quarter of Sundays WNBA preseason game between the Indiana Fever and the Brazilian national team and launched a 3-pointer near the 22 logo on Iowas Carver-Hawkeye Arena court. It was the spot where she hit the shot in her senior season in 2024 that made her the all-time leading scorer in NCAA womens basketball, and of course it went in. This shot, with 25 seconds left in the third quarter, capped Clarks return to the arena where she broke records on her way to becoming the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader. I was like, Ah, why not? Clark said, smiling. Had to give the fans a little something. Clark, starting her second season with the Fever, scored 16 points in Indianas 108-44 win. Clarks day was bookended by shots that were reminiscent of her career with Iowas womens basketball team  her first 3-pointer came from the tip of the beak on Iowas Tigerhawk logo at midcourt 34 seconds into the game. And after both shots went in, the crowd response sounded just like all the shots she made in front of sellout crowds as she led the Hawkeyes to back-to-back appearances in the NCAA national championship game in her final two seasons. Its amazing to see how many people love her, Fever forward Makayla Timpson said. Clark, dealing with a leg injury that kept her out of Saturdays preseason opener against the Washington Mystics, played almost 19 minutes, and that was enough to please the capacity crowd of 14,998. She finished the game making 6 of 10 shots, and added six rebounds and five assists. 
        
     Something about this gym makes me play well, Clark said. It was Clarks second time back at the arena since she left the Hawkeyes  she had her jersey No. 22 retired in a ceremony after Iowas 76-69 win over USC on Feb. 2. Ive told my teammates theyre going to be here cheering for me, yes, but theyre also going to be here cheering for you and our entire team, Clark said before the game. And I think thats whats so great about these fans, is they really rally around the entire team. Its not just myself, and thats what I love about it. Clark was greeted with a loud ovation when she took the court before the game, and the noise continued throughout the day. The crowd noise for Clarks pregame introduction reached 116 decibels, and the first 3-pointer recorded 117-decibel applause. That kind of a response wasnt a surprise to Fever coach Stephanie White. Ive seen the Caitlin Clark stuff from the outside looking in and being on the television side and certainly being an opponent, said White, who called some of Clarks games while working at ESPN and went against her last season as the coach of the Connecticut Sun. For us to be able to bring Caitlin back here and to bring our team here to experience this fan base, its an incredible opportunity. Iowa coach Jan Jensen had the same reaction. Were just proud that we can fill this place up in May, she said. Are you kidding me? The event became a hot ticket as soon as it was announced earlier this year. The average paid price of $440 per ticket on the secondary market this week made it the most in-demand event involving Clark, according to ticketing technology company Victory Live, which analyzes sales across the secondary market. Asking prices on the secondary market Wednesday ranged from $146 to $2,368. Clark made it clear before the game she was going to play despite the injury, although it was apparent the injury was still an issue  when she came out of the game in the first half she went to the tunnel behind the Fever bench to ride a stationary bike. It sucked being on the sideline yesterday, but obviously, its probably just the best decision in the preseason, Clark said. Kelsey Mitchell led the Fever with 17 points. Aliyah Boston added 11. Clark left the game after making that last shot, and as she got to the bench waved to the crowd, encouraging one last cheer. Thats my goal, Clark said before the game. Get them involved, get them loud. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba",https://apnews.com/article/caitlin-clark-iowa-fever-brazil-eae70207f0b03412b93d905bafa2e311,sports
LA Rams announce plans to hold their June minicamp in Maui,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  The Los Angeles Rams are moving their minicamp to Maui. The Rams announced their plan Wednesday to hold their mandatory minicamp on Hawaiis second-largest island on June 16-19. The camp will feature two days of on-field workouts at War Memorial Stadium in Wailuku, with one day open to the public. The Rams will also host a football clinic for local youth teams, and Rams players and staff will join Habitat for Humanity to rebuild four homes in Lahaina, which was largely destroyed by wildfires in 2023. The Rams have a lengthy history of partnerships with the state of Hawaii and its individual islands. They played a preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys in Honolulu in August 2019 before the largest crowd in Aloha Stadiums history, and the team did extensive fundraising for Maui wildfire relief two years ago. The Rams international ambitions stretch all around the Pacific Rim. They will play the first regular-season game in Australia in 2026 at the historic Melbourne Cricket Ground, and the team also was the first to get NFL marketing rights to Japan last year. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-rams-maui-minicamp-9c664f06c5b9f5edb61d2548d894d51d,sports
Seahawks re-sign veteran defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins,"SEATTLE (AP)  Defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins re-signed with the Seattle Seahawks on Wednesday. Hankins, 33, signed a one-year deal with the Seahawks as a free agent last year and is entering his 13th season in the NFL. Last season, Hankins appeared in all 17 games for the Seahawks and had 30 tackles, five tackles for loss and one sack. I like it here. Everything made sense, Hankins said in a statement. To be able to still be playing in Year 13, and obviously the organization wanted me back, so it just made sense. Hankins has played for four other NFL franchises in his career: the Raiders, Giants, Cowboys and Colts. He has had 433 tackles as well as 18 1/2 sacks. Hankins will remain with a Seahawks defensive line that already has a good amount of depth. Prior to Hankins signing, the Seahawks already had Leonard Williams, Jarran Reed and Byron Murphy II under contract for the 2025 season. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/seahawks-johnathan-hankins-4dc66f35be38c7039ae202768fe97c4e,sports
Dolphins release long snapper Blake Ferguson among four roster cuts,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla.

Ferguson, a sixth-round pick by Miami in 2020, was one of four players the Dolphins cut on Thursday to clear roster space. Cornerback Ryan Cooper Jr., defensive tackle Neil Farrell and offensive lineman Chasen Hines were also released. Ferguson appeared in 72 games with Miami, recording eight special teams tackles and one special teams fumble recovery. He did not play the second half of last season because of an undisclosed medical issue, and the Dolphins used practice squad long snappers in his place. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/dolphins-blake-ferguson-e4df84874b8812f9b7e3ae1abdd342b6,sports
Capitals and Golden Knights are the latest to blow leads this NHL playoffs and need to fix problems,"So far early in these NHL playoffs, 45 times a team has skated onto the ice for the third period with a lead. Nearly a third of those times that team lost the game. The Washington Capitals and Vegas Golden Knights lost their second-round series opener, becoming the 12th and 13th examples of that particular blown lead this postseason. The Capitals lost to Carolina in overtime and the Golden Knights fell to Edmonton in regulation.  Weve been good at getting leads and building leads in past playoff series, but the past is the past and the times now, Vegas center Jack Eichel said. You learn from some stuff thats happened. At the same time, we have to understand theyre not going to come in here and roll over, so our effort needs to be better. Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl dont know the meaning of roll over. Trailing 2-1, the Oilers outshot the Golden Knights 12-1 in the second period, then scored 57 seconds out of intermission on the way to winning 4-2. Washington led 1-0 midway through the third, when a turnover by Aliaksei Protas off the right skate of teammate Alex Alexeyev put the puck right on Jesperi Kotkaniemis stick. Quick pass to Logan Stankoven, who beat Logan Thompson, and the score was tied. Carolina finished it off three minutes into OT. Sure, it was a bad bounce, but the Capitals were 31-1-1 during the regular season when up after two periods.  
        
     You have to trust yourself and play within good D-zone structure for when those bad moments do happen because inevitably theyre going to happen in a series, center Nic Dowd said. Pucks are going to hit stanchions, theyre going hit toes of peoples skates  things like that are going to happen. But I trust that the five guys that are on the ice are always going to get the job done. That was a one-goal lead, and Washington was under siege most of Game 1. Vegas blew a two-goal advantage, ending a streak of winning 26 playoff games in a row when up by that margin or more. I dont think its anything that concerns us, said Reilly Smith, a member of the Knights 2023 Cup-winning team who was reacquired ahead of the trade deadline in March. Theres a lot thats correctable. I think we need to play faster and more direct, and I think it starts there. When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Thursday, 7 p.m. EDT (ESPN) Series: Hurricanes lead 1-0 What went wrong for the Capitals in the series-opening loss? Let coach Spencer Carbery count the ways. You can obviously go down 20 different alleys, Carbery said. Dowd referenced 94 twice as the number of shot attempts Carolina had in Game 1 compared with Washingtons 34. That explains just how much the ice was tilted toward Thompson. Theyre going to funnel a ton of pucks to the net, and eventually something bad will happen, Dowd said, referencing Jaccob Slavins overtime winner on a seemingly harmless shot from 65 feet out. You give them enough opportunities, something weird is bound to happen, just like it did. But all in all I dont think we played a very good game, so well obviously be looking to get back to what we do best. The silver lining for the Caps is they were one goal from stealing a game they had no business winning. Games 3 and 4 are on the road in Raleigh, where the Hurricanes get to control matchups  making this as close to a must-win as a Game 2 can realistically be. Were very, very short-term focused, so I dont even look at it as a series at this point right now, Carbery said. Our focus is: What do we need to adjust? What do we need to do tomorrow to have success on home ice and have our game look as close to possible what our game needs to look like this year and the level it has to be at  extremely high  to compete with a team like the Carolina Hurricanes? When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Thursday, 9:30 p.m. EDT (ESPN) Series: Oilers lead 1-0 Trailing in a playoff series is nothing new for the Golden Knights, who have shown a fortitude throughout their eight-year history to overcome early losses. No, I dont think were panicking, Eichel said. Its a seven-game series. Obviously, we didnt have our best (Tuesday) night and it cost us Game 1, but you learn from it and move on. The Golden Knights have won three consecutive series after losing the opener and are 4-2 in franchise history in such scenarios. They lost the first game to Winnipeg in both 2018 and 2023 on eventual trips to the Stanley Cup Final. In 2021, the Golden Knights dropped their first two games to Colorado before storming back to win in six. Vegas also has a series comeback just this year. The Golden Knights took Game 1 in the first round against Minnesota, lost the next two to trail 2-1, then won the next three to move on. Coach Bruce Cassidy anticipates a hungry opponent after the Oilers came one victory away from the Stanley Cup last season and not being satisfied with winning just one of the first two at Vegas. We cant be relying on (past comeback success), Cassidy said. Weve got to play better is what weve got to do. ___ AP Sports Writer Mark Anderson in Las Vegas contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-playoffs-second-round-d6d0cc5d0947ad7cde12795626d578a8,sports
Marner scores tiebreaking goal as Maple Leafs beat Panthers 4-3 for 2-0 series lead,"TORONTO (AP)  Mitch Marner has experienced a whirlwind stretch  both at home and the rink. Joseph Woll waited patiently and prepared for a chance he wasnt sure hed get. They both came through for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Game 2 of their second-round playoff series. Marner scored the tiebreaking goal in the third period and Woll made 25 saves in place of the injured Anthony Stolarz as the Maple Leafs beat the Florida Panthers 4-3 on Wednesday night to take a 2-0 series lead. A really exciting time in my house, said Marner, who became a father for the first time during the weekend. ""(And) pretty special feeling tonight. Woll was pressed into service after Stolarz exited midway through Mondays opener  a 5-4 Toronto victory  following an elbow to the head from Panthers center Sam Bennett, Woll started for the first time since April 17. Its been something Ive had to focus on and come up with a plan to stay ready, Woll said. Its a different challenge than playing every night, but a challenge nonetheless. Woll, who entered with a .950 save percentage in his four previous playoff starts, also performed well when called upon in both the 2023 and 2024 postseasons because of injury. Calm and cool, Maple Leafs coach Craig Berube said. On his toes and fighting through traffic. Very impressed. Max Pacioretty and Max Domi each had a goal and an assist, William Nylander also scored and Morgan Rielly added two assists for the Maple Leafs.  
        
     Anton Lundell had a goal and an assist, and Aleksander Barkov and Brad Marchand also scored for the defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers. Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 16 saves. Lots of stuff that we like about our game that we think we can improve, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. Well take a look at it and get better. The best-of-seven matchup between Atlantic Division heavyweights now shifts to South Florida, with Game 3 set for Friday. Trailing 3-2 after two periods, Florida tied it got even at 5:33 of the third when Lundell shoveled his third goal of the playoffs past Woll. Toronto regained the lead just 17 seconds later when Marner fired a shot from the boards that found its way through traffic past a surprised Bobrovsky. Marner, who turned 28 on Monday, has added an M to his equipment since he and wife Stephanie welcomed their son Miles on Sunday morning. Just calmness, he said of what looking down and seeing that initial does for him. I try to stay calm as much as I can throughout games. Its always a roller-coaster ride. Theres always stuff going on, stuff you cant predict happening. Im trying to play for him. Woll made a huge stop on Mackie Samoskevich with 9:59 left in regulation, and Maple Leafs defenseman Jake McCabe swatted a loose puck out of the crease with under six minutes to go. The Panthers continued to press and Sam Reinhart hit the post with just over three minutes left before the Maple Leafs held on late. Florida, which beat Toronto in five games two years ago at the same stage of the playoffs, went ahead 2-1 just 15 seconds into the middle period when Marchand  a Maple Leafs playoff nemesis as a member of the Boston Bruins  took a pass from Lundell down low off a turnover by Rielly and roofed his first of the playoffs. Toronto tied it at 4:18 when Pacioretty chipped a puck past Panthers defenseman Seth Jones before finding Nylander in front for him to bury his sixth, and the forwards seventh point in three games. Theyre very good on the rush, Marchand said. It seemed like every time we gave them the opportunity to get above us, they created something or capitalized on it. The Maple Leafs took a 3-2 lead with 2:51 remaining in the second when Domi took a pass from Steven Lorentz on a 2-on-1 and one-timed his second over a sprawling Bobrovsky. Toronto got nothing from two power plays inside the games first 10 minutes before Florida struck 5 seconds into its first man advantage when Barkov fired past Woll for his second at 10:58.

Toronto again didnt get much going until the second unit took the ice and Rielly fired a shot from the point late in the man advantage that Pacioretty  a healthy scratch to start the postseason before scoring the series-clinching goal against Ottawa in the first round  tipped it upstairs for his second with 1:41 left before the first intermission.

Mikko Rantanen has second straight hat trick as Stars beat Jets 3-2 in series opener,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP)  Mikko Rantanen had a natural hat trick in the second period, Jake Oettinger stopped 30 shots and the Dallas Stars beat the Winnipeg Jets 3-2 on Wednesday night in Game 1 of the second-round series. Rantanen, who had a hat trick in the third period of the Stars Game 7 win over his former Colorado teammates, is the third player in NHL history  and the first in nearly 40 years  with hat tricks in consecutive playoff games. Edmontons Jari Kurri accomplished the feat in Games 5 and 6 of the 1985 Campbell Conference final, and Chicagos Doug Bentley did the same in Games 4 and 5 of the 1944 Stanley Cup Final. Sometimes it goes that way, said Rantanen, acquired from Carolina at the trade deadline. The third goal goes off them and goes fivehole. Or when youre going through a tough stretch, you feel like you could only pray for those and those never come. Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Friday night in Winnipeg. Nino Niederreiter and Mark Scheifele scored for the Jets, who had won four in a row at Canada Life Centre. Connor Hellebuyck made 21 saves. Scheifele returned after sustaining an upper-body injury in Game 5 in the first round against St. Louis. Dallas forward Jason Robertson was back after injuring a knee in the final game of the regular season. The Jets led the NHL with 116 points to earn home-ice advantage through the playoffs, while Dallas was second in the Central Division and third in the Western Conference with 106. 
        
     We know we just gave up home-ice advantage, Jets coach Scott Arniel said. And that wasnt a game where they rolled over top of us for three periods. That was a game where we werent at our best. Niederreiter got the sold-out crowd cheering when his sharp-angled backhander beat Oettinger at 3:30 of the second period. He became the NHLs first Swiss-born player to skate in 100 postseason games. Rantanen tied it at 8:43 with his sixth goal of the playoffs. His second goal was a tip of Thomas Harleys point shot with 5:39 left, and he made it 3-1 on the power play 2:17 later when his shot went in off Jets defenseman Dylan Samberg. Sometimes its ups and downs in hockey and now its going well individually and as a team, Rantanen said. Rantanen extended his points streak to four games with eight goals and six assists across the stretch. He has 15 points this postseason. Hes one of the best players in the world and hes just on fire right now, so were just trying to get him the puck, said center Sam Steele, who assisted on Rantanens first goal of the night. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/stars-jets-score-nhl-playoffs-9104a02d0a358148370e8bb5c4024a07,sports
"Gilgeous-Alexander scores 34 as Thunder roll past Nuggets 149-106, tie West semis at 1-1","OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points in three quarters, and the Oklahoma City Thunder set league and team records in a 149-106 win over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night that tied the Western Conference semifinal series at one game apiece. Oklahoma City set an NBA playoff record for first-half points with 87, surpassing the 86 scored by the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Golden State Warriors in Game 4 of the NBA Finals on June 9, 2017. Chet Holmgren, who missed two critical free throws late in Game 1, made a pair with one second remaining in the second quarter to set the record and give the Thunder an 87-56 lead. The Thunder tied the record for points in any half of a playoff game. Milwaukee had 87 in the second half against Denver on April 23, 1978. Basically it was one team playing tonight, Denver center Nikola Jokic said.  The top-seeded Thunder wanted to avoid taking a 2-0 deficit on the road. Oklahoma City became the first home team to win a game in the second round. Game 3 is Friday in Denver. We knew what was at stake tonight, Gilgeous-Alexander said. We came out desperate. We wanted to just take care and control the things that we knew we could. And we did a pretty good job of that, specifically to start the game. The start carried us through the rest of the night.  Gilgeous-Alexander made 11 of 13 field goals, all 11 of his free throws and had eight assists. He led eight players who scored in double figures. 
        
     Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Gilgeous-Alexander did much more than score. He made them pay when they overhelped on him, Daigneault said. He had the ball ahead of them all night, so he got his teammates shots, too. It wasnt just a one-man show. He was super efficient. I mean, he had an unbelievable blend tonight. Jokic, who had 42 points and 22 rebounds in a Game 1 win, had just 17 points and eight rebounds on Wednesday before fouling out late in the third quarter. Russell Westbrook led the Nuggets with 19 points. Oklahoma Citys crowd cheered for the ex-Thunder star when he entered Game 1 as a reserve, but the fans changed their approach and booed him shortly after he entered Game 2. Westbrook got called for a technical foul moments later, and Gilgeous-Alexander made the free throw to make it 34-13. The Thunder led 45-21 at the end of the first quarter after shooting 71.4% from the field and setting a team record for points in a quarter in a playoff game. We got punked, and we didnt play well enough and they came out with the right intensity, Denver interim coach David Adelman said. We didnt. Oklahoma City continued its dominance in the second quarter. A lob from Gilgeous-Alexander to Jalen Williams for a two-handed jam gave the Thunder a 78-43 lead. Oklahoma City led 124-76 after three quarters. The largest lead was 49 points.  Adelman said he wouldnt minimize the loss, even though the Nuggets head back to Denver with home-court advantage. Im not sitting here tonight talking about the 1-1 thing tonight, he said. Not tonight. Were not going to flush that. Weve got to be better. We know that. That being said, its nice to know that you got a win underneath your belt. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nuggets-thunder-score-nba-playoffs-50b7f402e366173a4971cb21302fbc59,sports
The year of the NBA playoff comeback continues. A look at how these 20-point rallies keep happening,"New York down by 20 on Monday. Indiana down by 20 on Tuesday. New York down by 20 again Wednesday. No problem. For the first time since play-by-play began being digitally tracked across the NBA about 30 years ago, there have been three consecutive days where the winning team in a playoff game came from at least 20 points down to win. The Knicks did it in Boston on Monday, the Pacers did it in Cleveland on Tuesday and the Knicks did it again on the Celtics home floor Wednesday. Add in a pair of similar rallies  a 29-pointer by Oklahoma City and another 20-pointer by Indiana  in Round 1, and that pushes the total of 20-point comebacks so far this postseason to five. Thats the most of any postseason in the digital play-by-play era, which goes back to 1997. A look at how the comebacks happened: The big lead: Memphis 69, Oklahoma City 40, 3:07 left first half The final score: Oklahoma City 114, Memphis 108 How it happened: Memphis undoing started when star guard Ja Morant got hurt and left the game on the possession where the Grizzlies took the 29-point lead. The Thunder outscored the Grizzlies 74-39 the rest of the way, with Chet Holmgren scoring 23 points for Oklahoma City in that span. Memphis missed 30 of its final 41 shots. The big lead: Milwaukee 33, Indiana 13, 11:26 left first half The final score: Indiana 119, Milwaukee 118, OT How it happened: The Pacers got the lead down to six by halftime, then the final 29 minutes were largely back and forth. The Bucks led by seven with 40 seconds left in overtime, before Indiana ended the game on an 8-0 run and won it on Tyrese Haliburtons layup with 1.4 seconds remaining. 
        
     The big lead: Boston 75, New York 55, 5:47 left third quarter The final score: New York 108, Boston 105, OT How it happened: The Celtics went up 20, then shot 23% the rest of the way (9 for 39) and relied almost entirely on the 3-point shot (6 for 28) over those 23 minutes. OG Anunoby and Jalen Brunson combined to outscore Boston 39-30 by themselves over that finishing stretch, and neither team scored in the final 1:16 of overtime. The big lead: Cleveland 81, Indiana 61, 6:51 left third quarter The final score: Indiana 120, Cleveland 119 How it happened: Over the games final 40 minutes, Indiana led for 0.00046% of the time  and won the game. The Pacers outscored Cleveland 59-38 over the final 18:51, Tyrese Haliburtons 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left capping an 8-0 burst in the final minute and giving Indiana a 2-0 series lead. The big lead: Boston 73, New York 53, 2:19 left third quarter The final score: New York 91, Boston 90 How it happened: The Knicks outscored the Celtics 38-17 in the final 14:19 of the game, as Boston  just like in Game 1  built a big lead and then couldnt hit a shot. The Celtics were 5 for 25 from the field in that stretch, 2 for 12 from 3-point range. Bostons starters were a combined 2 for 19 down the stretch, while New York shot 15 for 28 and got 14 points from Mikal Bridges over those minutes. Jayson Tatum couldnt get a good look on the last play, and the Knicks took a 2-0 series lead. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-comebacks-0ac7f24401d27abe5fc30e1700cc19b6,sports
"Tyrese Haliburton gets warning from NBA for dance, but no fine, AP source says","Tyrese Haliburton did the dance. He will not pay a fine. Haliburton, the Indiana guard who expected to be fined for his dancing celebration after Game 2 of the Pacers win at Cleveland in the Eastern Conference semifinals on Tuesday night, received only a warning from the league office instead, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because the decision had not been revealed publicly. Ive been waiting for that. Ive been waiting for that, man, Haliburton said after Game 2, when asked about the celebration and if he expected to hear from the league. It was just right in the moment. It was right in the moment. Yeah, man, Ive been waiting for that. Ill take that fine, gladly. It will be just a warning instead. Haliburton fully expected a fine because celebrations similar to the one he used  believed to be first brought to the league by Sam Cassell long ago  merited such penalties from the NBA in the past. LeBron James, Eddie House, Julius Randle, Fred Van Vleet and more have previously drawn fines for what the league has described as an obscene gesture. Haliburtons 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left capped an Indiana rally from 20 points down and gave the Pacers a 120-119 win. The Pacers now lead the series against the top-seeded Cavaliers 2-0, with Games 3 and 4 at Indianapolis on Friday and Sunday. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/pacers-tyrese-haliburton-nba-0f06b516327cf0924c1d8d938e02e4ce,sports
Paul Pierce says he walked 20 miles to work in a robe as punishment for guaranteeing a Celtics win,"Former Celtics great Paul Pierce was so confident in his team in Game 2 against the Knicks, he said he would walk to work barefoot in my robe if they lost for a second straight game in the second-round series. If the Celtics lose Game 2 at home, I promise you, I am walking here tomorrow, he declared on an FS1 show Wednesday. I guarantee this one. Put the house on this game. That didnt turn out so great. The Celtics blew a 20-point lead in Game 2, as they did in Game 1, and lost 91-90. Pierce appeared to honor his vow Thursday, saying he set out before the sun rose for what he said was a 20.2-mile commute to work in the Los Angeles area. He posted updates on Instagram Live. Pierce made the wise choice of not walking barefoot, but bath-robed? Yes. All right, time for me to get to steppin, he said after 5 a.m. Pacific time, calling himself a man of my word. I cant believe the Celtics got me out here like this, dog, he said in a later update. Im really walking out here like this. A little before 9 a.m., Pierce posted another Live of a couple of hecklers on the sidewalk. You lost that bet, huh? one of them said. Pierce took it all in stride, having some fun with them. He said he was about halfway at that point. He posted another video saying he arrived to work at around 1 p.m. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/paul-pierce-celtics-knicks-bet-walk-robe-d93bfe637ae9024ddafac43f18cd9db6,sports

Olympiakos rises into next Champions League and skips qualifying rounds after PSG reaches final,"ATHENS, Greece (AP)  Greek league winner Olympiakos will return to the Champions League next season after a five-year gap because Paris Saint-Germain advanced to the final late Wednesday. We are back! the new Greek champion posted Thursday on its social media accounts after its elevated status was confirmed by UEFA. PSGs win over Arsenal in the semifinals means it will play Inter Milan in the May 31 final in Munich. Both finalists already qualified for the next Champions League through their national league position so the entry reserved for the defending champion can be reallocated. That guaranteed place in the 36-team league format goes to the national champion in the qualifying rounds that has the best UEFA ranking, based on European competition results over a five-year period. Olympiakos has that high ranking  currently No. 37 in all Europe  fueled by winning the Conference League title last year, as the first Greek team to win a European trophy. The champion of Greece had been set to enter the 2025-26 Champions League qualifying rounds in July, needing to advance through three rounds to reach the lucrative league phase. Olympiakos sealed the Greek league title, the 48th in its history, last weekend and now avoids having to beat three opponents to reach the elite Champions League stage. The team, owned by shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis, last played in the Champions League in 2020-21, placing third in a group behind Manchester City and Porto. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/champions-league-greece-olympiakos-uefa-98fc1c4492c05f41fb25b0c8e8fb2452,sports
FIFAs Infantino plans Saudi visit during President Trumps tour as soccer world gathers in Paraguay,"GENEVA (AP)  FIFA President Gianni Infantino will go to Saudi Arabia next week during U.S. President Donald Trumps state visit while the soccer bodys 211 member federations gather at their annual Congress being held in Paraguay. It is unprecedented in modern times for a FIFA president to skip any part of the days-long congress program, where FIFA voters in soccers six continental bodies caucus ahead of the main meeting often called the sports parliament. The FIFA president has accepted invitations to attend a series of important events with world leaders, where FIFA World Cups will also be discussed, soccers governing body said in a statement. Infantino also is expected to visit Qatar, the 2022 World Cup host which also is on the U.S. presidents Middle East tour schedule. Infantinos close ties to Trump during the presidents first term have grown stronger in about 10 meetings together since December, including Tuesday at the White House with a task force to oversee federal plans for the 2026 World Cup being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. The FIFA leader also meets regularly with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose kingdom will host the mens World Cup in 2034. Infantino helped steer those hosting rights to Saudi Arabia in an uncontested vote last December. Infantino is expected to return from the Middle East in time for the FIFA Congress on Thursday, the last meeting of all FIFA members before they come to the 2026 World Cup. It also is their first meeting together since before the online votes six months ago that confirmed the Saudi bid for 2034 and sent the 2030 edition to Spain, Portugal and Morocco plus single games in Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. 
        
     He had been due Tuesday in the Paraguayan capital Asuncion to chair an in-person meeting of FIFAs ruling council. It is now moved up four days for an online session Friday that clears Infantinos schedule for the kind of geopolitical trip he has seemed to relish detailing on his Instagram account. Infantino and FIFA have consistently said he needs to maintain good relations with the Trump administration to ensure the 48-team, six-week tournament is safe and successful. FIFA voters chose the North American bid in 2018 when it was backed by then-President Trump. However, there were no formal meetings for Infantino with President Joe Biden during his four-year term that ended in January. They did pose for a photograph together in 2022 at a G20 meeting in Bali, Indonesia. Infantino has forged close political and financial ties for FIFA with Saudi Arabia and its crown prince since before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. In Riyadh on Tuesday, when FIFA delegates are in Paraguay, Infantino is expected to attend a Saudi-U.S. investment forum where World Cup projects are on the agenda. Saudi Arabia is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on stadiums plus huge city and transport upgrades ahead of the tournament. Infantino attended a similar conference in Miami Beach in February, when he sat with Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner, Elon Musk and Saudi officials. They included the kingdoms ambassador to the U.S., Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud and the governor of its sovereign wealth fund, Yasir Al-Rumayyan. Soccer officials have privately expressed concern about Infantinos increasing focus on global politics as much as the sport FIFA runs. European soccer body UEFA said Thursday we were informed about the (Council) meeting being rescheduled to this week. However, we prefer not to comment on the reasons and suggest directing any queries to FIFA, UEFA said. President Trump is visiting Saudi Arabia plus Qatar and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, in what was originally planned as the first overseas trip since he took office for a second time in January. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/fifa-infantino-trump-saudi-arabia-world-cup-c7332dc43564a712d740ac85533818bb,sports
Chelsea advances to Conference League final against Real Betis,"Chelsea rested its regular starters and still comfortably advanced to the Conference League final by beating Djurgrden 1-0 in their semifinal second leg of Thursday. The Premier League club advanced 5-1 on aggregate to set up a May 28 title match against Real Betis, which prevailed in extra time for a 4-3 aggregate win over Fiorentina to reach its first European final.

Amazing to be in the final, Dewsbury-Hall told TNT Sports. We set our sights at the start of the season to get as far as we can in this tournament and it has been a long couple of months but one more game to go and and hopefully we can lift that trophy. Chelsea remains on course to become the first club to win all major European competitions. The Blues have claimed the Champions League (2012, 21), the Europa League (2013, 19), Cup Winners Cup (1971, 98) and Super Cup (1998, 21). The final takes place in Wroclaw, Poland. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca used only Marc Cucurella from the team that beat the new Premier League champion Liverpool 3-1 on Sunday. Sixteen-year-old midfielder Reggie Walsh was given his first career start and drew frequent fouls from the opposition defense. When he was used as substitute in the first leg, he became the third youngest player for Chelsea, the club said. 
        
     The Conference League champion is rewarded with a place in the second-tier Europa League next season, hardly a desirable bonus for Chelsea given that it is fighting in the Premier League for a Champions League spot. Chelsea, in fifth place in the Premier League, should have fresh legs Sunday when it plays at Newcastle. In Florence, Antony crossed for substitute Abdessamad Ezzalzouli in the 97th minute to score past goalkeeper David De Gea for a 2-2 draw that sent Betis to the final. Ezzalzouli also scored in the first-leg 2-1 victory in Sevilla last week. Betis increased its aggregate lead from the first leg to 3-1 with a goal from Antony in the 30th. The midfielder, who is at Betis on loan from Manchester United, netted with a curling free kick that hit the post before bouncing into the net for his fourth goal in the competition. Fiorentinas equalizer  on the evening  came four minutes later from a header by Robin Gosens off a corner kick. Gosens made it 3-3 on aggregate before the interval, heading home again from another corner. Fiorentina was the runner-up in the third-tier club competition in the last two years, losing the finals to West Ham in 2023 and Olympiakos last year. In the second-tier Europa League, Manchester United eliminated Athletic Bilbao on a 7-1 aggregate score after a 4-1 victory at Old Trafford to set up an all English final against Tottenham, which won 2-0 at Bod/Glimt for a 5-1 overall win. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/conference-league-chelsea-fiorentina-betis-d1904d5e021b8406ca481f29bf7a22d6,sports

Alpine promotes Franco Colapinto to replace Jack Doohan for the next 5 Formula 1 Grand Prix races,"LONDON (AP)  Formula 1 team Alpine has changed its driver lineup to promote Franco Colapinto for at least the next five Grand Prix races at the expense of Jack Doohan. Alpine confirmed the change Wednesday, a day after Oliver Oakes quit as team principal. The team said Flavio Briatore will continue as executive advisor and will cover Oakes duties. Colapinto will be paired with Pierre Gasly from the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, ahead of a new evaluation before the British Grand Prix in July, Alpine said in a statement. Alpine is ninth in the F1 constructors standings after six rounds. The next race weekend is May 16-18 at Imola. At Sundays Miami Grand Prix, Doohan ran into another car on the opening lap and then crashed on the second lap. Media reports of a driver rotation were dismissed ahead of the Miami GP weekend by Oakes, who had indicated that the rookie Australian driver would remain in the seat. Doohan, who didnt score a point in his seven GP races and had a best finish of 13th, will revert to being the teams reserve driver. The son of five-time motorcycle world champion Mick Doohan, Jack Doohan made his Formula 1 debut in the last race of 2024 and started this year for Alpine at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. He replaced Esteban Ocon, who left Alpine after a disappointing 2024. Colapinto joined Alpine as a reserve driver in January after racing in 2024 for Williams, where he earned five points after replacing Logan Sargeant in August. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-alpine-driver-colapinto-doohan-387c39d661a442515bb08e66e6d7379c,sports
Oakes resignation from F1 team Alpine came days after police charged brother,"LONDON (AP)  Oliver Oakes resignation as team principal of F1 team Alpine this week came several days after UK police charged his brother with transferring criminal property. Metropolitan Police said William Oakes, 31, was charged last Friday after being stopped the day before in the Silverstone Park area in possession of a large amount of cash. Police said he was remanded in custody after an appearance before the Northampton Magistrates Court on Saturday. It wasnt clear who his attorney is to seek comment. Oliver Oakes had joined Alpine from his junior team, Hitech Grand Prix, where William Oakes also was listed as a director. Hitech did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Oliver Oakes, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, had been Alpines team principal for less than a year when his resignation was announced on Tuesday. A day later, the team confirmed it had changed its driver lineup to promote Franco Colapinto for at least the next five Grand Prix races at the expense of Jack Doohan.

Drake Baldwin drives in the winning run to lift Braves over Reds 5-4 in 11 innings,"ATLANTA (AP)  Drake Baldwin hit an RBI single in the 11th inning to drive in automatic runner Ozzie Albies and give the Braves their fourth win in their last five games, 5-4 over the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday night. Scott Blewett (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings to pick up the win.  The Braves forced extra innings with a two-run rally in the ninth inning. Eli White bunted home Albies with the first run and Michael Harris II drove in pinch runner Eddie Rosario with a single to left field. Harris was 3 for 5 with two RBIs. Taylor Rogers (1-1) took the loss. Rookie Rece Hinds hit a tie-breaking two-run homer off Raisel Iglesias in the ninth inning to give the Reds a 4-2 lead. He was 2 for 3 with two RBIs and a walk in his second game of the season with the Reds. Reds catcher Jose Trevino was 3 for 4 with three doubles and an RBI.  Spencer Schwellenbach lasted six innings and gave up five hits, one run, two walks, five strikeouts. It was his sixth quality start of the season in eight outings and came after he struggled against the Dodgers in his last start. Reds manager Terry Francona was ejected in the 11th inning for arguing a caught stealing call at second base. In the 11th, Baldwin threw out Blake Dunn stealing to end the inning and gives the Braves a chance to win. Braves reliever Pierce Johnson has retired 25 straight batters in his last eight appearances covering 8 1/3 innings. He has nine strikeouts during that stretch.

"Marsh, Turner have RBIs in 10th inning as Phillies sweep Rays with 7-6 win","TAMPA, Fla. (AP)  Brandon Marsh and Trea Turner each had two hits and drove in a run in the 10th inning to cap a comeback from four runs down and lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a 7-6 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday night. Philadelphia tied the score in the ninth, handing Pete Fairbanks his first blown save in nine opportunities. After Kyle Schwarber led off with a single to extend his on-base streak to 43 games, the Phillies lifted him for pinch runner Johan Rojas. Fairbanks then sailed a pickoff attempt over first base, allowing Rojas to advance to third and score on Max Keplers RBI grounder. Marsh led off the 10th with a double to left-center off Manuel Rodriguez (0-1) to drive in pinch-runner Edmundo Sosa, and he scored two batters later on Turners single to center. Junior Caminero hit a solo homer for Tampa Bay in the first and Yandy Daz hit a three-run shot in the seventh to give the Rays a 5-1 lead. Bryson Stott hit a three-run homer, his second hit of the game, off Edwin Uceta to cut the Rays lead to 5-4 in the eighth.  Matt Strahm gave up a run in a shaky 10th and stranded the tying run on second to register his second save. Philadelphia has won nine of its last 11 and handed the Rays their seventh straight loss at Steinbrenner Field, their temporary home this season.  With the score tied in the bottom of the ninth, Taylor Walls singled off Jose Alvarado (4-1). Then, J.T. Realmuto threw out Walls stealing second on a pitch that struck out Diaz. Replay review upheld the Tampa Bay challenge, which appeared to lack definitive footage to overturn the call. Alvarado retired Christopher Morel to send the game to extra innings. 
        
     Phillies starter Jess Luzardo had pitched 40 1/3 innings without allowing a home run until the first inning, when Caminero launched his 2-1 fastball over the left-field wall. Phillies RHP Aaron Nola (1-5, 4.61 ERA) goes against Guardians RHP Gavin Williams (2-2, 5.06). The Rays continue their homestand against Milwaukee, starting RHP Zack Littell (2-5, 4.61) against Brewers LHP Jos Quintana (4-1, 2.83). ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/phillies-rays-score-94b0872d319050c46db25ebc95eae95b,sports
"Moreno hits grand slam off Yamamoto, lifts Diamondbacks to 5-3 win over the Dodgers","PHOENIX (AP)  Gabriel Moreno hit a grand slam off Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Brandon Pfaadt threw 6 1/3 scoreless innings and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3 on Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series between NL West rivals. Shohei Ohtani hit a solo homer in the ninth  his 11th long ball of the season  but the Dodgers have now dropped three of their past five games. Yamamoto (4-3) came into the game with an 0.90 ERA, which led the big leagues, but ran into trouble in the fourth. Pavin Smith walked, Josh Naylor singled and Eugenio Surez was hit by a pitch with no outs before Moreno drove a cutter to right, barely clearing the fence for his first homer of the season. Ketel Marte added a solo homer in the fifth to make it 5-0. Kevin Ginkel worked the ninth for his first save of the year. Pfaadt (6-2) continued his stellar start to the season, giving up four hits, walking three and striking out six. Yamamoto gave up five runs on six hits and a walk, striking out four. Max Muncys ground-rule double and Andy Pages single both scored runs as the Dodgers cut the margin to 5-2 in the eighth. Michael Conforto grounded into a double play to end the rally. The Dodgers were threatening in the eighth before Marte started a spectacular double play to end the threat. The second baseman ranged to his left and snagged Confortos grounder before wheeling and firing to Geraldo Perdomo at second, whose throw to Naylor at first was just in time. 
        
     The Diamondbacks won their 20th game of the year. The NL West is the only division that has four teams with 20-plus wins. The other team is the Colorado Rockies, who are 6-31.

(AP)  Anthony Santander hit a go-ahead, two-run single during Torontos four-run sixth inning, and the Blue Jays snapped their four-game losing streak with an 8-5 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday night. Daulton Varsho homered and drove in three runs on three hits for the Jays, who rallied from an early four-run deficit with 14 hits to avoid a series sweep. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. also had three hits as Toronto won for just the fifth time in 17 games. Taylor Ward and Jo Adell hit early homers for the Angels, who failed to earn their first series sweep. Chris Bassitt (3-2) persevered through six bumpy innings for Toronto, allowing eight hits and striking out six. Chad Green earned his first save of the season one night after Jeff Hoffman, who replaced Green as Torontos closer this year, blew a two-run lead in the ninth. Jos Soriano struggled through five innings for the Angels, yielding three runs on eight hits and four walks. Ward hit a two-run homer in the first, and Adell followed with a solo shot in the second before Zach Neto scored on Bo Bichettes error to put the Halos up 4-0. Varsho had an RBI double and Addison Barger added an RBI single before the decisive rally in the sixth. Varsho connected for his third homer in six games in the eighth. The Jays loaded the bases against Ryan Johnson (1-1) in the sixth before Santander delivered on Brock Burkes first pitch. 
        
     The Jays batted around for the first time this season in the sixth, although they left the bases loaded and stranded 11 total runners in the first six innings.

Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson refuses to dwell on missed calls in Game 2 loss to Pacers,"INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP)  Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson refused to blame officials for what the NBA said were three incorrect no-calls in the final minute  including one that led to Tyrese Haliburtons game-winning 3-pointer  in Indianas 120-119 victory over Cleveland in Game 2 of an Eastern Conference semifinal series on Tuesday night. The NBA said Wednesday in its Last 2-Minute Report on the game that two lane violations and defensive 3 seconds call were missed. The NBA releases those reports the day after games where the margin is three points or fewer at any time in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime. The league said Haliburton should have been called for a lane violation for stepping over the plane of the free throw line before the ball touched the rim on a missed foul shot with 12.4 seconds remaining with Indiana trailing 119-117. Haliburton got the offensive rebound after it was deflected by multiple players, dribbled out to the 3-point line and made the game-winning, step-back shot from the top of the key as the Pacers rallied from a 20-point, second-half deficit to go up 2-0 in the series. Haliburton though wasnt the only player to commit a lane violation on the play. The NBA said multiple players entered the lane. Atkinson  honored as the NBAs Coach of the Year on Monday  said his bigger worries were about how the Cavs lost their lead and how Indiana scored the final eight points in 47.9 seconds to get the victory. 
        
     I think we always have recency bias. So what happened in the last 30 seconds? Its like, howd you lose that 20-point lead, Atkinson said after practice on Thursday. Id say it was coaching decisions, player decisions, and then referee decisions. And we all made mistakes. And then if you put it kind of a ledger, you add all those up and that their minus-20 goes to, oh my gosh. We had plenty of decisions where we could have made it. Im kind of there with that. The NBA also said multiple players committed lane violations with 48 seconds remaining on a missed free throw by Indianas Pascal Siakam. One of the players was Aaron Nesmith, whose dunk off the rebound got the Pacers with 118-113. Clevelands Donovan Mitchell should have been called for a 3-second violation with 15 seconds left. That would have been a technical foul where Indiana should have been awarded one free throw as well as maintaining possession of the ball. While Atkinson has been critical of some of the non-calls and his feeling that some of the physical play has been excessive, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle pointed out that his team has been called for nine more fouls than the Cavaliers. The series shifts to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday. Look, were not expecting any gifts from the refs and I dont think we got any in the first two games. I know they disagreed with some calls, its all part of it, Carlisle said. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-cavaliers-pacers-baba8f7a58206aac79682505f7853460,sports
"Pacers, Nuggets trying to hold court after swinging playoff series with road victories","INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  The Denver Nuggets accomplished one goal by stealing Game 1 of their second-round playoff series at Oklahoma City. The Indiana Pacers were even more productive in Cleveland, sweeping both games. Now the two lower-seeded teams head home for their respective Game 3s on Friday with a new goal  taking advantage of those early road wins by keeping the upper hand in their series. The series isnt over, its far from over, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton said Thursday. This is a team that earned the No. 1 seed for a reason. Its probably rare they lose two games in a row. I dont know the exact number, but it probably doesnt happen often. So were going to see a desperate team, a team thats coming in here to win two games. Actually, the Cavaliers lost three straight during a four-day stretch in late January and four straight during a seven-day stretch in mid-March. Otherwise, theyve been dominant on the road where they earned the leagues third-best mark at 30-11. The Cavs may not even be in this hole if the leagues Last 2-Minute Report is correct. It said Aaron Nesmiths late dunk off a missed free throw and Haliburtons final rebound should have been jump balls because of lane violations by both teams in both cases. Haliburtons rebound led to his winning 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left. Even Donovan Mitchells incredible game  48 points, 17 made free throws and nine assists  wasnt enough to salvage a split. This time, though, Cleveland could be closer to full strength. 
        
     NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley and key backup DeAndre Hunter could both return. They both missed Game 2, Mobley with a sprained left ankle and Hunter with a sprained right thumb. The bigger question is starting guard Darius Garland. Hes missed four straight games with a sprained left big toe.  All three are listed as questionable. They all touched the ball. They all got some reps up, but we didnt do anything live, Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said after Thursdays practice. They kind of participated in the walkthrough and you know, hoping for the best. Haliburton said he intends to play despite with a heavily taped left wrist that he injured in Game 2. Hes a perfect 9-0 when appearing in home playoff games. One person who wont be at the game is Haliburtons father. This will be Indianas first home game since John Haliburton confronted Giannis Antetokounmpo on the court moments after Haliburtons winning layup eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 5. Oklahoma Citys Game 2 performance also shows it can rally in its series. The Thunder endured just two two-game skids this season, making sure it didnt happen a third time with a 43-point victory Wednesday in Game 3. The Thunder also went 35-6 on the road, including an early regular-season split in Denver. Winning the 2023 NBA crown also has given the Nuggets some perspective on how to turn the page after such an embarrassing loss. They were being aggressive, they were hitting us, three-time league MVP Nikola Jokic said. We werent disciplined, and everybody was kind of doing their own thing and we cant play like that. Every single person needs to step up and be better. And playing at home should help  both the Nuggets and the Pacers. Clevelands building was so loud, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. So we need our fans to bring every ounce of energy and noise and everything they have. Each game going forward is going to be a monumental challenge. Their support has meant a lot to us this year and its important right now. When/Where to Watch: Game 3, 10 p.m. EDT (ESPN) Series: Series tied, 1-1. BetMGM says: Nuggets by 4.5. What to know: Oklahoma City became the first team to protect its home court in this round after road teams won each of the first five games, and they did it by setting franchise and league records with an 87-point first half. Nothing went right for the Nuggets. They shot 37.9% from the field, had 20 turnovers and never looked like the team that played Game 1. MVP finalist Shea Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging 33.5 points to lead the Thunder despite sitting out the fourth quarter Wednesday. Jokic knows what must be done: Watch the tape, learn the lessons and move on to a pivotal game that could swing the series. The Thunder need to replicate their Game 2 performance while the Nuggets need to rediscover their Game 1 form. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-2025-pacers-nuggets-thunder-cavaliers-5c5b265a7e1b764980653da997cc2847,sports
Uncomfortable replay of Nuggets blowout loss to OKC in Game 2 essentially a group therapy session,"DENVER (AP)  The Denver Nuggets held what essentially was a group therapy session Thursday after their 43-point demolition at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 2 of their second-round playoff series. You cant just say, Hey, lets just have a mental day. Move on. Were good, we split, interim coach David Adelman said. Thats not the case. If we want to win Game 3 things have to be different. Starting with their mentality, he said. In the NBA playoffs, a lot of the time the whistle and the way the game is played is who hits first, Adelman said. And I thought they hit first, second and third. ... And tomorrow we have to be the aggressor, and I expect us to be. Adelman said the film review, albeit uncomfortable, proved productive. A lot of guys had thoughts on what they felt last night, Adelman said. And that allows you to move on and do things better tomorrow night. Adelman said the general sentiment was one of embarrassment. There was a lot of people speaking up and saying, I can do better, which I love, Adelman said. And then theres the film never lies, that kind of thing. The series shifts to Denver on Friday night, the Nuggets sixth game since April 29 whereas the top-seeded Thunder entered this semifinal series on nine days rest after sweeping Memphis in Round 1.  Denver survived a brutal seven-game series with the Los Angeles Clippers and 48 hours later beat Oklahoma City in the opener on Aaron Gordons 3-pointer that capped a frenetic comeback in the final minutes. 
        
     It all caught up to them Wednesday night when they fell behind in the opening minutes of Game 2 and watched the Thunder run away with it without any real resistance. I dont want to say we werent ready to play, Adelman said. I think we werent ready to play at that level. And when they came out the way they did, I thought our reaction to it took a really long time to understand what kind of game it was. Adelman said of all the things the Nuggets need to correct, it comes down to the mentality of how we play tomorrow. And we had a great mentality in Game 1. People can say, Oh, you were behind in Game 1, too. But it never felt like we let go of the rope. And yesterday I felt we let go of the rope and I felt they also played at an extremely high level. Adelman acknowledged fatigue was a factor in Denvers dismal performance. Ill say this: fatigue is a word you can use when you lose in the playoffs and that is a factor, but fatigue is part of what the postseason is, Adelman said. And finding that next level, your second wind, your third wind, collectively finding energy from each other, is how you win these games. And theres a million ways to break things down: oh, theyre playing more people than you or they had eight days off. All those things are true.

Receiver George Pickens points north with Cowboys after Steelers tenure turned south,"George Pickens says he joins the Dallas Cowboys focused more on a future with quarterback Dak Prescott and fellow receiver CeeDee Lamb than a past of why the Pittsburgh Steelers would trade one of their top playmakers in his prime. Dallas gave up a third-round draft pick next year, and the teams swapped late-round choices in 2027 to end Pickens three-year stint with the Steelers.  There were enough questionable antics for coach Mike Tomlin to declare bluntly last year that the former Georgia star and 2022 second-round pick needed to grow up. He isnt worried about that perception following him to Dallas. I cant really change anyones opinion of me personally, Pickens said in a conference call with reporters Thursday, a day after the trade was announced. I feel like everybody in the world has to grow. You get older and older as you grow. Were trying to build a winning culture, which they already have at the Cowboys. Im just glad to be joining it. The Cowboys werent winners last season, finishing 7-10 to end a three-year stretch of 12-5 playoff seasons. All three of those ended without a trip beyond the divisional round of the playoffs. Dallas is the only NFC team that hasnt played in a conference championship game since the 1995 season, when the Cowboys won their fifth Super Bowl title. Looking to rebound under first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer, Dallas didnt address the need for a No. 2 receiver behind Lamb during the draft. The trade for Pickens might have been why. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones said before the draft the Cowboys were working on a couple of substantive trades. 
        
     Pickens has the skills to match Lamb, who was an All-Pro in 2023 when he set career highs in catches (an NFL-best 135), yards (1,749) and touchdowns (12). The 24-year-old Pickens  two years younger than Lamb  led the Steelers in receiving yards each of the past two seasons and is among the NFLs best in yards per catch. You guys making a 1A, 1B, and all this, honestly, thats the first time Ive heard any of that stuff, Pickens said. I feel like two receivers are kind of normal. When I used to watch football, there was always a good receiver, and then there was also another good receiver on the side of him. Pickens has consistently struggled to keep his emotions in check. Last season alone he twice ended games by getting into dust-ups with opposing defensive backs, first when he grabbed Dallas Jourdan Lewis by the facemask and then when he tussled with Clevelands Greg Newsome II rather than try to get in position for a last-second desperation pass. That doesnt include a fine for using an expletive on his eye black against the Cowboys, a rule he said he was unaware of at the time. Pickens also drew criticism in 2023 for what could generously be described as inattentive downfield blocking for his teammates. Pickens wont have to worry about making nice with Lewis, who signed with Jacksonville as a free agent in March. Prescott was among the first to reach out to Pickens, who will need time to get settled in his new home and meet most of his new teammates. I like the mojo here, Pickens said. I like the swag. Considering Pickens volatility, the Steelers didnt seem interested in a contract extension, and he became expendable when they traded for two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf in March. Metcalf promptly signed a five-year contract. Pickens brushed off the question of signing an extension before the end of his four-year rookie deal this season. Im kind of where my feet are right now, to be honest, Pickens said. Im not really thinking about contract talks. Pickens led the league by averaging 18.1 yards per catch in 2023 and has 174 receptions for 2,841 yards and 12 scores in 48 games. Lamb was a model of consistency and improvement his first four years, and now Pickens is trying to prove he can be reliable in his fourth year. It excites me a lot because ... we can work off each other, Pickens said. Theres no, He gets the ball, I get the ball. Were working off each other. Thats why I always come back to building a winning culture. And thats kind of what weve been talking about in Dallas. ___ AP National Writer Will Graves in Pittsburgh contributed to this report. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/cowboys-george-pickens-c8fdd6ee722417d9b1921c26ccdf4a61,sports
Pakistan moves its T20 cricket tournament to Dubai because of concerns over India conflict,"ISLAMABAD (AP)  The Pakistan Cricket Board has shifted the remaining eight matches of its Pakistan Super League Twenty20 competition to the United Arab Emirates following rising military tensions between India and Pakistan. The PCB confirmed the relocation to Dubai in a statement released early Friday, citing growing concerns among overseas players and the need to prioritize their safety. Once logistical arrangements are completed, the final schedule, including revised dates and venues, will be announced. Rawalpindi, Multan and Lahore were due to host the remaining games. The PCB has always stood by the position that politics and sports need to be kept apart, PSB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement. However, the PCB has decided to shift the remaining matches to UAE. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-india-conflict-tournament-dubai-04ee4a8aa4fce6c8da6c25cd5400d21b,sports
Joel Quenneville hired by Anaheim Ducks for his 1st head coaching job since Blackhawks abuse scandal,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Joel Quenneville returned to hockey Thursday with contrition. He acknowledged mistakes and said he accepted full responsibility for his role in the Chicago Blackhawks sexual assault scandal. The second-winningest coach in NHL history said he is a changed man after nearly four years away from the game. As he took over behind the bench of the Anaheim Ducks, he vowed to continue to educate himself about abuse, to expand his work with victims, and to create an unimpeachably safe workplace with his new team. Quenneville also realizes thats not nearly enough to satisfy a significant segment of hockey fans who believe his acknowledged inaction during the Blackhawks scandal should have ended his career forever. I fully understand and accept those who question my return to the league, Quenneville said. I know words arent enough. I will demonstrate (by) my actions that I am a man of character. Ducks owner Henry Samueli and general manager Pat Verbeek strongly backed the 66-year-old Quenneville when they introduced him as the coach of a franchise stuck in a seven-year playoff drought and thirsting for the success Quenneville has usually orchestrated. He won three Stanley Cups with the Blackhawks and took 20 teams to the playoffs during a quarter-century with four NHL clubs, becoming the most consistent winner of his era. While Quennevilles on-ice record was remarkable, his off-ice behavior in 2010 eventually led to his resignation from the Florida Panthers in October 2021 and a lengthy banishment from the league  a ban that many feel should be permanent. 
        
     I own my mistakes, Quenneville said, occasionally pausing in his delivery of a written statement. While I believed wholeheartedly the issue was handled by management, I take full responsibility for not following up and asking more questions. Thats entirely on me. Over nearly four years, Ive taken time to reflect, to listen to experts and advocates, and educate myself on the realities of abuse, trauma and how to be a better leader. I hope others can learn from my inaction. Quenneville and Blackhawks executives Stan Bowman and Al MacIsaac were banned from the NHL for nearly three years after an independent investigation concluded the team mishandled allegations raised by former player Kyle Beach against video coach Brad Aldrich during the teams first Stanley Cup run. The trio was reinstated last July, and Bowman became the Edmonton Oilers general manager three weeks later. After an investigation and vetting process that lasted several days and included communication with Beach and other sexual assault victims and advocacy groups, the Ducks owners ultimately supported the decision made by Verbeek, Quennevilles teammate in New Jersey and Hartford more than three decades ago. Samueli and his wife, Susan, and their daughter, Jillian, all spoke at length with Quenneville. Henry Samueli said he is absolutely convinced Joel is a really good person. I think the four years that Joel spent out of hockey has really given him an opportunity to learn a lot, Samueli said. In my mind, he will be a model coach for dealing with situations like this. I think he will be a mentor to other coaches in the league who can come to him and talk to him. How do you handle situations like that? What do you do? And theyll trust him, because hes old-school whos changed. The fact that he comes from an old-school hockey culture, but now has transitioned and learned what it means to operate in 2025, not 1980 or whatever, I think that will make a big difference in how he operates. Quenneville understands just how badly his reputation and career were damaged by his role in the Blackhawks handling of the accusations against Aldrich. He remained out of hockey for another season after his ban ended, but became increasingly eager to continue his career last winter while watching games every night and staying closely informed on the league. I thought I had some work to do in growing as a person, Quenneville said. As far as doing work along the way, I felt I had progressed to an area where the education I had put me in a position where I know I can share some of these lessons and these experiences as well. Many people with a firsthand knowledge of Quennevilles attempts to change himself supported his desire to return. Quenneville said he has spoken to Beach several times recently, including Thursday morning. He has formed learning friendships with advocates including Chris Jensen, the former University of Wisconsin player and Maple Leafs draft pick who was abused by a coach as a teenager. I think most of the athletes that have played for him would argue that this guy has helped me be better, Jensen said. He brings all that expertise, and now hes got additional perspective about how to be available to help people deal with emotional injury. I think hes in a much better position to be successful. The Ducks charitable foundation is already involved in charitable and philanthropic work supporting survivors of sexual abuse, and Samueli expects Quenneville to support those efforts. Im very confident that Joel will be a star when it comes to working with those organizations, Samueli said. Before his ban, Quenneville spent parts of 25 NHL seasons behind the benches of St. Louis, Colorado, Chicago and Florida, most notably leading the Blackhawks to championships in 2010, 2013 and 2015. His 969 career victories are the second-most in NHL history, trailing only Scotty Bowmans 1,244. Quenneville takes over a team with the NHLs third-longest active playoff drought. Anaheim finished sixth in the Pacific Division this season at 35-37-10 after being in the bottom two for the previous four consecutive years. He replaces Greg Cronin, who was surprisingly fired by Verbeek after leading the Ducks to a 21-point improvement in his second season. Quenneville inherits an Anaheim team with an ample stock of young talent, and he was immediately impressed by their roster when he saw it in person during Anaheims road trip to Tampa Bay last January. He also coached Ducks captain Radko Gudas and forward Frank Vatrano in Florida. One of the best coaches Ive ever had, and I always tell people that, said Vatrano, who attended Quennevilles introductory news conference. As a person, hes a great person, too. Thats what always draws me to Q. Im a huge advocate for him, and Im glad hes here. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/anaheim-ducks-quenneville-c452a39d30e755665c162e270bd577ac,sports
"Pope Leo XIV brings hope to Chicago sports fans, and the Knicks for their Villanova ties","The sports loyalties of Pope Leo XIV became a topic of conversation almost as soon as the white smoke emerged from the Vaticans Sistine Chapel. Elected on Thursday, Robert Prevost is the first pope from the United States in the history of the Catholic Church. The Chicago-born missionary, who took the name Leo XIV, also attended Villanova University near Philadelphia, where he received a Bachelor of Science in 1977. Chicagos two baseball teams were front and center as sports fans reacted to the news. It was initially reported that the new pope was a Cubs fan. The team congratulated Pope Leo XIV in a post on X that had a picture of Wrigley Fields iconic marquee with the message: HEY, CHICAGO. HES A CUBS FAN! But his brother, John Prevost, set the record straight in an interview with WGN-TV. The pope is a White Sox fan. He was never ever a Cubs fan, so I dont know where that came from. He was always a Sox fan, John said, adding that the confusion might stem from the fact their mothers side of the family were North Siders and Cubs fans. The White Sox posted a clip from the brothers WGN interview on X, along with a picture of the Rate Field videoboard with the message: HEY CHICAGO, HES A SOX FAN! The post read Well, would you look at that... Congratulations to Chicagos own Pope Leo XIV. Family always knows best, and it sounds like Pope Leo XIVs lifelong fandom falls a little closer to 35th and Shields, the White Sox said in a media statement. Some things are bigger than baseball, and in this case, were glad to have a White Sox fan represented at the Vatican. A pinstripes White Sox jersey with his name on it and a hat already are on the way to Rome, and of course, the Pontiff always is welcome at his ballpark. 
        
     The TV interview had White Sox fans wondering about the popes ability to convince owner Jerry Reinsdorf to sell the last-place team. Long-suffering Bears fans weighed in, too. One remarked on X that Chicago developed a pope before the Bears developed a quarterback. Another said the Bears now have a direct line to God. And another said the Bears no longer will be on the wrong side of Hail Marys, a reference to Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels 52-yard Hail Mary completion to Noah Brown to beat the Bears in October. Daaaaaa Pope, Bears quarterback Caleb Williams posted on X on Thursday night. The election of the new pope coincides with a trio of former Villanova players leading the New York Knicks on an NBA playoff run. It didnt take long for a photoshopped picture of the four of them together to show up on social media. The Knicks erased 20-point deficits in winning Games 1 and 2 against the defending champion Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals.  Now fans are praying the combination of the Villanova guys and the new pope can help the team to its first NBA title since 1973. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/pope-leo-prevost-villanova-cubs-bears-4cbba3bb0a8219059fffeb309e534dfd,sports
"Celtics-Knicks ticket for Game 3 in New York is commanding nearly $2,000 on resale market","NEW YORK (AP)  Ticket demand is so great for Saturdays Game 3 of the NBA playoff series between the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks that the average paid ticket price on the resale market approached $2,000 Thursday. The average was $1,956 for Game 3 and $1,716 for Game 4, both at Madison Square Garden, according to ticketing technology company Victory Live, which analyzes transactions, not listings, on the secondary market. The cheapest ticket for Game 3 was $626 on StubHub; for Game 4 it was $613 on Vivid Seats. The Knicks have become the most exciting story in the playoffs, having erased 20-point deficits to beat the defending champion Celtics in the first two games of the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals. The Knicks, eliminated in the conference semifinals the last two years, would reach the Eastern finals for the first time since 2000 if they win two more games against the Celtics. Ticket prices for Knicks home games have surged steadily each day leading into Games 3 and 4.

Stephen Curry says he knows patience will be required when dealing with hamstring injury,"Stephen Curry sat down after the Golden State Warriors went through their shootaround practice in Minneapolis on Thursday, quickly announcing that hes feeling great. He was not telling the truth. Sarcasm, the four-time NBA champion with the Warriors quickly clarified, just in case anyone missed the joke. Curry is going to be a postseason spectator for at least a few games, his Grade 1 hamstring strain bad enough that it forced him out in the second quarter of Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinal series at Minnesota on Tuesday night. He missed the lopsided Game 2 loss to the Timberwolves on Thursday night that evened the series and will likely be sidelined for at least Games 3 and 4 in San Francisco, too. Curry  who is with the team but isnt allowed to do anything basketball-related yet, even stationary shooting  isnt exactly sure how or why the injury happened. Hes never had any hamstring issue of significance before. Its hard to really predict this stuff is what Im learning, Curry said. There were no, like, warning signs or any weird feelings. I felt great the whole game up until that point. And then I made a little pivot move on defense and felt something. Curry thought he would be able to return to Game 1, then quickly realized that wasnt the case. Playing with the strain could have made the issue far worse, Curry said. Hamstrings, hes quickly learning, need time no matter what sort of rehabilitation program he partakes in. 
        
     Obviously, a tough break, Curry said. Hopefully, Ill be back soon. Curry scored 13 points in 13 minutes of Game 1 before his exit, and Golden State went on to a 99-88 win. Buddy Hield, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green combined for 62 points for the Warriors, who held Minnesota to a 5-for-29 clunker on 3-point tries and limited the Timberwolves to 60 points through three quarters. We have a lot of confidence that we can still win the series and guys will step up no matter how it looks, Curry said. And its obviously a situation where you want to think positively and optimistically that we can win games and buy me some time to get back and hopefully have another series after this and be able to be in a position where I can get back out there safely, where Im not putting too much risk on the body if its not ready. Curry, who is averaging a team-best 22 points in these playoffs, can still contribute in small ways even if hes not playing.  The guys obviously revere Steph, and they love his presence and thatll matter to us tonight during the game, coach Steve Kerr said in his pregame interview. Im sure hell be talking to the guys on the sidelines and giving some thoughts. He may come into our huddle and make a suggestion, which I always welcome, so its good to have him here for sure. At one point, when Green picked up his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, two short of an automatic one-game suspension, Curry was concerned enough about his pal getting ejected for a second technical that he went over to the scorers table to try to talk Green down and walk him back to the bench. But not having Curry on the court clearly hurt. Everybody knows its difficult to recreate or even get close to doing what he does, but were going to have to find a way, Butler said. So well go to the tapes, talk about it and execute it to the best of our abilities. ___ AP Sports Writer Dave Campbell in Minneapolis contributed to this report. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/stephen-curry-warriors-hamstring-nba-playoffs-facfbc99e16a52099273a578ae6a3137,sports
F1 signs 10-year extension with Miami Grand Prix that keeps race on calendar through 2041,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Formula 1 announced a 10-year extension with the Miami Grand Prix on Friday that will ensure the event remains on the calendar through 2041. From our standpoint, it enables us to say that this event is here to stay for a very long time, said Tom Garfinkel, managing partner of the Miami Grand Prix. Securing a 10-year extension with Formula 1 through 2041 is an extraordinary milestone for all of us at South Florida Motorsports and a true testament to the hard work of our team, the strength of our partnerships, the support of our community and the growth of the sport in the United States. The race debuted in 2022 as the second F1 race in the United States on the schedule. Sundays running will be the fourth in what was originally a 10-year contract between Miami promoters and F1. There are now three F1 races in the U.S. every year. Las Vegas was added to the schedule in 2023 and F1 also makes a stop at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. F1 president Stefano Domenicali stressed how vital Miami is to the series portfolio as it continues to grow dramatically in the U.S. In just three years, the Miami Grand Prix has established itself as one of the most important and spectacular events on our calendar, an extraordinary example of quality and vision that truly represents the spirit and ambition of Formula 1 in the United States, Domenicali said. Extending this agreement until 2041 is a strategic milestone of enormous importance, which strengthens our presence in America and consolidates the ever-deepening bond with our fan base there, which is constantly growing and passionate like never before. 
        
     The Miami extension comes two days after F1 announced a three-year extension with Mexico City. The difference, though, is that Mexico City in the final year of its existing contract. The Miami race, meanwhile, was touted as a key event in F1s focus on North American growth, as well as the impact the race has on South Florida. The Miami Grand Prix has generated more than $1 billion in economic impact in its first three runnings. South Florida Motorsports, the official promoter, has established internship programs, worked with local charities, and promoted home-grown businesses each year to build a community relationship around the grand prix. South Florida Motorsports was named 2024 F1 Promoter of the Year. Promoters claim a record 275,000 spectators attended three days of activities last year and the race attracted the largest U.S. F1 television audience of all time, with 3.1 million viewers. The Miami Grand Prix is held around Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, home of the Miami Dolphins, the ATP and WTA Miami Open, and seven matches at next years soccer World Cup. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-extension-2041-e5e97f2a14f8e5c57cb1bb3e788cb894,sports
Max Verstappen delighted at birth of his first child with partner Kelly Piquet,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Four-time defending Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen arrived at the Miami Grand Prix on Friday as a first-time father after announcing he and partner Kelly Piquet had welcomed a daughter. Welcome to the world, sweet Lily, Verstappen and Piquet wrote Friday on Instagram. Our hearts are fuller than ever  you are our greatest gift. We love you so much. Verstappen had skipped Thursday activities at this weekends Miami Grand Prix to be with Piquet, the daughter of three-time F1 champion Nelson Piquet. The couple released no details about the birth, including when his daughter was born. Verstappen and Piquet went public with their relationship in 2021. She has a daughter, Penelope, with driver Daniil Kvyat that Verstappen is very close with but this is the first child for Verstappen. Hes going to be a very present father, predicted Christian Horner, Verstappens boss at Red Bull. Im just thinking of the genes of that child  it is quite incredible when you think of it: a Verstappen and then Piquet. If it was a racehorse, it would be worth a fortune. Verstappen joins Nico Hlkenberg as the only active F1 drivers this season with children. Hes joining that club. I hope its a good sleeper, Hulkenberg said. I think theres lots to discover  many beautiful, nice things that come with that. Im sure hell enjoy it. 
        
     Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton said he spoke to Verstappen at F1s last race and could tell the Dutchman was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his child. Its such an amazing, special thing, Hamilton said. I spoke to him briefly in Saudi and saw how excited he was. Big congrats to him. But theres a myth that racers often slow down when they become parents because they begin driving more cautiously and lose some of the edge that made them successful. Judge for yourself, look at the stats and what happens. Everyone is obviously different, but personally, I dont feel thats the case, Hulkenberg said. I feel once we step in the car  visor down, go out  even for me, I tend to forget what goes on outside because were just so focused and so driven to perform and maximize. I just personally feel its added benefit because its giving me so much outside of work and outside of being in Formula 1, he added. So I would even say its kind of been helpful for me, if anything. Horner doesnt believe there will be any change in his star drivers performance. I think hes a pretty measured guy, hes obviously got a step-daughter and he enjoys family life, Horner said. For him, it is business as usual. Hes obviously tremendously proud and its a great thing for him and Kelly to welcome a baby girl. Thats a different achievement and a different perspective for him. Mercedes driver George Russell doubted being a father will change Verstappens on-track performance. As Nico says, I think for many people it probably brings things to your life. I know what its like when I see my nieces and nephews  theyre not my kids, but they bring me so much joy when I spend time with them, Russell said. And youve seen drivers in the past win championships and races whove got kids, so I dont see it changing anything on his professional level. Verstappen, who has 64 career victories, has won the last four F1 titles. Hes won just once this season as McLaren has shown an early edge over Red Bull headed into Sundays race, the sixth of the season. He is third in the series standings. Verstappen won the first two Miami Grand Prix races, while Lando Norris of McLaren scored the first F1 victory of his career at this race last year. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-verstappen-miami-baby-09cb6fa1ce1c4ebf3e876baddefdee3c,sports
"Mobley, Garland and Hunter declared out for Cavaliers going into Game 2 against Pacers","CLEVELAND (AP)  Evan Mobley, Darius Garland and DeAndre Hunter were all declared out for the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night. Top-seeded Cleveland was already facing adversity after dropping Game 1 to the Pacers 121-112 on Sunday night. The Cavaliers havent lost their first two games at home in the playoffs since 1996 against the New York Knicks in the first round. Mobley, the leagues Defensive Player of the Year, and Hunter were both injured in a 26-second span in the fourth quarter Sunday night.  Mobley sprained his left ankle when he was boxed out by Indianas Myles Turner and didnt have room to land after his turnaround hook shot went in. Mobley is averaging 17 points and 7.2 rebounds in the playoffs. Hunter, averaging 23.8 minutes off the bench in the postseason, dislocated the thumb on his right shooting hand after Bennedict Mathurin blocked his running dunk attempt.  Dean Wade will start in place of Mobley, while Ty Jerome gets his first postseason start after Sam Merrill got the call the last three games that Garland was out. Kenny Atkinson, voted the NBAs Coach of the Year on Monday night, was still agitated about the non-calls where his players suffered the injuries. Even if its not malice, we need to see our best players playing in the playoffs, he said before Tuesdays game. This rhetoric going around, people say, Oh man, thats playoff basketball. To me, thats not. As a stakeholder in this, we need to figure out what is acceptable. 
        
     Garland continues to deal with a sprained left big toe. This is the fourth straight playoff game he has missed and has only played two of Clevelands last eight games. Jerome leads all NBA bench players in points (17.2) and assists (5.4) per game so far this postseason. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said he understood where Atkinson was coming from because he noted protecting players is part of a coachs job. Nobody wants to see players here. That disturbs the hell out of us, Carlisle said about the injuries. When you turn in a play to the league, they let the other team know. I dont want to tell you the number of plays we turned in from the Milwaukee series because that was five games. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-cavaliers-garland-mobley-hunter-fa38bf9a73ee82ac91f550ae901dbf67,sports
"Rookie GM Brian Gregory says hes ready to rebuild the Suns, touts closeness with owner Mat Ishbia","PHOENIX (AP)  Brian Gregorys basketball resume has plenty of gravitas thanks to nearly two decades as an NCAA Division I head coach at Dayton, Georgia Tech and South Florida. Thats not why hes the new general manager of the Phoenix Suns. Instead, it is Gregorys 25-year relationship with Suns owner Mat Ishbia that is the major reason hes making the rare transition from college sidelines to an NBA front office. Some may see that as a negative, but Gregory believes his closeness with Ishbia will be an asset as the Suns embark on a difficult rebuild following one of the most disappointing seasons in franchise history. Im never going to shy away from the fact that one of the reasons Im sitting up here is because of my relationship with Mat Ishbia, Gregory said Tuesday. But that relationship is founded on our alignment. Shared values. Shared work ethic. Weve been through a lot together. He trusts me and I trust him. The 58-year-old Gregory was elevated to the general managers role with the Suns last week, with former GM James Jones moving into the role of a senior advisor. Oronde Taliaferro was promoted to assistant general manager and Paul Rivers will add basketball operations responsibilities to his role as chief innovation officer. Gregory was an assistant coach at Michigan State from 1999 to 2003, which was the same time that Ishbia was a walk-on guard for the Spartans.  
        
     Michigan State enjoyed plenty of success during those years, including a national championship in 2000. Now the Ishbia-Gregory pairing will try to recreate that magic for a franchise that has never won a title in its 57-year history despite making the Finals in 1976, 1993 and 2021. The Suns finished last season with a disappointing 36-46 record despite the leagues most expensive roster that included the All-Star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. Booker  a four-time All-Star and franchise icon who has spent all of his 10 seasons in the desert  is the only player who seems certain to return. Gregorys first task this offseason will be hiring a new head coach to replace Mike Budenholzer, who was fired after just one season. It will be the Suns fourth head coach in four years. After that, it will be time to focus on an expensive but flawed roster. Ishbia said last month he wants future Suns teams to feature some grit, some determination, some work ethic, some grind, some joy. We just havent had that. Gregorys most valuable trade chip this summer appears to be Durant, who was still one of the NBAs elite scorers last season at 36. The 15-time All-Star averaged 26.6 points on 53% shooting, shows few signs of slowing and will certainly have multiple suitors during the offseason. Beal  a three-time All-Star  could be much more difficult to unload. The oft-injured guard is due more than $50 million next season, but his production hasnt come close to matching the price tag. Gregory said he likes both players, but wasnt ready to comment on their future in the desert. I have a very good relationship with both those guys, Gregory said. Kevin gave me a nice hug in the weight room the other night when the news came across Twitter. Had a great dinner with Brad Beal last Thursday and we talked a little about summer plans and different things like that. My main focus, to be honest with you, is finding the right head coach for those guys. Gregory joined the Suns in 2023 and served in several roles, most recently as the vice president of player programming. He had major input in the Suns selecting Ryan Dunn and Oso Ighodaro in last years draft and both had promising moments during their rookie seasons.

"Thunder, Celtics look to bounce back after series-opening losses to Knicks, Nuggets","The Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder looked very much like the dominant teams they were during the regular season in securing lopsided first-round playoff series wins.  Suddenly, both teams are facing their first dose of adversity this postseason following Game 1 losses to open Round 2. The Celtics missed an NBA playoff-record 45 of their 60 3-pointers and blew a 20-point lead in a 108-105 overtime loss to the New York Knicks.  Meanwhile, the Wests top-seeded Thunder will look to recover after surrendering a 42-point scoring night to Nikola Jokic and 3-pointer to Aaron Gordon in the closing seconds of their 121-119 loss to the Denver Nuggets. This isnt the first time weve handled adversity, Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Tuesday. This isnt the first time weve handled adversity in the playoffs. The team has made a great habit of that. We have to continue to do that. For Boston, it was a stunning result for a team that was 4-0 against its longtime rival during the regular season. Most glaring was the Celtics performance from beyond the arc in clutch time during Game 1 against the Knicks. In the clutch, defined as the final five minutes of fourth quarter or overtime when the scoring margin is five points or less, the Celtics were just 1-for-8 from 3. In their 11 clutch losses during the regular season, Boston shot just 12-for-44 (27.3%) from 3. 
        
     Still, coach Joe Mazzulla said it isnt something that needs a dramatic overcorrection heading into Game 2. You have to be able to make open shots, Mazzulla said Tuesday. If the open ones go in, were not having this conversation. New Yorks Josh Hart is confident their victory wasnt just courtesy of a fluke shooting night by Boston. I think its two-fold, right? Because I dont think we played our best basketball, Hart said. Why are they not playing well? Is it because theyre just off that day or is it because of good defense or the other team is playing well and forces them into playing that kind of style? The Celtics were 19-2 during the regular season in games following a loss and are 4-0 over the past two postseasons (1-0 in the first round against Orlando).  The rub? Of Bostons 21 losses during the regular season, 13 were at home. Weve always bounced back, guard Derrick White said. I dont expect nothing different now. When/Where to Watch: Game 2, 7 p.m. EDT (TNT) Series: Knicks lead, 1-0 BetMGM says: Celtics by 10.5 What to Know: The Celtics have thrived the past two seasons taking and making a high volume of 3-pointers. That strategy failed them in Game 1 against the Knicks, on a night in which the defending NBA champions took 60 3-pointers and had an NBA playoff-record 45 misses on their way to blowing a 20-point second-half lead in their 108-105 overtime loss. The Knicks will be looking to build on a night in which they seemed to confound Boston with multiple switches on defense and got big scoring nights from All-Star Jalen Brunson, who finished with 29 points. Boston starting center Kristaps Porzingis and reserve Sam Hauser are both day to day after leaving Game 1 early. Porzingis played for only 13 minutes before sitting out the second half with an illness. Hauser left with a sprained right ankle. Mazzulla said Porzingis has ongoing effects from an illness that sidelined him for a stretch of games late during the regular season.  When/Where to Watch: Game 2, 9:30 p.m. EDT (TNT) Series: Nuggets lead, 1-0 BetMGM says: Thunder by 11.5 What to Know: Itll be Game 2 of the matchup between Denvers Nikola Jokic and Oklahoma Citys Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, two of the three MVP finalists. Denver rallied from a double-digit deficit in the last five minutes of Game 1 to win 121-119 and handed the Thunder their first loss since April 6. Jokic went off for 42 points and 22 rebounds in the victory. The Nuggets outrebounded Oklahoma City 63-43 and scored 27 second-chance points while getting Oklahoma City big men Isaiah Hartenstein and Chet Holmgren into foul trouble. Jokic committed five fouls in the opener, and he often initiated contact while using his experience to avoid fouling out. He received a flagrant-1 for elbowing Lu Dort in the head in the fourth quarter. A key to the series going forward might be how physical a style the 7-foot, 284-pound Jokic is allowed to play. Gilgeous-Alexander had 33 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in Game 1, but didnt get the usual help from his teammates. Oklahoma Citys second All-Star, Jalen Williams, went 5 for 20 and scored 16 points in the opener. He rarely strings bad games together. ___ AP Sports Writer Cliff Brunt in Oklahoma City contributed to this story. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-knicks-celtics-nuggets-thunder-4f33a5eff7c8cfdb6ee78339bdf863af,sports
OKCs Sam Presti picked as the NBAs executive of the year,"Sam Presti of the Oklahoma City Thunder was announced Tuesday as the NBAs executive of the year, the reward for building that team into a juggernaut that won a league-best 68 games this season. It is Prestis first time winning the award and the first time since 1994 that the franchise  which was then called the Seattle SuperSonics  had its top executive voted as the winner. Bob Whitsitt won it that season. Presti, the Thunders executive vice president and general manager, got 10 first-place votes from a panel of 30 basketball executives  one from each of the NBAs teams  who ranked their top three choices in order. Presti appeared on 22 of those 30 ballots. An award such as this is really the result of our players and their commitment to our program, Presti said. They push themselves in all capacities for the good of the team. Im fortunate to work with this particular collection of men and I do not take their professionalism for granted. We have an incredible coaching staff and support staff, many who have been here for over ten years as the team behind the team, and I see their excellence day to day, in ways that are invisible but invaluable to a sustainable organization. Clevelands Koby Altman was second with six first-place votes, after the Cavaliers won 64 games and finished atop the Eastern Conference standings. Detroits Trajan Langdon also got six first-place votes and was third, after the Pistons went from a 14-win team to a 44-win playoff team in his first year leading that front office. 
        
     Houstons Rafael Stone (four first-place votes) was fourth, the Los Angeles Clippers Lawrence Frank (one first-place vote) was fifth and the Los Angeles Lakers Rob Pelinka (also one first-place vote) was sixth. Pelinka engineered the biggest trade of the season, the one that brought Luka Doncic to the Lakers from the Dallas Mavericks  but was listed on only five of the 30 ballots cast. Golden States Mike Dunleavy was seventh, Brooklyns Sean Marks and 2024 award winner Brad Stevens of the Boston Celtics (both of whom got one first-place vote) tied for eighth, and New Yorks Leon Rose was 10th. Sacramentos Monte McNair was 11th, while Orlandos Jeff Weltman and San Antonios Brian Wright tied for 12th. This was not a one-year jump by the Thunder. Presti and the Thunder brought in Mark Daigneault as coach five years ago; the first season resulted in 22 wins, then 24 in 2021-22, then 40 in 2022-23. But the last two seasons, plans became reality: Led by MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Thunder won 57 games last season and 68 this season. I look at it like its a tremendous privilege to be able to do it, Presti said at the start of the season when asked about his job. Eventually someone else is going to be the person thats doing it, and for me, while Im serving the position, I think Ive said this in the past, its not my job, its the Thunders job. Im just serving the position the best that I can and hopefully doing a good job with it for as many people as possible, and I enjoy it. The executive of the year award is not like most NBA season honors that are voted on by a global panel of 100 writers and broadcasters who cover the league and cast ballots shortly after the end of the regular season. Awards that were part of that voting process and have already had their results unveiled: Clevelands Kenny Atkinson winning Coach of the Year, Atlantas Dyson Daniels winning Most Improved Player, San Antonios Stephon Castle winning Rookie of the Year, Clevelands Evan Mobley winning Defensive Player of the Year, New Yorks Jalen Brunson winning Clutch Player of the Year, and Bostons Payton Pritchard winning Sixth Man of the Year. Other awards announced by the league since the end of the regular season: Golden States Stephen Curry won the Twyman-Stokes teammate of the year award, Warriors teammate Draymond Green won the hustle award and Bostons Jrue Holiday won the sportsmanship award for the second time in his career. The leagues social justice champion will be revealed Wednesday. Major awards that will be announced later in the playoffs include MVP (either Gilgeous-Alexander, Denvers Nikola Jokic or Milwaukees Giannis Antetokounmpo), plus the All-NBA, All-Rookie and All-Defensive teams. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-executive-of-year-sam-presti-cb7bb9e03533fe91ba90bbf7bba5777a,sports
Moving up 4th in the NHL draft in the lottery adds to the Utah Hockey Clubs exciting summer,"When the Utah Hockey Club selected Tij Iginla with the sixth pick and took 10 other players in the first draft since the team moved to Salt Lake City, fans were excited, thinking they would be in the NHL right away. General manager Bill Armstrong tried to temper expectations, telling them, No, it takes some time. After an unexpected victory off the ice Monday night in the draft lottery, the expectations for the clubs future are Rocky Mountain high once again.  Utah won the second random draw of lottery balls to move up from the 14th pick to No. 4, adding to an already momentous summer that could feature a free agent spending spree with tons of salary cap space and an owner not afraid to spend money, the first phase of massive arena renovations taking place and the full-time name getting unveiled before next season. Its a game-changer for us, Armstrong said on a post-lottery video call with reporters. These are exciting times for Utah. ... Just great stuff for the franchise. I cant express in words on the excitement of when that happened and the opportunity in front of us. Armstrong has over $22 million in room, and with Ryan Smiths ownership group in charge, theres every indication Utah can spend to the annually increasing cap. That was never the case under a procession of penny-pinching owners over the past decade as the Arizona Coyotes. Utah committed $80 million-plus in player salaries this past season, and Smith Entertainment Group along with the city are investing plenty to upgrade downtown Delta Center and increase the capacity of full-ice views to over 16,000 for hockey in an arena initially designed and built primarily for basketball for the NBAs Jazz. 
        
     We are excited for the challenge as we kick off this never-before-done renovation project, Ryan and wife Ashley Smith said last week. This transformation will create the most compelling, welcoming and exciting experience for hockey fans, while also allowing us to maintain the steep vertical seating for basketball that has made Delta Center such a dynamic venue. And, possibly soon, a venue for playoff hockey. Utah was in the race until the final few weeks of the season before finishing seven points out of the second and final wild-card spot in the Western Conference. We were a pretty good team that chased it down the stretch playing meaningful games and chasing a playoff spot, Armstrong said. Were getting to that point where were becoming a really good team thats going to have a chance to get into the playoffs. Not counting the expanded pandemic playoffs in 2020, this organization has not qualified since 2012. The building blocks to end that decade-plus drought are there, from captain Clayton Keller and 2022 No. 3 pick and budding star Logan Cooley to two-time Stanley Cup-winning defenseman Mikhail Sergachev  acquired at the draft last year  and top goaltender Karel Vejmelka. And after drafting a league-high 42 players over the past four years, there might be a temptation to use the fourth pick for immediate help, like someone who is established but still young and entering or in his prime. Thats something that obviously well always talk about, Armstrong said. Well never shut that door. Thats always been an avenue for us to get players, and were at the position right now as a team where were trying to make that next step, so well always look at that. Thats part of the process. The final step in the naming process is happening, too. The finalists have been narrowed down to Mammoth, Outlaws and Utah Hockey Club, complete with a permanent logo and new jerseys. If the branding process goes as swimmingly as the first year with Smiths group in charge, the results on the business side could even exceed the hockey progress.  They made a lot of promises, and they exceeded them with what they accomplished in a short period of time, Commissioner Gary Bettman said last week at a meeting of Associated Press Sports Editors in New York. What they accomplished is a testament to Ryan and everybody out there. They dreamed big and they accomplished everything they needed to do, and were thrilled to have them in the league. Its been an incredibly positive experience, and the players love it, too. More high-quality players are coming next year and into the future, though Armstrong cautioned that the lottery doesnt speed up the building process and, One picks not going to change our franchise. But that doesnt dull the internal excitement. Youve got a chance to get a real game-changer, Armstrong said. Were going to have the opportunity to pick a real good player high in the draft and take a big swing here. ___ AP Sports Writer Jake Seiner in New York contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/utah-hockey-club-summer-bdcb2b2eaa5f771b56084144ce23f9b2,sports
Nylander has 2 goals and an assist as Maple Leafs beat Panthers 5-4 in Game 1 of 2nd round series,"TORONTO (AP)  William Nylander got the Toronto Maple Leafs off to a fast start in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Nylander scored twice in the first period before adding an assist as Toronto built a big lead before holding on to beat the Florida Panthers 5-4 on Monday night in the series opener. Matthew Knies and Chris Tanev each had a goal and an assist, and Morgan Rielly also scored for the Maple Leafs. Max Pacioretty and Jake McCabe each had two assists. Weve been in tight games throughout the season, Nylander said. We dug into that and tried to bear down. Anthony Stolars stopped eight of the nine shots he faced before leaving in the second period after he took an elbow to the head from Panthers forward Sam Bennett, who wasnt penalized on the play. The Maple Leafs said the 31-year-old was being evaluated, but provided no further update. Elbow to the head, Toronto coach Craig Berube said. Clear as day. ... I get it, they miss calls. But its clearly a penalty. Joseph Woll stopped 17 shots in relief.  Seth Jones, Eetu Luostarinen, Uvis Balinskis and Sam Bennett scored for the Panthers, and Brad Marchand and Carter Verhaeghe each had two assists. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 24 shots. Florida beat Toronto in five games in the second round in the 2023 playoffs on the way to reaching the Stanley Cup Final. The Panthers went one step further last year when they won the Cup for the first time in franchise history. 
        
     Game 2 is Wednesday back at Scotiabank Arena, before shifting to South Florida for two games. Toronto opened the scoring just 33 seconds after puck drop when Nylander beat Bobrovsky through the five-hole from a tight angle for his fourth goal of the playoffs. The Maple Leafs, who beat Ottawa in six games in the first round to register just the second series win for the Original Six franchise in more than two decades, went up 2-0 with 7:09 left in the first when Nylander scooped up a rebound before deking Bobrovsky to the ice and roofing his second of the period. He came out and was feeling it, Rielly said of the slick winger. That helps set the tone. Jones got the Panthers on the board with a shot from the point through traffic on a power play with 3:03 remaining for his second of the postseason. Toronto restored its two-goal lead just 19 seconds later when Nylander sent Rielly off to the races on a 2-on-1 with John Tavares. The defenseman and longest serving member of the current roster looked Bobrovsky off before firing past the goalies blocker for his third of the postseason. Obviously it wasnt a great start by us, Panthers forward Aleksander Barkov said. We knew they were going to come hard and strong. Florida, which beat the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games to advance, got a man advantage in the second that saw Stolarz make a couple of stops, but Bennett caught him with a sneaky elbow to the back of the head. Toronto made it 4-1 at 7:50 when Tanevs knuckling shot from distance fooled Bobrovsky for his first. Stolarz, who backed up Bobrovsky on the way to Floridas Cup win a year ago, was seen on television vomiting by the bench a few minutes later before getting replaced by Woll. Nylander had a chance to complete the first playoff hat trick of his career on a shot that knocked the stick out of Bobrovskys hand but the puck stayed out as the Maple Leafs headed to the locker room up three. Luostarinen cut the deficit back to two on a redirection 1:41 into the third, and Balinskis then made it 4-3 at 4:30 after a Panthers push inside a suddenly tense building. We didnt look like ourselves, Florida head coach Paul Maurice said of his teams opening period. And then (we) righted it in the second and after that had a pretty good push in the third. Toronto failed to connect on two power plays later in third before Bobrovsky denied Max Domi on a break. Knies made it 5-3 with 6 minutes left in regulation with a move to the backhand on another breakaway. Bennett got his team back within one with 1:55 left in regulation on a pinballed shot off a Toronto stick, but Woll and the Maple Leafs held the fort late to secure an early lead in the series. That was nice for us, Nylander said. But were just focused on next game now. The Panthers were without defenseman Aaron Ekblad, who finished off a two-game suspension for his headshot on Tampa Bay forward Brandon Hagel in the opening round. The Maple Leafs have three players from the Panthers championship team  Stolarz, defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Steven Lorentz. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/panthers-maple-leafs-score-nhl-playoffs-fbba4f1009cfe6367828ddf510c8f28f,sports
Maple Leafs goalie Anthony Stolarz leaves Game 1 against the Panthers with an apparent head injury,"TORONTO (AP)  Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Anthony Stolarz left Game 1 of the teams second round series against Florida on Monday night with an apparent head injury. Stolarz took an elbow to the back of the head from Panthers forward Sam Bennett shortly before his departure. He also took a puck to the mask, knocking it off his head, earlier. Elbow to the head, clear as day, coach Craig Berube said afterward when asked bout Bennett making contact with Stolarz, who he added was being evaluated. Im not sure why theres not a call on it. I get it. They miss calls. But its clearly a penalty. Florida coach Paul Maurice said officials were nearby and did not believe it to be a penalty.  Hopeful for Anthony and his health, Maurice said. Love that guy and hope he gets better real fast. Television replays appeared to show Stolarz vomiting into a bucket by the team bench before leaving midway through the second period. The team said he was under evaluation. Backup Joseph Woll entered for his first NHL game action since April 17, with Toronto leading 4-1. Woll allowed three goals on 20 shots, but the Leafs held on to beat the defending Stanley Cup champions 5-4. Hopefully the league will handle it and protect our players, said Matthew Knies, who scored the winning goal. Stolarz, who has a Cup ring from backing up Sergei Bobrovsky last year, played all six games in the Leafs first-round series win over Ottawa, posting a 2.21 goals-against average and .901 save percentage. The 31-year-old won 12 of 14 starts going back to the regular season before getting injured. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/maple-leafs-stolarz-6b0cac6f9ca02e17eeb7091a535b74ca,sports
"New York Islanders win the NHL draft lottery, securing the No. 1 selection. Sharks will pick second","New York Islanders pro scouting director Ken Morrow knows a thing or two about so-called hockey miracles. Witnessing the Islanders win the NHL draft lottery on Monday and vault nine other teams in the order for the right to have the No. 1 pick represented yet another memorable moment for the four-time Stanley Cup champion and member of the 1980 gold-medal-winning Miracle on Ice U.S. Olympic team. Ive had a lot of thrills in my hockey life, but this is right up there at the top, Morrow said. The hockey gods smiled on us. I cant tell you how thrilled I am for Islanders fans, for our ownership, for the entire Islanders organization. The Islanders, who missed the playoffs for the second time in four seasons, are in the midst of a front-office shakeup after not renewing general manager Lou Lamoriellos contract on April 22. And they earned a remarkable lottery win by entering the day with a 3.5% shot  the 10th-best odds  of seeing their numbers come up. New York wasnt the only team to buck the lottery odds. The Utah Hockey Club won the second round of the lottery, and made the jump from 14th to fourth under the rules limiting teams from moving up no more than 10 spots in the draft order. A couple of seconds ago, we were just like 10 back, so it still hasnt sunk in, Utah GM Bill Armstrong said of a first-year franchise that finished just seven points out of a playoff spot. This is an exciting moment for us. Its a game-changer for us. 
        
     The San Jose Sharks will pick second after entering the day with the best odds, 18.5%, to win the lottery and a 25.5% chance of landing the No. 1 choice. San Jose, which finished last for a second consecutive year, was seeking to become the NHLs first team to win the lottery and pick first in consecutive years. We definitely lucked it out last year to be able to select Mac, Sharks GM Mike Grier said in referring to selecting Boston University center Macklin Celebrini first overall. This year would have obviously been nice to have the pick and have the choice of all the players. But picking two, were still in a pretty good spot so were happy. The Chicago Blackhawks had the second-best chances to win the lottery and will pick third. The remaining 12 teams moved two spots back in the order, starting with Nashville dropping from third to fifth. The final 16 draft spots will be determined following the playoffs. The Islanders have the right to pick first for the fifth time in team history, and first since selecting John Tavares with the No. 1 choice in 2009. This years draft will be held in Los Angeles with the first round taking place on June 27, followed by the final six rounds the next day. Top prospects will convene for the weeklong predraft combine being held in Buffalo next month. The prospect pool is not considered as deep at the top as last years class, or next years group, with Canadian junior forward Gavin McKenna long regarded as the No. 1 candidate. Erie Otters defenseman Matthew Schaefer is NHL Central Scoutings top-ranked North American prospect followed by OHL Saginaw center Michael Misa and Boston College center James Hagens, the top-ranked U.S. born prospect. Hagens is from Long Island and grew up an Islanders fan. Listed at 6-foot-2 and 183 pounds, Schaefer maintained his No. 1 position despite missing the final three months of the season after breaking his right collarbone representing Canada at the world junior championships in December. Schaefer has the potential of becoming only the fifth defenseman selected No. 1 since 2000, and first since Buffalo chose Owen Power in 2021. And he also has the chance of being the first OHL player to go No. 1 since Edmonton drafted Eries Connor McDavid in 2015. The top-ranked international skaters are center Anton Frondell and right wing Victor Eklund, who are teammates with Djurgarden of Swedens second division league. New Yorks jump from 10th to first is the biggest involving a team winning the No. 1 selection. And it comes after the last-place team won the lottery to retain the first pick in four of the past five years and 12 times overall since the NHL launched the format in 1995.  The New York Rangers enjoyed the previous largest move up to No. 1 in 2020, when they were grouped among eight teams  ranked eighth to 15th  with the same odds to win the lottery after being eliminated in the COVID-altered play-in round of the expanded 24-team playoff format. The lottery was held at the NHL Network studios in New Jersey, and conducted live for the first time in the events 30-year history. Previously, the lottery was held shortly before the broadcast in front of a limited audience of sequestered observers, followed by the draft selections being revealed in reverse order. ___ AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno and AP sports writer Josh Dubow contributed to this story. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-draft-lottery-sharks-islanders-f302b48843e7e9b64d7546dc2ca8199c,sports
"Jeff Sperbeck, former agent for John Elway, dies after injury at 62","LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP)  Jeff Sperbeck, a business partner and former agent for NFL Hall of Famer John Elway, died Wednesday after suffering an injury last weekend at a Southern California golf resort community. He was 62. No cause of death was released, but the Riverside County coroners office said Sperbeck was injured Saturday and the address listed for the incident belongs to The Madison Club in La Quinta. The Riverside County Fire Department said the agency was called to that location on Saturday after someone fell out of a golf cart. The person, who wasnt identified, was taken to a trauma center, said department spokesperson Maggie Cline De La Rosa. The sheriffs department said it is investigating the golf cart incident. Elway was at the scene of the crash, witness Ali Simon told KESQ-TV of Palm Springs. Simon said she did not see the accident occur but saw a man lying on the ground surrounded by people and Elway on the phone. I am absolutely devastated and heartbroken by the passing of my close friend, business partner and agent Jeff Sperbeck, Elway said in a statement Wednesday. There are no words to truly express the profound sadness I feel with the sudden loss of someone who has meant so much to me. My heart and deepest sympathies go out to Jeffs wife, Cori; his children Carly, Sam and Jackson; and everyone who knew and loved him. Jeff will be deeply missed for the loyalty, wisdom, friendship and love he brought into my life and the lives of so many others. Elways statement did not address his presence at the scene. 
        
     Sperbeck began managing Elway in 1990, when Elway was quarterback for the Denver Broncos. He represented more than 100 NFL players during a three-decade career as an agent and business adviser.  He was best known as Elways longtime friend, business partner and agent who helped manage the Hall of Famers extensive off-field business empire, which included restaurants, car dealerships and a winery. Sperbeck managed Elways marketing and business ventures, and the two collaborated with winemaker Rob Mondavi Jr. in 2015 to co-found 7Cellars by John Elway. He also co-founded Sullivan & Sperbeck, a sports marketing firm that was acquired by Octagon in 2001. Sperbeck directed Octagons football division from 2001-09, when he started The NOVO Agency, a sports management firm where he served as CEO and represented dozens of current and retired NFL players and coaches. The agency merged with Rep1 Sports in 2018. Sperbeck was involved in numerous charitable endeavors.",https://apnews.com/article/john-elway-agent-jeff-sperbeck-dies-golf-cart-f6be4138b8bb50149e1f8d2cd7f3fc7b,sports
"Jets pick up 5th-year contract options of Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson and Jermaine Johnson","The New York Jets exercised the fifth-year contract options for all three of their 2022 first-round draft picks: cornerback Sauce Gardner, wide receiver Garrett Wilson and edge rusher Jermaine Johnson. The moves, announced by the team Wednesday, were expected after general manager Darren Mougey said last week the Jets would exercise the options on the three who are considered foundation-type players. Gardner, Wilson and Johnson have been bright spots during a rough stretch for a franchise that has the NFLs longest active playoff drought at 14 seasons.  According to Over the Caps projections on the fifth-year options that kick in during the 2026 season, Gardner would receive $20.2 million, Wilson $16.8 million and Johnson $13.4 million  with the salaries guaranteed. Gardner, the No. 4 overall pick in 2022, is a two-time All-Pro selection who was the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year and is regarded as one of the NFLs top cornerbacks.  Wilson, selected 10th overall, was the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year and has more than 1,000 yards receiving in each of his first three seasons  the first player in franchise history to do so. He has 279 catches for 3,249 yards and 14 touchdowns. Johnson, who was taken 26th after then-GM Joe Douglas traded back into the first round to select him, was a Pro Bowl pick in 2023 before tearing his right Achilles tendon in Week 2 last year. He has 10 career sacks and is expected to be ready for this upcoming season. 
        
     Officially here for Year 5!! Johnson posted on X. Just want to take a little time to thank the Jets organization, Darren Mougey, Aaron Glenn and Woody Johnson for their belief in me and who I am on and off the field. Though I know it sounds corny, but it couldnt be more true, Ive barely scratched the surface. As always, yall will get everything I got.

Jets announce QB Jordan Travis is retiring from playing football after long comeback attempt,"Jordan Travis pushed through the struggles of a long and valiant comeback attempt from a serious leg injury until he was told it was time to finally walk away. The New York Jets announced Wednesday that the quarterback informed them he will retire from playing football, a surprising NFL ending for the 24-year-old former Florida State star. Travis hurt his left leg during a game against North Alabama in November 2023, the last time he played in a game at any level. His left leg rolled under a defender, twisting his ankle awkwardly and fracturing it. Travis was a fifth-round draft pick last year but spent last season on the Jets non-football injury list. The team will now place him on the reserve/retired list. On November 18, 2023, my life took an unexpected turn, Travis said in a statement released by the Jets. I gave everything I had to the rehab process but despite all my efforts, my leg never responded the way we hoped. After much prayer and consultation with the doctors, medical experts and my agent, Ive been medically advised to retire from the game I love so deeply. Travis, who finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting that year, completed 63.9% of his passes with 20 TDs and two interceptions  improving his draft stock while leading the Seminoles to an 11-0 start before his injury. Shortly after being drafted, Travis acknowledged he had thought about someday replacing Aaron Rodgers as New Yorks quarterback. He also insisted he never had any doubts he would recover from his injury and play again. 
        
     No, sir. Never, he said last May. I mean, I love adversity. I love waking up every single day and having to make a choice. It just makes the story a whole lot cooler. Ive always said that, from the day I broke my leg until now. I love it, man. So, no, theres never been a doubt in my mind. Travis agent Deiric Jackson told ESPN in March that the Jets tried to rush the quarterbacks rehabilitation and that caused a setback in his recovery. The team said it followed the plan created by Travis surgeon, and Jackson was optimistic the quarterback would be ready for this season. Jets general manager Darren Mougey declined to comment on Travis last week during the draft when he was asked about his recovery. Jordan has informed us of his intent to retire due to the injury he sustained while at Florida State, Mougey said in a statement Wednesday. It is unfortunate that he was unable to get back on the field after working so hard. We support his decision and wish him only the best. In a hand-printed note posted on his X account, Travis said he was overwhelmed with gratitude as he reflected on his journey. He included his statement that was shared by the Jets and thanked the team for believing in me and providing me with the opportunity to live out the ultimate dream. He also thanked his familiy, friends, coaches and teammates for their support. It is crazy how fast life can change, Travis wrote. This is not the ending I had ever imagined, but I do trust The Lords Plan above all else. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/jets-jordan-travis-b5238f1356fb8461e58a53278d5ca5d9,sports

Indiana Fever exercise 4th-year option to keep Aliyah Boston through 2026 season,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  The Indiana Fever made the long expected move Friday to exercise the fourth-year option on forward Aliyah Boston, assuring shes on the roster through the 2026 season. When Boston finished her college career at South Carolina, she became the No. 1 overall pick in 2023, became the first rookie to lead the league in field goal percentage (57.6%) and was the unanimous selection as the WNBAs rookie of the year. Last season, Boston teamed up with reigning rookie of the year Caitlin Clark and others to lead the Fever to the WNBA playoffs for the first time in eight years. Boston has averaged 14.2 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.2 blocks and was an All-Star selection in each of her first two pro seasons.

Paige Bueckers talks about her investment stake in Unrivaled league on Good Morning America,"NEW YORK (AP)  Paige Bueckers is ready to start not just her WNBA career with the Dallas Wings but her career as a businesswoman as well. The longtime UConn star, who was picked first overall by the Wings on Monday night, confirmed during an appearance on Good Morning America on Wednesday that she is an investor in Unrivaled, which just completed its inaugural season. Bueckers deal with the 3-on-3 league is expected to be far more lucrative than her four-year WNBA rookie contract. The average Unrivaled salary was more than $220,000. Her four-year WNBA deals base salary would be just under $350,000. I mean, investments in womens sports  I feel like the return on investment has been amazing, Bueckers said. Even the first year (of Unrivaled), the numbers were shocking. They just blew it out of the water. And just to invest so much in womens sports, its growing at an all-time high, and its just a great time to be in womens sports. Bueckers, who led UConn to the NCAA title on April 6, is just the latest high-profile investor in Unrivaled. In December, the league announced $28 million in funding from a group that included Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo, South Carolina womens basketball coach Dawn Staley and USC star JuJu Watkins. Other investors include tennis star Coco Cauff, retired soccer star Alex Morgan and retired NBA star Carmelo Anthony. Before she steps on the floor for Unrivaled, though, Bueckers has her rookie WNBA season awaiting her. 
        
     After making the talk-show rounds, which included a stop by The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Bueckers will be headed to Texas to do appearances and prepare for training camp, which begins April 27. The Wings open the season May 16 against the Minnesota Lynx, and they face Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever on June 27, which could represent a summit showdown of the two players expected to be the face of the league for the foreseeable future. Just to join a city and organization that embraces you, Ive felt so much love already and I havent even set foot in Dallas yet, Bueckers said. Everyone has been loving me and embracing me with open arms. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/paige-bueckers-wnba-good-morning-america-561eb33b530c5fae66e93eedd41244f2,sports
WNBA draftees turn attention to making rosters as training camp opens in a few weeks,"NEW YORK (AP)  Paige Bueckers will be heading to Dallas, the latest transcendent college star to go No. 1 in the WNBA draft. Her spot is assured with the Wings. It may be tough for a lot of the other 37 players drafted Monday night to make teams when training camps open in less than two weeks. The WNBA has notoriously been one of the toughest leagues to make. Even with the addition of the expansion Golden State Valkyries this season, theres a maximum of 156 roster spots in the league. Last years draft class headlined by Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese had 13 players make opening day rosters, which was down two from the previous season and four from 2022. Many teams draft international players to stash them overseas until potentially having them join the franchise at a future date. The league is growing on and off the court. Last season had record viewership and attendance, which has led to huge optimism in the WNBA heading into the season which begins on May 16. While this season is in a good place, the league and players union are working on a new collective bargaining agreement that will need to be decided before the 2026 season takes place. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said shes optimistic about coming to a transformational CBA at some point. She described the talks being in the early phases. Players are looking for higher salaries, a new economic model and improved benefits. We want to have a fair deal for all, but it has to be within the confines of a sustainable economic model that goes on for 10 years, she said. 
        
     Salaries are going to be a huge part of the negotiations. They are expected to grow exponentially in the new CBA with the 11-year media rights deal the WNBA signed last July that will bring in at least $200 million a year. That deal goes into effect next year. Bueckers is going to make around $78,000 this year in base salary. Thats slightly more than Clark and Reese made last season under the current rookie contract scale. All three have supplemented that income with huge endorsement deals with companies such as Nike, Gatorade, Bose and State Farm. Those deals started when they were in college. Prioritization will also be a key point in negotiations between the players and the league. Three of the top 10 picks in the draft were international players  tied for the most in league history. The WNBA has had stiff penalties over the past few seasons for veteran players who dont make training camp on time because of overseas commitments. As the game becomes more global, something will have to give. The league is adding two more expansion teams in 2026 with the addition of Toronto and Portland. The WNBA will add at least one more franchise soon after that. Yet Engelbert is concerned about diluting the talent pool too quickly. You dont want to degrade the quality of the game, already going to 16. Were adding 33% additional roster spots by adding 48 spots to a league of 144, she said before the draft Monday night. For now, the 38 players who heard their names called on Monday night will do their best to try to make a team in the upcoming weeks. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-camps-draft-cba-de2510c2062e4714bf07cd0d5b9c697b,sports
"Fashion, heritage and talent: Players turn the WNBA draft into a cultural showcase","NEW YORK (AP)  The WNBA draft has increasingly become a platform for more than just athleticism  it is a celebration of identity, heritage, culture, and self-expression. Paige Bueckers may have been the No. 1 pick, but it was Kiki Iriafen who arguably stole the show when it came to fashion. Even Bueckers herself said Iriafen had the best look of the night. Iriafen, drafted fourth overall by the Washington Mystics, is a forward who just wrapped up her senior season at USC, where she averaged 18 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. On the orange carpet, she made a statement  one rooted deeply in her Nigerian heritage. Im Nigerian so I wanted to work with a Nigerian designer, she said. I was really adamant. I want a slip. I want the waist snapped. I cant really breathe. I wanted to feel good, I wanted to look good. Future stars are using draft night as more than an opportunity to step into the spotlight for their talent on the court, but to use the moment to honor where they come from, showcase who they are beyond the jersey, and make powerful statements through fashion, family, and tradition. Iriafen wore a custom, shimmering gold dress embellished with intricate detailing, designed by Nigerian designer Nneka Alexander  who also created Chiney Ogwumikes wedding gown. To complete the look, Iriafen wore a traditional orange-beaded Nigerian bracelet, seamlessly blending modern glam with cultural pride. The 6-foot-3 Iriafen was not alone. 
        
     Dominique Malonga, the gifted 6-6 forward from France and the second overall pick by the Seattle Storm, brought a piece of home with her. She stepped out in a sleek suit designed by none other than Louis Vuitton  one of Frances, and the worlds, most iconic fashion houses. A huge collaboration between them, Malonga said. Im like a simple, classic person. Still, she made it clear that while her style might be understated, her game is anything but. As a forward, she knows she can do it all. At just 19, shes already been playing high-level basketball overseas for four years. Malonga wasnt the only Storm player showcasing her roots on the orange carpet. Seattle Storm point guard and former UConn Husky Nika Muhl also proudly embraced her Croatian heritage I came all the way from Croatia to be here, Muhl said. I had to bring Croatia with me. Muhl was wearing a black pantsuit with a black crop top underneath, complemented by a chain of keys draped across her body. The entire look was designed by Croatian brand Y/GIA and styled by a Croatian stylist. Even the players who couldnt attend the draft found ways to let their identities shine. Te-Hina Paopao, the sharp-shooting South Carolina guard, was selected 18th overall by the Atlanta Dream. Appearing on TV from her draft party, she wore a traditional Samoan dress, along with several flower lei around her necksymbolic necklaces in Samoan culture that honor and celebrate. I am so blessed to be Samoan, said Paopao. When you think of Samoan culture you think of family and I am so ready to bring that culture to Atlanta . And family was definitely present  about 300 people gathered behind her at her draft party in California, a powerful visual of support and pride. As they step into the professional spotlight, they carry with them not just their skills, but the pride of their families, their communities, and their cultures. The future of the WNBA isnt just about basketball; its about creating a space where every player can be their true, authentic selfon the court and beyond. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-draft-2025-fashion-0985ccad20045f6b3803805f247c3ce5,sports
Indian golfer Lahiris bad luck at a South Korean LIV tournament leads to 7-over 79,"INCHEON, South Korea (AP)  Anirban Lahiri had the worst kind of luck Saturday during the second round of an LIV tournament at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club in Incheon, South Korea. The Indian golfers approach to the ninth hole hit the flag and rebounded straight across the green and into the water. He took a double-bogey six. That stroke of misfortune appeared to affect him on the ensuing holes, where he had a triple-bogey seven on the 10th hole and another double-bogey six on the 12th en route to a 7-over 79. He had birdied three straight holes ahead of the calamity on the ninth.

Scottie Scheffler leads at 18 under through 36 holes after long weather delay at the Byron Nelson,"McKINNEY, Texas (AP)  Scottie Scheffler and Jordan Spieth share a strong desire to win their hometown event, the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. The top-ranked player has a great chance to do it first. Playing with his good friend who is also a fellow Dallas resident and Texas alum, Scheffler padded his lead on Friday, shooting an 8-under 63 to reach 18 under through 36 holes as one of the early finishers in a weather-delayed second round. About half the field didnt get to complete the round after a six-hour delay, the last of the players not teeing off until about 15 minutes before sunset at soggy TPC Craig Ranch in a Dallas suburb. They all figure to be chasing Scheffler on the weekend, with Spieth probably too far back to be among the contenders. Play was suspended for darkness with Scheffler leading Sam Stevens by six shots. Stevens shot 65 on Friday. This tournament definitely means a lot to me, said Scheffler, who made his PGA Tour debut at the Byron Nelson in 2014  four years after Spieth made himself an instant hometown favorite by contending on Sunday as a 16-year-old high school junior. Its going to be a lot of fun to play here and have a chance to win. TPC Craig Ranch, which yields low scores even without pillow-soft conditions, was no match for Scheffler. He opened with a 61 on Thursday, and his total of 124 beat the previous 36-hole best at the Nelson by two shots. The two-time Masters champion missed Justin Thomas 36-hole PGA Tour record from 2017 by one stroke. 
        
     Spieth couldnt keep up, although he figures to be safely inside the cut line following a 67 that put him at 6 under. Jhonattan Vegas, a Venezuelan who also played for the Longhorns, finished his 69 and was eight shots behind Scheffler after starting the day two back. Ricky Castillo was 10 under in the 18th fairway when play was suspended. Scheffler, bogey-free through two rounds, started on the back nine and parred his first eight holes before an eagle at the par-5 18th just before play was suspended. Lightning started the delay, and several hours of rain followed  for the second time in three days. When the players returned, water sprayed from most of the shots in the fairway. None of it bothered Scheffler, who hit 12 of 14 fairways and had six birdies over his final nine holes. There were some fairways that were pretty wet, but other than that, I think the golf course held up pretty well, Scheffler said. Defending champion Taylor Pendrith shot 71 and was 4 under, possibly in danger of missing the cut. The weather forecast had Scheffler believing a long delay was coming before his round even started. Once it came, he spent most of the time in the clubhouse, eating and chatting with players. The food is just sitting there, Scheffler said. So we enjoyed some food, sat there, kind of hung out with some of the guys and didnt do too much. The delay didnt stop the momentum from the eagle that beat the weather. All six of his birdie putts were inside 15 feet. Were on a golf course where youve got to make some birdies, and the conditions today were changing a good amount, Scheffler said. Obviously with the huge rain delay, that was a challenge as well. Getting back out and playing in some wind and some pretty wet fairways, but overall, its great to be playing at home. Stevens birdied four his last six holes, including two par 3s, and played the first two rounds without a bogey. The 28-year-old seeking his first PGA Tour victory was second at the Farmers Insurance Open in January. Theres so many birdies out here and theres so much golf to be played, I need to keep my head down, Stevens said. And if I get in a situation where Im in contention with nine holes to go, then I have some memories to draw on. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/byron-nelson-scottie-scheffler-70e4fb9d4add80a248c6c2606d1f13a1,sports
"Scottie Scheffler returns to hometown Byron Nelson, takes 1st-round lead with 10-under 61","McKINNEY, Texas (AP)  Scottie Scheffler is happy to be back at his hometown event and showed it. Cameron Champ isnt far from familiar territory, either, which is a good thing considering he got the call that he was in the Byron Nelson as an alternate about 18 hours before his tee time. Scheffler made the turn in 29 on his way to a 10-under 61 on Thursday for a two-shot lead over Rico Hoey and Jhonattan Vegas, with Champ among seven players another shot back at 64. Defending champion Taylor Pendrith shot 67 with players allowed to lift, clean and replace their shots in the fairways after the par-71 TPC Craig Ranch got heavy rainfall Wednesday. The top-ranked Scheffler outshined fellow hometown star Jordan Spieth with the former Texas Longhorns paired together along with Si Woo Kim, a South Korean who also calls Dallas home and was showcased in an event sponsored by CJ Group, a conglomerate based in his home country.  Kim shot 67, capping his round with a lofty chip-in for eagle at the par-5 18th and rolling onto his back in celebration. Spieth is 2 under. Vegas, another Texas alum, had a bogey-free round along with Scheffler and Hoey. The others at 7 under with Champ are Stephan Jaeger, Michael Thorbjornsen, Eric Cole, Andrew Putnam, Patton Kizzire and Will Gordon. Scheffler missed last years event in Dallas northern suburb of McKinney for the birth of his first child, son Bennett. 
        
     Jordan and I love playing here. This tournament has meant a lot to us over the years, Scheffler said. Obviously last year I was missing for some pretty good reasons. I wasnt too sad about what was going on in my life at the time. Back then, he had 10 wins combined before May over a three-year stretch, including the Masters and Players Championship twice each. Now, Scheffler is still seeking the first victory of 2025. Not that he was playing poorly before posting his lowest round of the year. Scheffler finished fourth as the defending champion at Augusta and has four other top-10 finishes this year. I wouldnt say anxious or eager, anything like that, the 13-time winner said of seeking his first victory in 2025. I got off to a pretty good start today, and theres three more days of the tournament. Just focused on going home and getting some rest. Scheffler birdied four consecutive holes on the front nine and added one more before putting his approach at the par-5 ninth inside 5 feet for an eagle to get to 7 under. A chip for birdie stopped on the lip at the par-4 11th, the second of three consecutive pars before he pulled even with Hoey with a birdie at 13. Scheffler took the lead by putting his tee shot on the stadium hole  the par-3 17th  inside 3 feet. Hoey, a 29-year-old from the Philippines seeking his first PGA Tour victory, started with eight pars on the back nine before an eagle on 18 triggered an 8-under finish over his final 10 holes. His 63 tied his career low on the PGA Tour. Hoeys best finish this year also was in Texas, a tie for 11th at the Houston Open.  Its been up and down, but from the start of the last season and comparing it, I think Im doing a way better job, said Hoey, who won on the Canadian tour in 2017 and the Korn Ferry circuit two years ago. Just feel like there are rounds Ive been clicking; other rounds I havent put it up. Kind of nice to get the momentum rolling now. Champ, who lives in Houston and played at Texas A&M, was home when he got the call that he was replacing Gary Woodland, who withdrew. He made it to the Dallas area Wednesday night and countered two bogeys in his first three holes with nine birdies. The 29-year-old from California won three times from 2019-21 but missed 35 of 55 cuts over the previous two years. This is just his fourth start of 2025. Considering last year, how many cuts I missed by one, it was like 11 or 12 or something, I havent really been playing that bad, Champ said. The last two years is probably the hardest Ive ever worked. Feel like my physical abilities are there. Its just getting back to the right mental state. Spieth and Danny Walker had to pause to clean spikes after wayward tee shots into muddy territory. Walkers cleaning delay lasted several minutes, including others helping by splashing the soles with bottled water.  Walker, playing in the group ahead of Spieth, ended up with a bogey on the par-4 11th on his way to a 68. Spieth scrambled for a par-4 at No. 3 after barely missing the water while putting his tee shot in a waste area.  ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/byron-nelson-scottie-scheffler-1c1d8091c5ff197067d881e8fcf3f26c,sports
Two teams suing NASCAR ask a judge to dismiss stock car racings counterclaim,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  The two teams suing NASCAR asked a judge to dismiss the sanctioning bodys counterclaim in court Wednesday. In a 20-page filing in district court in North Carolina, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports opposed NASCARs motion to amend its original counterclaim. The teams argued that the need to amend the counterclaim further demonstrates the weakness of NASCARs arguments, calling them an attempt by NASCAR to distract and shift attention away from its own unlawful, monopolistic actions. NASCARs counterclaim singled out Michael Jordans longtime business manager, Curtis Polk. Jordan is co-owner of 23XI Racing. The legal battle began after more than two years of negotiations on new charter agreements  NASCARs equivalent of a franchise model  and the 30-page filing contends that Polk willfully violated antitrust laws by orchestrating anticompetitive collective conduct in connection with the most recent charter agreements. 23XI and Front Row were the only two organizations out of 15 that refused to sign the new agreements, which were presented to the teams last September in a take-it-or-leave-it offer a mere 48 hours before the start of NASCARs playoffs. The charters were fought for by the teams ahead of the 2016 season and twice have been extended. The latest extension is for seven years to match the current media rights deal and guarantee 36 of the 40 spots in each weeks field to the teams that hold the charters, as well as other financial incentives. 23XI and Front Row refused to sign and sued, alleging NASCAR and the France family that owns the stock car series are a monopoly. 
        
     NASCAR already has lost one round in court in which the two teams have been recognized as chartered organizations for the 2025 season as the legal dispute winds through the courts. NASCAR has also appealed a judges rejection of its motion to dismiss the case. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-antitrust-lawsuit-23xi-front-row-jordan-polk-8e87d02b90a08b5c87ab439e00202ffb,sports
Haeran Ryu and Ariya Jutanugarn shake off major doldrums and have solid start on LPGA in Utah,"IVINS, Utah (AP)  Haeran Ryu and Ariya Jutanugarn didnt waste time moving on from the disappointment of the first LPGA major behind them, both opening with bogey-free rounds Thursday for an ideal start in the inaugural Black Desert Championship. Ryu missed only one fairway, one green and took 27 putts in her round of 9-under 63, giving her a one-shot lead over Jutanugarn and Wei-Ling Hsu in the LPGAs return to Utah for the first time in just over 60 years.  Ryu shared the 54-hole lead last week in the Chevron Championship when nothing went right for her the final round. Even with an eagle on the final hole, she shot 76 and missed the playoff by two shots. Im not change something from my mind, because last week it was tough golf course and this week its tough, too, Ryu said. Just thinking more accuracy for my shot, and I think same as last week. Jutanugarn had a rougher finish. She needed par on the last hole to win when the Thai stubbed a chip behind the green and wound up making bogey. In the five-player playoff, Jutanugarn lipped out on a 7-foot birdie putt as Mao Saigo won. I would say when I got here I felt like the course is really tough because like its kind of new. Its different, really unique, really beautiful, Jutanugarn said. But of course last week I didnt finish the way I want, but its so many thing going on  like good things  and I just want to carry on from that and keep working as hard as I can. Jutanugarn, a former No. 1 player in womens golf, has gone four years without winning. 
        
     Saigo was 2 over through four holes and then steadied herself by playing bogey-free the rest of the way with four birdies to salvage a 70. She was among the late starters at Black Desert, a Tom Weiskopf design carved from a massive field of black lava amid red rock mountains, some 30 miles from Zion National Park. It is the only golf course that hosts an official PGA Tour and LPGA Tour event. Black Desert hosted a PGA Tour event last fall. Lucy Li birdied her last two holes for a 64 and was part of a six-way tie for fourth that included Carlota Ciganda. Celine Boutier was among the group at 65. Its an amazing place. Ive really enjoyed my past few days here. Its beautiful. It was kind of just the focus on refreshing and recharging after the major last week, Henseleit said. The scoring was low without much wind and relatively soft conditions, with nearly 60% of the 144-player field breaking par.  Henseleit said it was more about picking targets and being aggressive. Even so, there is enough rock framing the fairways to make targets appear smaller than they are. And it doesnt take much to get in trouble. I would say this course can be really stressful because you kind of have to plan everything, every shot  tee shot, second shot, where to finish the ball, Jutanugarn said. Im very lucky this morning  no wind, so got a bit easier to finish the ball where I want to finish. ___ This version corrects Ryus score to 9-under 63 ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/lpga-black-desert-ryu-jutanugarn-mao-saigo-a5302622bd4dab889b85580f0458c93f,sports
Mexico City GP signs extension to stay on F1 calendar to 2028 and mayor hints at longer deal,"MEXICO CITY (AP)  The Mexico City Grand Prix will remain on the F1 calendar through at least the 2028 season after a three-year contract extension was announced on Wednesday, and the citys mayor said negotiations are ongoing for an even longer deal. With the contract for the Autdromo Hermanos Rodrguez circuit set to expire at the end of this season, the organizers and local authorities needed to get a deal done. This (contract) does not mean that it is the end of it, we needed to secure those dates, but early next year we will have good news regarding the continuity of this wonderful event for years to come in Mexico City, mayor Clara Brugada said at a press conference. Mexico first hosted an F1 championship race in 1963 and has been on the calendar every year since 2015, excluding 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Formula 1 has a deep tradition in this country, it is part of the history of several generations that saw these cars run and have seen the sport evolve to become one of the most important competitions in the world, Brugada said. The extension comes as F1 experiments with rotating some established off-schedule slots in alternate years to meet demand for new hosts outside of Europe. Mexico also fits in with F1s plans to reduce travel by scheduling back-to-back races in the same regions of the world. This year, its part of a four-race series in the Americas, in October and November. The others are in Sao Paulo, Las Vegas, and Austin, Texas. 
        
     It is an important day for Formula 1, Mexico is an incredible country and that is the reason for staying together for the next years, Formula 1 president and chief executive Stefano Domenicali said.

The F1 team on adapting some of the spirit of Top Gun to Formula One film with Brad Pitt,"Top Gun: Maverick filmmaker Joseph Kosinski came to Formula One like many Americans: Drive to Survive. In that popular Netflix series, he saw the potential for a cinematic event, full of immersive thrills, the high stakes of the competitive racing world and the idea that your teammate could be your greatest rival. I dont think theres any other sport thats quite like that, Kosinski said. Its ripe for drama. The movies have loved car racing since their earliest days, and the popularity of F1 has exploded in recent years. Giving it the Top Gun treatment made sense. But it would take nearly four years for that dream to become F1, which is speeding into movie theaters on June 27. It was a complex operation that would involve unprecedented coordination with the league, groundbreaking innovation in camera technology, and letting one of the biggest movie stars in the world, Brad Pitt, drive a real race car at 180 miles an hour on film. Many, many times.  
        
     Hollywood, it turned out, was a little easier to convince to make the film than the league. By the time Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer approached them, Pitt had already agreed to star and theyd decided to go with Apple to help make the movie at the level they needed, with the guarantee of a robust theatrical release (which Warner Bros. is handling). Then came the Formula One meeting. When you come in, the first thing they think is youre going to make them look bad, Bruckheimer said. I went through this with when I went to the Navy the first time on Top Gun. There were many concerns: About anything going wrong, accidents, and the question of the villain. But, the filmmakers explained, this story wasnt about a villain. Its a competition between two drivers  a younger driver (Damson Idris) and an older driver (Pitt) trying to make him better. Bruckheimer said it took almost a year to get the league on board, and then they had to go around to the individual teams to explain it to them as well. But once everyone bought in, they committed and opened their world to the filmmakers.  The amount of, lets say, conversations regarding things not related to the actual filmmaking has been massive just from a coordination point of view, Kosinski said. But theres no way we could have made this film without that partnership with Formula One. Among the things they got to do: Build a garage at the Grand Prix for their fictional team; Drive on the track during Grand Prix weekends in front of hundreds of thousands of spectators; Put their Formula One cars on the track with the films cars (and drivers); Have Pitt and Idris stand at the end of the national anthem in both Silverstone and Abu Dhabi; And sit in on drivers meetings and technical briefings. It was full-on integration of these two worlds coming together, Kosinski said. Theres no way the film could have happened or look like it does without that partnership. I think youll see the result of that on screen because you couldnt recreate what we were able to capture by doing it for real. In true Top Gun spirit, part of doing it for real meant trying to create the experience in the driver seat for the audience. Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, who was involved in the film from the earliest days, told Kosinski that hed never seen a film that had really captured what it felt like to be in one of those cars. These Formula One cars, they deal in grams, Kosinski said. Adding 100 pounds of camera equipment works against the very thing youre trying to capture. It became a technical engineering project for a year to figure out how to get very tiny cameras that are IMAX quality onto one of these cars. During Top Gun: Maverick, they had six Sony cameras inside the cockpit. Here, engineers were able to slim those down to about a quarter of the size (he estimates a 10x10 cm cube). Panavision also developed a remote control that allowed director of photography Claudio Miranda to pivot the cameras left and right, which they didnt have on Maverick. They had 15 camera mounts built into the cars and were able to run up to four at a time keeping the weight penalty to a minimum, and the close-ups real. Every time you see Brad or Damsons face, theyre really driving that car, Kosinski said. Its not being driven for them. And once it was go-time on the tracks, it was a race against the clock. It was a technical feat and an organizational feat, Bruckheimer said. You get limited access and wed get in there between some of their qualifying laps and have eight minutes to get on the track and off the track. Its precision, you cant be at nine minutes. When Hamilton first saw some of their racing footage cut together, Kosinski got a confidence boost. He smiled and said, It looks fast, Kosinski said. I was like, Oh, thank God. If Lewis says that were in a good place. This movie needed an icon kind of at the center of it, Kosinski said. Its a big, complicated, expensive film. And I needed one of our, you know, top, top movie stars. Kosinski knew Pitt liked cars. About a decade ago he, Tom Cruise and Pitt actually developed a car movie that never came to be. Plus, he said, I just felt like it was a role that I always wanted to see him play. The character is fictional driver named Sonny Hayes who was the greatest who never was. A phenomenon in the 1990s, he was destined to be the next world champion before an accident at a Grand Prix ends his Formula One career. Now he drives in every type of racing league you could imagine, but not Formula 1, Kosinski said, from Le Mans to swamp trucks. He likes to challenge himself to a new racing league and master it, but then he walks away. The audience meets him driving the midnight shift at the Daytona 24 hour race where he meets his old teammate and now Formula One team owner (Javier Bardem) who asks him to come back to help them win one race to save them from being sold. Its a story about a last place team, a group of underdogs, and Sonny Hayes in his later years having one more chance to do something he was never able to, which is win a race in F1, Kosinski said.  After the pitch, they went to the racetrack with Hamilton and Pitt was hooked. Pitt trained for three months before cameras started rolling to get used to the physical demands of the precision vehicles. He and his co-star really drove the cars at speeds up to 180 mph, and sometimes in front of a couple hundred thousand people. The happiest day was when they said, OK, its a wrap on driving, and he (Brad) climbed out of the car, Bruckheimer said. That was the best day for me because it is dangerous, it really is. The film, everyone has acknowledged, was enormously expensive. They had the advantage of advertising on the cars, which helped offset some of the costs, but the operation was akin to building a real F1 team, Bruckheimer said. They built six cars, which they transported all around the world along with production. Its like an army exercise moving vast groups of people and machinery around the world, Bruckheimer said. But it was much less than the $300 million figure going around, both Kosinski and Bruckheimer said. Its expensive, dont get me wrong. Its an expensive movie. But it was substantially lower than that number, Bruckheimer said. Hollywood is a very competitive place, and our friends sometimes inflate our budgets to make them look better. The biggest question is whether audiences will turn out in blockbuster numbers. So far, test scores have been very high across genders. And they promise you dont need to be an expert or even a fan of the sport to enjoy the film, which will teach you everything you need to know. Its emotional, its exciting, it has humor. Its got great music with a Hans Zimmer score and a bunch of phenomenal artists, Bruckheimer said. We hope its a perfect summer movie.",https://apnews.com/article/f1-brad-pitt-racing-summer-movie-preview-99da4518e5903aab663666be5c955de9,sports
"Shes in charge: At the F1 Miami Grand Prix, many top executive roles are held by women","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  For the Miami Grand Prix, someone is in charge of all the strategic planning and the budget. Someone else oversees the construction of 163 temporary buildings needed for a Formula 1 race weekend. Someone else designs the seating areas and keeps track of food and beverage needs. Someone else makes sure that the rich and famous have everything they need and want, from the right drink to the right kind of throw pillow. These jobs make the race happen. And in Miami, theyre all being done by women. Its something that the Miami Grand Prix believes sets its race apart. In a sport and a circuit still dominated by males  there hasnt been a woman behind the wheel for a Formula 1 race since 1992  it will be difficult this weekend to find an element of the event that isnt overseen by a woman. Im so proud, said Katharina Nowak, the Miami races vice president of business operations. The amount of talent, whether male or female, that we have in that room, it just makes you want to be better. Every day, we push ourselves to just continue to maintain the standard at which we all expect to be working at, which just pushes everybody to be better for each other because no one wants to let anyone down. 
        
     There are men on the masthead for the races local overseers: Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross owns the race, Tom Garfinkel is the managing partner and Tyler Epp is president of the race that takes place at the Dolphins Hard Rock Stadium campus. From there, many other top Miami roles are held by women, including:  Nowak  only 28 years old  reports to Epp as the races second-in-command and oversees all strategic plans, the budget and 17 internal departments. She also speaks four languages.  Natalie Clark is the senior director of event operations, overseeing the process of building, loading in and loading out, which means she tracks what every truck is bringing onto the campus and where it goes.  Sydney McClain is the senior director of events and food and beverage, meaning she creates virtually the entire fan experience on the 250-acre campus.  Melanie Cabassol is vice president of hospitality and curated experiences, meaning she creates the atmosphere for premium clients  a list that in past years has included the likes of LeBron James, Patrick Mahomes, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Ive worked at other places before, and it hasnt been that Im sitting around a conference table and a majority of women are driving different initiatives within this business, McClain said. So, it is very unique. Its very exciting. And I think that we owe a lot of that to the female leaders that have been here, been in our shoes before, and that have helped pave the way for us. The race, now in its fourth year, is part of a diverse series of events at the Hard Rock campus. Its primarily the home of the Dolphins, who have their training facility adjacent to the stadium. It also plays host to Miami Hurricanes football, concerts, soccer  the Club World Cup later this year and the FIFA World Cup next year will hold some matches there  and the Miami Open tennis tournament. The F1 race alone has generated more than $1 billion in economic impact in its first three years. The women leading the Miami race arent alone in their fields. At F1, the chief commercial officer is Emily Prazer and, until late last year, Sacha Woodward Hill had been there for nearly 30 years as the chief legal officer. But Miami stands out, said Susie Wolff, the managing director of F1 Academy  an all-female developmental racing series. I think its something which we can all take quite an amount of pride in, that the sport has shifted in such a way that its now the case that it is not regarded as something unusual, Wolff said. I dont see it as unusual. I think is a testament to the progress weve made. This week in Miami takes the other 51 weeks on the calendar to prepare for. Eight months of planning, three months of executing the plan and then one month of it all actually happening. Part of Clarks job, along with overseeing 245 tent structures and 110 generators and 35 miles of plumbing infrastructure  all of it temporary and hidden  also is to work with architects and construction companies who execute what she draws up for a plan. I think when I was younger in my career, I got a little bit of, Who is she? Why is she in the meeting? Why does she have these construction plans? Clark said. And what happens over time is they hear you speak, your confidence, and once people understand that you are a master at your craft, theres less questions being asked. Cabassol leaves nothing to chance in her job. Shes in charge of the most luxurious spaces on the campus, the Palm Club, the Casa Tua Trackside Club and the 72 Club. The original blueprints for those spaces were her vision. Every glass, every bottle of Champagne, every element of those spaces gets her approval. They call her group a white glove team, VIP service for VIP guests. She even manages a secret road of sorts on the campus  Palm Alley, they call it, a palm tree-lined path that drops off some of the worlds richest people 10 feet from the entrance. Inside the club, there are the strictest of rules: no entourages, no private security, the VIP and one guest only. No cameras, no media.  Cabassol and her group know the likes and dislikes, what kind of food, what kind of drink, every guest will want ahead of time by dealing with the VIPs own teams. If there is a Palm Club guest who doesnt like another Palm Club guest, they even have a plan to keep those people away from each other. Everybody must enjoy themselves, no matter what. She makes it work. So do Nowak, Clark, McClain and many others. What has happened here is theyve brought the right people together to create, the right team to execute the vision, Cabassol said. I guess I would say Im proud to represent women in this space, but Im even more proud to be a part of the team that recognizes and elevates talent that collaboratively work together in this environment. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/formula-1-miami-76958f4e0a886ce52acc9e3447bbac34,sports
Super Sommer enjoying his moment in the sun after helping Inter reach Champions League final,"MILAN (AP)  It is rare that a goalkeeper is named player of the match, even rarer when he has conceded three goals. But Inter Milans Yann Sommer was given that honor following an astonishing 4-3 victory over Barcelona on Tuesday that sent the Italian team through to the Champions League final 7-6 on aggregate after extra time. Sommers saves against Barcelona beggared belief in a rollercoaster match that at times went beyond insanity as it somehow managed to be even more drama packed than the 3-3 draw the previous week, with his team truly living up to its pazza (mad) Inter nickname. There was his sensational reaction save on Eric Garca early in the second half, between Barcelonas quickfire double that saw the visitors come back from two goals down, and a flying leap to fingertip a Lamine Yamal curler away from the top corner with the score at 2-2. Sommer saved the best almost for last, however, when he again flew to fingertip another shot from the precocious Barcelona teen around his post. There were just seven minutes of extra time remaining at that point, with Inter leading 4-3, and his teammates celebrated as if they had scored again. Im very happy. It was an amazing match, and the team has gone on an extraordinary journey, Sommer said. The toughest save was the last one, because Yamal is really strong and always comes inside to shoot. It was also maybe the most important one  because it gave us a little bit power, it gave us the confidence back for these last minutes. 
        
     At the age of 36, Sommer is revelling in his time in the spotlight in perhaps his biggest moment since saving a Kylian Mbapp spotkick to help Switzerland beat France in a penalty shootout in the 2020 European Championship. And he could even be in line for a much more prestigious acclaim, with Spanish sports newspaper Marca naming him as a strong candidate for the Ballon dOr award as the worlds best soccer player. I could not be happier than now, Sommer said. We as a team and as well me, I worked hard for these kind of moments, for these situations, for these games, to be in a club like this. In the end Im here with this beautiful team and we are in the Champions League final. It will be Inters second final in three years and, having almost defied the odds to get there, Simone Inzaghis team might very well be the favorite against either Paris Saint-Germain or Arsenal in Munich on May 31. Two years ago nobody expected much against Manchester City but Inter only lost 1-0. This time even Inzaghi almost conceded Inter would be favored after eliminating not only Barcelona but Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals. We have grown since then, he said. These guys have been extraordinary, we have to continue. The final will be played against a really great team, whether its Arsenal or PSG. It will be difficult but after beating Barcelona and Bayern  well theyre probably the best teams in Europe at the moment. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/sommer-goalkeeper-inter-barcelona-champions-league-d94af22198cc05be50256bd60eb36949,sports
"Sans superstars, PSG reaches Champions League final and will face Inter Milan for elusive title","PARIS (AP)  Paris Saint-Germain weathered one attack after another and showed remarkable adaptability Wednesday to hold off and defeat an inspired Arsenal 2-1 to reach the Champions League final and have another shot at the title it craves. Deprived of the ball possession it usually enjoys, PSG looked shaky early on but found answers by relying on counter-attacks and goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to advance 3-1 on aggregate. PSG reached the final of Europes elite tournament for just the second time in club history  it was runner-up five years ago  and did so in the first season following superstar Kylian Mbapp's departure to Real Madrid. The big hole left by Mbapp was not filled by yet another superstar. It was a major change at a club where for more than a decade owners had spent lavishly to attract big names such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Lionel Messi and Neymar. The clubs new approach allowed coach Luis Enrique to build a rejuvenated, rock-solid side playing some of the best football in Europe. I said from the first day that our goal was to work hard enough to be in a position to make history  and that remains our goal, Enrique said. To be the first to win the long-awaited trophy. This is a project that has evolved since last year, and I feel very comfortable here as a coach because I have the freedom and support from the president to build what we want, adapting to the market to put together a team that improves every day. The French club will try again for its first Champions League title when it faces Inter Milan on May 31 in Munich. 
        
     We believe in our coach and we believe in our players  in our talented, young, hungry players, PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi told CBS Sports. They fight for the team, they die for the jersey, thats the most important, for the city, for the club. Theres still one match to go. ... we are not done. Three-time European champion Inter defeated Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in one of the greatest semifinals in the competitions history. PSG, which eliminated Aston Villa and Liverpool before sending Arsenal home, had lost to Borussia Dortmund at this stage last year and was beaten by Bayern Munich in the 2020 final. PSG broke the deadlock in the 27th minute from a set piece after the Arsenal defense cleared a free kick toward the edge of the area. The ball bounced back into the path of Fabian Ruiz, who smashed a stunning half-volley into the back of the net. Achraf Hakimi curled in a precise finish in the 72nd minute to make it 2-0 on the night before Bukayo Saka pulled one back for the Gunners. Arsenal had struggled early on last week in London  unable to cope with PSGs intensity in midfield  and lost 1-0. This time, boosted by the return of midfielder Thomas Partey, the Gunners mustered 61 attacks, compared to PSGs 26. The visitors dominance was quickly rewarded when Declan Rice rose high but missed his header, and Gabriel Martinelli saw his effort saved by Donnarumma. Arsenal overwhelmed PSG on the flanks, and went close again in the eighth minute when Martin degaard unleashed a low drive from outside the area that forced Donnarumma into another fine save. PSG had little choice but to wait for chances on the counterattack, and they were few. An opening finally came in the 17th minute. With some space on the left, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia came inside on his right foot and curled one of his trademark pinpoint shots that rattled the post. PSG then failed to capitalize on a poor pass from William Saliba. But Dsir Dou could only fire a weak shot straight at Raya. Arsenal had another great opportunity soon after the hour mark when Saka curled a precise shot that seemed headed for the top corner, only for Donnarumma to stretch his long body and parry the ball away. Vitinha then missed a penalty after a VAR check ruled a handball on Myles Lewis-Skelly. It was not long, though, before PSG doubled its lead as Hakimi swept the ball into the corner from substitute Ousmane Dembls assist. Arsenal kept attacking until the end and cut the deficit through Saka in the 76th minute. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/psg-arsenal-champions-league-4308ec6b367431269e83d2d21159321f,sports
The ultimate leveler: Bod/Glimt has a secret weapon to bring down Europes giants,"Located north of the Arctic Circle and needing to deal with brutal weather conditions, Norwegian soccer team Bod/Glimt has an artificial playing field thats built to handle just about anything. Including much bigger rivals. That could be bad news for Premier League giant Tottenham Hotspur when the teams meet in the Europa League semifinal second leg on Thursday. Spurs leads 3-1 after the first game, but that advantage could look slender once play gets underway at the Aspmyra Stadion in the fishing town of Bod, more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Oslo. Despite the town having a population of around 55,000, Bod/Glimt  unheralded outside of Norway  continues to pull off shock wins against famous opponents on home turf. And it is that artificial surface that seems to be such a leveler for teams unused to playing in sometimes Arctic conditions and away from traditional grass. Evangelos Marinakis, president of Greek team Olympiakos, was critical after a 3-0 defeat in the Europa League in March, saying we played on a pitch that is not like other European stadiums and claiming one of his players got injured due to the pitch conditions. Olympiakos won the second leg 2-1 at home, but was eliminated 4-2 on aggregate, with Marinakis lamenting: what truly matters is what happened in the first match. 
        
     It is certainly unusual to see a high level match like the semifinal of a major European competition played on artificial turf, which is criticized for the way the ball rolls and bounces in comparison to grass. Now it has happened twice in one season. Swedish club Djurgrden hosted a Conference League semifinal last week that Chelsea won 4-1. Sometimes called plastic pitches, they were banned in England in 1988 due to higher rates of injuries and inconsistent playability. But UEFA allows approved artificial pitches to be used up to and including the semifinals of its competitions - the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League. High level football in (a) plastic pitch is not high level football, Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho said after a Champions League qualifying game against Lugano last July, which was also played on artificial turf. The ball is slow, the players cannot dribble, they run with the ball and the ball stays behind. The game is slow, so honestly I dont understand why UEFA allows Champions League in (a) plastic pitch. The Netherlands league has now banned artificial pitches from next season and Scottish top-tier clubs voted to ban them starting in the 2026-27 season. World governing body FIFA also allows approved artificial surfaces for national-team games, but is relaying synthetic pitches as grass in NFL stadiums being used for the mens 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Controversy in womens soccer followed a decision by previous FIFA management to let the 2015 Womens World Cup in Canada be played on artificial turf. Players including U.S. star Abby Wambach went to court trying to stop that claiming gender discrimination. Bod/Glimts record at its 9,000-capacity stadium would certainly seem to point to an advantage and it has played a major role in it becoming the first Norwegian team to reach the semifinals of a top European club competition. Besides Olympiakos, it has won home games against Lazio, Porto, Besiktas and FC Twente this season. It beat Red Star Belgrade in a home Champions League qualifier earlier in the campaign, but went out on aggregate. It also thrashed Roma  then managed by Mourinho  6-1 at home in the Conference League in 2021. A source of encouragement for Tottenham is the fact that Bod/Glimt has lost all four of its games against English opposition - including a 3-2 defeat at Manchester United this season. Tottenham manager Ange Postcoglou, however, lost 5-1 on aggregate against the Norwegians when in charge of Celtic in 2022. That included a 2-0 defeat at the Aspmyra Stadion. It is on artificial grass, but its still a game of football and Ive been there, Ive played there with Celtic, he said after the first leg last week. I know the experience and what is important for us is that we need to replicate what we did today (in the first leg). Irrespective of the surface, if were as disciplined and organised as we were today, with and without the ball, it wont matter what the surface is, I think it will make it really difficult for us to be stopped. Bod/Glimts stadium is one of the most northernly in world soccer at 67 degrees latitude. The town, on the west coast of Norway, is known as a destination to see the northern lights. Unlike in most of Europe, the Norwegian soccer league starts in the spring and ends in the fall to avoid playing during the long winter. Bod has less than an hour of sunlight on its shortest winter days, making maintaining the playing field expensive and difficult. Temperatures can dip toward the freezing point even in May. Bod/Glimts underground heating and synthetic turf allowed it to stage its quarterfinal against Lazio last month despite heavy snowfall completely covering the ground on the day of the game, which would have been unlikely on grass. Tottenham midfielder Dejan Kulusevski predicted that the game in Bod would be difficult because playing on artificial turf is almost like a different sport. Bod/Glimt defender Jostein Gundersen chuckled at his comment. I wonder what he thinks we should have done differently in Bod, Gundersen told Norwegian broadcaster TV2. If he had seen where were located, its not so easy to have anything other than artificial turf. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/bodo-glimt-plastic-pitch-tottenham-europa-league-919a7c68532ce31b6b589e1f255784c3,sports
Yamal thrives but misses late chance as Barcelona exits Champions League in semifinals,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  Almost six minutes into stoppage time, Lamine Yamal entered the area with the ball in front of him and only the goalkeeper to beat. The teenage sensation was being challenged by a defender, but looked in good position to find the net. Instead of scoring the goal that would likely take Barcelona to its first Champions League final in a decade, Yamal couldnt manage more than a weak left-footed shot that went straight into the hands of Inter Milan goalkeeper Yann Sommer. The 17-year-old Spain forward had another strong performance Tuesday, creating chances and being a constant threat, but it wasnt enough to lead the Catalan club to its first Champions League final in a decade. Yamals missed opportunity at the end of regulation proved costly, leaving the score even at 3-3 before Inter Milan prevailed 4-3 in extra time to advance to the final 7-6 on aggregate score. Yamal had scored an amazing goal in the first leg in Barcelona, but couldnt find the net this time to help Barcelona in the return match in San Siro. Another left-footed effort in extra time looked promising but Sommer made a fingertip save to preserve the 4-3 lead. Which save will I remember? said Sommer, the games most valuable player. The last one on Lamine Yamal. He is a great player and fortunately it didnt go in. Many teams would have given up after going down 3-2 but we didnt and managed to come back. 
        
     Sommer was speaking to Sky Italia in quotes reproduced by UEFA.  Sommer had already made a few saves to stop Yamal during the match, including a diving, one-handed deflection to parry away a long-range strike by the young forward in the 77th with the score 2-2. Yamals missed opportunity at the end of regulation came only minutes after Inter had equalized with a goal by Francesco Acerbi. Raphinha had put Barcelona ahead in the 87th in another thrilling match between the clubs. Yamal appeared to be in disbelief after he couldnt get the ball past Sommer. After the referee blew the whistle at the end of regulation, he briefly raised his shirt in front of his face. A trip to the final would have added to the sensational start of Yamals career, both with Barcelona and with Spains national team, where he has been setting records and earning praise from across the soccer world. Barcelona was trying to reach the final for the first time since it won its fifth Champions League title in 2015. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/lamine-yamal-barcelona-inter-milan-champions-league-2537ddfd664c5dd6ec0bc38d5c08bd28,sports
"Claressa Shields headlining 3rd Little Caesars Arena boxing card, facing New Zealands Lani Daniels","DETROIT (AP)  Claressa Shields is giving Lani Daniels a shot at winning her belts. Shields, the first undisputed heavyweight champion in womens boxing, announced on social media Wednesday that she is facing Daniels on July 26 at Little Caesars Arena. The 30-year-old Shields improved to 16-0 by unanimously outpointing Danielle Perkins three months ago in her hometown of Flint, Michigan. Daniels, a 36-year-old from New Zealand, has the IBF light heavyweight title. She has won seven straight matches and is 11-2-2 with one knockout. Shields, a two-time Olympic champion, has revived the Motor Citys place in boxing. The city has a rich history in the sport that includes Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson and Thomas Hearns. The home of the Red Wings and Pistons opened in 2017, but the arena didnt have a boxing card until nearly two years ago when Shields was the headliner and beat Maricela Cornejo. Shields was back at Little Caesars Arena last summer, knocking out WBC heavyweight champion Vanessa Lepage-Joanisse in front of about 12,000 fans and likely will be a big draw for a third time in July. Womens boxing has grown by leaps and bounds since Claressa Shields headlined the very first womens main event on a nationally televised card, Shields promoter, Dmitriy Salita, said Wednesday. ___ Follow Larry Lage at https://apnews.com/author/larry-lage ___ AP Boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing",https://apnews.com/article/boxing-claressa-shields-lani-daniels-21252faf361bccad2edfb0e6922aa2dd,sports
Maryland board OKs plan to start demolition to rebuild Pimlico Race Course shortly after Preakness,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP)  A Maryland board approved a $14.3 million contract on Wednesday to begin the demolition and rebuilding of Baltimores storied but antiquated Pimlico Race Course, home to the second jewel of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.  The vote by the three-member Board of Public Works, which includes Gov. Wes Moore, was made 10 days before the 150th Preakness Stakes, which is scheduled for May 17. It will be the last time the annual horse race will be held with the existing structures in place before the track is rebuilt on the same site. The demolition will begin shortly after this years race. There cannot be a better time to announce the beginning of a transformation that will allow Pimlico to become a year-round hub for economic activity within the Park Heights community, Moore said of the Baltimore neighborhood and longtime home of the race. Under the plan, the Preakness will take place in Laurel Park, located just southwest of Baltimore, in 2026 while the new facility is built, before returning to Pimlico in time for the 2027 race.  Craig Thompson, the chair of the Maryland Stadium Authority which is overseeing the design of the new track, said the plan is to make Pimlico the home of Maryland thoroughbred racing. The track will go from hosting about 15 races a year to well over 100, Thompson said. This is more than just about a racetrack, as historic and important as it is, Thompson said. This is about bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in state investments to Park Heights. 
        
     Thompson also shared a preview of the design plans. They include a new clubhouse with architecture inspired by the Rawlings Conservatory in Baltimores Druid Hill park and the original Pimlico Clubhouse, which included a colonnade and rooftop balconies, Thompson said.  Last year, the board approved a deal to transfer ownership of Pimlico from The Stronach Group to the State of Maryland in order to ensure the Preakness remains in Baltimore. The state has been wrestling with what to do to restore the old racetrack for decades. Aptly nicknamed Old Hilltop, the track opened in 1870. Its where Man o War, Seabiscuit, Secretariat and many others pranced to the winners circle. But its age has long been a concern. In 2019, the Maryland Jockey Club closed off nearly 7,000 grandstand seats, citing the safety and security of all guests and employees.  The horse racing industry and other equine industries have been a cornerstone of Maryland agriculture, as well as an integral part of preserving green space.",https://apnews.com/article/preakness-pimlico-horse-race-course-demolition-rebuild-91f4ff91d019f380bf7062b153ee9390,sports
Valdez and Pea help Astros trounce Brewers 9-1 to avoid a sweep,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Framber Valdez pitched seven strong innings and Jeremy Pea homered and drove in four runs as the Houston Astros defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 9-1 on Wednesday. Houston earned just its second victory in seven games to snap Milwaukees three-game winning streak and leave both teams with .500 records. The Brewers were attempting to sweep a series from the Astros for the first time since 2012. The Astros led 3-1 before Pea broke the game open by delivering a three-run homer to left off reliever Elvin Rodriguez with two outs in the sixth inning. Valdez (2-4) struck out seven while allowing three hits, two walks and one run to earn his first win since the Astros March 27 season opener. He threw a season-high 101 pitches. Milwaukees only run off Valdez came on Eric Haases fifth-inning homer, a 425-foot drive to center. The Astros took a 1-0 lead off Quinn Priester (1-1) in the second inning as Jake Meyers hit a two-out single and scored on Zach Dezenzos double. The Brewers have lost all 13 games this season in which their opponent scored first. Five-time All-Star closer Josh Hader worked the ninth while pitching in Milwaukee for the first time since the Brewers traded him in 2022. The Astros led 1-0 and had runners on third and second with one out in the fifth when Pea hit a bouncer to third. The throw home beat Dezenzo to the plate. Home plate umpire Chris Conroy initially ruled Dezenzo out, but the Astros challenged the call and replays showed the runner slid home ahead of Haases tag. 
        
     Valdez has now pitched at least seven innings an MLB-leading 57 times since 2020. The Astros host the Cincinnati Reds on Friday. Scheduled pitchers are right-hander Hunter Brown (5-1, 1.67) for the Astros and right-hander Nick Martinez (1-3, 4.19) for the Reds. The Brewers visit the Tampa Bay Ray on Friday. Left-hander Jos Quintana (4-1, 2.83) will pitch for the Brewers. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/astros-brewers-score-e873796ba123c1c91f59a741c255a035,sports

"Floridas Dijon Johnson charged by police with possession of a gun, synthetic marijuana","TAMPA, Fla. (AP)  Police have charged Florida cornerback Dijon Johnson with two felonies, including possession of a firearm, and two misdemeanors after his arrest over the weekend while driving a car in Tampa. Police said they pulled over the car Friday for surpassing a stop signal. Officers detected a strong odor of burned marijuana and said Johnson was argumentative during the traffic stop, refusing to exit the gray Dodge Challenger, according to the criminal report filed in Hillsborough County. Johnson was removed from the car and placed into custody. They searched the vehicle and found marijuana and 8 grams of synthetic marijuana inside a backpack. A black Glock 19 loaded with 17 rounds in a magazine also was found in the car, according to the report. We are in dialogue with the State Attorneys Office regarding Dijons traffic stop last week, Tampa-based attorney Tim Taylor said in a statement released Wednesday. At this time, no formal charges have been filed. Any potential charging decision will, of course, need to be consistent with Florida law. We are eager for all the pertinent facts to come to light. The gun charge is a second-degree felony. Possession of the synthetic marijuana is a third-degree felony, and the marijuana possession and resisting arrest without violence charges are misdemeanors. Johnson entered written pleas of not guilty to all charges, according to court documents. 
        
     Coach Billy Napier said in a statement the program is aware of the situation. We will continue to gather facts, cooperate with and monitor the legal and administrative processes, Napier said. Johnson, 21, was booked early Saturday and released the following night after posting an $8,500 surety bond, according to jail records. A 6-foot-1, 196-pound junior from Tampa, Johnson recorded 27 tackles and two pass breakups last season. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Reds place third baseman Noelvi Marte on injured list with left oblique strain,"ATLANTA (AP)  The Cincinnati Reds placed third baseman Noelvi Marte on the 10-day injured list with a left oblique strain on Wednesday. Manager Terry Francona said Marte was diagnosed with a grade 2 strain, which is considered moderate but more serious than a mild strain, so he will be a little while. Marte was scratched minutes before the first pitch of the Atlanta Braves 2-1 win over the Reds in 10 innings on Tuesday night. He was reported to have left side discomfort and the oblique injury was disclosed on Wednesday. Marte was hitting .294 with three homers, 17 RBIs and four stolen bases. The Reds placed another third baseman, Jeimer Candelario, on the injured list on April 30 with a lumbar spine strain. Santiago Espinal was the fill-in starter for Marte for the second consecutive game on Wednesday night. The Reds recalled outfielder Rece Hinds from Triple-A Louisville before Wednesday nights game against the Braves. Hinds is starting in right field after Francona said outfielder Jake Fraley would have an MRI for tenderness in his left calf. Francona said Fraley felt discomfort while leaving the batters box on a ninth-inning groundout on Tuesday night. He didnt know if he cramped or overextended, Francona said, adding on Wednesday that Fraley was just not quite where he needs to be. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/reds-marte-injury-509a968365135bf744c901bad56318bc,sports
Mississippi State announces plans to build a $60M indoor practice facility for football,"STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP)  Mississippi State on Wednesday announced plans to build a $60 million indoor practice facility with an expected opening in the summer of 2028. Howard Industries of Laurel provided the lead naming gift, and the building will be named in honor of former MSU multisport athlete Billy Howard Sr., pending approval of the states Institutions of Higher Learning. Howard, who graduated in 1946, excelled in football, basketball and track and earned the nickname Iron Man for playing nearly every minute of every football game.

Lawsuit accuses former Los Angeles Lakers star Byron Scott of sexually assaulting teen girl in 1987,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  A woman is suing former Los Angeles Lakers player and coach Byron Scott, accusing him of sexually assaulting her during a team event at her high school in 1987, when he was 26 and she was 15.  The lawsuit first filed in December 2022 and amended on May 1 accuses Scott of sexual battery and false imprisonment. Scott, 64, fought to have his name removed from court documents, but a judge denied his request to be identified only as John Doe. The updated complaint named him publicly for the first time. During a visit from the Lakers, the alleged victim was attending summer classes at Campbell Hall High in Los Angeles when she was sexually assaulted by Byron Scott in a locked janitors closet in the high school gymnasium, according to the court filing. Scott was a Lakers player at the time. The lawsuit was filed in 2022 under a California law that temporarily allowed older cases to be filed for underage plaintiffs. That law required the defendant to remain anonymous until certain thresholds were crossed.  Scotts attorney, Linda Bauermeister, said her client doesnt deny that sexual contact occurred, but maintains he thought the girl was of legal age.  Our client is devastated by this complaint, Bauermeister said in a statement Wednesday. Our client believed the plaintiff to be over 18 and had no idea she would claim otherwise until 35 years later. He respects girls and women, and the claims have blindsided him and his family. 
        
     Scott was married to his first wife, Anita Scott, at the time of the alleged assault. They had three children and divorced in 2014.  The lawsuit said the alleged assault occurred in the summer of 1987 when the Lakers were at the school to film an instructional basketball video in the gym and meet with students, parents and faculty members. A judge ruled last August that Scott could be identified, and last week the plaintiffs attorneys filed the amended complaint naming him. The suit also names Campbell Hall High, accusing school officials of negligence for failing to protect the girl. It demands a trial by jury and over $25,000 for damages including loss of earnings and attorney fees to be paid by Scott and the school. A message was sent Wednesday to school officials seeking comment on the lawsuit. Scott, a shooting guard, won NBA championships in 1985, 1987 and 1988 as part of the Lakers Showtime era. He led the team in scoring with a career-best 21.7 points in 1987-88. Scott also played for the Indiana Pacers and then-Vancouver Grizzlies before returning to the Lakers for the 1996-97 season, his last as a player in the league. He was a valued mentor for a team that featured Shaquille ONeal and 18-year-old rookie Kobe Bryant. Scott later was Bryants head coach with the Lakers. He coached in the NBA from 1998 to 2016, including a head stint with the Lakers. Hes currently coaching in the Philippines.  Scott is currently married to Cece Gutierrez, who has appeared on the Basketball Wives reality show.

Carlos Santana kick-starts Guardians 8-run 6th in 8-6 win over Nationals,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Carlos Santana kick-started an eight-run sixth inning with a bases-clearing double, and the Cleveland Guardians beat the Nationals 8-6 on Wednesday to win two of three at Washington in a 24-hour span. The Guardians sent 13 men to the plate in the sixth against Michael Soroka (0-2) and relievers Jorge Lopez and Andrew Chafin. The first seven reached, and all of them scored. Leadoff man Steven Kwan scored twice in Clevelands biggest inning of the season. Before the sixth, the Guardians had just two hits and eight strikeouts against Soroka, who made his second start for the Nationals after straining his right biceps in his March 31 debut. But Cleveland rediscovered the relentless offense that produced nine runs in each game while splitting a doubleheader a day earlier. After a rainout Monday, the first game of Tuesdays twinbill began at 3:35 p.m. and Wednesdays regularly scheduled matinee concluded at 3:03 p.m. Gabriel Arias had four hits for Cleveland, which has won seven of nine. Joey Cantillo (1-0) worked a scoreless fifth, and Emmanuel Clase pitched the ninth for his eighth save. Washington left 15 runners on base. Guardians reliever Cade Smith, who gave up four runs in two-thirds of an inning in Tuesdays first game, entered in the seventh with a four-run advantage. He allowed Amed Rosarios two-run single, then loaded the bases before retiring Alex Call on a flyball to right to preserve an 8-6 lead. 
        
     Sorokas last scoreless outing of five innings or more was on July 24, 2020, his debut in that COVID-19-shortened season. Guardians: Begin a three-game series against visiting Philadelphia on Friday night with Gavin Williams (2-2, 5.06 ERA) on the mound.

"After Larkins challenge, some top US players commit to worlds with Milan Olympics on the horizon","Mere minutes after a crushing overtime defeat to Canada in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, U.S. veteran Dylan Larkin already had a sharp criticism and a suggestion to his fellow Americans about how to prevent similar outcomes in the future. Weve had a tough time with USA Hockey getting guys to play in the world championships, and I think guys that are at home watching this, Im hoping theyre wanting a piece of it, Larkin said. They got to go to the world championships and prove themselves and play for their country. Clayton Keller listened. So did Tage Thompson. Jeremy Swayman was on the U.S. 4 Nations roster, but with no guarantee hell be one of the three goaltenders at the Olympics in nine months, he committed, too. Its no sure thing theyll be in Milan next February or that the U.S. will win Olympic gold for the first time since the 1980 Miracle on Ice team. But getting elite talent to worlds this spring is a good start with the aim of winning the tournament for the first time since 1933. We need to get some winning swagger back, U.S. world championship coach Ryan Warsofsky told The Associated Press by phone before leaving for Europe. We want to be a team and a country that has a winning pedigree, and weve got to start winning this tournament. The fact that the U.S. won World War II more recently than the IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship is something general manager Jeff Kealty brought up to everyone he signed up to play. Warsofsky called it the ultimate motivation, while acknowledging also that a lot of guys on the team have a lot to play for to get on the Olympic radar. 
        
     I dont think its going to be the be-all, end-all as to whether or not some of these guys make the team in February, but I dont think theres any question that it can help and it can get them front and center with USA Hockey, Kealty told The AP. It might make the difference for the final few roster spots after the likes of Thompson, Keller, Jason Robertson and Cole Caufield were left off the 4 Nations team. U.S. Olympic GM Bill Guerin is going to Denmark to watch and scout, and he said he puts a big emphasis on players participating and showing what they can do on a big international stage. Its not necessarily how many goals you score or this or that: When are we going to win that tournament? We need to win that tournament soon, Guerin said Tuesday. We need our best players though. Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon are going. That should say something. It is a commitment from our players to go and try to win that tournament. ... It is an Olympic year, but we need this more consistently from our players to go over and play and try to win that tournament. Canada has won it four times over the past decade, since back-to-back Olympic titles with NHL players in 2010 and 14. Crosby and MacKinnon joining this year makes the top hockey country on earth the favorite once again.  But the U.S. wants to close the gap on Canada, and even reaching the world championship final for the first time since 1956 would be a step forward. The Americans, of course, are not shooting for silver. The biggest thing for us to make a name and a statement is to win the tournament, Warsofsky said. Thats what well be remembered for as the team thats won a tournament for the first time since 1933. Just getting great U.S. players to take the tournament seriously would be a plus. Kealty understands with the NHL playoffs going on that the worlds are very much out of sight, out of mind in North America but points out players and coaches who have gone always return raving about their experience. Goalie Charlie Lindgren is one of them, comparing the playoffs with Washington on the road at New Yorks Madison Square Garden to a packed arena in Prague facing host Czechia. We played our first round at MSG last year with the Caps against the Rangers, which that was at the time the best atmosphere Ive ever played in, said Lindgren, who has represented the U.S. twice at worlds. Then going over there to the Czech Republic and seeing that, its just a totally different vibe. Its almost like you see the soccer games where the crowds on their feet the whole game doing chants. Lindgren remembers three-time Stanley Cup champion Patrick Kane leading the charge in 2018 to get more U.S. stars to the world championships, and the late Johnny Gaudreau was the poster boy for saying yes to USA Hockey when called. Larkin is only absent this year because of a family situation keeping him home. Perhaps those examples and Larkins challenge will be the start of the U.S. path toward winning more gold medals, from the worlds to the Olympics, now that players are showing they do indeed want a piece of this. Theres hopefully kind of a moment here, Kealty said. I do think more and more of these guys are standing up and wanting to go participate, and I think it speaks great for USA Hockey and speaks great for the future. ___ AP Hockey Writer John Wawrow in Buffalo, New York, and AP Sports Writer Dave Campbell in St. Paul, Minnesota, contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/us-world-hockey-championships-ca7ae342b9a904e6b70dca72e161da18,sports
Chennai overcomes top-order batting collapse to beat Kolkata in IPL,"KOLKATA, India (AP)  Chennai Super Kings pushed defending champion Kolkata Knight Riders to the brink of elimination with a nervy two-wicket victory in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday. Chennai, which is already out of the playoff race, overcame another top-order batting collapse to reach 183-8 for only its third win in 12 matches. Kolkata lies at No. 6 with 11 points and just two games in hand. Wrist-spinner Noor Ahmad had earlier picked up 4-31 on a favorable wicket for spinners to restrict Kolkata at 179-6. Dewald Brevis didnt hold back despite Chennai losing half the side inside the first six overs of the batting powerplay. Kolkata had Chennai on the mat at 60-5 inside the first six overs despite young IPL debutant Urvil Patel making a rapid 31 off 11 balls that featured four sixes. With 87 needed of the last 10 overs, Brevis turned the game on its head with his wide range of shots and smashed fast bowler Vaibhav Arora for 6-4-4-6-6-4 in one over as he raised his maiden IPL half-century off 22 balls. Kolakta fought back when Brevis holed out at long-on in the 13th over, but impact player Shivam Dube (45) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni brought Chennai closer to victory with 43-run partnership. Arora picked up the wickets of Dube and Ahmad in the penultimate over but experienced Dhoni (17 not out) ensured Chennai doesnt slip up in the last over as he lofted Andre Russell for six over mid-wicket and No. 10 batter Anshul Kamboj sealed the game with a boundary. Noor Ahmad exploited perfect bowling conditions for spinners to restrict Kolkata as he combined with Ravindra Jadeja (1-34) and Ravichandran Ashwin (0-19) to restrict Kolkata. The three spinners bowled 11 overs between them to finish with 5-84. Kolkata lost Rahmanullah Gurbaz (11) in Kambojs first over but Sunil Narine (26) and captain Ajinkya Rahane (48) hit a combined eight fours and two sixes to take it to 67-1 in first six overs. But once the spinners were deployed from both ends, Kolkata struggled to keep up the momentum. Ahmad had two wickets in his first over when he had Narine stumped and then Angkrish Raghuvanshi edged the left-arm spinner to give Dhoni his 200th catch in the IPL. Rahane and Manish Pandey, who replaced injured Venkatesh Iyer, added 32 runs before Rahane was caught by Devon Conway at backward point to give Jadeja his first wicket. Russell provided impetus by smashing three sixes and four boundaries in his 21-ball knock of 38 before Ahmad had him caught at long-off in the death overs and also dismissed Rinku Singh for 9. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/chennai-kolkata-ipl-3806cf634907e3ee289b1edd948ef09e,sports

ACC cuts 20-game mens basketball slate to make room for nonconference games in bid to boost sport,"The Atlantic Coast Conference is hoping its mens basketball programs trade two fewer league games for marquee nonconference matchups in an effort to reverse a dwindling haul of NCAA Tournament bids. The league announced Wednesday it is reducing its 20-game mens basketball schedule to 18. The change comes after Commissioner Jim Phillips has been vocal about spending the past two seasons examining the conundrum of the ACC getting fewer bids  down to four this year, its fewest since 2013  despite having teams regularly playing deep into March. Going to 18 games could make room for schools to add quality nonconference matchups to help their schedule strength  and therefore the ACCs stature, provided the league wins its share of measuring-stick games, unlike last year. It will shake up the scheduling model, which will mean ACC teams wont face one league member each year. In a statement, Phillips said the move  first reported by CBS Sports  is a direct result of our ongoing strategic review and analysis and gives them more control of scheduling by freeing up two slots. It also comes as the league implements a new revenue-distribution model that will factor in TV viewership in its payouts to league schools, which could offer even more incentive to schedule marquee opponents that fans want to watch to boost the bottom line. This decision reflects our on-going prioritization to do whats best for ACC Mens Basketball, Phillips said, and we appreciate the thoughtfulness of our membership and the support from our television partners. 
        
     The new model will have the league schedule running from late December into the first Saturday of March. Each team will play one primary partner at home and away every year, with those pairings  such as famed rivals Duke and North Carolina or instate opponents Virginia and Virginia Tech  designed to create some protection for long-running series. The others primary pairings are Boston College-Notre Dame, Clemson-Georgia Tech, California-Stanford, Florida State-Miami, Louisville-SMU, N.C. State-Wake Forest and Pittsburgh-Syracuse. Each team also will play a home-and-away series against a partner that will change each year, then play one game against 14 of the remaining 15 teams. It wont be perfect. Aside from the fact that some teams wont play each another, there are hiccups such as no guarantees that neighboring rivals UNC and North Carolina State will have their typical home-and-away meetings; the Tar Heels and Wolfpack have played those every year reaching back to their Southern Conference days long before the ACCs birth in May 1953. Still, Phillips had been clear the league had to make changes to address the newfound shakiness in a sport widely and long regarded as its crown jewel. The ACC had played an 18-game schedule from the 2012-13 season through 2018-19, then moved to a 20-game slate for the 2019-20 season with its ESPN-partnered launch of the ACC Network. At the time, the ACC was coming off a fourth straight season with at least seven NCAA bids  including a record nine in 2017 and 2018  while having three No. 1 seeds in 2019 and winning three of five national titles (Duke in 2015, North Carolina in 2017 and Virginia in 2019). Things have been tougher since the pandemic, coinciding with the retirement of big-name coaches like UNCs Roy Williams, Dukes Mike Krzyzewski and Syracuses Jim Boeheim. Or last year with the unexpected departure of Virginias Tony Bennett weeks before the season began. The league had seven bids during the bubble 2021 tournament in Indiana, then fell to five for three straight seasons before sliding to four this year, its first as an expanded 18-team basketball conference. By comparison, the ACC had 12 teams the last time it got just four bids in 2013. And yet, the league also had both UNC and Duke in the Final Four in 2022, Miami there in 2023, N.C.

Fastest South American marathon runner banned 5 years for steroid doping before Paris Olympics,"MONACO (AP)  South Americas fastest marathoner was banned for five years after testing positive for three steroids one month before the Paris Olympics, track and field investigators said Wednesday. Daniel do Nascimento of Brazil also will miss the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics before his ban expires in July the following year. Do Nascimentos marathon career peaked in 2022: He clocked 2 hours, 4 minutes, 51 seconds at the Seoul Marathon; placed eighth at the world championships in Eugene, Oregon; and led the New York Marathon for more than 20 miles until collapsing. His record time in Seoul qualified him for the Paris Olympics but he tested positive twice in samples given while training last July in Rio de Janeiro. The steroids metenolone and drostanolone were found in both samples and nandrolone was found in the first one, the Athletics Integrity Unit said. The AIU said clear evidence of the athletes use of multiple prohibited substances justified an extended six-year ban for Do Nascimento, which was cut by one year because he acknowledged doping and accepted the sanction. The 26-year-old Brazilian runner also competed in the Tokyo Olympics marathon, which he did not finish. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/marathon-nascimento-brazil-doping-steroids-olympics-469ae7816346a2c4578ec3799bace408,sports
Yordan Alvarez has muscle strain at the top of his right hand. Astros hopeful he could return soon,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Houston Astros slugger Yordan Alvarez has a strained muscle at the top of his right hand, a diagnosis that instills optimism he wont have a prolonged stay on the injured list. The three-time All-Star went on the 10-day injured list Monday, retroactive to Saturday, and returned to Houston for an MRI that revealed the muscle strain. We look at it as good news, Astros manager Joe Espada said before their 9-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday. Espada expressed hope that Alvarez wouldnt have to stay on the injured list longer than the required 10 days. He also said the hand issue may have played a role in Alvarezs slow start. Alvarez, 27, is hitting .210 with a .306 on-base percentage, three homers and 18 RBIs in 29 games this season. He batted .308 with a .392 on-base percentage, 35 homers and 86 RBIs in 147 games last year while ranking ninth in the AL Most Valuable Player balloting. He has posted an OPS of at least .959 and has finished 13th or higher in the MVP voting each of the last three seasons. Once he heals, once he gets back, I think well see a more aggressive at bat and be not as cautious, Espada said. I think it had something to do with it, yes. His potential return could go a long way toward boosting an Astros lineup that hasnt been as productive as usual this season. The Astros entered Wednesdays action ranked 21st in the majors in runs (136) and 23rd in OPS (.676). Houston has ranked 11th or better in both those categories each of the last four seasons. 
        
     The Astros did show some improvement on offense Wednesday as they capitalized on seven walks and Jeremy Peas three-run homer to get their record back to .500. Yordan Alvarez is missed on any lineup, said Pea, who scored twice and drove in four runs. Hes a leader in this clubhouse. Hes one of our biggest bats in the lineup. But what makes this team so great is that we have guys that step up. We just lean on the guys that are out there. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/houston-astros-yordan-alvarez-42943f07c6c4eaa5cbb38c7a283f6248,sports
Russell not impressed by FIA hinting at relaxing rules against cursing and code of driver conduct,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  George Russell had a frosty response Thursday to FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem claiming in an Instagram post hes received constructive feedback from drivers that has the governing body considering relaxing the code of conduct that penalizes for cursing. Formula 1 drivers have been furious about Ben Sulayems rule that went into effect this year. When they learned of it last season, the Grand Prix Drivers Association sent Ben Sulayem an open letter that Russell claims went unacknowledged. So the Mercedes driver seemed surprised to learn Ben Sulayem is claiming theres been an active dialogue. Ben Sulayem wrote I am considering making improvements to Appendix B,  the rule that defines the penalties for a range of offenses that include physical violence to political statements, using foul language and any comments deemed to cause moral injury or loss to FIA. The base fine for an F1 driver is set out at $45,500 (40,000 euros). But Russell said Ben Sulayems post doesnt mean anything unless the rules are actually changed. Obviously we want to see these things put into action, rather than saying Were considering things. You know, we all consider a lot of things, Russell said during media availability ahead of the Miami Grand Prix. We (drivers) are clear we want changes. And once they are implemented, then well comment. But for the time being its being considered  the words dont mean anything until the change has been made. The new rule was received negatively by most of the racing series that the FIA oversees, including the World Rally Championship, where drivers complained it was a draconian approach. 
        
     This is an election year for Ben Sulayem, who was elected as president of the FIA after the 2021 season finale. Ben Sulayem is running for re-election and currently has no announced opponent. Hes had a bumpy relationship with the drivers from the start, as Lewis Hamilton and others pushed back on a rule banning the wearing of any jewelry in the race car. Further controversy followed with the firings of popular industry veterans, including F1 race director Niels Wittich, who was let go just before last Novembers Las Vegas Grand Prix. Asked last year if Ben Sulayem had the support of Hamilton, the seven-time champion was blunt. He never has, Hamilton said. Hamilton had a list of grievances regarding how the sport was dealing with its internal issues and even warned F1s reputation was in danger. There is a real lack of accountability here, within this sport, within the FIA, Hamilton said last year. There are things that are happening behind closed doors, there is no transparency, there is really no accountability and we need that. The fans need that. How can you trust the sport and what is happening here if you dont have that? When Ben Sulayem was asked about drivers being upset with the code of conduct rules, he said at the time it was none of their business. Although Russell denied there had been dialogue with the FIA over the rule since the letter was sent last year, he did note there was extensive discussion at the drivers briefing at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Itd be great if changes were made and the drivers were at least heard, Russell continued. I think thats just in the best interests of the sport, ensuring that some common sense is applied to these situations. But as I said, I think all of us, we can comment on it when we see the action being taken rather than just consideration. The FIA holds a regular driver briefing on Fridays of grand prix weekends. Russell isnt sure theyve been productive. The GPDA was first founded in 1961 and re-established in 1994. I mean, I feel its unprecedented times weve been in in the last 18 months, with whats been changing, whats happening. I think when the GPDA was founded years ago it wasnt really to talk about politics, Russell said. It was to talk about safety, it was to talk about improvements of the sport, improvements of racing. And especially myself, I find myself talking about topics that I didnt really have any intention of talking about. But we find ourselves in a time where were not focused on the things (relevant to) why were all here. Were here to go racing, were here to create the best show for the fans, to have the fastest cars, the safest cars, the best technology, the best engineering, and yet we talk about fines and punishments and swearing. So, yeah, maybe something should change. Were open to it. But we just ultimately want whats the best for the sport. Russell prodded former teammate Hamilton to say something! on the issue during the news conference. So he did. I think ultimately the GPDA is very unified, Hamilton said. Ultimately we want to be able to work closely with the FIA. I think everyone, all of us, want to continue to work together and make the sport better. And of course, weve faced a bit of an uphill challenge in that communication over time. Ultimately we (drivers) dont hold power, a power seat at the table. And that needs to change, in my opinion. If you look at other sports that have unions, that may be something that comes into play at some stage, he continued. But its just as I said, we dont want to control things, we just want to collaborate with them more and have our voices heard. Ultimately people making decisions for others, (people) that have never been in that position, its good to have a point of view from a drivers perspective, and thats what were trying to do. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-cursing-russell-ben-sulayem-b1f23d4f6eb771a837f75534b890ea9b,sports
Kyle Busch was once kicked out of a track for being too young. Now the NASCAR champ turns 40,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Kyle Busch was hyped for NASCAR greatness long before he was a teenager by his Hall of Fame nominee brother, who vowed if you think Im good, wait until you see my little brother. Buschs debut in a NASCAR national series race was delayed, though, when he turned up at California Speedway in 2001 intent to run the Truck Series race. He dominated practice in a race sponsored by Marlboro but, because he was only 16 at the time, was ruled ineligible to compete over NASCARs interpretation of the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The MSA prohibited individuals under 18 from participating in events sponsored by tobacco companies. And because NASCAR at the time was sponsored by Winston, the series eventually adopted its own rule six weeks later implementing a minimum age requirement of 18 that began in 2002. Busch had no choice but to move to the American Speed Association National Tour, and then ARCA after graduating early from his Las Vegas high school. Fast-forward to Friday when Busch celebrates his 40th birthday as a two-time Cup Series champion headed to Texas Motor Speedway with 232 national series victories. Kurt Busch, his older brother by seven years and a nominee last week to next years Hall of Fame class, has one Cup title and 43 career national series victories. Busch can now laugh at his experience 24 years ago at California Speedway, where he went on to win five Cup races, including the last one in 2023 before the track was shuttered by NASCAR. 
        
     Shut that place down, he said, noting the irony that hes now sponsored by zone nicotine pouches, which has an additional relationship with online retailer Nicokick. Full circle moment. Busch celebrated his birthday early  over the Easter weekend, which was NASCARs only break of the 38-race schedule  with a vacation with wife, Samantha. They left their two children home and Samantha made a heartfelt social media post honoring her husband. Early celebration for Kyles big 4-0, love ya babe, Samantha wrote, sharing a picture of herself and her husband at dinner on a beachfront. In a separate image, Kyle could also be seen with a small chocolate cake in front of him with a candle burning. Busch said he and Samantha made the most of it even though he finds it difficult to unwind. Just a nice little quiet time, tried to disconnect, thats not easy for me to do, Busch said. So Im still kind of doing some work from afar, emails and things like that. And as for turning 40? Well, he wasnt exactly thrilled. Busch is in his 23rd season in the Cup Series, and although he joined Richard Childress Racing in 2023 and won three races, he went winless in Cup last year for the first time in his career and missed the playoffs. His losing streak headed to Texas is an eye-popping 67 races. I remember turning 30 and thinking that was going to be it, Busch said. It is what it is. Samantha has made the best of that for me where we celebrated my birthday on that trip. I dont feel much older than I did five, six years ago. So thats the good part of it. And Im in pretty decent shape, so thankful for all of that. Busch briefly considered retirement at the end of the 2022 season when he parted ways with Joe Gibbs Racing, where he for now is the winningest driver in team history with Denny Hamlin closing in on his mark. Now, hed like to race at least until his son, Brexton, turns 18 and the two can compete against each other in NASCAR. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-kyle-busch-40-texas-30e4fd6df176e471ed0626751325e2a7,sports

Arteta says Arsenal was the better team despite Champions League loss to PSG,"PARIS (AP)  Once again, Arsenal will end a season without a trophy. The Premier League team fell to Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 on aggregate, failing in its bid to become only the third team in the tournaments history to reach the Champions League final after losing the first leg of its semifinal at home. Arsenal played well over the two games but lost twice against a rejuvenated and rock-solid PSG side. Arsenal has not won major silverware since lifting the FA Cup nearly five years ago in manager Mikel Artetas first season in charge. PSG won the return leg 2-1 in Paris on Wednesday. Arteta was adamant when asked if he believed the best team lost. I think so. Especially for 160 minutes. They told us, he said, referring to PSG admitting it, too. It was a case of the most of the performance was there, but just the finishing of the chances wasnt. Arsenal enjoyed most of the possession in Paris, had 61 attacks compared to PSGs 26, including 19 attempts at goal. Arteta was quick to point out that PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had been the best player in both legs with his decisive saves. He has won the game for them, Arteta said. We know that, to win a competition, someone in one of the two boxes has to do something special, to win it for you and make it happen. PSG coach Luis Enrique said Arteta is a great friend, but I dont agree at all. They played in a clever way, but we scored more goals than them and in football its the most important thing, he said. They did great, we suffered a lot. Its the match we suffered the most. But I think we deserved to go to the final. 
        
     Arsenal lost the Champions League final to Barcelona in 2006 and in the semifinals to Manchester United in 2009, and had not been back to the last four since. Defeating defending champion Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in the quarterfinals  after victories home and away  had raised expectations that Arsenal could go all the way. I can take positives and Im very proud of the team, said Arteta, who has guided his team to consecutive runner-up finishes in the Premier League. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/arsenal-arteta-psg-champions-league-73d59dce86f467012dc7ef27d1bc7733,sports
Akron football is ineligible for postseason play because of its low Academic Progress Rate score,"AKRON, Ohio (AP)  Akrons football team will be ineligible for postseason play this season because of its multiyear Academic Progress Rate score. The NCAA this week updated its national APR database with the latest scores of member institutions. Akron had a score of 914, below the 930 minimum for postseason eligibility. Akrons athletic department has not commented on its APR penalty and did not return immediately messages left by The Associated Press on Wednesday. Akron, which plays in the Mid-American Conference, has not been to a bowl game since 2017, which also was the last time the Zips won more than four games in a season. But Akrons 4-8 record in 2024 under third-year coach Joe Moorhead was its best since posting the same mark in 2018. In between, the Zips won no more than two games in a season and went winless (0-12) in 2019. The last Division I Football Bowl Subdivision football team to be barred from postseason play because of APR scores was Idaho in the 2014 season. The NCAA temporarily suspended some APR penalties, including postseason bans, because of the COVID-19 pandemic that began disrupting college athletics in the spring of 2020. However, the NCAAs Committee on Academics voted to restore such penalties beginning with four-year scores released during the 2024-25 academic year. ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/akron-football-apr-postseason-b26353283af3095c3f024fa1ccc0be5e,sports
Barcelona looking forward to bright Champions League future despite missing on 1st final in a decade,"MADRID (AP)  It was a heartbreaking elimination for Barcelona, having come minutes away from returning to the Champions League final for the first time in a decade. The disappointment was significant, considering how close it got to advancing and how well the team had been playing led by teenage sensation Lamine Yamal. Still, Barcelona found a way to focus on the positives following the 4-3 extra-time loss at Inter Milan in the semifinals of the Champions League on Tuesday, and the 17-year-old Yamal was making promises to bring the European trophy to the club. We gave everything we had, but this year it wasnt meant to be, Yamal said on a social media post. We will be back, there is no doubt about that. We wont stop until we put this club where it deserves, which is at the very top. I will fulfil my promise of bringing it to Barcelona. We wont stop until we do it. Barcelona recovered from a 2-0 halftime deficit on Tuesday to take the lead in the 87th minute before conceding a stoppage-time equalizer that forced extra time and led to Inters victory.  I am disappointed but not about the teams performance. They did everything they could and did a really good job. We are out but we will try again next season. We will try to make the fans and the club proud, Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said. We will learn from this, progress. We want to continue learning and next season we will be back. Barcelona has taken a huge leap forward in its first season under Flick, reaching the Champions League semifinals for the first time since 2019. It also leads the Spanish league, where it has a four-point advantage over Real Madrid ahead of the rivals last clasico of the season on Sunday in Barcelona.  
        
     The Catalan club has been dominant against Madrid this season, outscoring its rival 12-4 in three matches. Barcelona beat Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup final in January and 3-2 in the Copa del Rey final last month. It also won 4-0 at Madrids Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in their first league match of the season in October. We have another final on Sunday and we have to stick together, Yamal said.  A lot of the clubs optimism going forward stems from the amount of young talent in the squad. In addition to Yamal, Barcelona also has the likes of Ansu Fati, Pedri, Gavi, Pau Cubars, Fermn Lpez, Hctor Fort, Marc Casad, Alejandro Balde, Pablo Torre and Marc Bernal. The oldest in that list  at 22  are Pedri, Torre and Fati. We are a young side and we have to mature. We are working on it and we have to improve in defense and in other aspects, Flick said. We will continue to fight this season and the next. This game is over and now we have to pick ourselves up and look ahead as we have the clasico coming up. I will wake the team up. A loss on Sunday would bring Madrid back in the title race with three matches left. Madrid, the defending European champion, was eliminated by Arsenal in the Champions League quarterfinals.  Barcelona last played in a Champions League final in 2015, when a team led by Lionel Messi won the clubs fifth European trophy. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-champions-league-lamine-yamal-63325c9fdf966be14773b635370dc856,sports
Friedl hits 2 homers as Reds overcome Greenes groin injury to beat Braves 4-3 and end 4-game skid,"ATLANTA (AP)  TJ Friedl hit two home runs and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Atlanta Braves 4-3 on Wednesday night to snap a four-game losing streak despite losing right-hander Hunter Greene to a right groin injury after only three innings. Greene struck out six batters and allowed only two hits in three scoreless innings. He was unable to complete his warmup before the fourth inning. Greene threw only two warmup pitches, including a pitch that hit the dirt, before stopping his routine. The Reds provided no immediate details on the severity of the injury. Greene was escorted off the field with the Reds leading 4-0. Left-hander Brent Suter (1-0) replaced Greene on the mound and gave up a fifth-inning homer to Braves rookie catcher Drake Baldwin. Right-hander Emilio Pagn, who blew a save in the Braves 2-1 win in 10 innings on Tuesday night, pitched the ninth for his ninth save. Pagn gave up a two-out single to Michael Harris II before pinch-hitter Eddie Rosario struck out to end the game. Right-hander Grant Holmes (2-3) gave up four runs on seven hits in 5 1/3 innings as Atlantas three-game winning streak ended. Friedl entered the game with only one homer before leading off the game with a blast off Holmes over the center field wall. Friedl led off the third inning with his third homer to almost the same spot, giving the Reds a 3-0 lead. Greene threw 114 pitches, the high mark for any pitcher in the majors this season, in his last start, a 6-1 win over Washington on Friday night. Greene had a season-high 12 strikeouts in the win. The four-game series ends Thursday night when Reds LHP Nick Lodolo (3-3, 3.27) faces Braves RHP Spencer Schwellenbach (1-3, 3.92). Schwellenbach has lost his last three decisions. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/reds-braves-score-2eee3ced50e5f86e0d4d23482bb167a9,sports
Gosling scores twice to help the Sceptres beat the Frost 3-2 in PWHL playoff opener,"TORONTO (AP)  Julia Gosling scored twice in a 1:55 span in the second period and the Toronto Sceptres beat the defending champion Minnesota Frost 3-2 on Wednesday night in Game 1 of the PWHL semifinal series. Gosling made it 2-0 at 7:47 and struck again at 9:42 on a power play.  Just the way we were playing and the way our lines were changing, I think it just put me in a great spot to get that opportunity and then just use my shot, Gosling said. It was just super fun to get it done at home. Game 2 of the best-of-five series is Friday night in Toronto. Blayre Turnbull opened the scoring midway through the first, and Kristen Campbell stopped 24 shots for Toronto. I think the biggest takeaway for us is if you play the right way, chances are youll get rewarded, Sceptres coach Troy Ryan said. I thought we played responsible defensively, responsible physically, and some timely offence as well. Britta Curl-Salemme scored for Minnesota on a power play with 6:04 left in the second, and Katy Knoll made it a one-goal game at 2:33 of the third. Nicole Hensley made 34 saves for the Frost. We knew they were going to come out with a lot of energy and play hard, Minnesota coach Ken Klee said. And obviously, spotting them a 3-0 lead is a tough spot to be. But I loved the way our team responded. We didnt quit. Minnesota won its final two regular-season games to take the fourth and final playoff position. Curl-Salemme received a game misconduct for hitting Toronto defender Renata Fast in the head with 5:23 ;eft. Fast remained in the game. I thought it was a pretty ugly hit and I think the refs made the right call, Turnbull said. ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/frost-sceptres-pwhl-playoffs-e91930a954648326306eed040205976a,sports
"Alex Bregman, Wilyer Abreu carry Red Sox past Rangers, 6-4","BOSTON (AP)  Alex Bregman hit a tiebreaking two-run single and had a solo homer, Wilyer Abreu added two solo shots and the Boston Red Sox beat the Texas Rangers 6-4 on Wednesday night to snap a three-game losing streak. Bregman and Abreu each drove in three runs for Boston, which was 1-4 against the Rangers this season before pulling out the victory. Adolis Garca and Josh Jung each hit a solo homer for the Rangers, who have dropped eight of 11. Abreu hit his second of the game deep into the seats in right in the eighth, making it 6-3. Brennan Bernardino (2-1) worked a perfect inning of relief for the victory and Aroldis Chapman got the final three outs for his fifth save despite allowing Jungs homer. Jacob Webb (2-2) took the loss, giving up two runs in 2/3 of an inning. Trailing 2-1, Bregman and Abreu went deep one batter apart in the fourth. Garcas homer over the Green Monster gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the top of the inning. Bolstered by the hiring of Bret Boone as the teams new hitting coach after struggling offensively, the Rangers won the series opener Tuesday. With runners on second and third with two outs and the score tied at 3, Rangers manager Bruce Bochy elected to pitch to Bregman, who delivered the go-ahead hit to left against Robert Garcia. It was the third multihomer game of Abreus career and all of them have come against Texas.

"After losing no-hit bid in 7th inning, Padres pitcher Dylan Cease exits with forearm cramp","NEW YORK (AP)  Dylan Cease was dominant for six innings. And then moments later, he was done for the night. Soon after losing a no-hit bid in the seventh, the San Diego Padres pitcher left his start against the New York Yankees with a cramp in his right forearm Wednesday. It basically made my hand close tight for a couple of seconds. I dont think its anything too serious, Cease said after the Yankees rallied for a 4-3 victory in 10 innings. I honestly was going to throw some warmup pitches and see, but I think the smart thing was to do what we did there.  Cody Bellinger homered into the second deck in right field on an 0-2 fastball clocked at 98 mph with one out in the seventh for New Yorks first hit. Cease then struck out Anthony Volpe and got ahead 1-2 in the count against Jasson Domnguez before manager Mike Shildt and a Padres athletic trainer went to the Yankee Stadium mound. To his credit, he said something about it, Shildt said. Said he could have kept going but it didnt make sense at the moment, so well evaluate and see what happens. Cease nodded his head repeatedly during the discussion on the mound and ultimately walked off the field with the trainer and into the dugout. We did all the testing. Nothing hurts or anything. It was just my hand locked up for a couple seconds and let go, Cease said. I obviously would have liked to have kept going, but I think it was the right call. 
        
     Jason Adam was given all the time he needed to warm up, and was credited with the strikeout when Domnguez went down looking to end the inning. After the game, Shildt said Cease exited with a cramp in his right forearm. I dont have any worry about my arm, to be honest. I guess you never know, but Im not in any pain or anything. Im really not worried about it, Cease said. It was just kind of like a weird thing. Cease, who pitched the second no-hitter in San Diego history last July at Washington, threw 59 of his 89 pitches for strikes and whiffed star slugger Aaron Judge all three times they squared off. The right-hander struck out a season-best nine and walked two in a season-high 6 2/3 innings. Another batter reached on catchers interference. Legitimate no-hit stuff, Shildt said. It was going to be a read-it-and-react situation. Cease is 1-2 with a 4.91 ERA in eight starts this season. He left with the score tied 1-all.  Ive been working on some mechanical stuff and it hadnt been clicking, Cease said. Then today it finally clicked and got to the point where I was able to kind of just focus on my target and throw it. Ive been searching for that for a while now, so it definitely feels good to be back closer to what I should be. Cease was acquired from the Chicago White Sox for a package of four players in a March 2024 trade. He finished second in the 2022 AL Cy Young Award balloting and fourth in NL voting last year after going 14-11 with a 3.47 ERA in 33 starts during his first season with the Padres. There have been 12 no-hitters pitched at Yankee Stadium, including Don Larsens perfect game for New York in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Eight no-hitters have been thrown against the Yankees  six in New York. Four of those came since the team began playing at Yankee Stadium in 1923. The most recent was a combined effort by Houston pitchers Cristian Javier, Hctor Neris and Ryan Pressly on June 25, 2022. ___ AP freelance writer Larry Fleisher contributed to this report. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/dylan-cease-padres-injury-nohitter-yankees-c20ae47dbd3034f08962ce9ef1701568,sports

"Red Sox 1B Romy Gonzalez leaves game after collision at first, running out grounder","BOSTON (AP)  Boston Red Sox first baseman Romy Gonzalez left the game after colliding with Texas Rangers first baseman Josh Smith while trying to beat out an infield hit on Wednesday night. Both players were down on the ground for a bit, being attended to by their teams trainers. Gonzalez was down the right-field line, while Smith was next to the bag. Just sore, Red Sox manager Alex Cora said after their 6-4 victory. The way he landed, his back got tight. I think hes day to day. He should be OK. Smith backed up a bit to handle a throw from third and collided with Gonzalezs left leg as he reached the bag, sending the Boston player tumbling. Gonzalez was originally ruled safe on the play that scored a run to push the Red Sox ahead, 4-3, but it was overturned after the Rangers challenged, taking the run off the board and ending the inning.  The position is shorthanded for Boston now after Triston Casas was lost for the season when he ruptured a tendon in his left knee last week running to first. Gonzalez is expected to see the bulk of play at the position. Gonzalez was replaced Wednesday by Abraham Toro, who was called up from Triple-A Worcester on Saturday. The club has been reluctant to think about moving Rafael Devers to first after he was moved from third to DH when they signed free agent Alex Bregman to a $120-million, three-year deal during spring training. Like I told you guys in spring training, hes my DH, Cora said Saturday of Devers. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/gonzalez-red-sox-injured-cad69a011964e9d117cc5569f652e17e,sports
Scottie Schefflers lead grows to 8 in the dark at his hometown Byron Nelson,"McKINNEY, Texas (AP)  Scottie Schefflers comfortable lead at his hometown CJ Cup Byron Nelson was the same late in the third round as it was at the start, even without the dominance the top-ranked player showed over the first 36 holes. Then he found that form again, and made a big lead even bigger at 23 under while finishing after sunset Saturday night.  Scheffler has an eight-shot lead after a 5-under 66 capped by birdies on three of the final five holes  the last on the par-5 18th more than 13 hours after the day began with about half the field needing to complete the second round, including 18 players who hadnt even started. There was a six-hour weather delay Friday. Erik von Rooyen (65), Adam Schenk (65) and Ricky Castillo (67) are 15 under, with Kurt Kitiyama (68) and Jhonattan Vegas (67) another shot back. Scheffler had his first two bogeys of the tournament and was 2 under for the day through 13 holes after missing the PGA Tour record for the lowest 36-hole score by one shot at 124 (18 under). His six-shot lead after two rounds was a Nelson record. At the short par-4 14th, Scheffler drove the green before settling for a tap-in birdie, then put his tee shot at the long par-3 15th inside four feet for another birdie. The horn for darkness had already sounded after Scheffler, Castillo and Sam Stevens teed off on 18 when the group in front was still in the fairway but cleared them to hit to try to save time. The players had the option to finish. 
        
     Scheffler couldnt see his second shot from the rough after impact, but it reached the green. He two-putted from 31 feet for the biggest 54-hole lead on the PGA Tour since Rory McIroy also led by eight on the way to winning the 2011 U.S. Open. I saw it take off the way I wanted it to, Scheffler said of his approach on 18. But after that, I couldnt see that far. Really, Id say the most challenging part was reading a green. Van Rooyen was in the rough beside the green on 18 in two shots and looking for another birdie that would have matched the low around of the day, only to need four strokes from there for a bogey. The rough was quite thin, so I thought I could scoot the ball through it, van Rooyen said. I didnt the first time. Then it came out dead the second time as well. So I just got it wrong. Schenk, who had missed six consecutive cuts coming into the Nelson, left with a similar feeling on his matching 65 after a bogey on 15 stalled his momentum at the TPC Craig Ranch course in the Dallas suburbs. Stevens started the day alone in second behind Scheffler, and was the only remaining player without a bogey when he had four in a five-hole stretch. The native of nearby Fort Worth was among five players at 13 under after a 70. That group included Antoine Rozner, who had the low around of the day at 63.  Jordan Spieth, Schefflers fellow Dallas resident and former University of Texas golfer, shot a second consecutive 67 and is 10 under. He was the first of the two to make his tour debut in the Nelson when he contended on Sunday as a 16-year-old in 2010. Schefflers first appearance was four years later, and it will take a massive turn of events for him not to be the first of the good friends to win perhaps their favorite event. Hes set to become the first high school golfer from Dallas to win the Nelson since Scott Verplank in 2007. He could also become the third wire-to-wire winner in the history of the tournament after Mark Hayes (1976) and Tom Watson (1980). I mean, I just walked off the golf course, Scheffler said in the darkness of a post-round interview. Tomorrow is not really a concern of mine right now. Schefflers first bogey came at the par-3 fourth hole, when his tee shot came up short and he missed a 7-footer for par. The two-time Masters winner missed five fairways after missing a total of six the first two rounds. I definitely wasnt as sharp as I was the last two days, but overall I posted a pretty good score, Scheffler said. Over a 72-hole tournament, youre going to have days, or typically at least one day where your swings not firing on all cylinders like it was the first two days. Its all about how you battle through that. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/byron-nelson-scottie-scheffler-27836d49655737c9614419d662d880d6,sports
Davis Riley makes cut at Byron Nelson with eagle after penalty over distance measuring devices,"McKINNEY, Texas (AP)  Davis Riley eagled his final hole to make the cut on the number at the Byron Nelson on Saturday after the PGA Tours first two-stroke penalty in the experimental use of distance measuring devices. Riley self-reported the violation on No. 17, his eighth hole, when his distance finder flashed a slope measurement, which isnt allowed. This is the third of four weeks that players are allowed to use the devices to measure distance as the tour tries to address pace-of-play issues. The 28-year-old Dallas resident made an 11-foot putt for eagle on the par-5 ninth to finish 5 under. Hometown favorite Scottie Scheffler was 18 under and held a six-shot lead after 36 holes. Riley said he knew immediately it was a slope number that popped up on his device as he used it. He talked to a rules official while still on the par-3 stadium hole at TPC Craig Ranch in the Dallas suburbs. Unfortunately, it was just kind of one of those moments where your heart sinks a little bit, like youre just throwing away two shots, Riley said. We certainly have a trial period here with this, and I know the USGA is trying to do something about the range finder and the pace of play. Its not the first time Riley has self-reported a two-stroke penalty. He did it in the final of the 2013 U.S. Junior Amateur, against Scheffler no less, when his ball moved as he addressed a birdie putt on No. 16. The resulting bogey gave Scheffler a 3 and 2 victory. 
        
     Its a gentlemans game. Thats just something, when you start out with that, thats the integrity of the game knowing guys are going to keep that there, Riley said. You kind of have to have that same trust as if guys, what happened to me today, have the security to say, Hey, I shot this, and it was accidentally on slope. Riley said he and his caddie had checked to make sure the slope measurement wasnt turned on, and that it was accidentally engaged when he took the device out of its case. I think there can be some more, a deeper look into this, just because I know this has happened a numerous amount of times, Riley said, referring to other tours. Id hate to see something happen coming down the stretch and you pull out a range finder, and it ends up a two-stroke penalty and costs the tournament. Riley at least kept himself in this tournament with a clutch shot from 223 yards on his final hole. He will be the defending champion later this month at the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial in nearby Fort Worth. This tournament has been good to me. It was my first PGA Tour start, Riley said. So playing with family and friends here, and being able to play the weekend is very important to me. That would have been a tough pill to swallow off a two-shot penalty to miss the cut by one. So it was a lot of relief. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/byron-nelson-davis-riley-penalty-3d5de76971372e46087edd0d937a892d,sports
"Jim Dent, the long hitter and one of the top Black golfers on PGA Tour Champions, dies at age 85","Jim Dent grew up in the caddie yards of Augusta, Georgia, eventually working at the Masters and honing his game at the municipal course known as The Patch. He went on to become one of the PGA Tours longest hitters and one of the top Black golfers of his generation. Dent died on Friday at age 85, a week before his birthday, his grandson posted on Facebook. The PGA Tour said on its website that Dent suffered a stroke the day after Augusta National announced plans for Tiger Woods to design a par 3 course at The Patch. What I learned about playing golf has probably kept me all through life, Dent told the USGA for a story in 2012. You had to be honest. You had to work at it. You just couldnt pick up today and not come back til next week. And if you broke a rule, you had to turn yourself in. Dent worked hard enough on his game that he entered a few United Golfers Association tournaments, a league devote to Black players, moved to California and took lessons from former U.S. Open champion Johnny Goodman. He finally earned his PGA Tour card through qualifying school in 1970, and while he never won on tour, he kept a full schedule of at least 22 tournaments for the next 16 years. His best result was in the 1972 Walt Disney World Open Invitational, when he trailed Jack Nicklaus by two shots going into the final round. Nicklaus shot 64 and won by nine. Dent won the Michelob-Chattanooga Gold Cup Classic in 1983, a Tournament Players Series event for players who were not fully exempt  the tour had gone to the all-exempt tour that year instead of the majority of the field going through Monday qualifying. 
        
     Dent never met any of the qualifying criteria to play in the Masters, but he made the cut in eight of the 11 majors he played  six at the PGA Championship, five at the U.S. Open. He was best known for his prodigious length, and Dent won the inaugural World Long Drive Championship in 1974. After turning 50, he won 12 times on the PGA Tour Champions. Al Geiberger said after Dent shot 64 to win his first Champions event, Jim Dent ought to be outlawed (for) the way he can hit the ball. A lot of people will remember Jim Dent for how far he hit the ball, and he really did, said Miller Brady, president of the PGA Tour Champions. Yet his long-term success, especially on our tour, proved Jim was more than just long off the tee. The fourth of six children, Dent lost both parents by the time he was 12 and was raised by his aunt, Mary Benton. She was opposed to him caddying at The Patch and told him, If you learn how to caddie, youre going to learn how to gamble. Kids think theyre the smartest people in the world, Dent said in the USGA story. Second thing I learned how to do when I learned how to caddie was shoot dice and play cards. She was dead right. He worked at Augusta Country Club, and Dent recalled how caddies could play if they were willing to cut crabgrass out of the greens. Among the players he caddied for at Augusta National for the Masters were Bob Goalby and Bob Rosburg. Augusta named the road leading into The Patch as Jim Dent Way in 2020 as a tribute. Two years later, Dent was inducted into the Caddie Hall of Fame. His son, Jim Dent Jr., now is the head pro at The Patch. Augusta National is pouring support into upgrading the municipal course under the work of architects Tom Fazio and Beau Welling. It will include a longer, conditioned course with a new short-game area and clubhouse. Woods is designing a Par 3 course called the Loop at The Patch to honor Augusta National caddies who played there. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/jim-dent-dead-pga-tour-champions-augusta-patch-5adef1b008949c40d7be0923db524d05,sports
Bryson DeChambeau wins on LIV Golf for his first title since the US Open last summer,"INCHEON, South Korea (AP)  Bryson DeChambeau held off a big charge from Charles Howell III with birdies on his last two holes for a 6-under 66 on Sunday for a two-shot victory at LIV Golf Korea, his first title since winning the U.S. Open last summer. DeChambeau, who played in the final group at the Masters and lost a 36-hole lead at LIV Golf Mexico City last week, started the third and final round at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club with a four-shot lead and was even par for the round through nine holes. Howell, his Crushers teammate, closed with a 63. They were tied until Howell made a bogey on the 16th hole, and DeChambeau rolled in a long birdie putt at the 17th for a two-shot cushion going to the par-5 18th. They both birdied. DeChambeau finished at 19-under 197 and won $4 million for his first LIV Golf League title since September 2023 and his third overall. Crushers won the team title by nine shots over Smash. DeChambeau next joins what likely will be 13 other players from LIV Golf in the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club on May 15-18.

Portland WNBA team breaks ground on training center it will share with NWSLs Thorns,"HILLSBORO, Ore. (AP)  Theres no team name just yet, but the expansion Portland WNBA team broke ground Tuesday on the training facility it will share with the Thorns of the National Womens Soccer League.  The $150 million project set to be built west of Portland is the first such alliance between the two womens leagues.  Portlands WNBA team will join the league in 2026. The team is owned by the Bhathal family, which also owns the Thorns and has a stake in the NBAs Sacramento Kings.  Lisa Bhathal Merage said it was important to create a space that centered the needs of women. I think this performance center will be changing the dynamic for womens sports for generations to come. Its the first dual-purpose professional womens sport performance center in the world, and we may not see any others after this, Bhathal Merage said. Our view is to collaborate, involve the community and really lift up everybody by that collaboration. Among those at the ceremony were NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek. The new training facility will repurpose buildings once owned by Nike.  Berman said that while some NWSL teams share facilities with Major League Soccer teams, the Bhathals approach is not only unique, but smart investment-wise.  Instead of thinking about it through the lens of the same playing surface or playing environment, you both have female athletes and there are going to be economies of scale in our ability to service those professional athletes as women. So, were going to build this center of excellence around female athletes thats rooted in our investment in the WNBA and NWSL. Makes total sense to me, Berman said. And certainly there are both strategic and tactical investments that can be made that can be leveraged for both properties that wouldnt have to be duplicated. 
        
     As for the much-anticipated team name? Thats coming. Weve literally compiled every single comment from every single person into a massive spreadsheet and rank them in order of how popular they were. And weve worked with the WNBA on all of those names, Bhathal Merage said. So we are getting closer. Were waiting for final league approval and, hopefully within the next two, maximum three months, well be able to unveil everything. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-nwsl-portland-d21a3a883c84b5e4ad117c20fa463646,sports
WNBA training camps opening. Heres why not every draft pick will make her teams roster,"NEW YORK (AP)  WNBA training camps are set to open this weekend and theres no doubt that No. 1 draft pick Paige Bueckers is primed for a pro career in the league. Not all 38 selections from this years draft will have such assurances. The WNBA has potentially 156 coveted roster spots among 13 teams, and other options for pro careers in womens basketball either in the U.S. or overseas are scarce. Teams can have up to 12 players on their rosters if they fit under the leagues salary cap, but most franchises carry only 11. Its a sharp contrast from mens prospects who dont make NBA rosters. They have other opportunities, including more overseas options and playing in the G League. The NBA also has 30 teams with 15 players allowed on the regular-season roster, so there are more spots available. Theres a simple reason why being among those 38 draft picks doesnt ensure a roster spot: Most of the spots will be taken by returning players. Last years draft class headlined by Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese had 13 players make opening day rosters, which was down two from the previous season and four from 2022. Many teams draft international players to stash them overseas until potentially having them join the franchise at a future date. Players have tried to carve out a WNBA chance by playing professionally overseas, but those jobs also are at a premium. Brittney Griners nine-month incarceration in Moscow along with the war in Ukraine have led to the elimination of dozens of potential jobs in Russia. Bueckers, the UConn standout, was picked first overall by the Dallas Wings and is poised to be the cornerstone of the franchise. Notre Dames Sonia Citron (No. 3 Washington), Southern Californias Kiki Iriafen (No. 4 Washington) and Kentuckys Georgia Amoore (No. 6 Washington) all are in a good spot to play on teams that are rebuilding this season. The Connecticut Sun also are in rebuild mode, which gives No. 7 Aneesah Morrow of LSU and No. 8 Saniya Rivers of N.C. State a good chance to contribute. It will be a lot harder for second- and third-round picks to remain in the WNBA after training camp. Of course, its disappointing for players who come so close to fulfilling their WNBA dreams but get squeezed out because of numbers. However, it also can be a big deal for fans who no longer get to see a favorite college player on the court. The league is adding two more expansion teams in 2026, with Portland and Toronto being awarded franchises. That will open up potentially two dozen more jobs.  ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-roster-rookies-draft-223359a4857db16573a0fc15f854d4ae,sports
WNBA training camps set to open this weekend with Caitlin Clark preparing for Year 2,"Aja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier will be back on the court Sunday to renew their chase of a coveted WNBA championship when training camps open and last years rookie sensation Caitlin Clark begins Year 2 in the league. Stewart and the New York Liberty will be chasing a second straight WNBA title, something Wilson and the Aces did in 2022 and 2023. There has been a lot of player movement in the offseason with the Aces adding Jewell Loyd in a three-team trade that sent Kelsey Plum to Los Angeles. Las Vegas still has a solid core with Wilson, Loyd, Chelsea Gray and Jackie Young. New York added Natasha Cloud to bolster its roster with guard Betnijah Laney-Hamilton sidelined for a few months after having knee surgery. No team made more changes this offseason then the Fever, who are led by Clark. Indiana added Sophie Cunningham through a trade and signed free agents DeWanna Bonner, Natasha Howard, Sydney Colson, and Brianna Turner. Add that to Clark and Aliyah Boston and theres a lot of excitement in Indiana. Theres a new energy in Dallas as well with No. 1 pick Paige Bueckers joining the team. The Wings are hoping that the former UConn star can bolster a roster that features Arike Ogunbowale. Golden State will be the first new WNBA team to take the court since the Atlanta Dream began play in 2008. 
        
     Eight of the 13 teams will have new head coaches this season. Atlanta and Los Angeles turned to college coaches Karl Smesko and Lynne Roberts, respectively. Indiana brought back former coach and player Stephanie White to lead the Fever. White had been in charge of the Connecticut Sun, who replaced her with former Belgium national team coach Rachid Meziane. Chicago, Dallas and Washington turned to former WNBA assistant coaches Tyler Marsh, Chris Koclanes and Sydney Johnson, respectively. Golden State also brought in a former assistant coach, Natalie Nakase, to be the first head coach in the expansion franchises history. Indiana is not the only team to make major moves with several franchises adding marquee names to rosters during the offseason via free agency. Atlanta picked up former Mercury All-Star Brittney Griner, who had spent her entire WNBA career playing in Arizona since being drafted No. 1 in 2013 by Phoenix. The Dream also added former Connecticut standout Brionna Jones. Phoenix was active in bolstering its roster, trading for Alyssa Thomas and signing Satou Sabally. The Sun lost their entire starting five from last season and brought back former UConn All-American Tina Charles as well as Diamond DeShields. Two players that wont be in camp this year are Diana Taurasi and Elena Delle Donne. Both announced their retirements this offseason. Taurasi had played her entire 20-year career in Phoenix, leading the Mercury to three WNBA championships. Delle Donne played in both Chicago and Washington, helping the Mystics win the franchises lone title in 2019. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-training-camp-caitlin-clark-aja-wilson-napheesa-collier-008b21ec8b0e7e0a566ce6ee627d35e3,sports
"Bills add depth at receiver by signing Elijah Moore to a 1-year, $5 million deal, AP source says","ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP)  The Buffalo Bills agreed to sign receiver Elijah Moore to a one-year contract potentially worth $5 million, a person with knowledge of the deal confirmed to The Associated Press on Wednesday. The person spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because the Bills have not announced the agreement first reported by ESPN.com. Moore has four seasons of NFL experience including the past two with Cleveland where he combined for 120 catches for 1,178 yards and three touchdowns in 34 games.  The 25-year-old was selected by the Jets in the second round of the 2021 draft out of Mississippi. He had 80 catches for 984 yards and six TDs in 27 games with New York before being traded to Cleveland in March 2023. Listed at 5-foot-10 and 180 pounds, Moore joins the Bills after general manager Brandon Beane received criticism for not addressing the receiver position until selecting Kaden Prather in the seventh round of the draft on Saturday. Moore was already scheduled to visit the Bills for a workout on Monday, when Beane responded to the criticism during an interview on Buffalos WGR-AM radio. Beane said he was focused on addressing his teams most pressing needs while also following his draft board in using Buffalos first five selections and six of nine on defensive players. He also defended his approach by noting much of the offense returns intact after the Josh Allen-led unit ranked second in the NFL in scoring last season despite receiver Stefon Diggs being traded to Houston a year ago. 
        
     Moore will compete for a backup spot at a position that returns Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Curtis Samuel. Buffalo also added receivers Joshua Palmer and Laviska Shenault in free agency to compensate for the losses of Mack Hollins and Amari Cooper. The Browns, meantime, placed an unrestricted free agent tender on Moore this week. Though Moore was free to sign elsewhere, his departure now factors into the NFLs formula in determining whether to award Cleveland a compensatory pick in next years draft. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-elijah-moore-d2472c9835ecc3484a315d89755871d2,sports
Steelers add wide receiver Robert Woods to crowded room that includes DK Metcalf and George Pickens,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  The Pittsburgh Steelers signed veteran wide receiver Robert Woods to a one-year deal on Thursday. The 33-year-old Woods has spent 12 years in the NFL, including the past two with the Houston Texans. Woods caught a career-low 20 passes for 203 yards in 15 games for the Texans last season. Woods is joining a wide receiver group that includes two-time Pro Bowler DK Metcalf  acquired in a March trade with Seattle  and George Pickens, who is entering the final year of his rookie deal. Woods has caught 683 passes for 8,233 yards and 38 touchdowns across his career and twice had more than 1,000 yards receiving. He won a Super Bowl ring with the Los Angeles Rams after the 2021 season, though he missed the playoffs after tearing the ACL in his left knee in November of that year. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/pittsburgh-steelers-53980424a329ef644c9895c2bcc14ca2,sports
Paige Bueckers dons cowboy hat in Big D as WNBA No. 1 overall pick formally introduced by Wings,"DALLAS (AP)  Paige Bueckers has done her best to live in the present during a short period in which she went from winning a national championship with UConn earlier this month to being the No. 1 overall pick in the WNBA draft and now donning a Stetson cowboy hat on a podium in Dallas City Hall. Its been insane. Its been nonstop on the go, Im either doing something or packing, Bueckers said Wednesday. Thats what its been like for the past couple weeks. But Ive tried to stay present as much as I could, enjoy the last couple of days at UConn soaking in those relationships and those experiences, obviously enjoying the draft. The next step is training camp with the Dallas Wings, which starts Sunday. Very excited for the next chapter, the versatile 23-year-old guard said. Bueckers and the other four players drafted by the Wings on April 14 were introduced in a packed lobby at Dallas City Hall that included the mayor, the city council and city workers, some watching from perches on the second and third floors. Well, it was Christmas nine days ago (at the draft). Certainly, today feels like New Years Eve or New Years Day with the optimism and all the momentum around the Dallas Wings, new general manager Curt Miller said. There was never a question for Miller or the Wings about who their top pick would be when they won the WNBA draft lottery. The big picture is that we knew what that meant ... exciting, exciting moment, Miller said. Paige obviously comes off a national championship, one of the most decorated collegiate players and one of the most efficient players in college basketball history. 
        
     Along with proclamations from the mayor, there were also the cowboy hats for each of the Wings draftees: Bueckers, 12th overall pick Aziaha James from North Carolina State, 14th pick Madison Scott from Mississippi, 27th pick JJ Quinerly from West Virginia and 31st pick Aaronette Vonleh from Baylor. Everybodys talked about just being a part of a new family, being a part of a new city. Dallas is a great sports city, you can feel the love and support already, Bueckers said. Theres lot of new in this organization, so be a part of something and build with each other, and just create a new sisterhood. The introductory news conference was held a couple of blocks from the historic downtown arena being fully renovated to become the new home of the Wings next season. But Bueckers home games in her first season with the Wings will be about 20 miles away at College Park Center at UT-Arlington, where they will play their 10th and final season since the franchise relocated from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Except for one home game on June 27. The Wings that night will play Indiana and Caitlin Clark, last years No. 1 overall pick, at the home of the NBAs Dallas Mavericks. It was a year ago Thursday that the Dallas City Council approved a 15-year agreement worth $19 million to facilitate the teams pending move to its namesake city. The council also approved a $7.7 million renovation to the arena that was once home to the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, who moved to San Antonio to become the Spurs in 1973, and joined the NBA when the ABA folded three years later. We stood right here in this building, and we proudly announced that the Dallas Wings would soon be making downtown Dallas their permanent home, Mayor Eric Johnson said Wednesday. And since then, the excitement has only grown, the fan base has rallied and today were taking the next big step forward. Welcome, everyone, to the future of Dallas sports. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/dallas-wings-bueckers-wnba-dc89a819fd23aad64a80e287039c3c7d,sports
Shedeur Sanders visits Cleveland high school shortly after arriving in town,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Shedeur Sanders is quickly trying to familiarize himself with his new work home. Sanders, who was drafted in the fifth round by the Browns last weekend, arrived in Cleveland on Tuesday and made a surprise visit to a local high school on Wednesday. He took questions from students in the cafeteria at John Marshall High School, about six miles (9.66 kilometers) from the Browns complex in Berea, Ohio. Included in Sanders message was a recommendation to stay focused and make good decisions. Shortly after becoming the 144th-overall pick in the NFL draft, Sanders told Browns reporters during a conference call that he intended to become involved in the community and work with the kids. Whatever situation theyre in, thats really where I feel like I have the most impact on, is really the kids and giving them a different perspective of respect parents, respect their elders and respect those people that are in position to give you advice, he said. Sanders and the other Browns rookies will participate in a three-day minicamp beginning May 9. According to the collectibles website cllct, he already has the highest-selling jersey among NFL rookies.  The 2025 rookie class includes No. 1-overall pick Cam Ward, who was taken by the Tennessee Titans, and Sanders former teammate at Colorado, Travis Hunter, who went at No. 2 overall to the Jacksonville Jaguars.  Also on Wednesday, the NFL fined the Atlanta Falcons $250,000 and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, $100,000, after Ulbrichs 21-year-old son, Jax, participated in a prank call to Sanders during the draft. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/shedeur-sanders-browns-aa3e185eec4584a77d9637e57118f119,sports
Patriots QB Maye says hes excited for beefed up offense with WR Stefon Diggs and OL Will Campbell,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP)  When New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye was playing video games in high school, Stefon Diggs was one of his favorite targets. Soon  the Patriots hope  Maye will be throwing passes to Diggs in real life. He was one of those guys growing up  when I was in high school, he was young in the league. I had him on my fantasy team and things like that, playing with him in Madden, Maye said on Thursday in his first availability since the Patriots signed Diggs as a free agent. Its going to be cool to throw to a receiver whos made plays like he has, Maye said. Its my job to give him a chance and go get it. After a rookie year in which the Patriots won just four games  just two of them with him at quarterback  Maye is looking ahead to his second season with an improved receiving group and offensive line. The Patriots picked Kyle Williams from Washington State in the third round of the draft last week, a month after signing Diggs for three years and $63 million. Mayes leading receiver last year was tight end Hunter Henry, who had 66 catches for 674 yards and two touchdowns. Diggs is a four-time Pro Bowl selection who had six straight 1,000-yard seasons before tearing his right ACL last October. Diggs has said he is ahead of schedule to return, and Maye is looking forward to it. Hes coming back, obviously, from injury. Hes doing great, Maye said. Hes been around. Its going to be cool to throw to a receiver whos made plays like he has. Hes made big plays in playoff games and played in a lot of different schemes, played with high-level quarterbacks. 
        
     The Patriots also beefed up the backfield with Ohio State running back TreVeyon Henderson in the second round to go with Rhamondre Stevenson. But the biggest boost may be No. 4 overall pick Will Campbell to protect Mayes blind side. Campbell, who played 37 of his 38 games at LSU at left tackle, allowed just two sacks over the past two seasons.  Maye said he was pumped that the team picked Campbell  even more so when he heard the newest Patriot say on draft night, Im going to fight and die to protect him with everything Ive got. Man, it gets you going, gets your juices going. It makes you want to go out there and play football now, Maye said. We got a chance to meet him when he came in and flew in on Friday. Pumped to get things going, and obviously, seems like a football player. Thats what you want around here. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-drake-maye-will-campbell-6e459e1d5be42eac8da2b3d2f2c40ba9,sports
"Home of Philadelphia 76ers, Flyers lands naming rights deal with Xfinity Mobile","PHILADELPHIA (AP)  The home of the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76ers has a new name. The arena will be renamed Xfinity Mobile Arena, effective Sept. 1 and running through the 2030-2031 season. Banking giant Wells Fargo announced last year that it would not renew its deal with building owner and operator Comcast Spectacor  the parent company of the Flyers  when it expires in August. Financial terms were not announced. Wells Fargo paid a reported $1.4 million annually as part of the naming rights deal. The arena, originally named CoreStates Center, opened in 1996 and has been the home to Philly sports stars like Allen Iverson, Eric Lindros and Joel Embiid, as well as NCAA Tournament games. The building has carried a number of names, including the First Union Center in 1998 and Wachovia Center in 2003. Wells Fargo bought out Wachovia and posted its name on the roughly 21,000-seat building in 2010. Comcast Spectacor last year completed a $400 million renovation project of the Wells Fargo Center. The 76ers earlier this year announced they would partner with Comcast Spectacor, their current landlord, to build a new arena in South Philadelphia and abandon a deal with the city to move downtown. Comcast will own the naming rights to the arena being developed via a joint venture between HBSE and Comcast Spectacor, set to open in the 2031-2032 season. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/flyers-76ers-philadelphia-xfinity-comcast-d5a3c6dc790d5ef8ecdceb61475dc1d9,sports
Maple Leafs goaltender Anthony Stolarz not ruled out for Game 2 against Panthers,"TORONTO (AP)  Anthony Stolarz was smiling and in the building. The Maple Leafs goaltender had taken a blow to the head, vomited on the bench and left Scotiabank Arena on a stretcher to be evaluated in a hospital on Monday night. His presence at Torontos practice facility in the citys west end Tuesday morning was a welcome sign. Whether or not Stolarz will play when the teams best-of-seven playoff series resumes Wednesday night is up in the air. Coach Craig Berube didnt rule out his starting goalie for Game 2 of the Leafs second-round matchup against the Florida Panthers after Stolarz was on the receiving end of an elbow from Sam Bennett in the opener. Hes doing well, said Berube, whose group earned a 5-4 victory Monday to take a 1-0 lead in a matchup of Atlantic Division rivals. Hes here, doing good. Thats about all the information the veteran head coach was willing to share. Is the 31-year-old available to play Wednesday?  Berube: Well see. Dont know that yet. And did he suffer a concussion?  Berube: Dont know that either. What the Leafs do know is Bennett  a Stanley Cup champion alongside Stolarz with the Panthers last season before the latter signed in Toronto  wont face any supplemental discipline from the NHL. I dont want to talk about it, Berube said. Its over. Stolarz, who also took a shot off the mask early in Game 1, was knocked to the ice in the second period by Bennett, but stayed in the action for a few minutes. He eventually departed after being sick during a TV timeout. 
        
     Tough seeing your starting goaltender go down, Leafs defenseman Jake McCabe said. No stranger to entering a playoff series, backup Joseph Woll stopped 17 of 20 shots in relief as Toronto held on after building a 4-1 lead. The 26-year-old won Games 5 and 6 of last springs first-round loss to the Boston Bruins, but was unable to go in the finale because of a back injury. Woll, who played long stretches this season, including when Stolarz was out with a knee issue, also entered Torontos second-round defeat to Florida in 2023, winning Game 4 to stave off elimination before a 40-save performance in a 3-2 overtime loss that sent the Panthers to the Eastern Conference final. Weve got all the confidence in him, McCabe said. Tough spot, but he did an awesome job. Bennett, meanwhile, spoke to reporters at Floridas downtown hotel after not being made available to reporters following Game 1. The 28-year-old said he had exchanged text messages with Stolarz. Theres no intent, said Bennett, who added he didnt realize the two made contact in the moment. Stolies a great friend of mine. When I hear he went to the hospital, of course, I feel bad. Thats why I reached out. The bruising 6-foot-1, 191-pound center, however, has a checkered past went it comes to playing near, on or over the line. That long list of questionable plays includes him slamming Matthew Knies to the ice on a sequence that resulted in the Toronto winger getting a concussion in the 2023 series. He also appeared to sucker-punch Brad Marchand  now his Florida teammate  in last springs second round to sideline Bostons former captain. I play a hard style, Bennett said. Im just trying to play my game, Im just trying to help our team win. He also understands the anger following Stolarzs injury, but said the fact the Panthers were on the power play means he was focused on only one thing. Im trying to score, Bennett said. The last thing in my mind is elbowing him in the head. There wasnt a ton of force in it. Leafs winger Max Pacioretty has been in the league since before Bennett was drafted fourth overall by the Calgary Flames in 2014. Emotional player that plays hard, said the 36-year-old. Players like that, they normally flirt with a line in terms of crossing it or playing right on that line all the time. Thats what makes players like that good at their job. Panthers coach Paul Maurice tried to downplay the situation Monday night and again Tuesday morning. Most of this, for me, is tempered by the fact that Stolie is one of our guys, he said. We love that guy. If I had thought that Sam had crossed the line, Id probably be more careful with my words. I just didnt think it happened. Berube said his team will have to stay disciplined and not seek retribution on Bennett that could result in power plays for the Panthers. Seventh on the NHLs penalty minutes list, however, Berube said the situation would have been handled differently during his playing days. Somebody would have done something right away, he said with a smile. Probably me, if I was out there. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/toronto-maple-leafs-anthony-stolarz-9e91d76c84dc5fe09a2f5329177a7ec3,sports
Coach Jared Bednar receives vote of confidence after Avalanche ousted in early rounds again,"DENVER (AP)  Jared Bednars job on the bench appears perfectly safe after the Colorado Avalanche were ousted in the early rounds yet again. General manager Chris MacFarland gave Bednar a vote of confidence Tuesday  100% confident Jareds our head coach, MacFarland exclaimed in a deconstruct-what-went-sideways news conference. This first-round playoff exit to Dallas, though, was particularly tough to swallow for MacFarland and team president/Hall of Famer Joe Sakic. Not just because former Avalanche forward turned Stars series saver Mikko Rantanen was the one to send them packing with a hat trick in Game 7. It was more because the front office firmly believed they had assembled a team that could win another Stanley Cup title, just like they did in 2022. This one stings. Im not going to lie to you, Sakic said. We knew we had the team to do it. We feel like this years team was on that (2022) level. So thats why this ones going to sting. Its going to sting a little longer than other years.  Well regroup. Great players here, great character. They want to win and were going to find a way next year to be in the situation again and try and compete for the Cup. One change the Avalanche made in the aftermath of the Dallas loss was letting go of assistant coach Ray Bennett, who oversaw the power play. The Avalanche were 3 of 22 with the man advantage against the Stars. 
        
     They (Stars) did everything they needed to be dangerous and scored (in) key moments of the game, Sakic said. We just didnt have it at the right time. So at the end of the day, when you look at it all, that was the difference. The Avalanche have been to the postseason eight straight years under Bednar, whos the winningest coach in franchise history. During that stretch, theyve only made it past the second round when they won it all in 2022.  I went through it as a player as well. Sometimes things just arent going to go your way, Sakic said of a series. We just missed on some opportunities and we didnt capitalize. But well get back at this again next year.  Sakic said he was involved in the deal that sent Rantanen to the Carolina Hurricanes on Jan. 24 that acquired Martin Necas and Jack Drury. Rantanen was then sent by Carolina to Dallas on March 7 at the trade deadline. Rantanen tormented the Avalanche in the series  five goals, seven assists  and will continue to do so for years to come after agreeing to a $96 million, eight-year contract. Whats done is done. That happened. We move forward, Sakic said. We were very confident with the group we have here. Listen, we had a really good team here. ... It was a lot deeper, a lot stronger than it was to start the year or Christmas time. We didnt get it done. Through all the squandered third-period leads in the series, Colorado was still 6:14 away from advancing  before Rantanen tied it up. Everybodys frustrated, Sakic said. Everybodys disappointed, just because we felt we were this close to moving on. Now, some decisions. Forwards Jonathan Drouin, Joel Kiviranta, Jimmy Vesey and Brock Nelson along with defensemen Ryan Lindgren and Erik Johnson are set to be free agents. MacFarland isnt opposed to running it back, especially with a nucleus of Nathan MacKinnon, Cale Makar and Devon Toews, along with the return of their captain, Gabriel Landeskog. Landeskog made it back for Game 3 after not playing in an NHL game for nearly three years. Hes been sidelined by a chronically injured right knee since helping the Avalanche to the 2022 title. Showing no signs of rust, Landeskog had one goal and three assists over five playoff games. Listen, nobody knew if he would be able to come back, not even himself, Sakic said. To come back the way he did, it was pretty inspiring. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/colorado-avalanche-nhl-joe-sakic-16719df5ae97d8271de4306a7bd3f2b2,sports
Buxton and Bader hit big homers as Twins top Orioles 5-2,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Byron Buxton homered for a third straight game and Harrison Bader had a pinch-hit homer to lift the Minnesota Twins to a 5-2 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night for their fourth consecutive victory. Buxton hit a three-run shot to the second deck in left field off Orioles starter Charlie Morton (0-7) in the bottom of the third inning to put the Twins up 3-1. Buxton also had a three-run homer in Tuesdays 9-1 win over Baltimore and hit a solo blast Sunday in Boston. Danny Coulombe (1-0) pitched a scoreless inning of relief to earn the win. Jhoan Durn earned his fifth save with a clean ninth inning for the Twins, who matched their longest winning streak of the season.  The Orioles have lost a season-high four in a row. With Minnesota leading 3-2 in the seventh, Bader pinch hit for No. 9 hitter Kody Clemens. Bader jumped on a 1-0 pitch from reliever Keegan Akin for a two-run homer to give the Twins a cushion. Baltimores Ramn Laureano hit a solo homer off Twins starter Simeon Woods Richardson in the top of the third. The Orioles also scored a run in the fifth. Mortons woes continued for Baltimore. The 41-year-old right-hander still doesnt have a win in nine outings, including six starts. Morton allowed three runs and four hits in four innings and saw his ERA rise to 9.38. Woods Richardson gave up a run and five hits in 4 2/3 innings. 
        
     Baders homer in the seventh was the first pinch-hit homer of his career. The veteran outfielder has four home runs and 16 RBIs in his first season with Minnesota. With his scoreless inning Wednesday, Coulombe has pitched 14.1 innings in relief this season without allowing a run. Baltimore will send right-hander Dean Kremer (3-4, 5.73 ERA) to the mound for the series finale Thursday. Bailey Ober (4-1, 3.72) will start for the Twins in place of Joe Ryan, who was scratched with an illness.

Gallen frustrates the Mets for the 2nd time in a week and leads the Diamondbacks to a 5-1 win,"PHOENIX (AP)  Zac Gallen pitched seven strong innings, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit a two-run homer and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the New York Mets 5-1 on Tuesday night. Gallen (3-4) had his longest outing of the season, giving up one run on two hits and three walks while striking out six. The right-hander coaxed a double-play grounder from Jeff McNeil in the seventh to end his evening. It was the second time in a week that Gallen frustrated the Mets powerful lineup. He gave up just one run over six innings last Thursday in New York during Arizonas 4-2 win. Gurriel gave the D-backs a 4-1 lead in the sixth by jumping on a first-pitch fastball that David Peterson left over the plate. The two-run shot scored Josh Naylor, who reached on a leadoff walk. Naylor had a sacrifice fly in the seventh that pushed Arizona ahead 5-1. He finished with two runs scored and two RBIs. Gurriel had three hits, including a double. The Mets took a 1-0 lead in the third when Pete Alonso walked with the bases loaded, forcing in Tyrone Taylor. Francisco Alvarez had two of the teams four hits. Alonso struck out three times. Peterson (2-2) gave up four runs on five hits and four walks over six innings, striking out six. The Mets had runners on first and third with one out in the ninth, but new D-backs closer Shelby Miller retired Brandon Nimmo on a liner and Mark Vientos on a shallow fly to end the game. 
        
     Gallen threw 101 pitches and Peterson threw 104. It was just the third time in the majors this season that both starters reached 100 pitches.

OHoppe and Moncada deliver in Angels big 8th-inning rally for 8-3 victory over Blue Jays,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Logan OHoppe drove in the tiebreaking run in the eighth inning, Yon Moncada followed with a three-run homer, and the Los Angeles Angels rallied to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-3 on Tuesday night for just their second win in 10 games. Zach Neto hustled home with the tying run to start a six-run rally in the eighth by the Angels, who scored more than five runs in a full game for the first time since April 10. OHoppe delivered an RBI single before Moncada hit his first homer since September 2023 in his first game back from a thumb injury. Jo Adell added another homer moments later. George Springer and Anthony Santander homered for the Blue Jays, who opened a six-game trip with their third straight loss. Tyler Anderson recovered from a rocky first inning to pitch six-hit ball into the seventh for the Angels. Jos Urea pitched solidly into the fifth inning of his debut with the Blue Jays, who signed the right-hander Monday. Toronto is Ureas eighth team in the past six seasons. After Springer hit his fourth homer in the first, Taylor Ward answered with a two-run shot to center, ending his 1-for-35 slump. Santander then golfed a low breaking ball from Ryan Johnson into the short right-field porch with one out in the eighth. Hctor Neris (1-1) came on and got two outs, stranding two Blue Jays. Neto walked, stole second and scored the tying run when Ernie Clement couldnt handle Alejandro Kirks throw to third after the catcher fielded Nolan Schanuels poor bunt off Yimi Garca (0-2). Neto extended his hitting streak to a career-best 11 games with a first-inning single. Yusei Kikuchi (0-4, 4.21 ERA) takes his eighth shot at earning his first win for the Angels.

Verlander winless in 8 starts with the Giants,"CHICAGO (AP)  It happened again. Justin Verlander was in position for his first win with the San Francisco Giants  but he walked away empty-handed. Verlander pitched five innings Tuesday night against the Chicago Cubs before giving a 5-3 lead to San Franciscos bullpen. The three-time AL Cy Young Award winner ended up with another no-decision, but the Giants scored nine times in the 11th for a 14-5 victory. Its crazy, because he could easily have four or five wins at this point, San Francisco manager Bob Melvin said. So just another one of those where were a pitch away from getting him a win, and next thing you know he doesnt, but it doesnt mean hes not performing well. The 42-year-old Verlander signed a $15 million, one-year contract with the Giants in January. He was charged with two losses while going winless in his first eight starts for the longest such drought at any point during his 20 seasons in the majors. Im somebody who really tries to focus on the big picture, Verlander said. Just try to keep pitching well and giving us a chance to win and thats doing my job, and wins can come in bunches. Its a team sport. Not everything is in your control as a starter, and I know that. Verlander allowed five hits, struck out three and walked two against the NL Central leaders. The big blow was Miguel Amayas two-run homer after San Francisco had opened a 4-0 lead in the top of the third. 
        
     Obviously, you want some wins, Verlander said. Ive also been somebody who never really expects a lot of wins when I only go five innings. I dont really feel like I did my job as well as I should have today. During his season-opening drought, Verlander has been hurt by lackluster run support. He had a 1.96 ERA in 18 1/3 innings over his previous three starts. He was in position to get his first win against Colorado on Thursday, but the lowly Rockies rallied for a 4-3 win. Verlander went 5-6 with a 5.48 ERA in 17 starts for Houston last year. He had stints on the injured list for shoulder inflammation and neck discomfort. The nine-time All-Star became a free agent after he failed to pitch 140 innings, a total that would have triggered his ability to exercise a $35 million conditional player option. Verlander is 262-149 with a 3.31 ERA in 534 career starts. He is tops among active big league pitchers in wins, innings (3,457 2/3), strikeouts (3,451) and starts (534). Ive been kind of working my way towards I think being better and better, Verlander said. Just kind of stay the course and see what happens. Weve still got a lot of starts left. Its really early. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/giants-justin-verlander-2632d6a004e07ae8a87470c429abea41,sports
Raleighs pinch-hit single in 9th inning sends Mariners past Athletics 5-3,"WEST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Pinch-hitter Cal Raleigh put Seattle ahead with a two-run single in the ninth inning, Julio Rodrguez went 3 for 4 with a solo home run and the Mariners beat the Athletics 5-3 on Tuesday night.  With the Mariners trailing by one, Jorge Polanco drew a one-out walk from reliever Tyler Ferguson (0-1) in the ninth. Rodrguez followed with a single and Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Raleighs single to right field gave Seattle a 4-3 lead, and Dylan Moore added a sacrifice fly. Carlos Vargas got three outs for his first major league save, retiring pinch-hitter Seth Brown with two on to end it. Collin Snider (1-0) gave up a go-ahead single to Miguel Andujar in the eighth but prevented further damage. Seattle is 176 since April 9, the best record in the big leagues during that span. J.P. Crawford singled in the fifth to extend the longest active hitting streak in the majors to a career-best 14 games.  Rodrguez homered in the first inning and Miles Mastrobuoni had an RBI double for the Mariners in the second. Brent Rooker and Tyler Soderstrom each had three hits for the Athletics. Andujar added two hits and two RBIs. Rooker also scored twice  and stole two bases for the first time in his career. Mariners relievers Gabe Speier and Snider got bases-loaded strikeouts to end the seventh and eighth innings, respectively. 
        
     Seattle is 8-0-2 in its last 10 series with the Athletics and 4716 over its last 63 games against the As.

No Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty in Preakness highlights some philosophical horse racing changes,"Just a few days after winning the Kentucky Derby, Sovereignty was ruled out of running in the Preakness Stakes. It is the second time in four years the owner and trainer of the Derby champion opted to skip the Preakness in favor of the Belmont Stakes in June. Rich Strike also bypassed the Preakness in 2022 after winning at Churchill Downs at odds of 80-1. Country House did not run in 2019 because of illness after getting elevated to Derby winner when Maximum Security was disqualified for interference, the races were run out of order in 2020 and Medina Spirit ran and finished third in the 2021 Preakness after being DQed from his first-place finish in the Derby for a positive drug test. That means this is the fifth time in seven years that the Preakness gates open at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore without even a chance at a Triple Crown. That was only the case once in the previous 33 years from to 1986-2018, and that happened because a horse was retired because of injury after taking the Run for the Roses. 
        
     Horse racing has changed from its heyday, when stars of the sport like War Admiral, Secretariat and Seattle Slew were used to running every couple of weeks. Breeding, money and other factors have changed that, and the top 3-year-old horses eligible for the Triple Crown race far less often, with bigger stretches in between. Most trainers hate running their horses back in two weeks, NBC Sports analyst Randy Moss said. They feel like its bad for the horses. Beginning in the early 21st century, many of the Derby horses who finish between second and 20th started getting more rest to wait five weeks for the Belmont. It was essentially automatic that the Derby winner would go, though not anymore. The trainers of Derby winners that do run back in the Preakness do it out of a sense of tradition  not because they like it, Moss said. Sovereigntys Bill Mott made that clear the morning after his horse passed Journalism down the stretch in the mud at Churchill Downs with a record audience watching, casting doubt on the Preakness. We want to do whats best for the horse, Mott told reporters in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday. Of course, you always think about a Triple Crown, and thats not something were not going to think about. The debate has been raging for decades about horses not being able to handle the grind of three premier races over a span of five weeks. That was primarily because no one swept the Triple Crown between Affirmed in 1978 and American Pharoah in 2015, a 37-year drought that made industry stakeholders question tradition versus modern-day changes. Justify doing it in 2018 to give the sport a pair of Triple Crown champions in four years quieted that talk. The recent uncertainty about Derby winners going to the Preakness reignited the chatter. Prominent owner Mike Repole shared a proposal on social media Tuesday that would move the Belmont up to second in the rotation and shift the Preakness back to provide more spacing. Others have suggested moving the Preakness back to the first Saturday in June and the Belmont to the first Saturday in July. No one really knows. And does there need to be seismic change like the pitch clock in baseball? Maybe, maybe not. After all, the previous two Derby winners  Mystik Dan last year and Mage in 2023  wheeled back after two weeks to finish in the money at the Preakness. They didnt win, but their trainers wanted to give it a shot. And Bob Baffert-trained American Pharoah and Justify completing the Triple Crown showed it was possible. Well see Triple Crown winners because there will occasionally be horses like American Pharoah and like Justify who are good enough to blow up any of the current thoughts about spacing, Moss said. And trainers who arent worried about it. Baffert and 89-year-old fellow Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas have shown a willingness to go for it after winning the Derby  and even when they dont. Lukas intends to run American Promise in the Preakness after a 16th place finish in Kentucky. Others have chosen to play it more safe, which, if that becomes the trend, puts the future of the Preakness in peril.  ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-derby-sovereignty-preakness-c095f7af64c3320fe41f3563ed1b8e2e,sports
Hands tied': Athletes left in dark as NCAA settlement leaves murky future for nonrevenue sports,"The $2.8 billion NCAA settlement awaiting final approval from a federal judge is touted as a solution for thousands of athletes to finally get the money they deserve and provide some clarity to recruiting. For some, it may have come too late. Sophomore distance runner Jake Rimmel says he was one of five walk-ons cut from Virginia Techs cross country team after Thanksgiving break. Rimmel decided to take a leave of absence and train independently while considering his next move  something thats proven easier said than done. Everyones got their hands tied right now, so theres just not many opportunities for me, Rimmel told The Associated Press. Ive just been having to bet on myself and trust the process. Its just been lonely. Ive been at home training by myself and living with my family again. Thank God for my family and all, I appreciate them. Its still kind of lonely though, being out of the norm, not being at school and with my friends. Pending approval, the so-called House settlement will allow schools to share revenue with athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). That could secure generational wealth for some but not others, and replacing scholarship caps with roster limitations is expected to leave walk-ons, partial scholarship earners, nonrevenue sport athletes and high school recruits at risk. There are deep concerns about the potential impact on sports that feed the U.S. Olympic teams. U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken told attorneys handling the settlement to come back to her with a plan soon to protect athletes currently or recently on rosters at schools across the country, a request seen as a way to soften the blow. 
        
     That filing came late Wednesday, with attorneys saying schools must offer athletes who lost their spots a chance to play  at their old school or their new school  without counting against the roster limits for as long as they have eligibility. There is no guarantee those athletes will win a spot on the roster and, for now, thousands of athletes like Rimmel have no idea where they might be this fall or are in jeopardy of no longer playing college sports at all. And many athletes balancing school and their sport are unaware of whats at stake and have more questions than answers.  Belmont track and field athlete Sabrina Oostburg said everything she knows about the settlement is from personal research. My school doesnt do a lot of education around it (the settlement). Every now and then, well be told, Hey, if you want to sign up to potentially get some money from this House settlement thats happening, you can do that, Oostburg said. Its almost like the education were being given is optional to consume, even though its limited. Oostburg is used to taking matters into her own hands, securing over 50 NIL deals by herself. She has contacted lawyers and asked for updates on the settlement, but shes not quite reassured. The chaotic nature of college athletics, so obvious to the public, is even worse for the athletes themselves. Being a college athlete, its so hard to stay up to date with whats happening every day because its so constantly changing, she said. Smaller, nonrevenue-generating programs dont often have a point person to navigate NIL deals or educate athletes. At Belmont, Oostburg said, NIL-related responsibilities are managed by an already busy compliance office. To take time to learn about whats happening is just so time-consuming, especially if youre not in that one percent or one of the football players where they have people dedicated to helping them stay up to date, she said. Over the next six weeks, athletes will wrap up their spring semesters and many of them have league tournaments or even NCAA championship competition ahead before what many expect will be the final summer before college sports sees some of the most dramatic changes in history.  For athletes like Rimmel, those changes are already here. On the bright side, his name was among those on an eight-page list of designated student-athletes released in Wednesdays court filing, meaning he is one of many who will be able to seek a roster spot without counting against a schools roster limit. Some of the others cut from the Virginia Tech program have given up on their dreams of collegiate running altogether. Rimmel hasnt given up completely; he spoke with his former coach recently, who said the Hokies athletics department is still trying to figure out whats to come.  Im still kind of hoping I might be able to find my way back there next fall, he said. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",https://apnews.com/article/ncaa-house-settlement-37ad7713f540c4597627116b1f219483,sports
Former top cyclist Miguel ngel Lpez has his appeal against 4-year doping ban dismissed,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP)  The Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Wednesday it has dismissed an appeal by Colombian cyclist Miguel ngel Lpez against a four-year ban for doping. Lpez was found guilty by the anti-doping tribunal of the International Cycling Union (UCI) of use and possession of a prohibited substance (Menotropin) at the 2022 Giro dItalia. Menotropin is a female fertility drug that can stimulate production of testosterone in men. Lpez appealed the ban in May 2024. CAS said its panel is comfortably satisfied that UCI has discharged its burden of proof and unanimously ruled that Mr. Lpez possessed a prohibited substance  and used a prohibited substance. It said the appeal is dismissed and the verdict by the cycling body is fully upheld. Lpez finished third in both the Giro dItalia and Spanish Vuelta in 2018. He was also fourth in the 2022 Vuelta, and won the toughest mountain stage at the 2020 Tour de France. His ban expires in July 2027, when he will be 33.  The UCI said Lpez was caught in the Operation Ilex investigation led by Spanish authorities concerning a doctor who worked in the sport, Marcos Maynar. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/lopez-4year-doping-ban-appeal-dismissed-cas-cbabd2ab088c5e672cb966e44ed9ab4e,sports
"Nationals Michael Soroka cruises through 5 vs. Guardians, then falls apart in return from IL","WASHINGTON (AP)  Michael Soroka came off the injured list and, for five innings, resembled the phenom who was an All-Star at age 21. Then it all fell apart in the sixth. Making his second start for the Washington Nationals and first since he strained his right biceps on March 31, Soroka cruised through five frames against the Cleveland Guardians on Wednesday, striking out eight as the Nationals built a 3-0 lead. His third time through the Guardians batting order wasnt so smooth. Soroka loaded the bases in the sixth with nobody out and then fell behind to Carlos Santana, who lined a 2-1 slider to right field for a bases-clearing double. Santana came in to score against reliever Jorge Lopez, leaving Soroka with a line of four runs allowed in five innings. Cleveland ultimately scored eight runs in the sixth and won 8-6. The only pitch I really, really want back is that one to Santana, Soroka said. I just threw it about 6 inches too high and hes a good hitter. He made me pay. Soroka was reinstated from the 15-day IL before the game. He gave up an identical four runs in five innings during his Washington debut, a 5-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. Before the ugly end to Wednesdays outing, Soroka dominated the Guardians with a sharp slider and 96 mph fastball  the swing-and-miss stuff that led the Nationals to sign him to a $9 million, one-year deal in the offseason. 
        
     As a whole, we got it in the zone early, let them know that I was throwing all pitches for strikes, Soroka said. Thats ultimately where Im at my best. An All-Star with Atlanta during his first full season in 2019, the 27-year-old Soroka has been limited by injuries since. He tore his right Achilles tendon on a routine fielding play in 2020, then injured the same tendon while walking into Atlantas ballpark the following year. He missed the 2021 and 2022 seasons. Weve got to keep him healthy, right? manager Dave Martinez said. But I think hes going to give us a lot of innings, keep us in games just like he did today. Soroka hasnt won in the majors since 2023. Last year for the Chicago White Sox, he went 0-10 with a 4.74 ERA in 25 appearances, including nine starts. Washington optioned right-hander Eduardo Salazar to Triple-A Rochester to make room for Soroka. Salazar is 0-1 with a 9.77 ERA in 17 appearances this season. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/nationals-michael-soroka-reinstated-d3e7b1d5a4ad92aa3fcc42b1fc692950,sports
Olympic medalist wrestler banned for 2 years over missed doping tests,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP)  Olympic silver medalist wrestler Iakobi Kajaia was banned for two years over missed doping control tests, the International Testing Agency said Wednesday. Kajaia took silver for Georgia at the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021 in the mens Greco-Roman 130-kilogram category. He did not compete at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The ITA said it filed an investigation in May last year alleging Kajaia broke so-called whereabouts rules three times in a 12-month period starting in 2023. International athletes must specify where they can be found for one hour each day to give an unannounced doping control sample. The agency said the athlete could not be located based on the whereabouts information he had provided. The 31-year-old wrestler was banned until April 2027 and had his results in 2024 disqualified by an anti-doping tribunal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He can challenge the ruling at a CAS appeal body. Kajaia is a two-time Olympian who placed seventh in the super-heavyweight class at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. In Tokyo, he lost the gold medal bout to Mijan Lpez of Cuba. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/wrestling-olympics-georgia-iakobi-kajaia-ban-9eb804a298c66c598c9e40dd79e51757,sports
PSG striker Ousmane Dembl fit to face Arsenal in Champions League semifinal,"PARIS (AP)  Paris Saint-Germain striker Ousmane Dembl has recovered from a slight hamstring problem and will be in the squad taking on Arsenal in the second leg of their Champions League semifinal on Wednesday. Coach Luis Enrique said Dembl, who scored the winner in PSGs 1-0 win in London last week, has been training with his teammates for two days. I have him at my disposal tomorrow, Enrique said on Tuesday. Dembl was injured during the first leg and rested over the weekend when PSG lost to Strasbourg 2-1 in Ligue 1. Enrique heavily rotated his squad with the match against the Gunners in mind. Dembls goal against Arsenal was his eighth in nine Champions League appearances since the start of the year. PSG defender Achraf Hakimi said he believes Dembl has recovered well. He really wants to play, Hakimi said. Ousmane is a different kind of player. He makes you want to go and watch the game in the stadium, he can change the course of a match at any moment, hes a genius with the ball. Were delighted to have him back. According to UEFA statistics, PSG has won 18 of the 19 ties in which it won a first leg away, while Arsenal has never overturned a home first-leg defeat in European competition, losing all five ties. Enrique, however, isnt counting on history ahead of the match at the Parc des Princes. Were bound to suffer because our opponents dont have a favorable result, Enrique told reporters. We need to match our performance as closely as possible in the first leg to win the return leg and stay true to our ideas. Both teams are looking for a first Champions League title, and second final. PSG lost to Borussia Dortmund at this stage last year. The French side lost to Bayern Munich in its only Champions League final in 2020, while Arsenal was runner-up to Barcelona in 2006. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said his team will do most of its talking when the whistle blows on Wednesday. We are here to make history, we have a big opportunity tomorrow, Arteta said Tuesday at a Paris news conference. Arsenal has won its last four away matches in the Champions League, including a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in the quarterfinals. Its Madrid against all the odds because obviously they were talking about all the comebacks and the history and what they did, he said. We proved something very different to what they expected and tomorrow we want to do the same.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/psg-arsenal-champions-league-dembele-e4c89ea258992ecde5874ddd69370efc,sports
"Aston Villa officials unhappy with Premier League fixture change, citing prejudice","Aston Villa officials have expressed their unhappiness with the Premier League for bringing forward a match against Tottenham by two days to help Spurs maximize preparation time for a potential appearance in the Europa League final. The match was due to be played on Sunday, May 18, but will now take place on Friday, May 16  five days before the title match in the Europa League in Bilbao, Spain. Tottenham leads Bod/Glimt 3-1 from the first leg of the semifinals, with the return match on Thursday in Norway. The fixture rearrangement gives Villa  a team chasing Champions League qualification  two fewer days to prepare for Tottenham, which might also choose to play a stronger lineup now there is more time to recover for a possible European final. It also will affect travel and logistical arrangements for some Villa fans. Monchi, president of football operations at Villa, took to X to say the change in match date is not what we wanted and represented the least damaging alternative. Our fans didnt deserve (it), he wrote on the social network site, but we tried hard to keep the match to protect the most important for us: YOU and OUR TEAM. Damian Vidagany, Villa director of football operations, went further in a long post on X, saying there was a clear prejudice toward Villa fans and bemoaning the fact that his club didnt feel this support over its last two European campaigns  in the Europa Conference League last season and the Champions League this season. 
        
     European football is not only demanding for English clubs just on the verge of the finals, Vidagany wrote. Villa is in seventh place in the Premier League and in a battle with five other teams to secure the remaining four Champions League qualification spots on offer. Liverpool, the already crowned champion, has already qualified. While it is commonplace in other countries, there has been no precedent for the Premier League moving games to benefit clubs playing in Europe. Manchester United is also in the Europa League semifinals and holds a 3-0 lead over Athletic Bilbao from the first leg in Spain last week. United will be playing a Premier League game on Friday, May 16, too  against Chelsea. So United and Tottenham would have the same amount of preparation time should they both reach the Europa League final. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/aston-villa-tottenham-monchi-b958bf00dde9625faf33c924133f1c7e,sports
Mexican soccer club Len loses appeal against FIFA and will not play in Club World Cup,"GENEVA (AP)  Mexican soccer club Len lost its legal challenge against FIFA on Tuesday and is out of the Club World Cup in the United States next month, when it will be replaced by either Los Angeles FC or another Mexican team, Amrica. The Court of Arbitration for Sport said its judges rejected Lens attempt to overturn being removed by FIFA from the 32-team tournament for being in the same ownership group as another Club World Cup entry, Pachuca. The panel examined the evidence, including the Club Len trust set up by the owners of the club, and concluded that this trust was insufficient to comply with the regulations, the court said in a statement. Len criticized FIFA in a statement that spoke of its very influential opponents. Our fans and players deserved more respect from an organization dedicated to promoting sports, but from the beginning no sporting principles existed in the case, the expelled club said. The urgent ruling one day after the appeal hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland, lets FIFA finalize organizing a playoff game between LAFC and Amrica to complete the lineup for the tournament that starts on June 14 in Miami. FIFA said Tuesday it had not yet confirmed a date and venue for the playoff game that will guarantee the winner almost $10 million from the Club World Cup prize money fund of $1 billion. The legal dispute played out in Switzerland five months after FIFA let Len go into the tournament draw in Miami despite the pending multi-club ownership issue. Len was drawn in a group to play Chelsea in Atlanta on June 16, then Esperance from Tunisia in Nashville, and Flamengo of Brazil in Orlando. Those games will now involve LAFC or Amrica. FIFAs new rules to protect the integrity of its prized, revamped club event prohibit two or more teams being in the same ownership group. That standard has been in place in UEFA-run European competitions for more than 20 years and is typically solved by management changes at one of the two clubs, which can be placed into an ownership blind trust. Len and Pachuca qualified for the Club World Cup by respectively winning the 2023 and 2024 editions of the CONCACAF championship. The owner of Len and Pachuca, Grupo Pachuca, said it was prepared to sell one of the clubs to comply with FIFA rules but that it was not possible before the tournament started. After FIFA officials decided Len should be removed, FIFA appeal judges formally excluded Len in March for non-compliance with the rules. At a previous appeal hearing at FIFA, Len argued FIFA should follow in the footsteps of UEFA and permit the implementation of a trust as a solution to the issue of multi-club ownership. FIFA lawyers argued that despite the intention of Lens owners, they still had not been compliant with rules when signing a Club World Cup entry agreement in February. A separate and long-shot appeal to CAS by Costa Rican club Alajuelense to replace Len was incorporated into the overall case and also rejected on Tuesday, the court said. FIFA previously said LAFC would be in the playoff because it was the beaten finalist against Len in the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League. FIFA explained Amricas place was justified as the next-best ranked team in the Club World Cup confederation ranking. It was unclear why Amrica  one of Mexicos best-supported teams  was eligible to be included when FIFA rules cap each country at two entries unless it has more than two winners of a continental championship in the qualifying period. The entry that was fought over by lawyers is worth an initial $9.55 million payment from FIFA for a CONCACAF team, plus a share of the $1 billion in total prize money based on results at the month-long tournament, being played in 11 U.S. cities. Most of the money will be taken home by the 12 European teams that qualified, including recent Champions League winners Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea, plus Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich. Teams that did not qualify include the new champion of England, Liverpool, nor the current leaders in Spain and Italy, Barcelona and Napoli. The lineup also includes Lionel Messi and his club Inter Miami who got an invitation last October from FIFA President Gianni Infantino despite not winning a CONCACAF or Major League Soccer title. Seattle Sounders, the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League winner, is in the competition. The first expanded edition of what is now a four-yearly FIFA club tournament has been heavily promoted by Infantino, who has leveraged his close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump to place the golden trophy in the Oval Office at the White House ahead of the tournament. ___ AP Sports Writer Carlos Rodriguez in Mexico City contributed. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/cas-leon-appeal-club-world-cup-d37e1b573babc8d30561e7a807c0f378,sports

Elliott to celebrate NAPAs 100th anniversary with gold car. Credits company for his NASCAR career,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Chase Elliott, son of a NASCAR Hall of Famer and the sports most popular driver, has 19 career Cup Series wins and championship titles in both the Cup and Xfinity Series. But if not for one critical partnership, Elliott is convinced he may not have ever made it as a professional racer. That pairing is with sponsor NAPA Auto Parts, which this Sunday will celebrate its 100th year as a company with gold cars at Texas Motor Speedway to commemorate its anniversary. NAPA joined Elliott in 2014 when he raced in the Xfinity Series for JR Motorsports and has been his primary sponsor ever since. NAPA was his primary sponsor in the races where he clinched his Xfinity and Cup championships, and for all but six of his Cup Series wins. If not for the company taking a chance on the then-18-year-old son of Bill Elliott, hes not sure what path his career might have taken. NAPA has defined my entire career, Ive said it a lot, Elliott told The Associated Press. Ive tried to express my appreciation for them, but if they dont come on board, I dont think 2014 happens. Youre essentially looking at the Xfinity championship never happening. We were going to run a handful of races had NAPA not signed on. We were talking about a part-time season and going full-time wasnt going to be possible without that money, without that deal coming. So, yeah, it was more than a little career defining. Although NAPA is a 100-year old company, its involvement in race car sponsorships didnt begin until 2001 when it joined Dale Earnhardt Inc. with Michael Waltrip. Waltrip won his debut race with the brand  the Daytona 500 in which Earnhardt was killed on the final lap. 
        
     NAPA stayed with Waltrip through his time at DEI and then moved with him when he started his own team. The brand then shifted to Michael Waltrip Racing driver Martin Truex Jr., but cut its ties after MWR was involved in a 2013 late-season cheating scandal. That made the company available for a new NASCAR driver and settled on unproven Elliott, who is from Georgia, where NAPA is headquartered. Jeff Gordon, now vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports, wasnt involved in Rick Hendricks courtship of turning NAPA into the largest supplier of Hendrick Automotive and also a NASCAR sponsor. But he was a keynote speaker at NAPAs convention in Las Vegas a little over a week ago and understands how much the company means to the Hendrick brand and Elliotts career. When Chase says that NAPA defined his career, he means that, Gordon told the AP. He doesnt say anything he doesnt 100% mean. We all have these moments in our career where things could have gone either way. For me it was DuPont (sponsorship) and for Chase it was NAPA. I cant even imagine Chase on track without NAPA some part of his car. NAPAs racing portfolio has expanded over the years. NAPA signed on as an associate partner with Ron Capps and Don Schumacher Racing in 2007 and the next year NAPA became Capps primary sponsor. NAPA became the official auto parts store of the NHRA this year. Capps ran the gold commemorative car in last weekends NHRA event. NAPA also partnered with Andretti Autosport in IndyCar in May 2016 with Indianapolis 500 winner Alexander Rossi. That sponsorship has ended. In NASCAR, NAPA initially sponsored Waltrip and then Truex Jr., then moved to be primary sponsor of Elliott the next season. As part of the centennial celebration this weekend, the gold cars will also be run by Daniel Hemric in the Truck Series and sprint car racer Brad Sweet, who is racing at Texas dirt track this weekend. NAPA plans to bring all the gold cars together for a photo opportunity. Based on his age  Elliott is now 29  he doesnt associate the NAPA traditional blue and gold paint scheme with any driver but himself. After all, NAPA has backed his entire NASCAR national series career. Ive spent so much time with them at this point that it feels like home, Elliott said. It feels like a true partnership and they definitely feel like part of my family. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-napa-elliott-100-years-gold-car-0f77b77900c0f7e93b37077093627fcd,sports
This Date in Baseball - Randy Johnson became the third pitcher to strike out 20 in nine innings,"May 8 1906  Philadelphia manager Connie Mack needed a substitute outfielder in the sixth inning of a game against Boston and called on pitcher Chief Bender. Bender hit two home runs, both inside the park. 1907  Bostons Big Jeff Pfeffer threw a no-hitter to give the Braves a 6-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Boston. 1929  Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants pitched a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the first by a left-hander in the majors in 13 seasons. 1935  In the first game of a doubleheader, Ernie Lombardi of the Cincinnati Reds hit four doubles in consecutive innings (sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth) off four different Phillies pitchers. Lombardi also singled to send the Reds past Philadelphia 15-4. 1946  Boston shortstop Johnny Pesky scored six times, an American League record, in a 14-10 win over the White Sox. Pesky, who was 4-for-5 with a walk and two RBIs, matched Mel Otts National League mark for runs scored in a game. 1963  A Stan Musial home run against the Dodgers gives him 1,357 extra-base hits, surpassing Babe Ruths major league record. He will get 20 more; his record will later be broken by Hank Aaron. 1963  Pirates LF Willie Stargells first major league homer and Cubs P Bob Buhls first major league hit in 88 at-bats highlight a 9-5 Chicago win over Pittsburgh. 1966  Frank Robinson became the only player to hit a home run out of Baltimores Memorial Stadium. The shot over the left-field wall came off Cleveland right-hander Luis Tiant. The Orioles won 8-3. 
        
     1966  The St. Louis Cardinals closed old Busch Stadium with a 10-5 loss to the San Francisco Giants. 1966  Orioles outfielder Frank Robinson hits the only ball ever completely out of Baltimores Memorial Stadium. The shot clears the left-field single-deck grandstands rear wall, 451-feet away, going an estimated 541 feet. 1968  Jim Catfish Hunter of the Oakland As pitched a perfect game to beat the Minnesota Twins 4-0. 1983  Darryl Strawberry gets his first major league hit, a single that scores Danny Heep, in a 10-5 Mets win over the Reds. 1984  Minnesotas Kirby Puckett had four singles in his first major league game, and the Twins beat the California Angels 5-0. 1994  Danny Tartabull, Mike Stanley and Gerald Williams hit back-to-back-to-back home runs for the Yankees in the 6th inning of New Yorks 8-4 win over Boston. 1994  The Colorado Silver Bullets, the first womens team to play a pro mens team, lost 19-0 to the Northern League All-Stars. Leon Durham hit two homers and Oil Can Boyd started for the All-Stars. The Silver Bullets had two hits, struck out 16 times and made six errors. 1998  Cardinals 1B Mark McGwire hits his 400th career home run in a 9-2 loss to the Mets. He is the 27th player to reach 400, and does so in fewer at bats than anyone in history, 4,726. Babe Ruth had taken 127 more at-bats, having held the old record. 2000  Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals hits his 12th home run of the season, against the San Francisco Giants. The homer ties Big Mac with Jimmie Foxx for ninth place on the all-time list with 534 career homers. McGwire needs just two taters to catch number eight on the list, Mickey Mantle, at 536. 2001  Randy Johnson became the third pitcher to strike out 20 in nine innings, but didnt finish the game in which the Arizona Diamondbacks beat Cincinnati 4-3 in 11 innings. Johnson, the first left-hander to strike out 20, missed a chance to join Roger Clemens and Kerry Wood as the record-holders for a nine-inning game because Arizona could not finish off the Reds in regulation. 2001  The Devil Rays edge the Orioles, 4-3, as Tampa Bays Fred McGriff joins Mark McGwire, Hank Aaron, Barry Bonds, Eddie Murray and Reggie Jackson as the only players to homer off 300 different pitchers in their career. 2009  In his first game of the season after missing six weeks because of hip surgery, Alex Rodriguez hits the first pitch he sees from Baltimores Jeremy Guthrie for a three-run home run in a 4-0 Yankees win that ends a five-game losing streak. CC Sabathia pitches a four-hit shutout in his best performance since signing a huge free agent contract over the winter. 2010  Jody Gerut hit for the cycle and drove in four runs, and the Milwaukee Brewers pounded the Arizona Diamondbacks 17-3. Gerut hit a solo home run in the second inning, singled in the third, drove in a run with a triple in the fifth and added a two-run double in the ninth. 2012  Josh Hamilton became the 16th player to hit four home runs in a game. His four two-run drives came against three different pitchers, carrying the Texas Rangers to a 10-3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. 2015  Bryce Harper hit two more home runs, giving him five in two games, and Danny Espinosa also connected twice to power the Washington Nationals to a 9-2 win over the Atlanta Braves. The 22-year-old Harper became the youngest in major league history to hit five homers in two games. 2018  James Paxton of the Mariners becomes only the second-ever Canadian-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, after Dick Fowler in 1945, turning the trick against the Blue Jays in a 5-0 win. _____",https://apnews.com/sports/randy-johnson-jody-gerut-bryce-harper-mark-mcgwire-baseball-ffb9f6437f247368a5119ef38124f439,sports
"Logano responds to criticism from Hall of Famer, asks Has Chipper Jones ever driven a race car?","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Joey Logano wondered Tuesday if Baseball Hall of Famer Chipper Jones had ever driven a race car at Talladega after the former Atlanta Braves slugger criticized the NASCAR champion in a series of social media posts. Jones was defending Austin Cindric, winner of Sundays race at Talladega Superspeedway, after Team Penske teammate Logano unleashed an expletive-laden rant about Cindric around the halfway mark of the race. Logano was furious he did not receive the help he needed from Cindric, which allowed rival Toyota driver Bubba Wallace to win the second stage and earn valuable bonus points. Way to go Austin. Way to go. You dumb (expletive). Way to (expletive) go, Logano said on his team radio. What a stupid (expletive). He just gave it to him. Gave Toyota a stage win. Nice job. Way to go. What the (expletive). Jones was angered by Loganos rant and in six social media posts congratulated Cindric, called Logano selfish and celebrated Logano being disqualified for failing postrace inspection. Good teammates are hard to come by, Boss! Remember that one of urs MFed u on national tv, when in all actuality, u did everything possible to keep from wrecking him, Jones wrote. Some people are hooray for our team as long as Im the star as every team has them. Hendrick, RCR, JGR, Penske, etc. Sometimes karma is glorious. When told of Jones comments on a Tuesday appearance of SiriusXM NASCAR Radios The Morning Drive, Logano said he was unaware of them. Once he was told, Logano asked: Has Chipper Jones ever driven a race car at Talladega? That would be my first question. Im pretty certain he hasnt. 
        
     Thats like me saying something about baseball. I know nothing about baseball. Thats like me saying something that he did something in baseball that was wrong. That doesnt matter. Logano continued by saying that as a former professional athlete, Jones should understand there was more to the situation than what he saw on television. Jones grew up outside Daytona International Speedway and was once the grand marshal for the Daytona 500. Chipper Jones, he seems like a cool dude, hes done a lot, right? Hes a pretty popular, good baseball player, but hes not a race car driver, and I know he wasnt in the room with us when we set in place the way things are supposed to go, Logano said. You would think somebody that has been in professional sports and has been in meetings like that would probably take a step back and say, Man, theres probably more to the story here than what there is. Im surprised it went that way. Maybe he was just bored. I dont know what his situation is. I tell you I dont care. Logano said he and Cindric cleared the air in Penskes Monday meeting. Austin and I talked about it. Weve got to move forward. Thats what it is, he said. I explained my side. He understood. We move on. Theres no sense in airing our dirty laundry and airing out what the actual rules are because thats private information that doesnt need to be out to everybody. But the facts are that what we set in place wasnt happening and thats why I got frustrated. Like I said, we talked about it and we moved on. Logano did acknowledge that he probably should not have hit the radio button and spouted off so much. Probably blew up into a little bigger situation than it needed to, but the conversation, either way, needed to happen. Just more people are talking about it now, he added.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-talladega-logano-chipper-jones-7bd4dcfe183b19433a457d83e3851a0f,sports

Formula 1: How to watch the Miami Grand Prix on TV and what to know,"MIAMI (AP)  Heres a guide what you need to know about Sundays Miami F1 Grand Prix. Its the sixth round of the 2025 Formula 1 season.  In the U.S., on ABC.  Other countries are listed here.  Friday: First practice and qualifying for the sprint race.  Saturday: Sprint race and qualifying for the Grand Prix.  Sunday: Miami Grand Prix, 57 laps of the 5.4-kilometer (3.4-mile) Miami International Autodrome. Starts at 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT). The Miami International Autodrome brings a Florida party vibe to F1 with yachts set up on a mock harbor trackside as VIP viewing platforms. Its the fourth time F1 has visited the temporary track, which loops around Hard Rock Stadium. Overtaking can be difficult and barriers close to the track punish mistakes. Max Verstappen won the first two races in Miami but last year there was a statement win for Lando Norris and McLaren. Heat and tire wear could favor McLaren again this year. Oscar Piastri won the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix to become the first Australian to lead the F1 standings since 2010. The key moment was at the first corner when Piastri challenged Verstappen for the lead and the Dutch driver went off track and rejoined in front. Verstappen was given a penalty and lost the lead at his pit stop. McLaren remains the top team on all-round pace. Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren have all challenged for wins on different tracks but havent adapted well when conditions dont suit their cars. Max Verstappen celebrated the birth of his first child with a pole-winning run at the Miami Grand Prix. The four-time defending Formula 1 champion edged Lando Norris of McLaren by .065 seconds to take the top starting spot for Sundays race. It was a rebound for Verstappen, who was penalized earlier Saturday in the sprint race and finished 17th. Verstappen and his partner, Kelly Piquet, announced the birth of a baby girl on Friday. 
        
     Get caught up:  New father Max Verstappen wins pole in Miami, his third through six F1 races this season  Max Verstappen delighted at birth of his first child with partner Kelly Piquet  No team orders: McLaren plans to let em race as Piastri and Norris battle for F1 championship  Russell not impressed by FIA hinting at relaxing rules against cursing and code of driver conduct  McLaren driver Oscar Piastri wins F1s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix to take overall lead  I cannot share my opinion: Max Verstappen stays tight-lipped on race-deciding penalty  Is the punishment for cursing in F1 too harsh? Racing boss hints at changes after driver backlash  General Motors plans to supply Formula 1 engines from 2029 are approved by the FIA  FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem picks a longtime Ford partner for top sports role 3  Oscar Piastri is aiming for his third win in a row. The last Australian driver to achieve that feat in F1 was Alan Jones in 1981. 0/3  None of Miamis three Grand Prix races so far have been won by the driver who started on the pole. Norris won last year from fifth on the grid. 77  McLarens lead in the constructors championship over Mercedes, the only other team with even half of McLarens 188-point haul. Nod to Max, especially being a dad now. I was hoping it was going to slow him down a little bit, but it clearly didnt.  Norris, the defending race winner. Clearly it didnt make me slower, being a dad. We can throw that out the window for people mentioning it.  Verstappen. So far this weekend I felt really good in the car. So thats definitely a positive. And hopefully tomorrow we can do a good race.  Kimi Antonelli, who qualified third for Mercedes. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-watch-guide-tv-schedule-e5054750f93cea04e1d442217f7d29bb,sports
Geoff Ogilvy and Brandt Snedeker are selected as Presidents Cup captains for 2026 at Medinah,"Geoff Ogilvy of Australia takes over as International captain of the Presidents Cup for 2026 at Medinah with a unique distinction from the previous eight captains. He can claim home-course advantage while trying to lead his team to victory on the road. Ogilvy, the former U.S. Open champion, and Brandt Snedeker were introduced Tuesday as captains for 2026 in the Chicago suburbs, matches that have been so one-sided that the Americans have lost only once since they began in 1994. Ogilvy knows the venerable No. 3 course at Medinah better than anyone because his design company  Australian-based OCM  was in charge of renovating the course that previously hosted three U.S. Opens, two PGA Championships and a Ryder Cup. Its a humbling thing. Its a great honor, Ogilvy said on a conference call in Chicago. Medinah is a place where weve done a lot of work, my company, the last two, three years. Its clearly an away game, but its exciting to be on a course that Ive come to know really, really well the last few years. Ogilvy was the clear choice even as the Americans were finishing off another victory at Royal Montreal in 2024. Snedeker, a nine-time PGA Tour winner who captured the FedEx Cup in 2012, was more surprising and didnt get offered the job until about two weeks ago. Snedeker played in only one Presidents Cup, in 2013 at Muirfield Village, and twice in the Ryder Cup in 2012 and 2016. He was an assistant captain to Jim Furyk in the last Presidents Cup at Royal Montreal. 
        
     Keegan Bradley also had played in only three cups when he was appointed Ryder Cup captain for this years event at Bethpage Black. Medinah was the scene of Snedekers first team competition in 2012 at the Ryder Cup, where the Americans lost a 10-6 lead to Europe. It was one of probably the lowest points of my career. But I remember all the good stuff leading up to it -- being part of my first team, being here in Chicago, how crazy the fans were, how awesome they were, Snedeker said. Something were going to try to recreate here is that team-like atmosphere we had there, he said. Obviously, we want a different result, but it was a great experience nonetheless. Medinah is a great venue for these events, and its a big ballpark, and its going to show out well. Geoff did a phenomenal job on the redo, so the course is going to show out really, really well. Just look forward to the opportunity of putting the best players in the world out there on a stage like Chicago and having the fans behind us. The Americans have won the last 10 times in the Presidents Cup dating to a tie in South Africa in 2003. The International team  players from countries outside Europe  have been gaining ground since taking over more control of its team from the PGA Tour, which owns the event. Key to that was a 2019 nail-biter at Royal Melbourne, when International captain Ernie Els came up with a new identity  a black and gold shield  for his team. While the Americans keep winning, Ogilvy has noticed a change in spirit and momentum for his side. When I first got involved in Presidents Cup ... I think the hunger was there for the week and then it would dissipate quickly and then it would disappear for two years and then come back the week of the tournament, said Ogilvy, who made his Presidents Cup debut in 2007. He has played for Gary Player and Greg Norman, and he has been an assistant for Nick Price, Els, Trevor Immelman and Mike Weir. Ogilvy said losing so many times only fuels motivation. Theres a burning determination thats in the group that is very envious, he said. Every trophy ceremony when we watch  the U.S. team has the trophy  it looks like a lot of fun. Its equally as disappointing to be on the other side of things. Disappointment usually fuels motivation, so the group is very passionate about it and very determined to sort of balance the ledger, if you like, and start winning this tournament a bit more regularly. As for the home-course advantage? The course will be routed differently to accommodate match play (not every match gets to the 18th hole). Besides, Ogilvy has been around long enough to know the worlds best players are quick studies. Look, I think its an advantage when we turn up on Monday, Ogilvy said. But by Thursday ... the best skill I think that touring professionals have over most other golfers is they can learn a golf course really quickly. By the time we tee off on Thursday, anything that I can help the players out with with what we did and how we were hoping people would play the course, I imagine that the U.S. team will have it pretty worked out by then. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/presidents-cup-geoff-ogilvy-brandt-snedeker-medinah-254518640ab7cef5394391d4c02df05d,sports
Burlesons double lifts Cardinals past Pirates 2-1; Skenes troubles against St. Louis continue,"ST. LOUIS (AP)  Alec Burleson hit a two-run double, Matthew Liberatore struck out eight in a season-high seven innings and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 2-1 on Tuesday night. Liberatore (3-3) allowed just one run on three hits and three walks as the Cardinals won a season-high fourth game in a row. Gordon Graceffo earned his first career save with a perfect ninth. Paul Skenes (3-4) allowed two runs on three hits in six innings, striking out six and walking four as Pittsburgh lost its sixth straight game and for the ninth time in its last 10 games. Skenes fell to 0-4 in five career starts against St. Louis. Burlesons two-out double in the sixth inning off Skenes scored Nolan Arenado and Willson Contreras. Burleson (6 for 15) has more career hits off Skenes than any other major leaguer. KeBryan Hayes opposite field double scored Oneil Cruz to give the Pirates a 1-0 lead in the sixth inning. Hayes has hit safely in 14 of his last 16 games and it was his third multihit game out of his last four. Hayes hit snapped a five-inning hitless stretch for Liberatore, who had retired 17 of the previous 19 batters he faced. Contreras, who walked twice, extended his on-base streak to nine games. After the Pirates took the lead in the top of the sixth, Skenes retired the first two batters before running into trouble in the bottom of the frame. Arenado started the rally with a single and Contreras walked before Burlesons double. 
        
     In his five starts against the Cardinals spanning 32 2/3 innings, Skenes has received just three total runs of support.

Carlos Santanas 3-run homer helps Guardians beat Nationals 9-1 and split a doubleheader,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Carlos Santana broke a scoreless tie with a three-run homer in the sixth inning and started a late onslaught by the Cleveland Guardians, who beat the Washington Nationals 9-1 on Tuesday night to split a doubleheader. Daniel Schneemann and Austin Hedges also went deep for the Guardians, who scored 18 runs in the twinbill but lost the opener, 10-9. Cleveland has won six of eight. Ben Lively (2-2) gave up a solo homer to Riley Adams, one of two hits he allowed over 5 1/3 innings. Brad Lord (1-4) pitched a career-high six innings for Washington and was working on a shutout before Santana turned on an 0-2 fastball and sent it into the bullpen in right field with two outs in the sixth. Steven Kwans RBI double capped a three-run seventh, Schneemann hit a two-run homer in the eighth and Hedges added a solo shot in the ninth. The Nationals threw four wild pitches, two by Eduardo Salazar and one each by Lucas Sims and Jackson Rutledge. Jos Ramrez drew a two-out walk that moved Kwan to second base before Santanas 397-foot drive.  Washingtons James Wood singled in the first inning to push his on-base streak to a career-high 16 games, although he didnt stay on base for long. He was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. Guardians left-hander Logan Allen (1-2, 4.02 ERA) is scheduled to start against the Nationals Michael Soroka (0-1, 7.20) on Wednesday at 12:05 p.m. as the teams play their third game in a 24-hour span.

"Castellanos has HR and 4 RBIs, Schwarber and Bohm also go deep as Phillies beat Rays 8-4","TAMPA, Fla. (AP)  Kyle Schwarber, Alec Bohm and Nick Castellanos all homered, and Zack Wheeler pitched seven solid innings as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Tampa Bay Rays 8-4 on Tuesday night. Castellanos hit a three-run shot to break open a close game in the eighth, and finished 3 for 5 with four RBIs. Schwarber, who homered to put the Phillies on the board in the second, had three hits and two RBIs. Bohm hit his first homer since last Sept. 20, a two-run shot in the second that made it 3-0. Harper and Trea Turner had two hits for Philadelphia, which has won seven of its last nine. Wheeler (3-1) scattered four hits while walking none with nine strikeouts. His only blemishes came in the fourth, when Brandon Lowe led off with a double and Yandy Diaz followed with a two-run homer. Wheeler then retired 11 of his final 12. Diaz (right leg) left the game with an 0-2 count in the bottom of the sixth after an awkward swing. Christopher Morel pinch hit for Diaz and flied out to end the inning. Tampa Bay sold out Steinbrenner Field, its temporary home, for the 22nd time in 23 games.  Philadelphia entered the eighth with a 3-2 lead but opened with four straight hits off reliever Mason Englert, including Schwarbers RBI single and Castellanos homer. Schwarber, who has five homers over his last seven games, hit a 97-mph fastball from Drew Rasmussen (1-3) over the left-field wall in the second inning. Schwarber has reached safely in 41 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the majors.

"Rangers bats come alive with new coach Boone in dugout, beating the Red Sox 6-1","BOSTON (AP)  Nathan Eovaldi struck out seven over six strong innings, Texas had 16 hits in their first game since adding Bret Boone as a hitting coach and the Rangers beat the Boston Red Sox 6-1 on Tuesday night.  Eovaldi allowed just one run on five hits in rainy conditions that pushed back the start. The Rangers finished just two hits shy of their season high, recorded one week before in a 15-2 rout of the Athletics. Texas won its second straight  the first consecutive victories since sweeping three games against the Angels from April 15-17.  Josh Jung was the only batter in the lineup without a hit for Texas, which was playing its first game since firing offensive coordinator Donnie Ecker and adding Boone, a former big league All-Star with one of baseballs deepest pedigrees, to the coaching staff.  Something certainly sparked the Rangers, who batted around during a five-run fourth inning and provided Eovaldi (3-2) with a surplus of offensive support. Boston didnt score until Kristian Campbells sixth-inning single drove in Alex Bregman, whose double to right was just their fourth hit.  Lucas Giolito (0-1) allowed 10 hits and six runs over 3 2/3 innings for Bostons fifth loss in six games. Boston had a pair of hits in the fifth, which ended when Josh Smith caught a line drive headed for right field but didnt know it. Smith spun around a full 360 degrees looking for the ball, which was in his mitt.  
        
     Corey Seager and Joc Pederson opened the fourth with back-to-back ground-rule doubles, sparking a five-run rally as the Rangers batted around with seven hits in the inning.  Texas seven hits in the fourth was one more than the Rangers had tallied in any inning this season.

Wells grand slam gives him 5 RBIs in 10-run 7th inning as Yankees beat Padres 12-3,"NEW YORK (AP)  Austin Wells had five RBIs in a 10-run seventh inning, hitting a tying single and then his first career grand slam, as the New York Yankees rolled to a 12-3 victory over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday night. Aaron Judge launched his 12th homer of the season in the fourth for the Yankees, who snapped a three-game skid. New York was leading 8-3 when Wells lifted a full-count changeup from ex-Yankee Wandy Peralta into the right-field seats to turn the game into a rout. The Yankees had their biggest inning this season, getting seven hits off Adrian Morejon (1-1) and Peralta. Wells started the outburst with an RBI single that scored Jasson Domnguez from second to tie it at 3. Trent Grisham took a four-pitch walk against Peralta to give the Yankees the lead after pinch-hitter Paul Goldschmidt was intentionally walked. Ben Rice hit a two-run double for a 6-3 advantage. Cody Bellinger added an RBI single after Judge was intentionally walked, and Anthony Volpe hit an RBI single before Wells went deep. Fernando Tatis Jr. hit an RBI double in the seventh off Fernando Cruz (1-0) but the Padres left the bases loaded after taking a 3-2 lead. Judge homered off former teammate Michael King to extend his on-base streak to 32 games. Bellinger scored on a throwing error by Tatis in right field later in the fourth. Manny Machado scored San Diegos first run on a balk by Clarke Schmidt in the fourth. Jackson Merrill had two hits in his return from a hamstring injury and scored the Padres second run on a sacrifice fly by Jason Heyward. King allowed two runs and three hits in six innings. Schmidt permitted two runs and seven hits in six innings. 
        
     After giving up Tatis double, Cruz walked Luis Arraez but struck out Machado to keep the deficit at one run. Rice got his fifth hit in 31 at-bats against left-handed pitching this season.

"Lpez fans 11 as Correa, Buxton homer in Twins 9-1 win over Orioles","MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Pablo Lpez struck out a season-high 11 batters and Carlos Correa hit an upper-deck two-run homer during a five-run third inning as the Minnesota Twins opened a three-game series against the Baltimore Orioles with a 9-1 win on Tuesday night. Byron Buxton also hit a three-run homer in the seventh and drove in four runs for the Twins, who have won three straight. Baltimore had just three singles in losing their third in a row. Lpez (3-2), who had 10 or more strikeouts for the 10th time in his career, fanned the side in the first, third and fifth innings. He struck out Dylan Carlson looking to end the fifth, the final batter he faced. The right-hander allowed one run to lower his ERA to 2.18. Correas homer was just his second of the season. The veteran shortstop entered Tuesdays game batting .216 with a .560 OPS before delivering a 458-foot blast off Orioles starter Cade Povich (1-3). Minnesota got Royce Lewis (left hamstring strain) and Willi Castro (right oblique) back from the injured list for the game. Lewis was the designated hitter and went 0 for 4 in his season debut. Castro played left field and was 1 for 3 with a walk. While Correas homer provided the big highlight, Ryan Jeffers hit a two-run single in the third that scored Castro and Buxton to make it 3-0 Twins. Twins pitchers combined for 17 strikeouts, two shy of the team record for a nine-inning game. Every Oriole batter struck out at least once. 
        
     The Orioles had not announced Wednesdays starting pitcher by the conclusion of Tuesdays game. Minnesota will send Simeon Woods Richardson (2-2, 4.03 ERA) to the mound.

Witt has RBI single in 9th to rally Royals to 4-3 win over White Sox,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  Bobby Witt singled with the bases loaded to cap a crazy rally in the bottom of the ninth as the Kansas City Royals beat the Chicago White Sox 4-3 on Tuesday night. It was the second walk-off hit of Witts career, following a game-ending grand slam in 2023. Mark Canha coaxed a walk off Cam Boozer (0-3) to lead off the ninth. Drew Waters hit a popup that went off second baseman Chase Meidroths head into right field, but Michael A. Taylors throw was wide at second. Freddy Fermin bunted for a hit to load the bases. After Kyle Isbel popped out, Jonathan India drove in the tying run with a fielders choice and Witt followed with a single to center. Taylor Clarke (1-0) earned the win in relief. The White Sox got on the board first with an RBI single from Brooks Baldwin in the fourth, scoring Matt Thaiss. Thaiss led off the sixth with a single and went to second on a wild pitch. He went to third on a ground out and scored when Vaughns grounder went under the glove of third baseman Jonathan India for an error. Isbel led off the bottom of the sixth with a line drive home run that just cleared the fence in right center. The White Sox added a run in the eighth on an RBI single by Josh Rojas to make it 3-1. Salvador Perez had a double in the eighth, scoring Vinnie Pasquantino, to pull the Royals within one. The Royals had first and second with one out, trailing 2-1 in the seventh. However, reliever Steven Wilson got Fermin to foul out and then retired Isbel on a fielders choice to end the inning. 
        
     The White Sox have lost nine straight at Kauffman Stadium, their most ever in Kansas City.

Brewers get all the offense they need in first inning of a 4-3 victory over Astros,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Jake Bauers hit a two-run homer as the Milwaukee Brewers got all their runs in the first inning of a 4-3 victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday. The Brewers produced that big first-inning outburst against Hayden Wesneski, who hadnt allowed more than three runs in any of his previous five starts this season. Rhys Hoskins opened the scoring with a two-out, two-run double off the center-field wall. Bauers followed that up by clearing that center-field wall as he connected on a 1-2 pitch and delivered a 416-foot drive. Wesneski (1-3) didnt allow any more runs but only lasted four innings. He struck out three while allowing five hits and two walks. Milwaukees Chad Patrick (2-3) worked a career-high 6 2/3 innings and carried a one-hit shutout into the seventh before the Astros got to him. After Yainer Diaz and Jake Meyers hit consecutive one-out singles, Brendan Rodgers hit a three-run homer with two outs to cut Milwaukees lead to 4-3. Rodgers drive to right field was his first homer of the season. The Astros had runners on first and second with two outs in the eighth, but Nick Mears came out of the bullpen and got Diaz to hit an inning-ending grounder to shortstop Joey Ortiz. Mears had gotten the Brewers out of a two-on, one-out jam in a 5-1 victory over the Astros a night earlier. Trevor Megill retired the side in order in the ninth for his fourth save in five opportunities. Meyers led off the inning with a deep fly that Jackson Chourio caught at the center-field warning track. 
        
     Houston trailed 4-3 with one out in the eighth when Brewers catcher William Contreras threw out Jose Altuve, who was attempting to advance to second on a pitch in the dirt. Isaac Paredes walked and Christian Walker singled immediately after that second out, but the Astros couldnt capitalize. Patrick, a 26-year-old rookie, hasnt allowed more than three runs in any of his seven starts. Left-hander Framber Valdez (1-4, 4.39 ERA) pitches for Houston and right-hander Quinn Priester (1-0, 5.79) starts for Milwaukee as the Brewers attempt to complete the sweep Wednesday afternoon. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/astros-brewers-score-b4453aed4a70cd3875de070e815bfc07,sports

Jess Snchezs RBI single in 10th inning lifts Marlins to 5-4 win over Dodgers,"MIAMI (AP)  Jess Snchez singled with the bases loaded in the 10th inning, lifting the Miami Marlins to a 5-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night. Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman homered for the Dodgers, who lost for only the second time in their last 10 games. With automatic runner Xavier Edwards on second to start the 10th, J.P. Feyereisen (0-2) intentionally walked Kyle Stowers and allowed a single to Agustin Ramirez to load the bases. The Dodgers used five infielders to face Snchez, but he still found a hole with a liner up the middle to score Edwards from third. Jess Tinoco (2-0) threw two innings of relief for the win, the Marlins fifth walk-off victory of the season. Solo homers by homers by Ohtani and Freeman off Marlins reliever Anthony Veneziano in the sixth erased a 2-1 deficit before the Marlins retook the lead on Connor Norbys RBI double and Dane Myers run-scoring single in the bottom half. Ohtanis turn came up again in the seventh and he tied it at 4 with a run-scoring double. Liam Hicks two-run drive off Dodgers starter Tony Gonsolin in the fifth gave the Marlins a 2-1 lead. Freeman extended his hitting streak to 11 games with an RBI single against Miami starter Cal Quantrill in the first. Quantrill allowed one run and four hits and struck out six in five innings.  Gonsolin gave up two runs and four hits and struck out eight in five innings. 
        
     With Ohtani at third and two bases unoccupied in the seventh, the Marlins opted to pitch to the surging Freeman. Miami reliever Calvin Faucher struck out Freeman swinging for the third out. Freeman is 19 for 42 with four homers and 14 RBIs during his hitting streak. The homer Tuesday was the 42nd by Freeman against Miami, surpassing Ryan Zimmerman and Ryan Howard for most by a Marlins opponent. The Dodgers hadnt announced a starter for the series finale Wednesday. RHP Valente Bellozo (0-2, 4.97) will start for the Marlins.

Harris and Ozuna deliver clutch hits as Braves rally past slumping Reds 2-1 in 10 innings,"ATLANTA (AP)  Michael Harris II hit a tying double in the ninth inning and Marcell Ozuna singled home the winning run in the 10th as the Atlanta Braves rallied past the Cincinnati Reds 2-1 on Tuesday night for their third straight victory. Ozunas line-drive single to left field came after Lyon Richardson (0-1) issued an intentional walk to Austin Riley with nobody out. Automatic runner Alex Verdugo scored easily from second base, and happy teammates swarmed Ozuna on the field.  Raisel Iglesias (2-2) struck out two in a hitless inning for the win. Cincinnati has lost four in a row. Santiago Espinals run-scoring single off Daysbel Hernndez in the eighth drove in Elly De La Cruz to break a scoreless tie. Atlantas Chris Sale and Cincinnatis Andrew Abbott helped keep the game scoreless through seven innings. Abbott had eight strikeouts while allowing four hits with no walks in five innings. Sale fanned 10 in 6 2/3 innings. Reds third baseman Noelvi Marte was scratched minutes before the first pitch with left side discomfort. Sean Murphy drew a leadoff walk from Emilio Pagn in the ninth, and Harris doubled to right field with one out to drive in pinch-runner Stuart Fairchild, who slid under Jose Trevinos tag at the plate. It was Pagns second blown save in 10 chances. With Trevino behind the plate, Austin Wynns at first base and Tyler Stephenson at designated hitter, all three catchers on Cincinnatis active roster were in the starting lineup. It was Wynns second career appearance at first base and first start. He appeared in one game at first base in 2021 for Baltimore.

Giants score 9 runs in the 11th inning to beat the Cubs 14-5,"CHICAGO (AP)  Patrick Bailey hit a tiebreaking single in San Franciscos nine-run 11th inning, and the Giants beat the Chicago Cubs 14-5 on Tuesday night. Bailey drove in Christian Koss with a liner to center against Ryan Pressly (2-2). Jung Hoo Lee had a run-scoring single and Matt Chapman singled home two more runs in San Franciscos highest-scoring inning of the season. Lee also hit a two-run homer as San Francisco bounced back from an ugly 9-2 loss to Chicago on Monday night. Chapman, who committed two of the Giants four errors in the series opener, had three hits and scored twice. The Cubs trailed 5-3 before rallying in the ninth, handing Justin Verlander another no-decision after he was in position for his first win with the Giants. Justin Turner bounced a pinch-hit RBI single into right field against Ryan Walker. After Ian Happ struck out swinging for the second out, Kyle Tucker greeted Erik Miller (2-0) with a hard grounder back up the middle, bringing home the tying run. Verlander pitched five innings of three-run ball. The three-time AL Cy Young Award winner signed a $15 million, one-year contract with the Giants in January. The 42-year-old Verlander is winless in eight consecutive starts for the first time in his 20 major league seasons.  Miguel Amaya hit a two-run homer for NL Central-leading Chicago, which had won four of five. Dansby Swanson had two hits and scored twice while extending his hitting streak to eight games. Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong robbed Mike Yastrzemski of extra bases with a leaping grab at the wall in the third. Crow-Armstrong also took a hit away from Lee with a sliding catch in the fifth. 
        
     The Cubs put runners on second and third with one out in the 10th, but Crow-Armstrong struck out swinging and Swanson lined to third. The Giants improved to 21-5 against right-handed starting pitchers this season, the best such record in the majors.

Pirates Skenes still winless against Cardinals after 2-1 loss,"ST. LOUIS (AP)  Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes still hasnt found what hes looking for against the St. Louis Cardinals  a win. Skenes fell to 0-4 in five career starts against the Cardinals following a 2-1 loss on Tuesday night. It is the most starts by a Pirates pitcher to begin a career against St. Louis without a win since JT Brubaker went 0-6 in eight starts without a win in 2021 and 2022. Skenes pitched well enough in his latest start, allowing two runs on three hits in six innings. But one mistake to Alec Burleson, who hit a two-out, two-run double in the sixth inning, did him in. Just not executing, Skenes said. Burleson (6 for 15) has more career hits off Skenes than any other major leaguer. Adding to Skenes frustration is the entire rally in the sixth started with two outs as Nolan Arenado singled and Willson Contreras walked before Burleson came to the plate. There is no secret, Burleson said of facing Skenes. It takes a little bit of luck I feel like. Its just with a guy like him you have to have a plan and stick to it for three, four at bats. It may not necessarily give you success that night but it gives you the best chance to have success. So thats what I did and it worked out and I had a good time. Skenes, who allowed a season-high five runs in a loss to the Cardinals in Pittsburgh on April 8, has a 2.75 ERA in his five career starts against St. Louis. 
        
     I feel like we took tough at bats, Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. Didnt have a ton to show for it, but pitch count, we were able to drive that up, some deep counts. The guys continued to battle. You have to stay short through the middle of the field and battle from pitch one against someone like Skenes. I felt like our guys did that. Skenes pitched around four walks, matching a career high he set in his last outing against the Cubs. There were times where it looked like he lost his command, and then he came back and really executed pitches, Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. He gave up, what, three hits  and, you know, did a pretty good job. He made a bad pitch on a fastball that leaked out over to Burleson that ended up being the difference in the game. While Skenes would like the pitch to Burleson back, he was also the victim of lack of run support once again. In his five starts against the Cardinals spanning 32 2/3 innings, Skenes has received just three total runs of support while he has been in the game. The Pirates have lost six straight and nine of their last 10 games. Were not being very consistent right now offensively, Shelton said. Were not getting things going and, you know, weve tried some different lineups. Weve tried lineup changes. Weve tried consistency of lineups. So, I think its something we just got to keep exploring. Pitching is not the problem, Pirates third baseman KeBryan Hayes said. And I mean, we just got to pick them up and score runs. So however, that may be, whether it be drawing walks, getting that big hit, we just got to find a way. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/pirates-cardinals-skenes-3df8e6ec548d19c0a082cf87671f6bb7,sports
Maradona requested alcohol and tore out his own IVs in days after surgery,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  The director of the clinic where Diego Maradona had surgery two weeks before his death in 2020 testified Tuesday that the Argentine soccer star requested alcohol during the post-operative period and was difficult to deal with, which made his subsequent recovery in home care inadvisable. Pablo Dimitroff, medical director of the Olivos Clinic, said that neurosurgeon Leopoldo Luque, one of the seven health professionals on trial requested a place so the former player could undergo surgery in early November 2020. Maradona had surgery for a hematoma that formed between his skull and brain and stayed in intensive care at Olivos between Nov. 4-11. He then was sent recover to a private home where he died on Nov. 25 of 2020 at age 60. The deficiencies in Maradonas home care are one of the prosecutions key pieces of evidence against the defendants. A cardiologist testified that he was against moving Maradona from the Olivos Clinic. Dimitroff said the surgery was not an emergency, although there were indicators that it was necessary at some point. The operation was performed by a neurosurgeon at that center and it was routine, according to the medical director. After the surgery, the former player displayed a difficult temperament during his stay in intensive care and did not understand that he had to stay still, Dimitroff said. He added that on Nov. 6, Maradona had a complex psychomotor excitation episode that resembled alcohol withdrawal, which was what he was demanding, the manager indicated. 
        
     We were dealing with an aggressive patient who tore out his own IVs; he was a very difficult patient to take home, Dimitroff stated. Dimitroff explained that he discussed the situation with Luque and Agustina Cosachov  Maradonas psychiatrist, who is also on trial  and with the former soccer players family. According to Dimitroff, both Luque and Cosachov requested sedation for Maradona which was carried out at the clinic for approximately 24 hours. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/maradona-argentina-trial-783ae3737be6b4cbf589509e13ee8758,sports
Braves continue recovery from 0-7 start by rallying for confidence-building win over Reds,"ATLANTA (AP)  The Atlanta Braves are gaining momentum in their attempt to recover from a staggering 0-7 start to the season. A come-from-behind 2-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in 10 innings Tuesday night was the latest confidence-building win. The Braves scored a run in the bottom of the ninth to force extra innings before Marcell Ozunas run-scoring single in the 10th ended the game. It just kind of shows the character of this team, said left-hander Chris Sale, who had 10 strikeouts in 6 2/3 scoreless innings. We were down to our last couple of outs and found a way to do it. The Braves (17-18) have won three straight and 12 of 17 to close within a win of .500. Thats usually not big news for a team that has a streak of seven straight postseason appearances, including the 2021 World Series championship. The woeful start to the season forced manager Brian Snitkers team to focus on the new goal of becoming the first team to make the playoffs after losing its first seven games. It doesnt get any better than winning a game like that, Snitker said of Tuesday nights comeback. This is a mental game. It can have a great effect on a club. The streak of three straight wins began with a 4-3 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday night that saved the Braves from being swept in the series. Atlanta then beat Cincinnati 4-0 on Monday night when AJ Smith-Shawver took a no-hitter into the eighth inning. 
        
     With the score tied at 1 on Tuesday night, the Braves opened the 10th with automatic runner Alex Verdugo on second base. The Reds chose to issue an intentional walk to Austin Riley to face Ozuna, who had no hits in his first four at-bats. Ozuna might have looked even more vulnerable after calling timeout during his at-bat in the eighth because he was experiencing a cramp in his right leg. He was visited by Snitker and an athletic trainer in the batters box. I said, Hit a two-run homer or get a hit because were going to run for you, Snitker recalled. Im glad we didnt, in retrospect.  The eighth-inning at-bat ended with a long flyball to right field and Ozuna, the designated hitter, remained in the game. When asked if he was motivated by the Reds walking Riley, Ozuna said: For sure. I was 0 for 4 and I didnt feel right. Kind of a cramp. I just try to get good contact. Happy teammates swarmed Ozuna between first and second base after his line-drive single allowed Verdugo to easily score the winning run. It feels amazing, Ozuna said. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/braves-reds-ozuna-snitker-33adfb2a5c538f264c8e1b62d367b906,sports
Texas Rangers recall Evan Carter from minors while Leody Taveras waived and claimed by AL West rival,"BOSTON (AP)  Evan Carter was recalled by the Texas Rangers on Tuesday from Triple-A Round Rock, where the outfielder had been all this season after being hurt most of last year following his impressive debut late in the run to their only World Series title in 2023. Outfielder Leody Taveras, who at 26 was still one of the Rangers longest-tenured players, was acquired by Seattle on a waiver claim. Texas had put him on outright waivers over the weekend. The moves came before the Rangers opened a three-game series in Boston, and their first game since Bret Boone was hired as a hitting coach after the firing of offensive coordinator Donnie Ecker. Carter started the season in the minors after hitting .158 in 14 spring training games. In 21 games for Round Rock, he hit .221 with three home runs, nine RBIs, 13 walks and six stolen bases. Each of his seven extra-base hits have come in the past 14 games, with Carter hitting .288 with a .577 slugging percentage in that stretch. The outfielder made a dazzling debut late in 2023 after his call-up in September as an injury fill-in in 2023. He made is big league debut 10 days after his 21st birthday, then hit .306 with five homers and 12 RBIs in 23 games to finish the regular season. He reached base in all 17 of the Rangers postseason games, hitting .300 with an MLB postseason record nine doubles, and also 10 walks. Carter was limited to 45 games because of back issues in what was supposed to be his first full big league season in 2024. He hit .188 with five homers and 15 RBIs. Taveras was hitting .241 with one homer and eight RBIs in 30 games for Texas. He had been in the Rangers organization since 2016, and made his big league debut in 2020. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-mlb-carter-taveras-90ae0d0342e32c0aace323f01d2b82ee,sports

Scott Frosts return to UCF earns him a five-year contract valued at $22.1M; starting salary $3.9M,"Scott Frost received a five-year, $22.1 million contract upon his return to UCF and will have it automatically extended a year if the Knights appear in a bowl this season. An executive summary of Frosts contract was obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday through an open records request. UCF rehired Frost in December after Gus Malzahn left after four seasons to become offensive coordinator at Florida State. Frost had his first head coaching job at UCF in 2016, and the Knights went 6-7. A year later, UCF went 13-0 with a conference championship, a bowl victory over Auburn and final ranking of No. 6. Frost took over at Nebraska in 2018 and went 16-31 at his alma mater. He was fired three games into the 2022 season. He was out of coaching in 2023 and on the Los Angeles Rams staff in 2024.

Gujarat moves to top of IPL and ends Mumbais six-match winning streak,"MUMBAI, India (AP)  Gujarat Titans rose to the top of Indian Premier League with a thrilling three-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians on DLS method Tuesday. In a game twice interrupted by rain, Gujarat reached the revised target of 147 for the loss of seven wickets of the final ball as Deepak Chahar couldnt defend 15 runs. Mumbai had earlier lost five wickets for 27 runs in the middle overs and was restricted to 155-8 with Will Jacks (53) scoring his first half-century of the season. Gujarat with 16 points is at No. 1 ahead of Royal Challengers Bangalore on net run-rate while Mumbai is at No. 4 with 14 points as the battle for four playoff spots got intense. There was a little bit of chaos when we came in to bat after the rain, Gujarat captain Shubman Gill said. But always good to have a W (beside your name) after the match. When rain first interrupted the game, Gujarat was eight runs ahead on DLS before Mumbai stormed back through its pace bowlers when play resumed. Gujarat lost four wickets in space of 16 balls as Jasprit Bumrah clean bowled captain Gill (43) and Shahrukh Khan (6) to finish with 2-19. Sherfane Rutherford smashed two fours and two sixes in his quickfire 28 off 15 balls but Trent Boult trapped him leg before wicket and Rashid Khan also fell lbw against Ashwani Kumars searing yorker before rain took the players off the field for the second time. 
        
     When play resumed for one last time well past midnight, Rahul Tewatia kept his cool against Chahar and smashed the fast bowler for a straight boundary off the first ball and Gerald Coetzee smacked a six over long off to bring down the target to four off three balls. With scores leveled and two balls to go, Chahar had Coetzee holed out at mid-wicket and captain Hardik Pandya could have run-out Arshad Khan off the final ball, but missed the stumps as Mumbais six-match winning streak ended in the tournament. Fought well with the total we had, Pandya said. It was a game of margins. It was definitely not a 150-wicket. It was a 175-wicket, we were short by 20-25 runs. Earlier, Gujarat made amends of its three dropped catches inside the batting powerplay to contain Mumbai. Jacks was dropped before he had scored and Suryakumar Yadav also got reprieve on 10 before scoring 35, his 13th successive score of 25 or more in T20 cricket. Both batters combined in a 71-run stand before Gujarat spinner Sai Kishore (2-34) and Khan (1-21) put the brakes in the middle overs. Yadav spooned an easy catch at mid-off as he tried to play Kishore inside out and Jacks holed out to Kishore at deep square leg as he tried to drill Khan on the leg-side. Gill picked up three catches as Mumbai lost momentum after its two set batters got dismissed before Corbin Bosch made 27 off 22 balls and helped five-time champion to cross the 150-run mark in the final over.  ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/mumbai-gujarat-ipl-b79bc62d161b6b16d9dea5f7f834fc01,sports
Defending PWHL champion Minnesota opens playoffs in rematch vs. Toronto; Montreal faces Ottawa,"Feelings of relief quickly gave way to pride as Kendall Coyne Schofield assessed how the defending Walter Cup champion Minnesota Frost refused to let their PWHL season end with a whimper. The Frost earned a return to the postseason by winning their final two games to clinch the fourth and final playoff berth by the slimmest of margins in a race Minnesota, Ottawa and Boston  the odd-team out by tiebreaker  finished with 44 points apiece. For Coyne Schofield, Minnesotas closing flourish, capped by an 8-1 win at Boston on Saturday, was a reflection of the championship resolve the Frost showed in winning two decisive Game 5s to take the inaugural title. We needed to win two games in regulation to get to where were at today, and we did that, Coyne Schofield said. So I think when I look back to last year, its just how hard it is to win a five-game series. And to do it twice, I think that for me was unique in itself. The Frost have the championship pedigree entering their semifinal series rematch against Toronto opening on Wednesday. The Sceptres as well as the Montreal Victoire, who open against Ottawa on Thursday, carry over the weight of unfinished business following semifinal series losses last year. And welcome the Charge to the postseason after clinching their first playoff spot on Katerina Mrazovas overtime goal on the last day of the regular season. 
        
     As if there wasnt enough intrigue, the regular-season champion Victoire added another subplot in opting to face third-seeded and regional rival Ottawa rather than the Frost. I think theres a lot of spice already. I dont know if we needed more motivation, Charge captain Brianne Jenner said. Yeah, I think it maybe adds a little chip on our shoulder. The Victoire reached their decision by consulting with staff and players. One determining factor was geography with Ottawa a mere two-hour drive as opposed to a two-plus-hour flight to St. Paul. Last years playoffs proved seedings dont matter. Both lower seeds won their semifinal series, with fourth-seeded Minnesota defeating Boston for the title.  What stands out in Montreal are the difficult memories of last years playoffs, in which Boston swept the semis by winning all three games decided in overtime. We can talk about last year all we want. Honestly, it was a lesson for all of us, Montreal captain Marie-Philip Poulin said. Series are hard and that was hard last year. Its going to be harder even this year. Theres a similar lament in Toronto, with the Sceptres cognizant of how they squandered a 2-0 series lead to Minnesota, which coincided with losing leading scorer and eventual league MVP Natalie Spooner to a knee injury. Losing to Minnesota last year in five games is part of what motivated me and makes me even more excited to get this series started, Toronto captain Blayre Turnbull said. Montreal won the season series 4-2, but lost the final two meetings, including a 3-2 loss on April 26.  The Victoire feature the PWHLs leading goal-scorer in Poulin (19 goals) and top goalie in Ann-Renee Desbiens, who led the league in wins (15-2-2), a 1.86 goals-against average and .932 save percentage. They also allowed the fewest goals (67), while going 14-2-1 in one-goal games. Montreal was the first team to clinch a playoff berth, but didnt secure first place until Torontos 2-1 OT loss to Ottawa on Saturday. Ottawa went 4-1 to close the season, and did so without starting goalie Emerance Maschmeyer, who remains sidelined by a lower body injury sustained mid-March. Rookie Gwyneth Philips went 5-3 down the stretch, including a 4-1 closing run in which she allowed just six goals. The Charge rely on balanced scoring, and were led by Tereza Vanisova, who had 15 goals, including four game-winners, and 22 points. Ottawa finished tied for last with 71 goals for, and tied for last with 80 goals against. The Sceptres went 2-2-2 against the Frost, including a 5-2 loss in their most recent meeting on March 30. Toronto still finished second in the standings while overcoming injuries to Spooner, Sarah Nurse and Hannah Miller. The injuries led to others stepping up with Daryl Watts leading the team with 12 goals and 27 points. Blueliner Renata Fast continued making her case as one of the PWHLs best defenders with six goals and 22 points while leading all skaters with 739:14 of ice time. The Sceptres finished fifth with 73 goals scored, 24 coming on their league-leading power play, which converted 26% of its opportunities. Minnesota closed the season by winning three of four, and was led by Coyne Schofields 12 goals and 24 points. The Frost led the league with 85 goals, and have a solid D-core that includes offensive-minded Sophie Jaques and Claire Thompson, and a shutdown defender in Lee Stecklein. As last year, coach Ken Klee split the goaltending duties with Maddie Rooney going 8-7-3 and Nicole Hensley finishing 7-3-1. After closing with two road games, Minnesota elected to stay in Boston in awaiting its semifinal opponent. ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/pwhl-playoffs-womens-hockey-6f8da1cc20c8747c1222642c2460469b,sports
Reds rookie Callihan is expected to miss at least 2 months after surgery for forearm fracture,"ATLANTA (AP)  Cincinnati Reds rookie left fielder Tyler Callihan is expected to miss at least two months following surgery Tuesday to repair his fractured left forearm suffered while attempting a sliding catch a night earlier. Reds manager Terry Francona said Callihan will have no baseball activities for six to eight weeks but has not been ruled out for the season. Its actually kind of remarkable, Francona said, adding that everything came out like it was supposed to in the surgery, which was performed in Cincinnati. Callihans attempted catch turned into an inside-the-park home run for Matt Olson in the Reds 4-0 loss to the Atlanta Braves on Monday night. Callihan was playing in his fourth major league game after making his debut last week. The Reds placed him on the 10-day injured list on Tuesday. The team optioned right-hander Yosver Zulueta to Triple-A Louisville. Outfielder Jacob Hurtubise and right-hander Lyon Richardson were recalled from Louisville. Also, right-hander Rhett Lowder (right forearm strain) began a rehabilitation assignment. Utility player Santiago Espinal initially was listed as the Reds starter in left field in Tuesday nights game against the Braves. Minutes before the first pitch, third baseman Noelvi Marte was scratched with discomfort in his left side and Espinal was moved to third base.  Spencer Steer moved from first base to left field and Austin Wynns moved into the lineup at first base. TJ Friedl started in center field with Blake Dunn in right field. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/reds-callihan-surgery-0e99aeb343cddc2d57826438b25beb8e,sports
Lawyers for members of Canadas 2018 world juniors team suggest assault accuser wanted wild night,"LONDON, Ontario (AP)  An attorney for one of five hockey players charged with sexual assault suggested Tuesday that the accuser was the one to bring up calling other players into a hotel room in June 2018 because she wanted to have a wild night. David Humphrey, who represents Michael McLeod, suggested during cross-examination that the woman, now 27, wanted to keep the night going after having sex with McLeod and discussed having some of his friends come to the room to have some fun. Im going to suggest that Mr. McLeod asked you if you were serious and if thats what you really wanted and that you said yes, it was, Humphrey said. I dont recall having any conversation about this, and then just feeling really surprised when people did walk in, she replied, and later in response to a similar question said: That doesnt sound like anything I would usually say and I dont remember saying those words.  McLeod, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart, Cal Foote and Alex Formenton were charged with sexual assault last year for the incident that allegedly took place when they were in London, Ontario, for a Hockey Canada gala celebrating their championship at that years world junior tournament. McLeod is facing an additional charge of being a party to the offense of sexual assault. All have pleaded not guilty. None is on an NHL roster or has an active contract with a team in the league. 
        
     The woman, who is appearing via a video feed from another room in the courthouse, testified Monday that she was naked and scared when men started coming into the room. She described feeling numb and on autopilot, and like she had to go along with what the men wanted her to do. Prosecutors contend the players did what they wanted without taking steps to ensure she was voluntarily consenting to sexual acts. The judge, Maria Carroccia, has told jurors they may use evidence related to the initial encounter with McLeod to assess the credibility of the complainants testimony about her interest and level of participation in what happened afterward, her ability to choose what activities to engage in and her level of intoxication. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/hockey-assault-trial-f581d89a31a8d03d79152c23b35e5f86,sports
Yankees designate veteran RHP Carlos Carrasco for assignment,"NEW YORK (AP)  Needing another reliever, the New York Yankees designated struggling starting pitcher Carlos Carrasco for assignment on Tuesday. The Yankees recalled Yerry de Los Santos from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre to replace Carrasco. The right-hander made his only appearance for the Yankees during a doubleheader on April 27 against Toronto and is 1-1 with a 1.74 ERA in 10 appearances in Triple-A. Carrasco was 2-2 with a 5.91 ERA in eight appearances and made six starts for the Yankees, whose rotation began Tuesday with a 3.92 ERA. Carlos Rodn and Max Fried have combined to go 10-3 with a 2.03 ERA while other Yankees starters are 3-6 with a 6.02 ERA. It was a tough call, with how we feel about Cookie, manager Aaron Boone said before the Yankees continued a three-game series with the San Diego Padres. Weve toyed with it for a couple of days now, and just felt like it was the right time. Injuries to Gerrit Cole (elbow) and Luis Gil (lat) created a spot for Carrasco, who signed a one-year contract on March 22. Carrasco was in spring training on a minor league deal and could have opted out but he was re-signed after posting a 1.69 ERA in five spring training outings, including four starts. Carrasco was 3-10 with a 5.64 ERA in 21 starts for Cleveland last season. In 15 seasons, Carrasco has a 112-105 record and 4.18 ERA. He led the American League in wins in 2017, when he was 18-6 with Cleveland and also was named the 2019 AL Comeback Player of the Year following a return from leukemia. 
        
     What I told him is, Ive always admired him from across the diamond, Boone said. We got to see it up close, in what a phenomenal human being Carlos is, with the class with which he carries himself. It really was a pleasure to be around him for these last couple of months, and who knows? He may be back here. Boone did not immediately say who would take Carrascos spot. The Yankees may use Ryan Yarbrough, who pitched four scoreless innings filling in for Clarke Schmidt on Saturday. Another option Boone hinted at is Allan Winans, who has pitched 14 scoreless innings in Triple-A. Giancarlo Stanton, recovering from epicondylitis in both elbows since the start of spring training, took two at-bats and saw 10 pitches in a live batting practice session from reliever Jake Cousins, who is rehabbing a right elbow flexor strain. Stanton is expected to remain in New York during the upcoming West Coast trip and continue rehabbing against the high-velocity Trajekt machine. I thought his at-bats were really good, Boone said. Cousins is not an easy at-bat for a righty, especially. I thought Cousins looked good and G looked like he was controlling the at-bats pretty well. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-carrasco-7a3e6ef923d02cd466ba701e7a07dc7b,sports
"Pennsylvania Senate votes to ban transgender athletes in girls sports, but bill faces uphill battle","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)  Pennsylvanias state Senate on Tuesday approved a bill to ban transgender athletes from competing in womens and girls sports at the collegiate and K-12 levels, although the Republican-penned bill is unlikely to get a vote in the states Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. The bill passed, 32-18, with five Democrats crossing party lines to join with all 27 Republicans in voting yes. The vote marked the second time the GOP-controlled Senate has passed it. An earlier attempt, in concert with a Republican-controlled House, met then-Gov. Tom Wolfs veto pen in 2022. This time, Senate Republicans are advancing the effort after President Donald Trump declared his intent to keep men out of womens sports. and made it a major campaign issue in last years election, dividing Democrats on how to respond. The bill applies to participation in girls and womens sports that are sponsored by public schools, public universities and publicly chartered community colleges.  It also prohibits any sort of government agency or athletic association from investigating or punishing a school or higher education institution for maintaining separate sports teams for girls or women.  For well over an hour, Republicans and Democrats debated the bill, at times hotly. The sponsor, Sen. Judy Ward, a Republican from Blair County, said the bill would ensure all young women have a fair chance to compete in the sports they love.  
        
     Ward said that since 2020 in Pennsylvania, 37 female athletes have lost first place and another 13 lost second or third place, although she didnt say from where she drew the statistics. Pennsylvanias governing body for high school sports, the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, said it was aware of just one transgender student currently participating in sports. Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, a Democrat from Allegheny County, called the bill discriminatory against transgender people, as well as unnecessary, unwarranted and unconstitutional in my mind. Democrats warned that the bill will go nowhere in the House, and a spokesperson for House Democratic leaders accused Senate Republicans of being more focused on divisive political theater and bullying kids for political points.  Gov. Josh Shapiro s office declined to comment Tuesday about the bill, although the Democrat has in the past expressed opposition to such bans, calling 2022s bill nothing more than cruel, designed to discriminate against transgender youth who just want to play sports like their peers. Trump, as president, signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls and womens sports.  In February, the PIAA changed its policy in a move that some officials said was designed to follow Trumps order, except that lawyers on both sides of the issue say the change in policy wording does nothing of the sort. Previously, the PIAAs policy had deferred to school principals to determine an athletes gender when questioned or uncertain. It changed the policy to defer to principals to determine a students sex when questioned or uncertain, and added a line that says that, in accordance with Trumps executive order, schools are required to consult with their school solicitors relative to compliance with the order. In response to Trumps order, the NCAA revised its transgender participation policy to limit womens college sports to athletes assigned as female at birth. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, a governing body for smaller schools, effectively banned transgender athletes in 2023 from womens sports. __ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter.",https://apnews.com/article/transgender-athletes-sports-pennsylvania-high-school-college-94d8cfeaa9c5cf22c02742ac94eb5b33,sports

The Tigers enter the series having won eight of 11. The Rockies (6-28) are the only team in the majors with single-digit wins. Both teams pushed back their scheduled starters by a day, with Jackson Jobe (2-0, 3.38 ERA) set to start Wednesday night for Detroit against Colorados Chase Dollander (2-3, 6.48).

Padres activate All-Star center fielder Jackson Merrill from injured list,"NEW YORK (AP)  The San Diego Padres activated Jackson Merrill from the injured list Tuesday after the outfielder was sidelined for a month with a strained left hamstring. Merrill was batting fourth against the Yankees and playing center field after joining the Padres on Monday. He returned after playing in a pair of injury rehabilitation games for Double-A San Antonio during the weekend. Jacksons a really, really special player that missed quite a bit, both on the field, off the field and were excited to have him back, Padres manager Mike Shildt said. Merrill was placed on the injured list April 8, a week after he signed a $135 million, nine-year contract following a standout rookie season during which he was selected for the NL All-Star team and he finished second to Pittsburgh pitcher Paul Skenes in the NL Rookie of the Year voting. Before landing on the injured list, Merrill was hitting .378 (14 for 37) with three homers and 10 RBIs in eight games. To make room for Merrill, catcher Luis Campusano was optioned to Triple-A El Paso. Campusano appeared in three games and was hitless in six at-bats. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/padres-merrill-yankees-e98b14a75e7982fab3401ee55df4ebaf,sports

Brewers Sal Frelick remains out of lineup with knee issue but says he should return later this week,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Sal Frelick was out of the lineup for a second straight night with a knee issue but believes he should be ready to play again later this week. Frelick had left the Brewers 4-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Sunday with discomfort in his left knee after hurting it while taking a swing. Frelick underwent an MRI that showed no major damage, and the 2024 NL Gold Glove right fielder said he felt much better when he woke up Tuesday. From what the trainers are saying, it seems like theyll try to keep me out until the off day to get an extra day and be ready to go on Friday, Frelick said before the Brewers 4-3 victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday. The Brewers complete a three-game series with the Astros on Wednesday afternoon before beginning a six-game trip Friday at Tampa Bay. Frelick isnt the only Brewer dealing with an injury this week. Brewers manager Pat Murphy said after Tuesdays game that catcher William Contreras was getting an X-ray on his finger. Murphy said the injury was affecting Contreras swing.  Hes dealing with probably a fracture, Murphy said. He had it last year, too. Frelick said he felt a grab behind his left knee after swinging the bat in the second inning of Sundays game. He briefly stayed in the game before getting removed in the fourth inning. My whole body rotated, but the spike on my toe staying in the dirt. My foot almost came out of my shoe, he said. I tried to play another inning, but my knee was blowing up on me. ... Based on my previous meniscus stuff, I think we dodged a bullet there. 
        
     The 2021 first-round draft pick said he underwent two meniscus surgeries on that knee while playing for Boston College, but he hadnt had any other issues with it until Sunday. Frelick said the MRI he underwent showed no tear but just a ton of inflammation in there. But he says hes feeling better now. Yesterday I came in and was not too much better, Frelick said. This morning I woke up and it was like unbelievable. Frelick, 25, is batting .297 with a .381 on-base percentage, one homer, nine RBIs and seven steals in 35 games. That follows a 2024 season in which he hit .259 with a .320 on-base percentage, two homers, 32 RBIs and 18 steals in 145 games. His absence has tested the depth of an outfield that already has Garrett Mitchell and Blake Perkins on the injured list. Mitchell last played April 25 as he deals with a left oblique strain. Perkins still hasnt made his 2025 debut as he recovers from a fractured right shin. Milwaukees injuries have caused Jake Bauers, who primarily is a first baseman, to start at right field each of the last two nights. Bauers has responded by going 2 for 4 with an RBI in a 5-1 victory over the Astros on Monday and hitting a two-run homer Tuesday. I think Im just grateful for any opportunity I get to play this game and play for the Brewers, Bauers said. I love being here, so anytime I can get on the field and just do my best to contribute and do my best to help the team get a win, thats kind of been my mentality throughout the course of the season so far. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/milwaukee-brewers-sal-frelick-f2854fa8e8c28a4b1e859379ca39ba8a,sports
Dodgers place outfielder Teoscar Hernandez on 10-day injured list,"MIAMI (AP)  The Los Angeles Dodgers placed outfielder Teoscar Hernndez on the 10-day injured list Tuesday because of a Grade 1 abductor strain. Hernndez left after the third inning of Los Angeles series-opening win at Miami on Monday in what was first reported as left hamstring tightness. He underwent an MRI Tuesday which revealed the severity of the injury. He doesnt come out of baseball games, so we put him on the IL, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Tuesday before his team faced the Marlins. Obviously, hes going to be inactive for a while. I dont really know what timetable. Hernndez first experienced discomfort after he chased and caught a ball hit in the gap by Javier Sanoja in the third inning Monday. When his turn to bat came up again in the fourth, he was replaced by Chris Taylor. The 32-year-old Hernndez began Tuesday hitting a team-leading .315 and also tops the club in RBIs with 34. Its certainly weeks but I dont know how long, Roberts said of Hernndezs return. Hes had a huge impact. Without Teo, you try to balance out the lineup. I think its going to be more of a platoon-paced roster right now. And well go from there. The Dodgers recalled outfielder James Outman from Triple-A Oklahoma City in the corresponding move. Outman will start in center field and bat eighth Tuesday. Outman hit 23 homers and had 70 RBIs in his rookie season with the Dodgers in 2023. But Outman, who finished third in the Rookie of the Year voting, hit .147 in 53 games last season. He then struggled in spring training and began this season in the minor leagues. 
        
     Its up to him to go out there and relax and know that you can be comfortable in this environment and be free and go play, Roberts said. Hernndez becomes the second Dodgers offensive player to land on the IL this season. Tommy Edman had eight homers and 24 RBIs through 30 games before he was sidelined because of right ankle inflammation. The Dodgers also recalled right-handed reliever J.P. Feyereisen from Oklahoma City and designated right-handed reliever Yoendrys Gmez for assignment on Tuesday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-dodgers-teoscar-hernandez-a025b2129c039f62fdf0bf1a682f27c1,sports
"Trump, Congress and city council: Managing relationships, DCs mayor walks a tightrope","WASHINGTON (AP)  D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser drew a laugh from the room when she was asked how it feels to manage a mercurial relationship with the White House and Congress  while, by the way, also trying to run a city of 700,000 people. It is just like you might imagine, she deadpanned. Its tricky. A few hours after that comment Monday, Bowsers balancing act with President Donald Trump was on public display. She appeared with Trump to celebrate Washington being named as host for the 2027 NFL draft and maintained a poker face while Trump talked at length about immigration.  Bowser also continues to lobby the House of Representatives to pass a simple fix that would prevent the nations capital from having to immediately cut $400 million from its 2025 budget in the middle of the budget year. The House essentially created the shortfall earlier this year when it eliminated a little-known provision in a budget resolution. The change would force the District of Columbia to immediately revert to its 2024 budget parameters.  And while the Senate immediately passed a simple fix, the House has failed to bring that measure up for a vote during four weeks in session  despite it being publicly endorsed by Trump. Bowser has warned that layoffs, furloughs and service cuts could be coming  and within days  if the issue isnt resolved.  
        
     Now Bowsers relationship with the D.C. Council is coming under public stress. The third-term mayor faces a looming showdown with the council over a host of budget issues and her new deal to bring the NFLs Washington Commanders back to the nations capital.  Citing the uncertainty surrounding the 2025 budget, Bowser has delayed submitting a proposed 2026 budget to the council by more than a month. But D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has publicly complained that Bowser is dragging out the process. We cant wait longer to start making the service reductions and cuts, Mendelson said Monday of the 2025 budget cuts. She has to move forward now. Bowser maintains she is following the proper timeline and protocol required by the citys chief financial officer. But Mendelson contends that Bowser was using the delay to jam the council and force it into a pressurized deadline where city legislators wouldnt have time to properly question either the budget or the particulars of the Commanders agreement. That stadium deal should prompt a robust debate when it comes up for D.C. Council approval. When it was first announced, Mendelson said he didnt think it had enough votes to pass. But different members of the 12-person body have staked out widely varied initial positions. First-term Ward 5 Councilmember Zachary Parker called the chance to bring football back to the nations capital and revitalize the site of the old RFK Stadium a once in a generation opportunity.  Parker said he believed the deal would and should pass; he simply wants to make sure the city gets the best deal possible.  But veteran Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen has taken a harder public line. He says he opposes the entire concept of a stadium  especially if any significant amount of public money is spent on the project.  I dont think a stadium returns back the economic investment.

Teen basketball players were among those who died in a Kansas highway crash that killed 8,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP)  Two teenage basketball players, a coach and a trainer from the Tulsa, Oklahoma, area who were on their way back from a tournament were among eight people killed in a fiery head-on highway crash in eastern Kansas. Authorities said the other victims in Sundays crash on a two-lane stretch of U.S. 169 about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri, included three members of a St. Louis-area family. The crash occurred when a southbound SUV driven by the trainer, carrying the teammates, collided with a northbound sedan with the St. Louis family as passengers, the Kansas Highway Patrol reported. A third teenager from the Tulsa area survived the crash and was hospitalized with what the Highway Patrol described as potentially a minor injury.  Video obtained from bystanders by KSHB-TV in Kansas City shows people trying to save those trapped in the burning vehicles and pounding on the windows of one of them but unable to get close enough to pull people out because of the flames.  The young basketball players who died were Donald DJ Laster, 14, a student at Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa; and Kyrin Schumpert, a ninth-grader at the Union High School Freshman Academy in the Tulsa area, who also sometimes went by Kyrin Gilstrap, according to Union Public Schools. The boys were members of the Oklahoma Chaos youth basketball program, which participated in a tournament in the Kansas City area. It called the crash an unimaginable tragedy in a post on the social platform X. 
        
     Please wrap their families and friends with love and support as they try to get through this very difficult time, the post said. Our organization has taken a tremendous hit and we are deeply saddened. Ron Horton, a teacher at Booker T. Washington, said in a video sent by Tulsa Public Schools that he has seen a lot of kids come and go in his 17 years of teaching and that DJ Laster was something special.  He said Laster was a quintessential student-athlete who worked as hard at academics as he did at sport during the busy varsity basketball season. He said Laster was among only two freshmen to make the schools varsity team and stood out for how he put others at ease. Its just a shock, it is, that hes gone, Horton said. Two adults traveling with them also died  Wayne Walls, of Talala, Oklahoma, 41, a former teacher and coach at Carver Middle School in Tulsa  and Jamon Gilstrap, a trainer and driver with the Tulsa Public Schools transportation team. Gilstrap was driving the SUV at the time of the accident.  The sole survivor of the accident was Braden Walls, 15, also of Talala, Oklahoma, according to the Kansas Highway Patrol. An obituary posted online identified him as Wayne Walls son.  The other driver  Alexander Ernst, 37, of Ames, Iowa  also died, along with Madalyn Elliott, 33; John Elliott, 76, and Norleen Elliott, 69, all of Chesterfield, Missouri. The Kansas Highway Patrol said the crash occurred a few miles outside of Greeley, Kansas, a town of fewer than 300 people, at about 5:45 p.m. Sunday, as Gilstrap, the driver of the SUV, attempted to pass a slow-moving vehicle. He and the sedan driven by Ernst were headed toward each other in the northbound lane, and both drivers swerved to avoid a collision, but both went into the northbound shoulder of the highway.  The crash caused a fire, and both cars burned up, officials said. ___ Hollingworth reported from Kansas City, Missouri.

"Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty wont run in the Preakness, dashing Triple Crown possibility","Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty will not run in the Preakness Stakes, officials announced Tuesday, meaning there wont be a Triple Crown champion for a seventh consecutive year. We received a call today from trainer Bill Mott that Sovereignty will not be competing in the Preakness, said Mike Rogers, executive VP of 1/ST Racing, which operates the Preakness. We extend our congratulations to the connections of Sovereignty and respect their decision. Mott told Preakness officials the plan will be to enter Sovereignty in the Belmont Stakes, the third jewel of the Triple Crown, on June 7 at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York. Mott on Sunday morning had foreshadowed skipping the Preakness in the name of long-term interests. We want to do whats best for the horse, he told reporters at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Of course, you always think about a Triple Crown, and thats not something were not going to think about. The competition for a Triple Crown will have to wait another year. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports. Sovereignty won a muddy Derby with jockey Junior Alvarado at odds of 7-1 by passing favorite Journalism down the stretch. Owner Godolphins U.S. director of bloodstock, Michael Banahan, deferred an explanation to Mott in a text message sent to The Associated Press, calling it a team decision that both feel its the right direction for the horse going forward. A message left for Mott was not immediately returned. This is the fifth time since Justify won all three races in 2018 that the Preakness will go on without a true shot at a Triple Crown. Elevated winner Country House and Maximum Security, who was disqualified for interference, each did not participate in 2019, the races were run out of order in 2020, Bob Baffert-trained Medina Spirit was DQd for a positive drug test in 2021 and long shot Rich Strike was held out in 2022 to rest him for the previously planned five weeks. 
        
     Mage finished third in the Preakness in 2023, and Mystik Dan was second last year after his owner and trainer also were initially reluctant to run him. The two-week turnaround from the Kentucky Derby to the Preakness and changes in modern racing have sparked debate around the sport about spacing out the races. Prominent owner Mike Repole earlier Tuesday posted on social media a proposal to move the Belmont to second in the Triple Crown order, four weeks after the Kentucky Derby and sliding the Preakness back further with the aim of keeping more of the top horses involved. The Preakness being run two weeks after the Kentucky Derby, in this new day and age in racing, shows the lack of vision and leadership needed to evolve this sport, Repole wrote. I expect the top three finishers of this years Derby to skip the Preakness and go right to the Belmont. No decision has been made on second-place finisher Journalism, who was the Derby favorite, or third-place Baeza for the 150th running of the Preakness, the last at Pimlico Race Course before it is knocked down and rebuilt. The plan is for the 2026 Preakness to take place at Laurel Park between Baltimore and Washington while Pimlico is under construction. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",https://apnews.com/article/sovereignty-preakness-triple-crown-e2368353711c0671ed019989a763b461,sports
Inter captain Lautaro could make surprise comeback against Barcelona in Champions League,"MILAN (AP)  Inter Milan captain Lautaro Martnez is hoping to emulate strike partner Marcus Thuram ahead of their teams Champions League semifinal against Barcelona on Tuesday. In the buildup to the first leg last week, the focus was on whether Thuram would be fit in time even for a place on the bench after missing three matches with a thigh problem. But Thuram surprisingly started and scored the opener just seconds after kickoff in a thrilling 3-3 draw that has set up a must-see sequel in Milan. This time around it is Lautaro who is a doubt after having to come off at halftime against Barcelona last Wednesday with a thigh muscle injury. Inter coach Simone Inzaghi admitted last week that it would be very difficult to have Lautaro back in time as that type of injury normally takes 10 days to two weeks to recover from. But confidence is growing in the Inter camp. Lautaro trained in the gym on Sunday and the Argentina World Cup winner is set to return to the group in their afternoon training session on Monday. Inter could also welcome back Benjamin Pavard after the defender  who was the goalscoring hero against Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals  missed the trip to Barcelona with an ankle injury. We will decide together with the medical staff, together with the players themselves, because they will be the ones who will have to tell me their own feelings, Inzaghi said on Monday.  
        
     Pavard participated in the first part of training yesterday, he didnt feel much, so well see. Lautaro hasnt trained since the Barcelona match, today well see how he is and then well decide. Lautaro himself posted a cryptic message on Instagram: a photo of him doing exercises in the gym, captioned with emojis of an hourglass and a battery. Thuram commented on the image with an emoji of an alarm clock. Lautaro is Inters record goalscorer in Europes elite club competition, with 20 goals  including eight this season. The 27-year-old has scored 21 goals and added six assists for Inter across all competitions this campaign. Lautaro will do the impossible to be there, Inzaghis assistant coach, Massimiliano Farris, said after Saturdays win over Hellas Verona in Serie A. Clearly what they feel after todays training sensations will be very, very important for Lauti, for Pavard, Inzaghi said. Knowing that we have players if necessary because Pavard wasnt there in Barcelona and Lautaro had to come off at the end of the first half. So we have a good squad and well see after todays training. Tomorrow morning well do some stretching, Ill make my decision then. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/lautaro-injury-inter-barcelona-champions-league-28f89151c3f1cebf8454bd9d64d4bb84,sports
Melchie Dumornay signs new 3-year deal with the Lyon womens team until 2029,"LYON, France (AP)  Haiti midfielder Melchie Dumornay signed a three-year contract extension on Monday with the Lyon womens team, tying her to the club until 2029. Lyon announced the new deal on its website, with a picture of Dumornay holding up a jersey with 2029 written on it. The 21-year-old Dumornay has stood out in the Champions League this season, scoring six goals. She scored a fine individual goal last month in a 2-1 win away to Arsenal in the first leg of their semifinal. Last November, Dumornay scored a stunning goal from inside the center circle in a game at Roma. She has scored 30 goals in 45 matches overall since joining Lyon from French club Reims two years ago.

Lewandowski back in Barcelona squad for Champions League semi against Inter Milan,"MILAN (AP)  Barcelona is getting a boost in attack with the return of Robert Lewandowski against Inter Milan for the Champions League semifinal second leg on Tuesday. Lewandowski was included in the squad on Monday for the trip to Milan after being sidelined for about two weeks because of a left thigh injury. The striker missed four games, including last weeks thrilling first leg against Inter in Barcelona, a 3-3 draw. Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said Lewandowski would start from the bench, however. We also spoke yesterday, everything goes on in the right way and hes good, much better than we expected and hes ready for the bench, Flick said on Monday.  So its when we need him, maybe he can come in. So, its like that. The Polish striker was injured on April 19 in a La Liga match against Celta Vigo. After two weeks working on his recovery and training with the squad on Sunday, he has been given the all clear to return to action, Barcelona said. The 36-year-old Lewandowski is having one of his best seasons with Barcelona, having scored 40 goals in total, including 11 in the Champions League. He leads La Liga with 25 goals, one more than Real Madrids Kylian Mbapp. Flick rested nearly all of his regular starters in the 2-1 win at Valladolid in La Liga on Saturday. With four rounds remaining, Barcelona has a four-point lead over Madrid ahead of next Sundays clasico. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/robert-lewandowski-barcelona-inter-milan-champions-league-201de6527bb856ba0c0a316cd3a7606d,sports
Spire Motorsports among the surprises of NASCAR season so far with Talladega up next,"Despite five finishes of 30th or worst in the first eight races of the season, Carson Hocevar has avoided getting caught up in the dismal results. Its the encouraging performance of his No. 77 Chevrolet that has the 22-year-old from Portage, Michigan, believing his team is emerging as a force in NASCARs premier Cup Series. Our group is so strong, said Hocevar, who is in his second full Cup season. Were so good on pit road. Were good on the racetrack. We just got to be able to take advantage of the adversity. As my dad would remind me when I was a kid racing, they are character-building moments. Despite the disappointments, Hocevar still is part of the best start in the six-year history of Spire Motorsports, one of the seasons major surprises. At Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Michael McDowell (a two-time Cup winner hired for 2025 by Spire) delivered the first pole in team history. Hocevar finished a career-best second at Atlanta Motor Speedway Spire, which has yet to finish a season in the top 20 of the championship standings, has its three cars ranked between 19th and 25th in points after overhauling its roster with a host of championship veterans. Rodney Childers, who guided Kevin Harvick to the 2014 championship and earned 40 wins as a crew chief, joined the No. 7 of Justin Haley. Dax Gerringer, formerly a lead engineer for Childers at Stewart-Haas Racing, was hired as Spires technical director. Matt McCall, a four-time winner as a Cup crew chief, was added as director of vehicle performance. 
        
     A lot of the impact on our program is the unsung heroes, Hocevar said before finishing 11th and leading two laps (despite a pit stop miscue) in the April 13 race at Bristol Motor Speedway. Its Matt McCall, Dax and a handful of others in the competition space. Their mettle will be tested as Bristol marked the quarter-pole of a 36-race season that gets only more grueling. Emerging from the Easter off-weekend, the Cup Series will return Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway for a stretch of racing on 28 consecutive weeks through the Nov. 2 season finale at Phoenix Raceway. Denny Hamlin, who has been another 2025 surprise in ending a long winless drought with new crew chief Chris Gayle, said he understands the reason for the marathon but fears the stress. There is always a breaking point, he said. It is harder and harder to keep people over the years. It is just generally a hard sport to be a part of because of the schedule. It is certainly not ideal. Here are some other surprises, good and bad, from the season so far: In three championships from 2022-24, Team Penske developed a title blueprint of playing possum in the regular season before reeling off hot playoff runs by Joey Logano and Ryan Blaney. The lack of early results from Penskes trio of drivers is befuddling this season. Logano needed seven races before his first top 10 finish, the longest stretch for a defending Cup series champion. Blaney has led five races in his No. 12 Ford but averaged a finish of 16.7 because of mechanical failures, mediocre pit stops and crash misfortune. Austin Cindric could have won the first two races at Daytonaand Atlanta but twice got wrecked. Last year, we didnt run very good and then we were able to fabricate a finish somehow, Logano said. This year has kind of been the opposite. You name it, and it has happened. The fact that we have speed gives me a lot of confidence that a win will be around the corner at some point. After his debut in the championship field, Tyler Reddick keeps gathering steam with top-three rankings in NASCARs passing, defense and speed categories. Teammate Bubba Wallace, who missed the playoffs last year, has shown major gains on restarts (ranking third in the series with his No. 23 Toyota). In its fifth year, the team co-owned by Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan is on target for qualifying two title contenders despite the distractions of facing off with NASCAR in federal court for an antitrust battle that could drag through the year. The preseason optimism was high for Brad Keselowski. He ended a 110-race winless streak last year and was reunited for 2025 with crew chief Jeremy Bullins, who took Keselowski to his most recent championship round appearance in 2020. But its been a wipeout for the No. 6 Ford driver, whose best finish is 11th. The 2012 Cup champion is ranked 31st in the standings and is off to the worst start of his 16-season career. At 41, the driver-owner of Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing could face career decisions if the trajectory continues. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-cup-spire-hocevar-e3b609dc9fd5ad62e93f949262654283,sports

NASCARs Katherine Legge says she has been receiving death threats after Xfinity crash at Rockingham,"NASCAR driver Katherine Legge said she has been receiving hate mail and death threats from auto racing fans after she was involved in a crash that collected veteran driver Kasey Kahne during the Xfinity Series race last weekend at Rockingham. Legge, who has started four Indy 500s but is a relative novice in stock cars, added during Tuesdays episode of her Throttle Therapy podcast that the inappropriate social media comments Ive received arent just disturbing, they are unacceptable.  Let me be very clear, the British driver said, Im here to race and Im here to compete, and I wont tolerate any of these threats to my safety or to my dignity, whether thats on track or off of it. Legge became the first woman in seven years to start a Cup Series race earlier this year at Phoenix. But her debut in NASCARs top series ended when Legge, who had already spun once, was involved in another spin and collected Daniel Suarez. Her next start was the lower-level Xfinity race in Rockingham, North Carolina, last Saturday. Legge was good enough to make the field on speed but was bumped off the starting grid because of ownership points. Ultimately, she was able to take J.J. Yeleys seat in the No. 53 car for Joey Gase Motorsports, which had to scramble at the last minute to prepare the car for her. Legge was well off the pace as the leaders were lapping her, and when she entered Turn 1, William Sawalich got into the back of her car. That sent Legge spinning, and Kahne had nowhere to go, running into her along the bottom of the track. 
        
     I gave (Sawalich) a lane and the reason the closing pace looks so high isnt because I braked mid-corner. I didnt. I stayed on my line, stayed doing my speed, which obviously isnt the speed of the leaders because theyre passing me, Legge said. He charged in a bit too hard, which is the speed difference you see. He understeered up a lane and into me, which spun me around. The 44-year-old Legge has experience in a variety of cars across numerous series. She made seven IndyCar starts for Dale Coyne Racing last year, and she has raced for several teams over more than a decade in the IMSA SportsCar series. She has dabbled in NASCAR in the past, too, starting four Xfinity races during the 2018 season and another two years ago. I have earned my seat on that race track, Legge said. Ive worked just as hard as any of the other drivers out there, and Ive been racing professionally for the last 20 years. Im 100 percent sure that the ... the teams that employed me  without me bringing any sponsorship money for the majority of those 20 years  did not do so as a DEI hire, or a gimmick, or anything else. Its because I can drive a race car. Legge believes the vitriol she has received on social media is indicative of a larger issue with women in motorsports. Luckily, she said, I have been in tougher battles than you guys in the comment sections. Legge has received plenty of support from those in the racing community. IndyCar driver Marco Andretti clapped back at one critic on social media who called Legge unproven in response to a post about her history at the Indy 500. Its wild to me how many grown men talk badly about badass girls like this, Andretti wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Does it make them feel more manly from the couch or something? ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-xfinity-katharine-legge-threats-rockingham-fabc9a956b1cdf24b75e0c83c8492ae7,sports
PGA Tours Zurich Classic extends title sponsorship through 2030,"AVONDALE, La. (AP)  The PGA Tour has locked up Zurich Insurance as the sponsor of its only two-man team event through 2030. Wednesdays announcement came on the eve of Thursdays first round of the Zurich Classic. The length of the deal corresponds to the remaining years on the PGA Tours television broadcast rights contracts. Zurich has sponsored the tours New Orleans-area event since 2005, the first year the tournament was held at the Pete Dye-designed TPC Louisiana, and just months before Hurricane Katrina flooded much of the area. A number of Zurichs charitable endeavors in the years following the storm focused on the areas recovery from widespread destruction. The Zurich Classic was an individual event until 2017, when it became the only team event to offer FedEx Cup points. Our connection to this resilient city runs deep, and the Zurich Classic of New Orleans has supported that resilience over the past two decades, Zurich CEO of North America Kristof Terryn said. As the only team event on the PGA Tour, the Zurich Classic lets players compete alongside family and friends. Defending champions Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland and Shane Lowry of Ireland are close friends. The Zurich is McIlroys first event since he won the Masters on April 13 to complete the career Grand Slam. This years field also includes former U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick of England alongside his brother, Alex. Players on the winning team each earn 400 FedEx Cup points and $1.66 million. The event has raised more than $30 million for local charities since Zurich became the title sponsor, officials said. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-tour-zurich-classic-sponsorship-d489ab433714800695196664ece7b0b8,sports
"Ryu, Liu share Chevron Championship lead as defending champion Korda struggles","THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP)  Haeran Ryu and Yan Liu each shot bogey-free 7-under 65 to share the lead during the suspended first round of the Chevron Championship as top-ranked Nelly Korda struggled to a 77 on Thursday in her title defense. The round was suspended late as a storm approached The Club at Carlton Woods, with 24 players unable to finish. Korda won the event last year for the last of her five straight LPGA Tour victories and had hoped to rediscover that dominant form in the seasons first major. Instead, she made bogeys on four straight holes and was 4-over par after six holes.  Korda added two more bogeys on the back nine and was 12 shots behind the leaders and needing a big second round simply to make the cut.  Ryu of South Korea and Liu of China had no such problems. Ryu birdied five of her first 10 holes to move in front and made her seventh birdie on her closing hole, the ninth.  Liu got going on her back nine with four birdies in a five-hole stretch. She, too, made a closing birdie to tie Ryu.  Hya Joo Kim was a shot behind the two leaders heading to her final hole, but took bogey on the 18th to finish with a 67.  The group at 68 included Ariya Jutanugarn, Hye-Jin Choi, Carlotta Ciganda, Manon De Roey and Brooke Matthews. Lucy Li also was 4-under par through 14 when play was suspended, Among those unable to complete the round were Lexi Thompson, who retired from full-time tour golf last year, and LPGA rookie Ingrid Lindblad of Sweden, who won last week in Los Angeles in her third start as an LPGA Tour member.  
        
     Thompson was at 1-over par with her final hole, the ninth, remaining. Lindblad was at 2-over par with her last hole, the 18th, to play. Lindblad had a triple-bogey 7 on the par-4 14th.  Ryu, with two career LPGA Tour victories, changed putters midway through last weeks tournament in Los Angeles, liked how it felt and continued with it in Texas. Ryu said she was more comfortable on the greens. She often opened the face with her former putter, Ryu explained, and was happy to make several tricky putts in her round. Its really good for me, she said.  Liu, seeking her first LPGA Tour win, was not happy with her performance off the tee in Los Angeles last week and worked to get it corrected. This week, I fixed my driver, so it feels very solid, she said.  Little was solid for Korda, who began her season with a pair of top 10 finishes, but has not been as crisp as a year ago when she won seven events and was the Rolex Player of the Year.  When Korda walked off the 18th green following her round, she told a small group of media that she was headed back to work.  Im going to go and practice and see where it takes me, she said.  Korda is seeking her third career major.  ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/lpga-chevron-major-ryu-liu-korda-22b781227bcf6e6a75df519e449ccca0,sports
Masters champion Rory McIlory and teammate Shane Lowry 6 back in Zurich Classic title defense,"AVONDALE, La.

The teams will play alternate shot Friday, better ball Saturday and alternate shot Sunday. A large gallery gathered on the 10th tee at TPC of Louisiana before 8 a.m. to see McIlroy. Shaking off an early-week illness, he provided a few highlights after a relatively slow start. It was brilliant to see so many people out there on a Tuesday morning, McIlroy said. Its always nice to play in front of a supportive, enthusiastic crowed and looking forward to doing more of that over the next few days. Lowry carried the team early, birdieing three of the first holes after their back-nine start and adding another on the par-5 18th. McIlroys first birdie came on a nearly 20-foot putt on No. 1, which he celebrated with a light-hearted fist-pump. McIlroy followed that with an eagle on the par-5 second hole, hitting a 6-iron from 204 yards to 5 feet to get to 8 under. They added a birdie on the fourth but both pulled tee shots left in the water on No. 6 and both made bogey. McIlroy settled for birdie on the par-5 seventh after narrowly missing a 20-foot eagle putt. 
        
     I think sometimes every par you make feels like a bogey on these sorts of days, but then again, you have to remember that tomorrow and Sunday (alternate shot) are the important days, and if you can shoot good scores on those days, you can move up the board pretty quickly, McIlroy said. Salinda and Velo played the front nine in 10 under, with Salindas eagle on No. 7 and eight birdies. They added four birdies on the back nine, but parred three of the last four. Very easy to play when golf when you have a partner thats stacking it and making a lot of putts, Velo said. A few really clutch par saves that he had on the back nine, and it was a very, very solid day. Collin Morikawa and Kurt Kitayama were tied for third at 61 with the teams of Cam Davis-Adam Svensson, Paul Peterson-Thomas Rosenmueller and Kris Ventura-Antoine Rozner. Adam Schenk had an albatross on the seventh, holing out from 231 yards. Schenk and Tyler Duncan shot 63. Yannik and Jeremy Paul of Germany, the other identical twins in the field, shot 67. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/zurich-classic-rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-87a6df74cf3a7b44eae88a3bb9246d3d,sports
PGA Tour rookies Isaiah Salinda and Kevin Velo remain atop Zurich Classic leaderboard,"AVONDALE, La. (AP)  PGA Tour rookies Isaiah Salinda and Kevin Velo shot a 3-under 69 in alternate-shot play Friday to remain atop the leaderboard in the Zurich Classic, and leave defending champions Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry six strokes back. Salinda and Velo had a 17-under 127 at the breezy TPC of Louisiana after breaking the tournament better-ball record with a 58 on Thursday in the tours only team event. Andrew Novak and Ben Griffin were a stroke back after a 66. Overall, really solid, Velo said. I think we played really to our strengths today. We both missed a couple short ones that kind of led to our bogeys, but besides that, we played pretty flawless. We feed off each other really easily, and I know how to club off him, and were talking through shots out there. The teams will play better ball Saturday and alternate shot Sunday. Tomorrow, we just keep playing how were playing, set ourselves up for Sunday and give ourselves a shot, Salinda said. I think alternate shot is kind of our strength. Playing the back nine first, Salinda and Velo made the turn at 1 over, then rallied with four birdies on the easier front nine. Novak is coming off a playoff loss last week to Justin Thomas in the RBC Heritage, his second straight top-three finish. There was really only one hole out there I felt like we were in trouble at any point really, Novak said. Our short games kind of take care of a lot of missteps. But a lot of good putting, and seven birdies today. Thats really strong for alternate shot. 
        
     McIlroy, making his first start since winning the Masters, and Lowry were tied for 16th at 11 under after a 69. The Irish stars eagled the par-5 second and played the first 12 holes in 6 under. They were 3 over on the last six, dropping strokes on the par-4 13th, par-3 17th and par-5 18th. Danish identical twins Nicolai and Rasmus Holgaard were third at 15 under after a 70. They shot 59 on Thursday. Jacob Bridgeman and Chandler Phillips had a 68 to get to 14 under. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/zurich-classic-pga-tour-3d823f95ece9e840d7fe15c47fe02206,sports
Businessman who scammed ex-NBA star Dwight Howard in fake bid for WNBA team gets 12 years in prison,"NEW YORK (AP)  A Georgia businessman who scammed former NBA players Dwight Howard and Chandler Parsons out of millions of dollars was sentenced Thursday to more than 12 years in federal prison. A Manhattan jury in October convicted Calvin Darden Jr. of cheating Howard  who had been one of the NBAs most dominant players in his prime  out of $7 million in a bogus scheme to buy the WNBAs Atlanta Dream.  The 50-year-old Atlanta resident was also found guilty of bilking $1 million from former NBA forward Chandler Parsons in a separate ruse involving the development of then-NBA prospect James Wiseman.  A Manhattan federal court judge on Thursday ordered Darden to forfeit $8 million, as well as several luxury items he acquired with the ill-gotten gains, including a $3.7 million Atlanta mansion, $600,000 in artwork by Jean-Michel Basquiat, a Lamborghini and a Rolls-Royce.  Lawyers for Darden, who wasnt present in court when the sentence was handed down, declined comment. Darden was allowed to the leave the proceedings after waiving his right to be present and telling the judge he had suffered a concussion last week while in custody, according to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Howard testified during the trial that Darden fooled him into giving him $7 million by convincing him that it was an investment toward the purchase of the Dream.  
        
     But the eight-time All-Star and three-time NBA defensive player of the year acknowledged he only learned he wasnt an owner of the Dream when ESPN reported the team had been sold to an investor group that included former Dream guard Renee Montgomery in 2021. Prosecutors said Darden and a sports agent also conned Parsons into sending $1 million that was supposed to aid in the development of James Wiseman, who was drafted by the Golden State Warriors as the second overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft. But the two didnt know Wiseman, and the player never agreed to be represented by the agent as they claimed to Parsons. Wiseman last played for the Indiana Pacers before being traded to the Toronto Raptors, who waived him earlier this year. Darden was ultimately convicted by a jury in October of wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering charges. He was previously sentenced to a year in federal prison in New York for impersonating his father, Cal Darden, a former executive at Atlanta-based United Parcel Service, in a failed bid to buy Maxim magazine. Howard played for seven franchises after the Orlando Magic took him with the No. 1 overall selection in the 2004 draft. He won his lone NBA title with the Los Angeles Lakers during the pandemic-affected 2019-20 season.  Parsons had a nine-year NBA career playing for Houston, Dallas, Memphis and Atlanta teams.  The Atlanta Dream were once co-owned by former Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, but she was pressured to sell after clashing with players over her opposition to the leagues racial justice initiatives.",https://apnews.com/article/nba-dwight-howard-wnba-atlanta-dream-scam-86e260e5bf84aa13c09186627171ef1e,sports
Yelich homers and Myers takes a step forward in Brewers 5-1 victory over Astros,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Christian Yelich hit a two-run homer, Tobias Myers pitched 5 1/3 strong innings and the Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Houston Astros 5-1 on Monday night. Myers (1-0) received an early hook in his last start, working just two innings before departing with the score tied at 2 in a game the Brewers eventually won 6-4 over the Chicago White Sox. He was much sharper Monday. Myers carried a shutout into the sixth inning and ended up allowing six hits and one run. He struck out two and walked none. Milwaukee broke a scoreless tie by getting three runs in the third inning. Joey Ortiz hit a leadoff double and came home on William Contreras two-out single. Yelich followed by connecting on a 2-2 pitch and delivering a 413-foot shot over the wall in right-center. Yelichs homer came in his 1,500th career game and occurred one day after he broke out of an 0-for-19 slump. Houstons Ronel Blanco (2-3) allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings. He struck out six and walked two. Milwaukee added two runs off Bennett Sousa in the eighth. Rhys Hoskins hit an RBI double before Jake Bauers singled him home. The Astros played a third straight game without three-time All-Star Yordan Alvarez, who went on the injured list Monday with inflammation in his right hand.  The Astros cut Milwaukees lead to 3-1 and had the bases loaded with one out in the sixth when Nick Mears came out of the bullpen to relieve Myers. Mears got out of the jam by striking out Zach Dezenzo and retiring Jake Meyers on a grounder to the left side of the infield. 
        
     Milwaukees Vinny Capra snapped an 0-for-36 slump by hitting a single in the eighth. It was Capras first hit since April 2. This three-game series continues Tuesday with a matchup of right-handers as Hayden Wesneski (1-2, 3.86 ERA) starts for the Astros and Chad Patrick (1-3, 2.87) pitches for the Brewers. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/astros-brewers-score-ff7f8bf5500b5dc1d5bce435cfcc1235,sports
Ian Happ homers as the Cubs beat the sloppy Giants 9-2,"CHICAGO (AP)  Ian Happ homered and drove in three runs, helping Matthew Boyd and the Chicago Cubs beat the sloppy San Francisco Giants 9-2 on Monday night. Carson Kelly also went deep, sparking Chicagos five-run sixth inning with a leadoff drive for his eighth homer. Happ added a sacrifice fly and Seiya Suzuki singled in two more runs in the decisive outburst. Boyd (3-2) pitched six innings of two-run ball as the NL Central leaders won for the fourth time in five games. The left-hander struck out seven and walked none. San Francisco shortstop Willy Adames and five-time Gold Glove third baseman Matt Chapman each committed two errors, contributing to six unearned runs for Chicago in the opener of a three-game set. Luis Matos hit a tying two-run homer for the Giants in the fourth, but the Cubs responded with two runs in the bottom half. Landen Roupp (2-3) struck out the first two batters before Pete Crow-Armstrong reached on an error on Chapman. Nico Hoerner then singled and swiped second ahead of Dansby Swansons two-run single to left. Swanson had three hits and scored twice. He is batting .462 (12 for 26) during a seven-game hitting streak. Kyle Tuckers sixth-inning walk loaded the bases before Suzuki greeted Spencer Bivens with a grounder into left field, driving in Swanson and Nicky Lopez for a 9-2 lead. Boyd has allowed three earned runs or fewer in each of his seven starts this season. Justin Verlander (0-2, 4.38 ERA) starts for San Francisco on Tuesday, and Colin Rea (2-0, 1.46 ERA) pitches for Chicago. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/giants-cubs-score-1fcd4b75838004ca4725771e82836efc,sports

Contreras homer sparks Cardinals over Pirates 6-3,"ST. LOUIS (AP)  Willson Contreras hit a go-ahead home run in a four-run sixth inning and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-3 on Monday night for their third straight victory. Contreras fifth home run came off Pirates reliever Chase Shugart, who walked Nolan Arenado after coming in with the bases empty, one out and a 3-2 lead. Jose Barrero, who hit his first homer as a Cardinal earlier, added a bases-loaded ground-rule double off Shugart for a 6-3 lead. Oneil Cruz beat out a high hopper to Cardinals starter Miles Mikola leading off the first and Bryan Reynolds followed with his fifth home run for a 2-0 lead. Barrero led off the third with a solo shot off Pirates starter Carmen Mlodzinski, and Alec Burleson followed with his second homer in as many games to tie it 2-all. Burlesons homer went 435 feet  the longest by a Cardinal this season. Joey Bart drew a leadoff walk in the fourth and scored on a hit by Adam Frazier to put the Pirates ahead. Mikolas allowed three runs on four hits in five innings. Gordon Graceffo (2-0) pitched the sixth for the win. Ryan Helsley notched his sixth save. Mlodzinski allowed four hits and two runs in 4 2/3 innings. Shugart (1-2) gave up four runs on five hits and didnt record an out. The Cardinals (17-19) swept a doubleheader with the Mets on Sunday after winning two against the Reds on Wednesday. The Pirates (12-24) have lost five in a row and 8 of 9. 
        
     Helsey struck out Reynolds looking with runners on second and third to end it.  Cruz was hit by a pitch leading off the third before being thrown out by Pedro Pags trying to steal, ending a run of 35 successful attempts including 15 this season.

Machado and Bogaerts lead 8th-inning rally as Padres beat Yankees 4-3 for 6th straight win,"NEW YORK (AP)  Manny Machado hit a two-run double and Xander Bogaerts followed with a two-run single in an eighth-inning comeback against Devin Williams and Luke Weaver, and the San Diego Padres rallied past the New York Yankees 4-3 on a soggy Monday night for their sixth straight win. Carlos Rodn allowed three hits in 6 2/3 scoreless innings, leaving with a 3-0 lead. San Diego loaded the bases with two walks and a hit off Williams, who had three hitless outings after being dropped as closer but faltered in his fourth. Weaver (0-1) gave up two-out hits to Machado and Bogaerts as the Yankees lost their third game in a row. Padres manager Mike Shildt and Fernando Tatis Jr. were ejected during the rally by plate umpire Adrian Johnson. Tatis said something when he struck out swinging, a pitch after a called second strike at the bottom of the zone. Tossed for the 15th time in his managerial career, Shildt threw his lineup card and glasses while arguing. Ryan Bergert (1-0) earned his first major league win with a hitless seventh and Robert Suarez struck out two in a perfect ninth for his major league-high 14th save. The game started 28 minutes late because of rain and was interrupted by another 28-minute delay with two outs in the bottom of the fourth. Trent Grisham matched his 2024 total with his ninth home run, a two-run drive in the third off Padres starter Nick Pivetta, and Anthony Volpe hit a sacrifice fly for the Yankees after missing one game because of a left shoulder injury.  
        
     Cleanup hitters were 0 for 17 with six strikeouts against Pivetta this year before Paul Goldschmidts sixth-inning single. Aaron Judge walked in the first, extending his on-base streak to 31 games. He went 0 for 3, ending a 14-game hitting streak that matched his career high and dropping his big league-leading batting average to .414. Weaver had not allowed a run in 13 previous outings this year when he entered. Rodn and Max Fried have combined to go 10-3 with a 2.03 ERA while other Yankees starters are 3-6 with a 6.02 ERA.

Braves rookie AJ Smith-Shawver takes no-hit bid into 8th inning against Reds,"ATLANTA (AP)  AJ Smith-Shawver was rolling right along when he realized his Atlanta Braves teammates were beginning to avoid him. They had a good reason. The 22-year-old rookie right-hander hadnt given up a hit against the Cincinnati Reds  and the rest of the Braves didnt want to jinx him. After pitching into the eighth inning for the first time as a professional, Smith-Shawver wasnt quite able to complete the no-hitter Monday night in his 11th major league start  and 70th overall since getting drafted in 2021. But his only blemish in a 4-0 win was Santiago Espinals sharp single to center field leading off the eighth. I probably started like really kind of noticing in the fifth, and everybody really got away from me sixth and seventh. And I was like, OK, this is real, Smith-Shawver said. Just trying to go out there and execute pitches, just do the same thing Ive been doing, but just with a little bit more adrenaline. Braves fans gave Smith-Shawver a nice ovation after he gave up the hit, and another when he walked off the field after inducing a double play to end the eighth on his 99th and final pitch. It was just, like, one of those feelings. Thats what you kind of dream about as a kid, just going out there and playing the game you love, Smith-Shawver said. So, I mean, Im just trying to take it all in right now. There were also the congratulations and hugs from his teammates in the dugout  all with a big smile on his face.  
        
     It means everything. Whenever the guys in the clubhouse are believing in you and they want you to take the ball and go win games, I feel like, as a pitcher, thats your ultimate goal, Smith-Shawver said. You want those guys to trust you and know what theyre going to get out of you every night. Enyel De Los Santos issued a walk in the ninth before finishing the one-hitter for Atlantas second shutout of the year. But the story on this night was Smith-Shawver. The biggest thing I told him is, `You discovered your fastball again. Because it was really good. They werent taking real good swings at it, Braves manager Brian Snitker said. I told him, too, that I was prepared to let him go for a little bit to try and get (the no-hitter) if it continued on. I could tell, I dont know, probably in the seventh, I said, He knows whats going on. Because he had a couple of reactions when that inning was over that he knew he was nearing something which is so hard to do. Smith-Shawver (2-2), who was trying for the first no-hitter in the majors this season, struck five and walked four. He was a high school teammate of Kansas City star shortstop Bobby Witt Jr.  they won a state championship together at Colleyville-Heritage High School in Texas in 2019, when Smith-Shawver was a sophomore and Witt was a senior before becoming the No. 2 pick in that summers MLB draft.  It was Smith-Shawvers fifth start for Atlanta this season, the second since being recalled from the minor leagues, and it came six days after he won at Colorado. He pitched 5 1/3 innings against the Rockies before leaving that game after taking a liner off his right arm.  The Braves havent had a no-hitter since Kent Mercker pitched one at Dodger Stadium on April 8, 1994. They havent thrown one at home since Sept. 11, 1991, when Mercker went the first six innings in a combined no-no with Mark Wohlers (two innings) and Alejandro Pea (one inning) in a 1-0 win against the Padres. Braves shortstop Nick Allen made a nifty play on a hard-hit grounder with one out in the third to keep the latest no-hit bid intact for a while.  All you want as a defender is just to make plays for him, when you kind of look up at the board and youre seeing what youre seeing, no hits or something like that, Allen said. You want to get everything, dive for anything. Unfortunately, they got the one in the eighth. But he threw it so well today, and with conviction. And thats all you can ask for. And when he does that, I mean, look what happens. Smith-Shawver walked two batters in the first before striking out Spencer Steer to end the inning. He also issued two walks with two outs in the fourth, then retired the next 10 batters before Espinals hit.  I feel like I used my heater pretty well today. I feel like I had good results on it all day. And then it was curveball-split, Smith-Shawver said. It was really just kind of leaning on that (fastball) and getting myself into good counts and getting myself out of bad counts. But I thought everything was kind of working today. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/aj-smithshawver-braves-nohitter-8b6b3d59410b8564d7c836728501e207,sports

Mikaela Jaworski to oversee Brisbane 2032 Olympics planning for the IOC,"BRISBANE, Australia (AP)  Mikaela Cojuangco Jaworski has been elevated to lead the IOCs coordination commission for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics and will get her first on-the-ground planning update  from local organizers later this month. Jaworski, a former actress who competed in equestrian for Philippines, was selected as 2032 commission chair on Monday to replace Kirsty Coventry, a gold medal-winning swimmer from Zimbabwe set to take over as president of the International Olympic Committee next month. Andrew Liveris, president of the local organizing committee, said he welcomed a May 20-22 visit by the IOC leadership as our attention shifts from strategy to planning and eventually delivery of our Games in 2032. Jaworski trained in Australia over 20 years, working with three-time Olympian Vicki Roycroft.  Mikaela has a deep understanding and history of time in Australia ... and has been a positive and supportive voice as part of Brisbane 2032s co-ordination commission since its formation, Liveris said Tuesday. I look forward to welcoming Mikaela and our co-ordination commission to Brisbane this month for our first in-country meeting and the chance to provide detailed updates on our progress. Jaworski, an Asian Games gold medalist in 2002, joined the IOCs executive board in 2020 and has been on the coordination commission commissions for the Tokyo, Paris and Brisbane Games. She is now expected to oversee the planning and delivery of the Brisbane Olympics on behalf of the IOC, working with local organizers and international sports federations. 
        
     In March, the Queensland government unveiled a major overhaul of venue planning more than 1,300 days after the state capital was awarded the 2032 Summer Games. It included a new main stadium, a sailing venue in the Whitsunday islands and rowing in a crocodile-inhabited river in Rockhampton.

"Lindor and Alonso go deep for the Mets, who hold on late for a 5-4 win over the Diamondbacks","PHOENIX (AP)  Francisco Lindor hit a three-run homer, Pete Alonso launched a two-run shot and the New York Mets held on late to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-4 on Monday night. Lindor turned on a slider from Ryan Thompson in the seventh inning, driving it over the right-center fence for what looked like a comfortable 5-1 lead.  But the D-backs closed the gap in the eighth, loading the bases with no outs when reliever Dedniel Nez walked three straight batters in his first major league outing this season after coming off the injured list. Reed Garrett entered and struck out Pavin Smith, but Josh Naylors single made it 5-2 and Eugenio Suarez followed with a two-run single off the center-field wall that cut the margin to 5-4. With the potential tying run on second and the go-ahead run on first, Garrett struck out Gabriel Moreno and retired Lourdes Gurriel Jr. on a foul popup to end the inning. Arizona threatened again in the ninth against closer Edwin Daz when Alek Thomas reached on Alonsos throwing error at first base. But catcher Francisco Alvarez caught Thomas trying to steal second with the help of a sensational tag by Lindor, and Daz retired Geraldo Perdomo and Corbin Carroll for his eighth save. Alonsos two-run homer in the fourth  his 10th of the season  was a no-doubter, traveling 425 feet deep into the left-field stands to give New York a 2-1 advantage. 
        
     Griffin Canning (5-1) gave up one run and six hits over five innings, becoming the first Mets pitcher to win five straight starts since Zack Wheeler in 2018. He struck out six. Carroll hit a leadoff homer to give the D-backs a 1-0 lead. Ryne Nelson (1-1) allowed two runs and three hits over 4 1/3 innings in his first start of the season. Garrett permitted two sharp hits in the eighth, but was ultimately able to clean up Nezs mess and preserve a 5-4 lead. Lindor loves playing in Arizona. He came into Mondays game with a .364 batting average, three homers, five doubles, three triples and seven RBIs in 15 games at Chase Field.

Quite a spectacle: Padres manager Mike Shildt got so mad he threw his glasses at Yankee Stadium,"NEW YORK (AP)  Mike Shildt had seen enough, and he was so angry with plate umpire Adrian Johnson that he made a spectacle by tossing his spectacles. A tantrum by San Diegos manager following the first major league ejection of star slugger Fernando Tatis Jr. fired up the Padres, who overcame a three-run deficit in the eighth inning to beat the New York Yankees 4-3 on a soggy Monday night and extend their winning streak to six. Shilty came down the tunnel and he was still chirping, said Xander Bogaerts, who hit a go-ahead, two-run single off Luke Weaver that followed Manny Machados two-run double. I think he was ready to fight. Tatis was ejected after a strikeout, causing Shildt to rush out onto the field, throwing his lineup card and then his glasses. He argued so vociferously with Johnson and first base ump Quinn Wolcott that third base coach Tim Leiper ran over in case intervention was needed. My glasses made it. I did have my head about me to make sure, Shildt said after the game. I got some  a lot of BPs on my shoulders  not as operable as Id like but it came into play, and I made sure it stayed in the grass. I didnt want them scratched. I like these glasses a lot. Devin Williams entered with a 3-0 lead and walked Tyler Wade with one out in the eighth, then allowed a single to Brandon Lockridge. Williams threw four straight changeups, his famous Airbender, to Tatis. The two-time All-Star took the third at the bottom of the strike zone for strike two, then swung over an even lower pitch. 
        
     He said something in Johnsons left ear before taking a turn to the dugout and was immediately tossed. Tatis said it was his first ejection since winter ball as an 18-year-old. Ah, what did I say? I forgot, Tatis said, laughing. Im just happy I got the boys hyped. Id just been complaining all game. It was a rough night, he added. After the strikeout I just let him know what I thought. San Diegos players were invigorated by the emotion. You can feel it. Its energy, Wade said. Three-time batting champion Luis Arraez then walked on four straight fastballs. Tatis made me hot, Arraez said. I love Mike Shildt. He supports his players, and when I saw that thing, I said: `We come back! Yankees manager Aaron Boone brought in Weaver, who had not allowed a run in 13 prior appearances this year. Machado doubled on a 1-1 fastball, cutting the deficit to 3-2, and Bogaerts singled on a first-pitch cutter. Tati had some pitches that (he) didnt agree with  I didnt agree with earlier and made my comments from the dugout known, which I dont do a ton, Shildt said. Did it. Walks away, hand over his mouth, and next thing you know hes ejected walking away with his back turned for his first major league ejection. Shildts ejection was the 15th of his six-season big league managerial career. I probably have the fewest amount of player ejections in my time managing, so our players play, they stay in the game, theyre very respectful, rightfully so, to the umpires, he said. Ill let the body of the work for the umpire grade speak for itself, and well leave it at that. A two-time All-Star acquired from Milwaukee in December, Williams has a 10.03 ERA in 14 games with the Yankees, walking 10 in 11 2/3 innings. On a night with near-constant rain that caused a pair of 28-minute delays, Williams said he had trouble with his landing spot. I couldnt figure it out with the release point on my fastball, he said. He had pitched three hitless innings in his three prior appearances since losing his closer role and felt he had turned around his season. I feel like I still have, he said. Yankees fans booed Williams as soon as he fell behind hitters. Its part of the business. Its part of being in New York, said starter Carlos Rodn, booed during a poor first season with the Yankees in 2023. If you dont pitch well, youre going to be get booed but if you pitch well, theyre going to praise you. Theyre going to love you. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/tatis-shildt-glasses-padres-ejections-yankees-f5fe7d6d15190e499e9a7adda0cdbe9e,sports

Wilson comes up clutch again as Athletics edge Mariners 7-6 in 11 innings,"WEST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Jacob Wilson singled home the winning run in the 11th inning to give the Athletics a 7-6 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Monday night in the opener of a three-game series between the top two teams in the AL West. Wilson finished with three hits and three RBIs, including a tying single against Mariners closer Andrs Muoz leading off the 10th that scored automatic runner JJ Bleday. The Athletics then loaded the bases with nobody out, but Muoz struck out the next three batters and still has not allowed an earned run this season. One inning later, a sacrifice bunt by Gio Urshela and two intentional walks loaded the bases for Wilson. He smacked a one-out single off Casey Legumina (2-1) through the middle of a drawn-in infield as the Athletics pulled within a game of the first-place Mariners. It was Wilsons third walk-off hit in 62 major league games and second this season. Hogan Harris (1-0) got the win with a scoreless 11th. Miguel Andujars sacrifice fly in the first and Wilsons RBI single in the second staked the Athletics to a 2-0 lead. Jorge Polanco, Rowdy Tellez, Miles Mastrobuoni and Ben Williamson each drove in a run in the third off Athletics starter Luis Severino to put Seattle ahead 4-2. Shea Langeliers led off the fourth with his eighth homer and Lawrence Butler tied it with a two-out RBI single. Langeliers sacrifice fly off Collin Snider in the seventh gave the Athletics a 5-4 advantage.

"Texas Rangers hire former All-Star Bret Boone, brother of Yankees manager, as a hitting coach","Former big league All-Star infielder Bret Boone was hired Monday as a hitting coach for the Texas Rangers, who are last in the American League in runs scored. It will be the first time Boone, the 56-year-old older brother of New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone, is on a major league coaching staff. Bret Boone will join the Rangers on Tuesday for the opener of their three-game series in Boston. Boones hiring came a day after Texas fired offensive coordinator Donnie Ecker.  Chris Young, the Rangers president of baseball operations, said Boone will work with hitting coach Justin Viele and assistant hitting coach Seth Conner, who both remain on manager Bruce Bochys staff. Brett is obviously someone who has a significant major league pedigree as a player, somebody whos well connected to the game through his family, Young said before adding he has known Bret Boone for a long time. Embodies a lot of the characteristics that will make a successful coach and thats what our players need right now. In 14 big league seasons as player, Boone was a three-time All-Star and hit .266 with 252 homers and 1,021 RBIs in 1,780 games from 1992-2005 for five teams: Seattle, Cincinnati, Atlanta, San Diego and Minnesota. His only season with the Padres was in 2000, when his manager was Bochy. Boone, whose grandfather Ray and dad Bob were also big league players, retired as a player while with Triple-A Columbus in the Washington Nationals system in 2008, and was a roving instructor and scout in the Athletics organization from 2014-15. He had since been involved in several business ventures, most recently a podcast focused on baseball topics.  
        
     If there is one guy to get back on the field for the first time in a long time for me, its Bruce Bochy, Boone said on his podcast Monday when announcing that he was joining the Rangers.  Texas (17-18) had a day off Monday after an 8-1 win at home in its series finale against AL West-leading Seattle on Sunday. Even with that outburst, the Rangers were last in the AL with 113 runs (3.2 per game). They lost 13-1 and 2-1 in the first two games of that series. Before the win over the Mariners, the Rangers had scored just 30 runs during a 2-9 stretch, and half of those came when they finished with a season-high 15 runs against Oakland on Tuesday.  Ecker was in his fourth season as the clubs offensive coordinator after being hired on Nov. 1, 2021. He helped the Rangers win their only World Series title in 2023. The Rangers led the AL during their championship season, hitting .263 with 5.4 runs per game before slipping to .238 and scoring 4.2 runs a game last year. They are now hitting .228 and have scored no more than two runs in nine of their last 12 games. Young said Boones initial contract runs through the end of this season, though that doesnt mean he wont stay longer.  Given just the timing of this, we really focused on getting through the end of the year and what our goals are, where we are as an organization, getting to the end of the year and re-evaluating, Young said. And for Bret, too, having the flexibility for him to re-evaluate and see if he likes this as well. Both sides were comfortable with the term. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-mlb-hitting-coach-boone-1e27262222d38b67a4513bf46b94aacb,sports
Cubs put lefty Shota Imanaga on injured list after he got hurt going to cover first base,"CHICAGO (AP)  The Chicago Cubs placed Shota Imanaga on the 15-day injured list on Monday in another blow to an already depleted rotation for the NL Central leaders. Imanaga, 31, strained his left hamstring when he went to cover first base in the sixth inning of Sundays 4-0 loss at Milwaukee. The Japanese left-hander has been one of the teams most reliable starters since he signed a $53 million, four-year contract with Chicago in January 2024. Imanaga had some imaging done, and he met with team physician Dr. Stephen Gryzlo on Monday night. Hes presenting to the doctor like with a very mild hamstring strain, manager Craig Counsell said after Chicagos 9-2 victory over San Francisco. So that makes us optimistic. I think its probable were going to be past two weeks here, because were going to be cautious and make sure that hes back to 100%. But, all in all, pretty good news. Right-hander Gavin Hollowell was recalled from Triple-A Iowa. Hollowell, 27, threw two scoreless innings in the victory over the Giants. Imanagas injury creates another hole in Chicagos rotation. Left-hander Justin Steele is out for the season with an elbow injury, and right-hander Javier Assad has an oblique issue. Imanaga pitched five-plus innings in his previous start at Pittsburgh before departing because of leg cramps. He is 3-2 with a 2.82 ERA in eight starts. Youre always building depth and youre always dealing with injuries, president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer said. You always hope its not one of your best players, best pitchers, but thats what happens. Hopefully we can figure out when we can get him back and get him back healthy. But we just got to step up. No ones going to pause for us. 
        
     Imanaga got hurt while covering first on a potential double play against the Brewers. He was in clear discomfort as he headed toward the bag. After the runner beat the throw to first, the pitcher grabbed the back of his left leg. Imanaga said he had never had this kind of injury before. I think thats the challenge is, with guys that have done those injuries before, they usually give you a better sense of how it feels compared to other times, Hoyer said. And he says hes never been through this so a little bit of something new. But well have to figure it out. The Cubs have some options when it comes to replacing Imanaga in the rotation, along with some flexibility because of their upcoming schedule. They are off Thursday each of the next four weeks. Cade Horton, one of their top prospects, is 2-1 with a 1.24 ERA in six starts for Iowa. The right-hander pitched six innings of one-run ball against Buffalo on Sunday. The Cubs also have veteran right-hander Chris Flexen, who has 110 career starts in the majors. Imanagas slot in the rotation comes up again on Saturday at the New York Mets. I think we have options of how we decide to do that day, Counsell said before the victory over San Francisco. Imanaga went 15-3 with a 2.91 ERA in 29 starts last year, striking out 174 in 173 1/3 innings. He made the NL All-Star team and finished fourth in balloting for the NL Rookie of the Year. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/cubs-mlb-imanaga-a279cfcfac8b95701b50692322cab04b,sports
Police charge 2nd suspect with murder in the death of a Super Bowl reporter at his hotel,"Louisiana authorities on Monday charged a second suspect with murder in the death of a television reporter who had traveled to New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl. Adan Manzano, a 27-year-old reporter and anchor for Telemundo based in Kansas City, Missouri, was found dead Feb. 5 in his hotel room in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner. A woman seen on security video leaving Manzanos room was later charged with second-degree murder and with stealing his credit cards and cellphone. Kenner police announced Monday that an accomplice, 34-year-old Rickey White, has also been charged with second-degree murder. White was arrested in Florida in March on robbery and fraud charges related to Manzanos death, then extradited to Louisiana. Kenner police said in a news release that the murder charge against White resulted from continued investigative efforts, but officials gave no further details.  Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said at a news conference March 18 that investigators had linked White to Danette Colbert, the first suspect charged in the case, based on correspondence and information where they were going back and forth. So we think they were working hand-in-hand in concert with each other. An attorney for White, Kevin Boshea, said he hadnt been informed of the murder charge before an Associated Press reporter called him Monday.  I dont think hes guilty of the other crimes, Boshea said, so how can he be guilty of murder? 
        
     Boshea said he pressed police during a preliminary hearing on the robbery and fraud charges last month to show evidence that White was in the New Orleans area when Manzano died, but they presented none. An attorney for Colbert had said that police were making assumptions and guesses to link her to Manzanos death.  Under Louisiana law, a defendant can be charged with second-degree murder for distributing drugs that cause a death or for committing certain crimes, including robbery, that result in someone dying. An autopsy found Manzano died lying facedown on a pillow and unable to breathe after ingesting a combination of alcohol and the depressant Xanax, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerry Cvitanovich told reporters in March. Police said security video from Manzanos hotel showed him and Colbert entering his room together the day of his death. Footage showed Colbert leaving without him about an hour later. Authorities have said Colbert later used Manzanos credit card to make a purchase at a New Orleans gas station and at several stores in the area. Police have also said Manzanos medical records showed no prescriptions for Xanax or other depressants, and that they recovered the drug from Colberts home. ___ Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia.",https://apnews.com/article/super-bowl-reporter-death-new-orleans-telemundo-501e4b2a94548465102c63631a9dccb1,sports

NCAA vice president of external affairs Tim Buckley said the NCAA would not comment on the litigation while negotiations are ongoing. Wilken looked favorably on other key components of the settlement  namely, the up to $20.5 million some schools can pay their athletes for name, image likeness (NIL) deals and the nearly $2.8 billion in back pay that will go to players who said the NCAA and five biggest conferences wrongly kept them from earning NIL money. But she asked lawyers to rework the part of the deal that will replace scholarship limits with roster limits. Its a proposal that could make more overall scholarship money available but could cost thousands of athletes their spots on rosters in moves that began shortly after Wilken gave preliminary approval to the deal last fall. 
        
     The NCAAs first response to Wilkens request  which included the idea of grandfathering in current players to their roster spots  was to change nothing, arguing that undoing roster moves already in play would create more turmoil in an already chaotic process. Wilken wasnt moved, saying in her April 24 order that any disruption that may occur is a problem of Defendants and NCAA members schools own making. Berman acknowledged that the objectors likely wouldnt approve of the new deal being worked on. But I dont think its going to be a big deal, he said, because it is designed to find roster spots for virtually all the individual athletes who objected. Berman also criticized Nick Saban after reports emerged that the retired Alabama football coach was urging President Donald Trump to undo damage he says has been caused by all the money flowing into college sports. The Wall Street Journal reported Trump is considering an executive order that would call for some sort of structure behind NIL compensation now going toward players who are now able to move more freely between schools. Berman said he believes an executive order would be subject to lawsuits like there are against so many of his other orders. But here, the question is, Why does the president need to get involved? Berman said, while outlining the financial gains players have made in the NIL era. Just because Nick Saban thinks he knows better and resents change? This is a coach who made more money off college football than any other coach, did absolutely nothing to make it right for these student-athletes. Why should he drive the presidents thinking? Saban, who made more than $11 million in his last year at Alabama and who some have said should become the commissioner of college football  a position that doesnt exist  has said he isnt completely against players making money. But he has argued for rules and laws to keep things from looking like the pay for play model that the NCAA hopes to avoid but that is often what NIL payments look like. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",https://apnews.com/article/ncaa-house-settlement-saban-trump-f14c384b5aceba35b567e1daeb3e2f76,sports
Padres All-Star center fielder Jackson Merrill set to return Tuesday from strained hamstring,"NEW YORK (AP)  All-Star center fielder Jackson Merrill is set to return to the San Diego Padres active roster Tuesday from a strained right hamstring that has sidelined him since April 6. Merrill played a pair of injury rehabilitation games for Double-A San Antonio last weekend and was at Yankee Stadium on Monday for the Padres series opener against New York. San Diego had not yet activated him from the 10-day injured list. Scheduled day off today to recover from a couple of games but, yeah, so hes on track for tomorrow, Padres manager Mike Shildt said. Just a very professional rehab. He dominated every day in what he was able to do. Merrill was hitting .378 (14 for 37) with three homers and 10 RBIs through eight games. After finishing second to Pittsburgh pitcher Paul Skenes in last seasons NL Rookie of the Year voting, Merrill agreed on April 2 to a $135 million, nine-year contract for 2026-34. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com",https://apnews.com/article/jackson-merrill-padres-hamstring-c1bd3b6f307d8dd9a0e92a277aa4869a,sports
SafeSport Center to Grassley: Should have been additional scrutiny on ex-cops hiring,"The top lawyer for the U.S. Center for SafeSport wrote to Sen. Chuck Grassley that there should have been additional scrutiny when the center learned a vice cop it was considering hiring as an investigator had been subject to an internal investigation at his last job.  The center ended up hiring Jason Krasley, who was later charged with rape and other felonies from episodes that happened when he worked as an officer in Allentown, Pennsylvania. About 2 1/2 years after bringing him on, the center fired Krasley when it learned of his arrest for allegedly stealing money seized in a drug sting he participated in while with the force. The Krasley affair led to the centers CEO, JuRiese Colon, losing her job two weeks ago. It was general connsel Jessica Perrill who responded last week to a letter originally directed to Colon from Grassley, R-Iowa. Among Grassleys questions were why the center hired the former cop knowing he was subject of an internal investigation.  There should have been additional scrutiny into the concerning statements by the reference, which would prompt additional scrutiny today, Perrill wrote. Unfortunately, we have been unable to find any evidence of further inquiry by the Center into the internal investigation. Perrill referenced a letter sent March 14 by Colon to Grassley that outlined stronger hiring policies the center has implemented in the wake of Krasleys arrest.  
        
     They include enhanced reference checks and access to the National Decertification Index, which keeps track of officers who have been sanctioned because of misconduct.  Perrill wrote that the center learned on Sept. 4, 2024, of the 2019 theft allegations against Krasley and others involving harrasment from a separate arrest in June 2024. But, she said, the agency took no action because law enforcement asked the center to not do anything to tip off Krasley about a criminal investigation.  In the two months between learning about the allegations and firing Krasley, Perrill said the center closely monitored Krasleys work. Nothing of concern was observed during this period, Perrill wrote.  ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/safesport-grassley-juriese-colon-1c3e8f23a3a267e5b7245dc29da77c11,sports
"Guardians-Nationals series opener postponed because of rain, twinbill set for Tuesday","WASHINGTON (AP)  The opener of a three-game series between the Cleveland Guardians and Washington Nationals was postponed Monday night because of rain. The game will be made up as part of a traditional doubleheader starting at 3:35 p.m. Tuesday. Right-hander Luis Ortiz (2-3, 4.78 ERA) had been scheduled to start Monday for Cleveland against Washingtons Jake Irvin (2-1, 4.01).  The Guardians said Ortiz will start Tuesdays opener, followed by Ben Lively (1-2, 3.72) in the nightcap. Irvin will pitch Game 1 for the Nationals, with Brad Lord (1-3, 4.43) going in the second game. Both teams simply pushed back their Monday night starters to the opener on Tuesday and kept their scheduled Tuesday night starters unchanged.

Mets DH Jesse Winker expected to miss 6-8 weeks with a Grade 2 oblique injury,"PHOENIX (AP)  New York Mets designated hitter Jesse Winker is expected to miss six to eight weeks with a Grade 2 oblique strain, manager Carlos Mendoza confirmed on Monday. Mendoza also said reliever A.J. Minter will have season-ending surgery next Monday because of a torn lat muscle. Minter had a 1.64 ERA in 13 appearances this season. Infielder Brett Baty will take Winkers spot on the big league roster after being called up from Triple-A Syracuse. Winker left the first game of Sundays doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals because of right side discomfort. He got hurt making a throw to the plate in the third inning during his first start of the season in left field after getting nearly all his playing time this year in a DH platoon with Starling Marte. The 25-year-old Baty hit .204 with one homer and four RBIs for the Mets earlier this season. The fact that he can play some second base, obviously can play third, lefty bat, Mendoza said. He allows me to rotate the DH a little more. The 31-year-old Winker, a left-handed hitter, is batting .239 with one homer and 10 RBIs this season. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-jesse-winker-oblique-injury-e481861159423625940a7ab4e4263da4,sports
Reds rookie Tyler Callihan breaks his forearm trying for catch on inside-the-park homer,"ATLANTA (AP)  Cincinnati Reds rookie left fielder Tyler Callihan broke his left forearm while attempting a sliding catch on a play that turned into an inside-the-park home run Monday night in a 4-0 loss to the Atlanta Braves. Reds manager Terry Francona said Callihan will be sent back to Cincinnati on Tuesday for surgery to set the arm. Hes such a good kid, you feel terrible for him, Francona said. With two outs in the third inning, Callihan was chasing down a flyball from Matt Olson and briefly made the grab before crashing hard into the padded wall in foul territory along the left-field line. After he hit the wall, the ball fell out of Callihans glove as he rolled onto his back in pain and grabbed his left arm. Reds fielders momentarily stopped, unsure if Callihan made the catch or if the ball was foul. Austin Riley scored from first base and Olson circled the bases at half speed, not sure of the ruling. Theres no good way to explain it, Francona said. The kid is running full blast trying to do everything he can to save runs. Reds athletic trainers tended to Callihan, who walked back to the dugout and clubhouse holding his left arm. The play was reviewed and replay confirmed the ball was touched in fair territory and Callihan did not have control of it long enough to constitute a catch. Later in the game, the Reds announced that Callihan has a broken left forearm. He was playing in his fourth major league game after making his debut last week. 
        
     I hate it for the kid, Braves manager Brian Snitker said. Hes just laying it out there for his club. ... Hopefully it is something they can set and heal good and he can get on with his career. Olsons home run gave the Braves a 4-0 lead. Atlanta pitcher AJ Smith-Shawver took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before Santiago Espinal led off with a clean single for Cincinnatis lone hit. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/tyler-callihan-reds-injury-inside-park-33d8791d7ca51abad7f2b6c79b381a8f,sports
Dodgers Teoscar Hernndez will have MRI on Tuesday after leaving vs. Marlins with tight hamstring,"MIAMI (AP)  Los Angeles Dodgers star outfielder Teoscar Hernndez will have an MRI on Tuesday on his left hamstring after he left in the fourth inning of the 7-4 victory against the Miami Marlins on Monday night with tightness in his leg. I got word that it was tight  whether it was a hamstring, abductor, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. Hes a guy that just doesnt come out of games by way of injury. Thats a little concerning, given the person. Hernndez hit an RBI double for the Dodgers first run in the first inning and singled to right in the third. When Hernndez returned to the dugout for the fourth, he was replaced by Chris Taylor. Roberts said Hernndez first experienced tightness after he chased and caught a ball hit in the gap by Javier Sanoja in the third. With the possibility of Hernndez landing on the injured list, Roberts said the team is discussing bringing up a player from the minors. (Tuesday) will be telling, Roberts said. In his second season with the Dodgers, Hernndez began Monday with a team-leading nine homers that was tied after Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run shot in the fifth to give Los Angeles a 5-0 lead against Miami. Hernndez is hitting .315 with 34 RBIs and 10 doubles with a .933 OPS this season.

Braves pitcher AJ Smith-Shawver has no-hit bid vs Reds broken up in 8th inning,"ATLANTA (AP)  AJ Smith-Shawvers bid for a no-hitter was broken up when Santiago Espinal led off the eighth inning with a clean single to center field, giving the Cincinnati Reds their first hit against the Atlanta Braves pitcher Monday night. Espinals base hit came on the 93rd pitch from Smith-Shawver, who worked into the eighth inning for the first time as a professional. Smith-Shawver struck out five and walked four  two in the first inning and two in the fourth. He gave up at least four hits in all four of his previous starts this season. The right-hander got a popup and a double play to end the eighth, then was lifted after 99 pitches with Atlanta leading 4-0.

Ohtani and Freeman homer off Alcntara as Dodgers beat Marlins 7-4,"MIAMI (AP)  Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman homered and the Los Angeles Dodgers roughed up Sandy Alcntara again for a 7-4 win over the Miami Marlins on Monday night. Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernndez each had two hits for the Dodgers, who have won eight of nine and began a 10-game road trip. Hernndez left in the fourth because of tightness in his left hamstring. Manager Dave Roberts said after the game the slugger will have an MRI on Tuesday. In his first major league start, Los Angeles Hyeseong Kim had two hits and drove in a run. Alcntara (2-4) gave up five runs and six hits in five innings six days after the 2022 NL Cy Young Award winner was tagged for seven runs and seven hits in 2 2/3 innings against the defending World Series champions. The Dodgers struck quickly against Alcntara on Hernndezs RBI double in the first. Freeman made it 3-0 with a two-run drive in the third. The 402-foot blast over the wall in center was Freemans 41st career homer against Miami, tying him for first by a Marlins opponent with Ryan Howard and Ryan Zimmerman. Ohtani padded the lead with his two-run blast over the wall in right-center that had an exit velocity of 117.9 mph. Ben Casparius (4-0) relieved Dodgers opener Jack Dreyer with one out in the second and scattered one run over four innings for the win. Rookie Agustin Ramirez hit a three-run homer off Dodgers reliever Yoendrys Gmez in the eighth that cut the Marlins deficit to 7-4. Tanner Scott relieved Gmez and got the last two outs in the eighth before Kirby Yates closed for his first save. 
        
     Kim singled to lead off the fifth for his first major league hit and scored on Ohtanis homer. Ohtani tied Hernndez for the club lead in homers with nine. He now has gone deep four times at loanDepot Park in his last two games, following his three-homer performance last Sept. 19, when the star slugger became the first player to reach 50 home runs and 50 steals in a season. RHP Tony Gonsolin (1-0, 4.50 ERA) will start for the Dodgers on Tuesday, while the Marlins will go with RHP Cal Quantrill (2-3, 8.10).

No guard of honor by Rangers for fierce rival Celtic in 1-1 draw between Scottish rivals,"GLASGOW, Scotland (AP)  Rangers opted against giving a guard of honor for newly crowned Scottish champion Celtic ahead of the 1-1 draw between the fierce Glasgow rivals on Sunday. Celtic was playing for the first time since clinching the Scottish Premiership title last weekend to join Rangers on a national-record 55 championship crowns. Ahead of the game, interim Rangers manager Barry Ferguson had indicated there would be no guard of honor for Celtic, saying it had never happened in the past, and that ended up being the case at Ibrox. The champions were roared onto the field by around 2,100 of their own supporters, however. It was the first time away fans were in attendance at a derby at Ibrox since the 2-2 draw in January 2023. After the match, it was the home fans under scrutiny after a glass bottle was among several items thrown into Celtic goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalos penalty area in the second half. Also, before kickoff, a banner was unfurled in one of the stands which depicted iconic former Rangers player and manager Graeme Souness holding a shotgun, with the words Take aim against the rebel scum underneath. Rangers was unhappy with the behavior of some of its supporters. Rangers Football Club condemns the actions of the individual who threw a bottle during todays match, the club said. This behavior has no place at our stadium. Steps have already been taken to identify the person responsible, and the club will take the strongest possible action once their identity is confirmed. 
        
     We also acknowledge that the tifo displayed prior to kickoff crossed a line and was unacceptable. Our approach to supporter displays has always been built on trust, with the responsibility placed on groups to exercise good judgment. We will reflect on how these displays are managed and engage with supporter groups to ensure the right balance of trust, responsibility and oversight is maintained moving forward. Rangers is proud of its passionate fan base, and we all share a duty to protect the standards and reputation of our club. Rangers looked well placed to follow up its victories from January and March over Celtic when Cyriel Dessers struck in the 44th minute. Celtic striker Adam Idah equalized in the 57th to make it six games in a row without a victory in all competitions for second-placed Rangers, which has now won just four of its 12 games under Ferguson and none at home since Feb. 2. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-celtic-scotland-derby-df54ee75a5f75a468d750acc3e178702,sports

Rain ends Hyderabads slim hope of qualifying for IPL playoffs,"HYDERABAD, India (AP)  Rain washed out Sunrisers Hyderabads slim chance of qualifying for the Indian Premier League playoffs on Monday. Captain Pat Cummins three-wicket burst with the new ball limited Delhi Capitals to 133-7 before heavy rain and the wet outfield denied further play. Both teams received one point each but Hyderabad, last years finalist, became the third team to drop out of the playoffs race after Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals. Delhi was lucky to get away with one point after more dismal batting from its top order, and was still in playoffs contention in fifth place. Cummins perfectly read the tricky grassless pitch and ran Delhi into all sorts of trouble with three wickets off his first 13 balls after he won the toss and elected to field. He had Karun Nair caught behind off the first ball of the match and Faf du Plessis was beaten by a short ball and edged behind to Ishan Kishan, who kept wickets for the first time this season in place of Heinrich Klaasen. Cummins, who took the new ball after Mohammed Shami was left out, made it 15-3 when Kishan took a smart running catch at square leg after Abhishek Porel top-edged an attempted flick. Cummins added a brilliant catch over his right shoulder when he back-pedalled from mid-off to dismiss Delhi captain Axar Patel. Kishans fourth catch made it 29-5 when Lokesh Rahul edged Jaydev Unadkat. Tristan Stubbs, 41 not out, and impact player Ashutosh Sharma, 41, helped Delhi cross 100 but all of Hyderabads sterling work in the field was washed away by the rain. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/hyderabad-delhi-ipl-8479103d9c0908ae8cd8e71c56a1d7de,sports
"Twins activate Royce Lewis for season debut, and also bring back Willi Castro from injured list","MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Minnesota Twins have returned third baseman Royce Lewis from his rehab assignment, clearing the way for his season debut after he strained his left hamstring in spring training. The Twins reinstated both Lewis and multi-position player Willi Castro from the injured list on Monday, putting both regulars in play for the start of their three-game series against Baltimore on Tuesday. Castro missed 16 games with a strained right oblique muscle. Infielders Mickey Gasper and Edouard Julien were sent to Triple-A St. Paul to make room on the roster with the Twins, who are still missing right fielder Matt Wallner (strained left hamstring) and second baseman Luke Keaschall (broken right forearm) with long-term injuries. Lewis went 4 for 23 with one double in six games with St. Paul, finishing yet another rehabilitation that has defined his young career. The first overall pick in the 2017 draft, Lewis suffered his latest injury on March 16 while running out a ground ball in an exhibition game. Lewis missed the 2021 season after he tore his right ACL when he slipped on ice at his Texas home during a freak winter storm. He needed reconstructive ACL surgery on the same knee in 2022, after a collision with the wall while making a catch during a brief audition in center field barely two weeks after his major league debut. He opened the 2023 season on the injured list while still in recovery and debuted that year in late May. Lewis also had IL stints that season with a strained left oblique and a left hamstring strain. In 2024, he played in a career-high 82 games, enduring IL stints for a strained right quadriceps and a right adductor strain. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/twins-royce-lewis-injuries-willi-castro-cdb365b79b9b322080ca397d494bf328,sports
"Anthony Volpe is back in the Yankees lineup, 2 days after hurting shoulder","NEW YORK (AP)  Gold Glove shortstop Anthony Volpe was back in the New York Yankees starting lineup Monday night, two days after he injured his left shoulder diving for a grounder. Volpe did not play in Sundays 7-5 loss to Tampa Bay but was penciled in to bat sixth in Mondays rain-threatened series opener against San Diego. I talked to him on the way home last night and he said he can do everything so, yeah, I feel like we dodged something there, manager Aaron Boone said.  Volpe remained in the game after his unsuccessful attempt at a backhand stab on Christopher Morels eighth-inning single Saturday, which sparked a two-run rally in Tampa Bays 3-2 win. An X-ray and MRI were negative, and Boone said Volpe was cleared by a team doctor and athletic trainers.  Volpe, who turned 24 on April 28, is hitting .233 with five homers, 19 RBIs and four stolen bases in his third season with the Yankees. Sidelined since straining his left calf in his spring training debut on March 1, DJ LeMahieu could make his season debut on the West Coast trip that starts Friday. LeMahieu has played six rehab games with Double-A Somerset starting April 22 and likely will move to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday. He had a cortisone injection last week in his right hip, an injury stemming from last year. The cortisone helped a lot, LeMahieu said. With second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. sidelined by a strained right oblique, LeMahieu will continue to see time at second base rather than third. Asked about LeMahieus availability on the road trip, which runs through May 14, Boone said: Possible. Well see. 
        
     Marcus Stroman, who hasnt pitched in a game since April 11 because of inflammation in his left knee, was to throw a bullpen Monday. Boone said if that goes well, Stroman could face hitters in batting practice this week. A right-hander who turned 34 on Thursday, Stroman is 0-1 with an 11.57 ERA in three starts. He had a cortisone shot after he allowed five runs and got two outs in a loss to San Francisco. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/volpe-shoulder-yankees-f17fddfabb6c483930996cb051311b3c,sports

Former volunteer assistants Taylor Smart of Arkansas and Michael Hacker California-Davis in 2022 filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of California, Sacramento Division, alleging the NCAA and its member schools unlawfully restricted competition in the college baseball labor market by limiting the number of paid coaches on Division I staffs. Each team could have four coaches, but only three could be paid. The NCAA began allowing all four coaches to be paid beginning July 1, 2023. The $49.25 million settlement with the NCAA would provide an average payment of $32,794.85 to each volunteer assistant who was on a staff from Nov. 29, 2018, to July 1, 2023. U.S. District Judge William Shubb wrote that the payment represents a strong result for the class and that each members share will be based on factors including where the volunteer worked and for how long. Shubb set a final fairness hearing for Sept. 15. Front Office Sports first reported the preliminary approval. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",https://apnews.com/article/ncaa-baseball-volunteer-coaches-efb62c1b4e139ebbf4971cea398a35ea,sports
Zhao Xintong becomes Asias first world snooker champion after match-fixing ban,"Zhao Xintong of China became Asias first world snooker champion after beating Mark Williams 18-12 in the final on Monday, completing a remarkable career turnaround following his involvement in the sports biggest match-fixing scandal. Zhao captured the sports biggest prize  as well as a winners check of 500,000 pounds ($670,000)  at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield just months after returning to competitive action following a 20-month ban. The fixing scandal in 2023 involved 10 Chinese players in total and left snooker under a cloud, especially in China, the sports biggest market in the television landscape and a country that makes up more than 50% of snookers global audience. Zhao is now the pride of China, winning the world championship while playing as an amateur  hell return to the professional ranks next season  and having come through four rounds of qualifiers just to get to the main draw at the Crucible. I think I had a dream, Zhao said. Maybe Im not sure this is true. The 50-year-old Williams was bidding to become the oldest ever world champion as well as a four-time winner, but never recovered from trailing 7-1 after the first of the finals four sessions across Sunday and Monday. Zhao, a fearless, attacking left-hander, showed few nerves in a match which World Snooker Tour officials estimated was being watched by a potential audience of 150-200 million live streams in China and a cumulative audience of 50-150 million on Chinas CCTV5. Even after Williams won the first four frames of the last session to go from 17-8 to 17-12, Zhao stayed composed to compile a break of 87 in what proved to be the last frame, after which he unfurled the flag of China and hung it over his shoulders to the backdrop of applause. Theres a new superstar in the game, Williams said, looking at Zhao, and hes over there. 
        
     When Zhao won the prestigious U.K. Championship  one of snookers majors  in 2021, he looked ready to join the elite of the game. Even as a teenager, he was marked out by some top players, including Williams, as a potential future star.  However, his career was brought to a shuddering halt when, as part of a sprawling match-fixing scandal that rocked snooker in 2023, he was banned after accepting charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself. Zhao was ranked No. 9 in the world at the time. Zhao has been free to play since his suspension expired in September and, in January, secured a return to snookers main professional tour for next season. Given his talent, he was seen as a dangerous wild card in world championship qualifying and he breezed through that  and then the main tournament itself, even thrashing seven-time champion Ronnie OSullivan 17-7 in the semifinals. Now he has beaten another veteran  and member of snookers so-called Class of 92  in Williams, who himself had looked good in beating four-time champion John Higgins in the quarterfinals and then top-ranked Judd Trump in the semifinals. It was only a matter of time before a Chinese player won the worlds. Only one, Ding Junhui, had previously reached the final at the Crucible and he lost to Mark Selby 18-14 in 2016. Ding emerged as a snooker star about 20 years ago, when the sport first tried to spread to China, and is the trailblazer for a raft of his countrymen to have burst through, making snooker huge in their homeland. According to the World Snooker Tour, there are around 300,000 snooker clubs in China. Snooker is available to watch in every TV household in China on CCTV5. There are three snooker academies for Chinese players in Britain, one of them being in Sheffield  where Zhao is based. A record 10 Chinese players reached the first round proper of the worlds this year and six of them made it through to the last 16. The sport has traditionally been dominated by British players but there have now been two overseas winners of the world championship in the past three years, after Belgiums Luca Brecel captured the title in 2023. The only other non-British winner this century was Neil Robertson of Australia in 2010. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/zhao-snooker-world-championship-china-williams-4c9cb262159ff5c661e7a2492f845023,sports

Astros place Yordan Alvarez on injured list with inflammation in his right hand,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Houston Astros slugger Yordan Alvarez is going on the 10-day injured list with inflammation in his right hand. The issue had caused the three-time All-Star to miss the last two games of the Astros weekend series with the Chicago White Sox. The move, announced before the Astros Monday night game at Milwaukee, is retroactive to Saturday. Houston recalled catcher Csar Salazar from Triple-A Sugar Land in a corresponding move. Alvarez, 27, has batted .210 with a .306 on-base percentage, three homers and 18 RBIs in 29 games this season. That follows a 2024 season in which he batted. 308 with a .392 on-base percentage, 35 homers and 86 RBIs in 147 games while earning a third straight All-Star Game selection and finishing ninth in the AL Most Valuable Player voting.

"Pitcher Ross Stripling, aka Chicken Strip, is retiring after nearly a decade in the majors","Ross Stripling is calling it a career. The veteran pitcher announced his retirement on Monday, about six weeks after the Kansas City Royals released him following a monthlong tryout during spring training. Stripling went 40-54 with a 4.17 ERA and four saves in 248 appearances with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Toronto, San Francisco and Oakland. The right-hander was an All-Star for the Dodgers in 2018, going 8-6 with a 3.02 ERA in 122 innings while bouncing between the starting rotation and the bullpen. I never imagined the experiences and memories Id be a part of, Stripling wrote. They exceeded every hope that my younger self could have dreamt for my baseball career. The former Texas A&M star spent four-plus seasons with the Dodgers before being traded to Toronto during the 2020 season. He had the best season of his career with the Blue Jays in 2022. He posted career highs in wins (10) and innings pitched (134 1/3) and a career low in ERA (3.01). He moved on to San Francisco in 2023 and moved across the bay to Oakland in 2024. The Royals gave him an opportunity when he signed in late February. He struggled in five spring training appearances with Kansas City, allowing 14 runs (13 earned) in eight innings of work before being released on March 23. Stripling, selected by the Dodgers in the fifth round of the 2012 amateur draft, earned the nickname Chicken Strip because he used it  thanks to the urging of a teammate  on the back of his jersey during MLB Players Weekend in 2017. The name stuck so much so that Stripling signed his retirement announcement with love, Chicken Strip. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/ross-stripling-retires-baseball-chicken-strip-8228c42a85b3c857e4d26b4130a51d9e,sports

Yankees ace Gerrit Cole had internal brace as part of Tommy John surgery,"NEW YORK (AP)  Yankees ace Gerrit Cole had an internal brace put in his right elbow as part of Tommy John surgery on March 11. And while hes not projecting a date for his return to the mound, he understands the usual rehabilitation takes about 14 months. Cole, the 2023 AL Cy Young Award winner, spoke with reporters Monday for the first time since the operation by Los Angeles Dodgers head team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache. Im under the impression that its the same recovery time, 14 months or so, Cole said. I hope it comes back like maybe like a fresh new set of tires. I mean, thats best hope, just a pit stop that took a little longer than you had hoped for. A 34-year-old right-hander with a 153-80 career record and 3.18 ERA over 317 starts, Cole felt constrained when his arm initially was in a cast following the surgery and then a brace, which was removed 2 1/2 weeks ago. He undergoes 90 minutes to two hours of rehab each day and now can touch his shoulder. It stinks but now that Im stronger and less worried about getting bumped and things like that, its nice to be able to be back and be able to come around more and be in the dugout, he said during a 21-minute question-and-answer session in front of his locker. It starts out really dark and then I think you work your way closer to the light at the end of the tunnel. His arms immobility caused change. 
        
     My wife cut my steak for three weeks or so, yeah, four weeks, he said. Cole has thrown 1,954 innings over 12 major league seasons plus an additional 133 1/3 innings in 22 postseason starts. His procedure was reconstruction of the ligament with an internal brace, which is designed to promote stability. My understanding is that it takes 24 months for the cells in the tendon to turn into ligament cells, Cole said. The idea of the brace in the situation of full reconstruction is to guard that first year so that you dont have situations like  I believe (Shohei) Ohtani was the most recent one, where I could remember  coming back and kind of overstretching it or stretching it too far, then having to take some time off and get the brace surgically put in. Cole is on track to start a throwing program in August and perhaps be on a regular pitching program for spring training. He has spoken with teammates Carlos Rodn and Max Fried, who both returned from Tommy John surgery with ElAttrache, and former teammate Jameson Taillon, who had it twice. Cole is signed to a $324 million, nine-year contract through 2028, and manager Aaron Boone wants him to return to a role of mentoring fellow pitchers. I want to encourage him to start being Gerrit and being around and doing his thing and offering what he does, Boone said. Hes had obviously a ton of success but hes also had moments of truth and struggles and adversity, too. So hes got a lot to share and he likes sharing it, but hes also smart about the craft and hes able to absorb the information thats available now and make of that what he will. Coles 2024 season debut was delayed until June 19 because of nerve irritation and edema in his right elbow. He went 8-5 with a 3.41 ERA in 17 starts for New York and then was 1-0 with a 2.17 ERA in five postseason starts. I had defeated the odds for so long, he said. But, yeah, it did catch up to me. Cole went for tests after allowing a pair of home runs in his second spring training start this year, against Minnesota on March 6. I had trouble bending my elbow. I had trouble moving my arm the next day, he said. So I had a pretty good feeling we were in some deep mud. His need for surgery was clear when he met with ElAttrache. I sat down in front of the computer and I saw it, Cole said. Cole has had time to take his kids to school and go to soccer and T-ball games of his 4-year-old son Caden, who is baseball teammates with Rodns son Bo in Greenwich, Connecticut. Before Cole falls asleep each night, he envisions being on a mound. I still pitch before bed, he said. I havent given up any hits recently. I try to run positive film in my head. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/gerrit-cole-tommy-john-surgery-b18be137cd600253b9b2880addb4297d,sports

Mbapp scores twice and Madrid wins again to trail Barcelona by 4 points ahead of clasico,"MADRID (AP)  Real Madrid survived a late scare but kept pace with leader Barcelona again on Sunday, ahead of their Spanish league clasico next weekend. Kylian Mbapp scored in each half as Madrid held on to beat Celta Vigo 3-2 and remain four points behind the Catalan rival going into next Sundays match in Barcelona. La Liga is in Barcelonas hands, but well have more chances if were able to win, Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. Its a great opportunity. Were going to prepare well for Sundays game, which Im not saying will be decisive, but almost. Arda Gler also scored for Madrid, which opened a 3-0 lead early in the second half but saw Celta get back into the game toward the end of the match at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium. Celta had a couple of great chances to complete its comeback, including a shot by Pablo Durn that stopped just short of the goal line after a deflection by Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in the 78th minute. Courtois had to make a couple of saves near the end to secure the win. We did very well for an hour, we could have managed the lead a little better, but in the end it was a nice win, Ancelotti said. Barcelona came from behind to defeat last-placed Valladolid 2-1 on Saturday, when coach Hansi Flick rested most of the teams regular starters ahead of its Champions League semifinal match at Inter Milan on Tuesday. Barcelona and Inter drew 3-3 in the first leg. 
        
     Gler put Madrid ahead with a shot into the top corner in the 33rd, and Mbapp scored in the 39th  also finding the top corner  and in a breakaway in the 48th. The France star hadnt scored in the league since March.  The match appeared under control until Javi Rodrguez pulled the visitors closer in the 69th and Williot Swedberg scored Celtas second goal in the 76th. A couple of minutes later, Durns shot agonizingly stopped just in front of the goal line after the ball picked up some backspin as it struck Courtois. It was a shame, Celta striker Borja Iglesias said. We had our chances. That shot by Pablo almost went in. It wasnt meant to be. Celta, which was coming off a 3-0 win over Villarreal, stayed in seventh place. There were a few jeers from the Bernabeu crowd as Madrid struggled to hold on to its lead late in the game. It was the fourth straight league win for Madrid, which last Saturday lost the Copa del Rey final to Barcelona and last month was eliminated by Arsenal in the quarterfinals of the Champions League. We played the last game (against Barcelona) a week ago. It was a very competitive game and we came close to winning, Ancelotti said. We dont have to invent a lot of things. Were going to play a serious game. Its very important. Were going to play with all the confidence in the world. Despite all the difficulties, were there and to be able to fight this match is something nice. He said having Mbapp in top form will be key. Hes going to be a very important player in this match due to the fact that Barcelona play with a very high line, Ancelotti said. His runs in behind are going to be very important and decisive. Forward Rodrygo was not included in the squad because of illness. The Basque Country derby ended in a 0-0 draw between Athletic Bilbao and host Real Sociedad. Athletic is three points ahead of fifth-placed Villarreal and six points behind third-placed Atletico Madrid. Athletic was coming off a 3-0 home loss to Manchester United in the first leg of the Europa League semifinals. Midtable Sociedad is winless in four matches. Also Sunday, 15th-placed Sevilla drew 2-2 with second-to-last Leganes, while sixth-placed Real Betis beat 14th-placed Espanyol 2-1. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/real-madrid-mbappe-athletic-sociedad-liga-0ab6778b0fac2c5eab61efeffb2d78da,sports
Roma and Lazio catch up with Juventus in fight for 4th place in Serie A,"MILAN (AP)  With three rounds remaining, the race for the fourth Champions League qualifying spot from Serie A became even tighter on Sunday. Juventus, Roma and Lazio all have 63 points, while Bologna is only a point behind them and Fiorentina three points further back.  Napoli leads Serie A with 77 points, three ahead of second-placed Inter Milan. Atalanta is third with 68 points.  Juventus currently occupies fourth spot but only because of a slightly better goal difference than Roma. Head-to-head is the first tiebreaker when teams are level in Serie A but Juventus and Roma played out two draws, while the Bianconeri visit Lazio next Saturday. Roma has the better head-to-head record with Lazio. Roma and Lazio caught up with Juventus on Sunday after Igor Tudors side was held 1-1 at Bologna. The hosts got off to a miserable start when a series of mistakes allowed Juventus to take the lead in the ninth minute. Andrea Cambiaso was given too much space to cut inside from the right and he spread the ball to Khphren Thuram for a shot that squirmed under the body of Bologna goalkeeper ukasz Skorupski, who should have done better. Juventus had two goals disallowed for offside before Bologna leveled nine minutes into the second half when Remo Freulers effort from close range was accidentally deflected in by Renato Veiga. 
        
     Claudio Ranieris Roma beat Fiorentina 1-0. Just one point separated the two sides heading into the match but Artem Dovbyks diving header deep in first-half stoppage time was enough to keep Roma level with its capital rival Lazio, which won by the same scoreline at relegation-threatened Empoli. Lazios Boulaye Dia scored the only goal after just 54 seconds and both teams ended the match with 10 men. Empoli forward Lorenzo Colombo was sent off shortly before halftime after two bookings in the space of four minutes and Lazio defender Elseid Hysaj was dismissed in the 76th minute following a second yellow card. Empoli remained two points from safety. Charles De Ketelaere found the back of the net in the league for the first time in 2025 with a first-half double to help set Atalanta on its way to a 4-0 win at Monza. Third-placed Atalanta moved five points clear of the glut of teams chasing fourth spot. Monza, which had looked doomed for months, was mathematically relegated as the result left it 12 points from safety. De Ketelaere hadnt scored in Serie A since December  a run of 16 matches  but ended his drought in fine fashion in the 12th minute, controlling a ball from Mateo Retegui before beating two men and drilling into the near bottom corner. Monza showed why it is getting relegated 11 minutes later. Gaetano Castrovilli managed to intercept Reteguis return pass towards Ademola Lookman but the Monza midfielder and teammate Pedro Pereira both just looked at the ball, allowing De Ketelaere to pounce and prod it into the bottom left corner. Atalanta extended its lead immediately after the break when Retegui headed on a long ball over the top and Lookman beat Stefan Lekovic, who had only just come on, and raced into the area to fire past Semuel Pizzignacco. Substitute Marco Brescianini capped a dominant Atalanta performance with a fourth, two minutes from time. Pisa was promoted to Serie A for the first time in 34 years despite losing 1-0 at Bari. Third-placed Spezia also lost, guaranteeing Pisa second spot in Serie B and automatic promotion to the top flight alongside second division champion Sassuolo. Pisa is coached by World Cup-winning forward Filippo Inzaghi, the older brother of Inter Milan coach Simone Inzaghi. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/juventus-bologna-lazio-atalanta-serie-a-e99790508c2d7341b79d3990436aafc7,sports
Palou finally loses as IndyCar champs 2-race winning streak snapped by Kirkwood in Long Beach,"LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP)  Kyle Kirkwood showed that Alex Palou can be beat this IndyCar season and returned Andretti Global to the top of the podium with his second career victory at the Grand Prix of Long Beach. Kirkwood has won the most prestigious street course race in the United States twice in the last three years and Sundays win ended the early run of Palou dominance. Palou, a three-time IndyCar champion including the last two consecutive seasons, won the first two races this year.  Palou, the current points leader, instead finished second.  You never feel amazing when you finish second, Palou said. I tried, I tried. I think we did the best we could. Palous dominance has started to irritate other drivers in the field, but the Spaniard doesnt care. He was an unknown from a racing series in Japan when he arrived in IndyCar in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic when competition was in a bubble and few got a chance to interact with Palou.  He moved to Chip Ganassi Racing in 2021 and, in top-notch equipment, won three races and his first IndyCar championship. He was polite, always smiling, and used the descriptor its amazing for nearly everything good that was happening to him.  Palous demeanor was endearing and he presented himself as very eager to please. It wasnt an act, but as he collected three championship trophies, theres been a shift in Palous approach  hes still smiling and nice, but hes calculated and unconcerned about the competition. When told this weekend he should give his rivals a chance to win a race, Palou used an expletive in declining and said to publish his words.  
        
     He said he planned to win the first six races of the season before hed give another driver a chance  a run that would include Palous first victory in next months Indianapolis 500. Alas, his streak came to an end on the downtown streets of Long Beach, which hosted the caution-free race for the 50th year.  I am not disappointed, 100% I am happy to be here, Palou said. It sucks we couldnt make it more interesting for the fans, but I am happy to be here.  Palou joined his Ganassi teammate Scott Dixon as the only drivers in the last 14 seasons to win the first two races of the year  Dixon did it in 2020, when he won the first three races and eventually his sixth IndyCar title.  Will Power (2010), Sebastian Bourdais (2006), Paul Tracy (2003), Sam Hornish Jr. (2001), Rick Mears (1982) and Johnny Rutherford (1980) are the only drivers to also win the first two races of the season. All but Power went on to win the championship.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/indycar-long-beach-palou-kirkwood-f0d5781de04ebda82d24a492cfb502fb,sports

Cologne fires coach and brings back Friedhelm Funkel in battle for Bundesliga promotion,"COLOGNE, Germany (AP)  Cologne is turning to promotion specialist Friedhelm Funkel to lead the team back to the Bundesliga. Cologne, which is second in Germanys second division, fired Gerhard Struber as coach on Monday and appointed the 71-year-old Funkel for the last two games of the season. Its Funkels third stint in charge at Cologne and his first job since leading Kaiserslautern to the German Cup final last season. Over his long coaching career, Funkel has led six teams to Bundesliga promotion  more than any other. Cologne was leading the second division with four matches remaining, then lost at Hannover before drawing at home with relegated Jahn Regensburg, which allowed Hamburger SV move top on Saturday. The top two are promoted to the Bundesliga. Cologne has a three-point lead over third-place Elversberg before it plays Nuremberg and Kaiserslautern for its final two games. Given the big remaining chance of a direct return we have to do everything to take this chance, Cologne president Werner Wolf said. We cant rely on our rivals results. Funkel was relegated from the Bundesliga with Cologne in 2003 during his first stint, then clinched survival in 2021 during his second. His third will be his 14th coaching appointment after jobs at Neuss, Uerdingen, Duisburg, Rostock, Cologne, Eintracht Frankfurt, Hertha Berlin, Bochum, Aachen, 1860 Munich, Fortuna Dsseldorf, Cologne again, and Kaiserslautern. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/cologne-coach-funkel-promotion-2ec317bfa0ad3de4a2cc8de3340b07fc,sports

NBC Sports Mike Tirico says hes feeling fine after nut allergy knocked him off the Derby broadcast,"NBC Sports host Mike Tirico said Monday he is feeling fine after having to leave the Kentucky Derby broadcast early over the weekend because of a strong reaction to a nut allergy. Ive had a nut allergy my whole life and am usually very, very careful, he said on the Today show. I ate something that had a nut in it and had a nut allergy, causing your throat and your nose and all that stuff to kind of clog up and swell. It affects your breathing a little bit. Tirico said he took an epinephrine shot and was treated by EMTs at Churchill Downs. He began feeling better later Saturday night.  Im embarrassed about the attention, he said. Ahmed Fareed took over for the 58-year-old broadcaster, who was hosting Derby coverage for the ninth year.

Olympic swim great Gary Hall Jr awarded 10 medals to replace those destroyed in LA fires,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP)  After all his Olympic medals were destroyed in the Los Angeles fires, swimming great Gary Hall Jr. set an unexpected record replacing them at IOC headquarters Monday. Ten Olympic medals awarded to one athlete on the same day. Ill do a better job of taking care of these, Hall Jr. quipped receiving the new set of five golds, three silvers and two bronzes earned swimming for the United States at three Summer Games from 1996 to 2004. The originals burned four months ago at his home in the Pacific Palisades area of the city that will host the next Summer Games in 2028. Replacing them by presenting 10 at the same time was a unique ceremony, said International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach. I dont think that it happened ever before and I hope it will never have to happen again, Bach told Hall Jr. We hope also to give you a moment of relief and joy which will help you now in the further process to get over what you had to go through with this tragedy. Hall Jr. spoke with emotion about being supported by family, former teammates and old Olympic rivals like Australia stars Ian Thorpe and Michael Klim. Having friends and family I am a very lucky man, he said. The support that I was offered from the athletic community has buoyed me through the darkest of nights. He brought with him to Switzerland a deformed gold medal later recovered from the home he fled with his dog, Puddles, after grabbing his insulin medication. 
        
     Its got some character, Hall Jr. said of the burned gold at the Olympic ceremony. The value of friends outweighs the value of objects. We live in a time of capitalism, consumerism and you realize when you lose everything, how little of it you truly need. Character cannot be taken away, it cannot be burned and it cannot be lost. Thorpe was among the first people to contact Hall Jr. during the January fires. I dont know how he knew, Hall Jr. said of the surprise call from Thorpe, who was part of the Australian 4x100-meter freestyle team that took gold ahead of the U.S. at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. That is what this (Olympic) family is about  rivals and friends. I am just so appreciative to all of them. I cant thank the Olympic movement enough for their support through this very difficult time. ___ AP Olympics at https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",https://apnews.com/article/gary-hall-olympics-medals-los-angeles-fires-3c78be280c2f9ba4b8bdc291ba156fd8,sports

"Michigan to suspend Sherrone Moore for 2 games to address NCAA allegations, AP sources say","ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP)  Michigan is expected to suspend coach Sherrone Moore for two games next season to address allegations that he failed to cooperate in the NCAAs sign-stealing investigation that rocked college football during the Wolverines championship season under Jim Harbaugh in 2023, according to two people familiar with the situation. Moore is expected to miss the Wolverines third and fourth games  home against Central Michigan on Sept. 13 and at Nebraska a week later and all athletic-related duties during those weeks, they said.  The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Monday because the schools proposed self-imposed sanction has not been announced. It has also not been finalized, according to a third person with knowledge of the situation, also speaking on condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing. ESPN was the first to report the expected suspension. The NCAA investigation into impermissible in-person scouting and sign stealing by Michigan hung over the second half of the teams unbeaten season in 2023 and is still looming over college footballs winningest program. The NCAA does not have rules against stealing signs, but it does prohibit schools from sending scouts to the games of future opponents and using electronic equipment to record another teams signals. Records from other Big Ten schools showed former staffer Conor Stalions bought tickets to games involving future opponents, sending people to digitally record teams when they signaled plays. 
        
     Stalions initially was placed on leave by the school and later resigned. He did not participate in the investigation.  Last August, the NCAA alleged in a notice relating to its sign-stealing investigation that Moore violated rules as an assistant under Harbaugh, who served a three-game suspension in exchange for the Big Ten dropping its own investigation into the allegations after the two wound up in court.  Moore was accused of deleting text messages with Stalions before they were recovered and provided to the NCAA. Moore has said he has and will continue to cooperate with the NCAAs investigation. Moore served a one-game suspension during the 2023 season related to recruiting infractions and filled in as head coach for four games last year when Harbaugh was punished by the school and the Big Ten. The NCAA previously put Michigan on three years of probation, fined the school and implemented recruiting limits after reaching a negotiated resolution in a recruiting case and banned Harbaugh from coaching college football for four years. Michigan opens the season on Aug. 30 at home against New Mexico State and at Oklahoma, where Moore was an offensive lineman. ____ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

This win by Joey Logano flips the script and reduces the pressure for Team Penske,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)  Joey Logano quickly flipped the script for Team Penske. The focus after this win can be on, well, the first win this season for NASCARs reigning Cup Series champion. Not like last week following Austin Cindrics victory at Talladega, when Logano had an expletive-laden rant on the radio directed at his teammate during that race and then afterward had what would have been a fifth-place finish disqualified because of a missing nut and loose bolt on the spoiler during the postrace inspection. Its nice to change the storyline, Logano said. Logano recovered from starting 27th at the 1 1/2-mile Texas Motor Speedway on Sunday in the 11th Cup race of the season, and surged ahead after the restart in overtime with teammate Ryan Blaney to his outside. We paid the price from last week in qualifying, going out early, and now you have a bad pit stall. OK, I just got to (get a) top 10, top five and start clicking those off, getting some points, I need that, Logano said. Then just found ourselves in position to win. Glad we capitalized on that. The goal was to get some momentum rolling. I feel like just get some stuff going, juices flowing again. Yeah, turned out well. All three Penske drivers led laps at Texas. Cindric was in front for 60 laps and won the first stage, but finished 25th after getting caught up in a late-race crash. Logano and Blaney were on the front row for the final restart after the races 12th caution. Logano was the control car for the green-white-checkered finish, even though Blaney was actually shown as the leader when they reached the line. Blaney finished third, still his best of the season, after Logano and Ross Chastain both got in front of him on the final run. 
        
     Walter Czarnecki, the teams vice chairman, dismissed the notion that back-to-back wins brought a sigh of relief. Rather, it reduces the pressure. The fact that here we are ... 11th race of the year, and we got two cars in already for the playoffs. So it allows the team to, I wont say freewheel, but to be able to do some things that perhaps they might not have been otherwise to do, Czarnecki said. Now, the mission is to get Ryan Blaney into the playoffs. Blaney is actually the teams highest-ranked driver at seventh in the Cup standings after moving up a spot following his best finish of the season. Logano is ninth and Cindric 14th. Im really proud of this team. Team Penske has been bringing good, competitive cars for the first 11 races. Weve been in the hunt in every one of them. Weve qualified very well. Had a chance to win some other races. Now, two in a row. Hope thats a real momentum builder for us, Czarnecki said. If we werent bringing good cars or there were other issues, thats one thing, but weve been there. So Blaneys time is coming, too. There are 15 points races left before the playoffs begin Aug. 31. The Cup Series is at Kansas on Sunday, followed by the non-points All-Star Race. Then comes Charlotte, where Blaney has won before. There are also races left at Pocono and Iowa, other places he has driven to Victory Lane. I think Blaney surely could have won multiple races, Paul Wolfe, Loganos crew chief, said after Sundays race. I really appreciate that relationship we have amongst our team and specifically the 12. We work very closely together, and its kind of ironic how the end of the race we were racing the 12 for the win. The way the racing is with limited track time these days and things like that, I think its very important the teamwork aspect and how well were able to help one another to ultimately make us better on race day and as the race goes on, he said. We continue to work together. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-texas-penske-logano-3d9d9da3488849b4bf2a3f0ed8a04b71,sports
Barcelona marches toward La Liga title before Inter Milan decider in Champions League,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  Raphinha and Fermn Lpez saved Barcelona from a stumble at relegated Valladolid on Saturday, helping it close on the La Liga title before a crunch Champions League match at Inter Milan. Halftime substitute Raphinha canceled out Valladolids first-half opener in the 54th minute. Lpez continued his quietly superb season by bagging the winner six minutes later for a 2-1 road victory. Hansi Flick played with fire by rotating his starting XI ahead of Tuesdays trip to Milan, where Barcelona and Inter will see which can tip the balance in their semifinal after delivering a 3-3 thriller this week in Spain. I am happy that we won the three points, but I am also happy that some players had less minutes before the important match against Inter on Tuesday, Flick said. Even though his team was trailing 0-1 at halftime, Flick stuck to his plan to play only top midfielder Pedri Gonzlez for the first half before replacing him with Frenkie de Jong. First-choice center backs Pau Cubars and igo Martnez didnt play. 
        
     Valladolid made a surprising start when Ivn Snchezs shot deflected off Ronald Arajo, hit the turf and looped over goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who was making his first start since recovering from a right knee injury in September. Barcelona was stalled until Lamine Yamal replaced injured debutant Daniel Rodrguez, whose first game ended after just over half an hour when he hurt his right arm. Raphinha replaced an ineffective Ansu Fati at halftime. The Brazil forward, who has come through in the clutch for Barcelona this season, drilled in a loose ball after goalie Andr Ferreira punched a cross by Yamal to the edge of the area. Fermn followed up moments later with a precise, low strike into the corner. Yamal had a goal-bound shot saved on the line by Valladolids Antonio Candela in the 80th. The 17-year-old also delivered the dribble of the match, when he spun with the ball to twirl past two defenders. Barcelona opened a seven-point gap over Real Madrid, which it beat last weekend in the Copa del Rey final to launch its bid for a treble. Madrid hosts Celta Vigo on Sunday. After this round there will be four games left, including a clasico in Barcelona next weekend. I was really eager to play and enjoy being on the field. And there is no better way to return than with a win, Ter Stegen said on his first appearance in seven months. We are keeping up the momentum ahead of some spectacular games. Flick had said that Ter Stegen would see some action in La Liga but that Wojciech Szczesny will continue to play in the Champions League. Defender Andreas Christensen made his first start of the season in defense after a long injury absence. Barcelona midfielder Gavi Pez asked to be substituted late in the game. It is unclear if it was due to muscle cramps or a possible injury. Barcelona already has striker Robert Lewandowski, right back Jules Kound and left back Alejandro Balde on its injury list. Valladolid was relegated last week after winning just four of 33 games before Barcelona came to the city in north-western Spain. Valladolids disgruntled fans protested against club owner, Brazil and Real Madrid great Ronaldo, before and during the Barcelona game. Supporters waved fliers that looked like 500-euro notes with the face of Ronaldo and the message in English Ronaldo go home on them before tossing them toward the turf. They also chanted for him to leave. Third-placed Atletico Madrid drew at Alavs 0-0 as Diego Simeone was left five points behind fierce rival Real Madrid. Ayoze Prezs double led Villarreal to a 4-2 win over Osasuna and reinforced its hold on fifth place, which next season will earn a Champions League berth. Real Betis, in sixth, was four points behind with a game in hand. Hugo Duro scored twice for Valencia as it won at Las Palmas 3-2 and kept the Canary Islands club in the relegation zone. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-valladolid-raphinha-laliga-53dfe718240541afe44230c89bf33847,sports

Weigandt, from point-blank range, tapped in the putback of his own shot to make it 2-0 in the 30th.  Surez put away his own rebound to give Miami a 3-0 lead. Tadeo Allende rolled a cross to Surez for a one-touch shot from center of the area that was blocked by defender Kyle Duncan, but Surez was there for the finish for the left corner of the 6-yard box.

Sebastian Berhalter played a low ball-in from the right side to Blackmon for a one-touch finish from the center of the area that slipped inside the near post and under the crossbar in the 70th to make it 2-0.  Yohei Takaoka stopped two shots for Vancouver.  Diego Luna converted from the spot for Real Salt Lake (4-7-0) in the sixth minute of stoppage time.  Cabral finished with seven saves, including a stop of a penalty kick by Daniel Ros in the 68th minute.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/real-salt-lake-whitecaps-score-6ec6684bd21f7708fa2c39a44a959e1f,sports
"Oscar Piastri cruises to win at Bahrain Grand Prix, with Lando Norris third","In a race with plenty of drama, Oscar Piastri made sure to stay ahead of trouble. Piastri took his second win of the Formula 1 season in dominant style at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday, slashing the points gap to his teammate Lando Norris, who could only manage third after an eventful race. Piastri started on pole and kept Mercedes George Russell behind him, fending off a challenge for the lead after a safety-car restart.  Russell held on to second after defending his position on the last lap from Norris, who had started sixth. Its been an incredible weekend, Piastri said after claiming McLarens first-ever win in Bahrain. To finish the job today in style was nice. Norris keeps the lead of the championship with a three-point advantage over Piastri. Defending champion Max Verstappen, who finished sixth, is five points further back in third.  Piastri had a no-drama run to the checkered flag, except for a drinks system which wasnt working in the desert heat. Norris race was a roller-coaster. Norris made up three places off the start but was then handed a five-second penalty for starting too far forward on his grid space. After going down as far as 14th, he made up places and won a lengthy battle with the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton before falling short in his attempt to beat Russell for second. A messy race for me and disappointed not to bring home the one-two for McLaren, Norris said. 
        
     Russell had to deal with electrical problems on his car and was facing an investigation into his use of the DRS overtake aid system. Russell said it had opened by accident when he pressed the button to use the radio but said he eased off and didnt gain an advantage. The stewards agreed and didnt give him a penalty. Russells second place was the best result for Mercedes since Russell won the Las Vegas Grand Prix in November. Leclerc was fourth for Ferrari after losing a hard-fought battle to Norris while his teammate Hamilton started ninth but cut through the field to finish fifth. After last weeks race in Japan resembled a procession, with all of the top six finishing in the order they started, Bahrain offered a festival of overtaking. Verstappen won last week but was never in contention in Bahrain and was even last at one stage. He survived an overheating car and a slow pit stop to place sixth, passing Pierre Gasly, who was seventh for Alpine. Esteban Ocon of Haas was eighth, with Yuki Tsunoda ninth for his first points since joining Red Bull  and the teams first for any driver other than Verstappen since November  and Oliver Bearman 10th in the other Haas. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/bahrain-f1-piastri-norris-verstappen-russell-3c1c95434c6b70c15cee55d64193d11f,sports
Michael Schumachers signature on helmet worn by F1 champ Jackie Stewart at charity drive in Bahrain,"SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP)  Formula 1 champion Jackie Stewart wore a helmet bearing the signature of all living Formula 1 champions, including Michael Schumacher, as he drove one of his title-winning cars for charity ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday. Seven-time champion Schumacher has not appeared in public since he sustained severe head injuries in a 2013 skiing accident. Few details of his condition have been made public.  Stewart earlier told the Daily Mail newspaper that Schumacher had signed the helmet with help from his wife Corinna. It is wonderful that Michael could sign the helmet in this worthy cause  a disease for which there is no cure, Stewart was quoted as saying Saturday. His wife helped him, and it completed the set of every single champion still with us. The 85-year-old Stewart, a three-time F1 champion, was driving his 1973 championship-winning Tyrrell car to raise awareness for the Race Against Dementia charity, which he founded to research treatments for the disease. Stewart is caring for his wife Helen, who has dementia. To find a cure for dementia is my biggest wish, he told the BBC this month. He said that Helen required specialist care and had recently been unable to recognize him. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/michael-schumacher-signature-jackie-stewart-helmet-f1-9160ea12117ad77594b505c1ce5444b6,sports
Verstappen recovers from ridiculous setbacks to finish 6th at Bahrain GP,"SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP)  From first to last  at least briefly  in the space of a week.  A qualifying master class put Formula 1 defending champion Max Verstappen on course for victory in Japan last week but on Sunday in Bahrain he was far off the pace. At one stage Verstappen even ended up in last position in the race, before recovering to finish sixth and minimize the ground lost in the standings.  Verstappen started seventh but steadily lost places  including being overtaken by 18-year-old rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli and his old rival Lewis Hamilton  and complained of tire wear, brake problems and overheating.  I cant even brake any more, Verstappen told the Red Bull team. Its just ridiculous. There were problems, too, with the lights that indicate when a driver can leave the pit, costing Verstappen yet more time. His second stop left him in 20th position midway through the race. Gradually, he turned it round. Verstappen made the most of his troublesome car to get back into contention and he swooped past Alpines Pierre Gasly for sixth on the last lap. That was at least a positive result considering all the things that went wrong today, Verstappen said. This was not the weekend that we wanted but we have to keep on trying to improve. It was Verstappens worst result of the season but still left him just eight points off standings leader Lando Norris. Finishing any lower than sixth would have been the Dutch drivers worst result in a race since 2022, except for cases of car failure. 
        
     An unwelcome streak ended for Red Bull as the team scored points with both cars for the first time since the Las Vegas Grand Prix in November. Yuki Tsunoda was ninth in his second race for Red Bull since replacing Liam Lawson, and one he called another learning curve. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-bahrain-red-bull-max-verstappen-2ead8d1494428cc95888ad01ba9aa4b0,sports

Garca homers as the Nationals beat the Reds 4-1,"CINCINNATI (AP)  Luis Garca Jr. homered during Washingtons three-run seventh inning, and the Nationals beat the Cincinnati Reds 4-1 on Sunday. Garca gave Washington a 2-1 lead with his one-out solo drive off Graham Ashcraft (2-3). CJ Abrams tacked on a two-run double against Taylor Rogers. Jorge Lpez (4-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win, and Kyle Finnegan handled the ninth for his 11th save. Washington took two of three in the weekend series at Cincinnati. Nationals left-hander MacKenzie Gore struck out nine in five innings. He allowed four hits and walked four. The Reds wasted a sharp performance by Nick Martinez, who struck out six while working six innings of one-run ball. Garca put Washington in front with a sacrifice fly in the second. But Tyler Stephenson hit a leadoff drive in the bottom half for Cincinnati. It was Stephensons first homer in his third game since he missed the start of the season with a left oblique strain. With two outs, a runner aboard and rain falling in the fifth, Elly De La Cruz hit a shot down the left-field line for Cincinnati that was initially ruled a home run before the umpires gathered and changed the call to a foul ball. Gore leads the majors with 68 strikeouts in just 46 innings. The Nationals begin a six-game homestand on Monday night against the Cleveland Guardians. The Reds open a seven-game trip on Monday with the first of four against the Braves. Brady Singer (4-1, 3.24 ERA) starts for the Reds against AJ Smith-Shawver (1-2, 4.26 ERA). ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/nationals-reds-score-115e9d4b069b8d4b3b03e18f77360589,sports

Lance McCullers Jr. pitches 3 2/3 scoreless innings for Astros in his first appearance since 2022,"CHICAGO (AP)  Thirty months after his last appearance, Lance McCullers Jr. finally made it back to the mound in a major league game. The 31-year-old McCullers started Sunday for the Houston Astros and threw 3 2/3 scoreless innings in his first outing since Game 3 of the 2022 World Series in Philadelphia. McCullers had surgery in June 2023 to repair his right flexor tendon and to remove a bone spur. Then he was shut down after a setback last year. He kept the Chicago White Sox off the scoreboard in his first game back, allowing three hits and three walks with four strikeouts. The Astros lost 5-4 in a game shortened to seven innings by rain. I was happy with the overall stuff. Physically, I felt strong through the game, McCullers told reporters. Very grateful to just be back out with the team and be an active member. McCullers stranded runners on second and third in the first inning and pitched out of a bases-loaded situation in the second. After a 1-2-3 third, he got two outs in the fourth but also allowed a double and a walk. He was taken out after 87 pitches.  A lot of foul balls, a lot of high-stress moments there, but I think he pitched out of them, Espada said. So hell get ready for the next one. McCullers is 49-32 with a 3.46 ERA in his career, which has been entirely with Houston. He went 13-5 with a 3.16 ERA in 2021, the last time he pitched anything resembling a full season. 
        
     If he can regain that level, the right-hander can obviously help the Astros. It has been a very long road for me. Its been a grind to get back to this point, McCullers said. I know that I have to do a better job of controlling the pitch count and getting quick outs and things like that, but from where Ive come from over the last couple years, especially where I was early this offseason, I would lie to you guys if I didnt say I was pretty proud of myself. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/houston-astros-lance-mccullers-jr-fce37adedd20ad4760ad33900be1e8ad,sports

Maya Yoshida own goal keeps defending-champion Galaxy reeling in 1-0 loss to Sporting KC,"KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP)  Los Angeles Galaxy defender Maya Yoshida had the only score on Sunday night, unfortunately it was an own goal that led to a 1-0 victory for Sporting Kansas City  continuing the worst start by a defending champion in league history. The Galaxy (0-8-3) are still looking for their first victory 11 matches into the season and even a 3-0-2 record in five previous matchups with Sporting KC (3-7-1) didnt help. Yoshidas own goal came in the 13th minute. John Pulskamp had to make one save and it came in the first half on the way to his second clean sheet in his 11th start of the season for Sporting KC. His save came just before halftime on a right-footed shot from the center of the box by John Nelson. John McCarthy did not have a save for the Galaxy.  It was sweet revenge for Dejan Joveljic, who came to Sporting KC in the first cash-for-player trade in league history after helping the Galaxy win their sixth MLS Cup last season. He leads the team with five goals  all at home. The Galaxy have missed Riqui Puig, who hasnt played since suffering a knee injury in the playoffs. And Joseph Paintsil and Gabriel Pec, who combined for 50 goals contributions in the championship run, have just four so far this season. Sporting KC interim coach Kerry Zavagnin and the Galaxys Greg Vanney were teammates on the US mens national team. The two coaches represented their current teams when the two clubs squared off in the conference final of the 2000 MLS Cup  won by the then-Kansas City Wizards, who went on to beat the Chicago Fire 1-0 in the championship match. The Galaxy travel to play the New York Red Bulls on Saturday. Sporting KC travels to play the Portland Timbers on Saturday. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/la-galaxy-sporting-kc-score-0a8ce8fe39147bc85f89df7ce40a3a55,sports
"Victor Scott II robs Juan Soto, has go-ahead double as Cardinals beat Mets 5-4 to sweep twinbill","ST. LOUIS (AP)  Victor Scott II robbed Juan Soto of a three-run homer and later hit a tiebreaking double, leading the St. Louis Cardinals to 5-4 victory over the New York Mets for a doubleheader sweep on Sunday night. The Cardinals won the opener 6-5. The nightcap was tied at 4-all in the fourth inning when Soto drove a fastball to straightaway center. Scott ran back to the wall and leaped, and his glove was over the fence when he snatched the ball, preventing it from landing on the grass. In the sixth, Scotts two-out double off Max Kranick (2-1) scored Yohel Pozo from first base. Coming off two of three losses to Arizona, the NL East-leading Mets have dropped consecutive series for the first time this year. Alec Burleson hit a two-run homer and rookie Michael McGreevy pitched 5 2/3 innings of scoreless relief for the Cardinals. McGreevy (1-0) was recalled Saturday from Triple-A Memphis. He struck out five and gave up one hit and one walk in first appearance in the majors this season. Last year, McGreevy went 3-0 with a 1.96 ERA in four appearances, three of them starts. Mets starter Tylor Megill allowed four runs in five innings. Burlesons first homer this season came with one out in the second. He belted a 0-1 fastball into the right-field bullpen for a 2-0 lead. Starling Marte had two hits and two RBIs for the Mets. The Mets sent nine to the plate in the third against Andre Pallante, scoring four runs. McGreevy inherited the bases loaded and retired two batters. St. Louis tied it in the bottom half on singles by Nolan Arenado and Willson Contreras. 
        
     Burleson has hit safely in nine of his last 10 starts against the Mets. He is hitting .333 (12 for 36) with three homers and eight RBIs. Mets: Begin a series at Arizona with Griffin Canning (4-1, 2.61 ERA) on the mound Monday. Cardinals: At Pittsburgh on Monday with Miles Mikolas (1-2, 4.66) facing the Pirates Carmen Mlodzinski (1-3, 6.58). ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-cardinals-score-c7d1b6b0a1b33f80e9126b460233a697,sports
"South Africa men, New Zealand women win the Sevens world championship titles in Los Angeles","LOS ANGELES (AP)  South Africas men and New Zealands women have been crowned 2025 Rugby Sevens world champions after winning their respective finals Sunday at the same venue in Los Angeles where the Olympic competition will be played in 2028.  The Olympic and world sevens league champion New Zealand womens lineup beat Australia 31-7 in their final and went unbeaten at the tournament. South Africa beat Spain 19-5 in a surprise mens final between teams which finished third and fourth in the league. Spain upset league champion Argentina in the semifinals but couldnt repeat that in the final against the Olympic bronze medalists.  South Africas physical defense was critical against a Spain team which enjoyed a surplus of possession. Selwyn Davids scored the only try of the first half, stepping past tackles inside his own 20-meter area and going more than 80 meters to score under the posts. Spain opened the second half with a try to star Pol Pla which made the score 7-5. South Africa then finished strongly with tries to Mfundo Ndhlovu and Roberto Duarttee. Its pretty sweet. I think we owed this one to ourselves, South Africa captain Siviwi Soyizwapi said.  New Zealand and Australia met in a womens final between the first- and second-ranked teams in the league. New Zealand won that title with 116 points, 10 clear of the Australians. The teams have met five times in finals this season, with New Zealand winning the last three after Australia won the first two encounters. 
        
     New Zealand opened the scoring with an outstanding individual try to Georgia Miller, her 29th try of the season. Michaela Brake scored off a turnover by captain Sarah Hirini and New Zealand took a 12-0 lead to halftime. Australia hit back with a solo breakout try to McKenzie Davis, cutting the lead to 12-7. New Zealand then scored three unanswered to complete a comprehensive win. Risi Pouri-Lane scored after strong runs by Brake and Miller. Marina Paul scored off Hirinis pass, then Hirini capped the win with a try, celebrating with a fist-pump. That feels good. Im so happy, Hirini said. Its nice to be able to take that World Series trophy back home. I dont show too much emotion but I probably showed how much it means to this group. After the Olympic gold medal we wanted to show were a great team and that meant winning the league and winning the World Series. Olympic silver medalist Canada beat the U.S. team, the Olympic bronze medalist, in the womens third-place playoff, completing a 4-0 sweep of the North American contests this season. Asia Hogan-Rochester scored three tries. In the mens bronze match, New Zealand beat league champion Argentina 38-17 for its first podium finish of the season. ___ AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby",https://apnews.com/article/rugby-sevens-world-champions-los-angeles-236f7d84596b087a630371f805dad0fa,sports

Armstrong scores late winner Wave defeats Bay 2-1,"Trinity Armstrong scored a header in the fifth minute of stoppage to hand San Diego Wave a dramatic 2-1 win over California rivals Bay FC in the National Womens Soccer League on Sunday. In the only other NWSL match, Gotham FC tied 0-0 with the Chicago Stars in New Jersey.  At San Diegos Snapdragon Stadium, the Wave opened the scoring when Maria Sanchezs curling corner kick was headed in from six yards out by Kennedy Wesley in the fifth minute. Bay answered quickly when Dorian Bailey forced a turnover, which allowed Racheal Kundananji to spread the ball to Karlie Lema, who took a few touches and squeezed a shot past Wave goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan in the 18th minute. Referee Elvis Osmanovic awarded a penalty to San Diego after Bay defender Joelle Anderson got her legs tangled up with Wave winger Delphine Cascarino in the 25th minute. Bay goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitzs athletic save prevented Sanchez from scoring. It was the first penalty save for Silkowitz in the NWSL. In the dying moments, Armstrong, a 17-year-old rookie, scored her first professional goal to the delight of the home fans.  San Diego (4-2-1) is on a three game winning streak and moved up to third in the standings. Bay (2-3-2) ended the weekend in 10th.  
        
     Alyssa Naeher made five saves and the Stars held firm over the home team at Sports Illustrated Stadium. It was the Stars first clean sheet of the 2025 season. Naeher is now up to 50 career NWSL clean sheets, 45 of those coming with Chicago. It was Chicagos first game since firing coach Lorne Donaldson on Wednesday. Assistant coach Masaki Hemmi took charge as the interim in Donaldsons place. Gotham dominated but couldnt find a way into the Stars well-marshaled box. The closest the hosts came to scoring was when Jaelin Howell crashed the crossbar with a long-range effort in the second half. Gotham finished the game with 14 total shots to Chicagos four. Gotham also had the lions share of possession (58%). The visiting Stars won 66% of the aerial duels.

Riley and Braves receive morale boost from long-awaited 1st win of season against powerful Dodgers,"ATLANTA (AP)  Austin Riley knows one win by Atlanta in six games against the Los Angeles Dodgers doesnt give the Braves a claim to challenge the team with baseballs best record. Even so, avoiding a season sweep with Sunday nights 4-3 win over the Dodgers was important for the Braves and their morale.  Its huge, said Riley, who powered the Braves by hitting a pair of two-run homers for an early 4-0 lead. I think this is a really good ballclub here, he added. Weve shown it at times and weve struggled at times. I think its something you can build off of to get that confidence, knowing that we can compete with the best, and go from there. The Braves opened the season with seven consecutive losses, a stretch that was capped by three losses in Los Angeles. They have remained under .500, though they climbed close at 14-15 before another three-game skid that included losses to the Dodgers in the first two games of the weekend series, including a 10-3 defeat on Saturday night that gave Los Angeles a seven-game winning streak and the best record in the majors at 23-10. Including losses in their last two games against the Dodgers in 2024, the Braves had lost seven straight in the series. Thats why avoiding the sweep of the season series was important. I think its big when you win a game like this, said Braves manager Brian Snitker. Its like you know what, were pretty good, too. I think the club can take something away from that. We didnt win the series, but its a big win for us. It shows us we can play, that were a good team, too. 
        
     Riley is hitting .292 and leads the Braves with eight homers and 24 RBIs. Riley, Marcell Ozuna, Matt Olson and other Atlanta hitters are awaiting the return of outfielder Ronald Acua Jr. as early as this month as he continues to recover from last years ACL surgery on his left knee. Acua was hurt after 49 games last season. He won the National League MVP in 2023 with 41 home runs, 73 steals and a .337 batting average. When asked how the top of Atlantas lineup would compare with the Dodgers top four of Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Teoscar Hernndez when Acua returns to the leadoff spot, Snitker said: Were right there. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/braves-dodgers-riley-d98c3b3f0a59806356e59742fc2d76aa,sports
Lowry scores late in 2OT to rally Jets to 4-3 win over Blues in Game 7 to advance to 2nd round,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP)  Adam Lowry scored on a tipped shot 16:10 into the second overtime and the Winnipeg Jets rallied to beat the St. Louis Blues 4-3 on Sunday night to advance to the second round of the NHL playoffs. Cole Perfetti had two goals, Vladislav Namestnikov also scored, and Kyle Connor and Neal Pionk each had three assists for Winnipeg, which scored twice in the final two minutes of regulation to tie the score. Connor Hellebuyck finished with 26 saves. Lowry deflected Pionks shot from the right point late in the second overtime to end the third-longest Game 7 in NHL history at 96:10. Its incredibly special, Lowry said. I probably dreamt it was a little nicer than just going off my leg, but its one of those things, on the outdoor rink, in the driveway, you dream about being the hero in a Game 7 and giving yourself a chance to continue chasing a Stanley Cup. The Jets will next face the Dallas Stars starting Wednesday at home in the teams first postseason meeting. Jordan Kyrou, Mathieu Joseph and Radek Faksa scored for the Blues. Jordan Binnington had 43 saves. Winnipeg won the franchises first Presidents Trophy after having a league-best 56-22-4 regular-season record and were the favorites against the eighth-seeded Blues. They needed a late comeback to avoid getting knocked out in the first round for a third straight year. To lose in those first rounds, those were heartbreaking, said Jets first-year coach Scott Arniel, who was the clubs associate coach the previous two seasons. Last year, obviously with the season we had (52 wins), to do it this year we didnt want to go out. That was one of the messages I said to these guys, Bring your best game forward and have no regrets. And thats what it was all about. 
        
     Winnipeg was down 3-1 in the third period when Namestnikov scored with 1:56 remaining after his shot went in off Blues defenseman Ryan Suter. With Hellebuyck pulled for an extra skater, Winnipeg appeared to tied it up 50 seconds later, but a review ruled the puck didnt cross the goal line. Perfetti then scored his second redirected goal of the game with 3 seconds remaining to lift 15,225 frenzied white-clad fans out of their seats inside Canada Life Centre.  Even down 3-1, there was no doubt, Perfetti said. We had belief in one another and belief that we were going to come back. Im just so proud of this group and so proud to be a part of it. Winnipeg went on the power play 6:20 into the first overtime when St. Louis captain Brayden Schenn was called for delay of game. The Jets tried to pound the puck in the crease, but Binnington covered it. He also stopped Nikolaj Ehlers on a breakaway.  The Jets were without star center Mark Scheifele (upper body injury) for the second straight game and then lost top defenseman Josh Morrissey about eight minutes into the first period.  To play this long of a game with five defensemen, its pretty incredible, Ehlers said. So hats off to those guys. They stuck with it. The home team won each game in this series. Kyrou scored on the Blues first shot of the game at 1:10 of the first period after he and Colton Parayko went on the rush. It marked the fastest goal to begin a Game 7 in Blues history. Joseph made it 2-0 after picking up a loose puck dropped by Connor in the neutral zone. Using Morrissey as a screen, Joseph sent a wrist shot past Hellebuyck on the stick side at 7:16. Morrissey went to the dressing soon after the goal. Earlier in the game, he got hit into the boards by Blues forward Oskar Sundqvist and appeared to be in pain as he sat on the bench. He didnt return. The Jets missed on a couple chances early in the second period, but got the games first power play and quickly made it count. Seven seconds after Sundqvist was called for slashing, Connor sent the puck toward Perfetti at the side of the net and Perfetti redirected it by Binnington with 8:19 remaining. St. Louis regained a two-goal lead after Ehlers lost the puck and Faksa beat Hellebuyck high over his glove with 34.1 seconds left in the second. The Winnipeg/Atlanta Thrashers franchise is now 2-8 all-time when facing elimination. The other win came in Game 7 of their second-round series against Nashville in 2018. The original version of the Jets lost a pair of Game 7s on the road in 1990 and 92. St. Louis is now 10-9 in Game 7s. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/blues-jets-score-nhl-playoffs-329aba9a3412c9e4a282d54ed6748b9f,sports
Tanner Bibee leaves after 5 innings with leg cramps but gets win as Guardians beat Blue Jays 5-4,"TORONTO (AP)  Tanner Bibee pitched five innings before leaving because of leg cramps, Gabriel Arias had three hits and two RBIs, and the Cleveland Guardians beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 on Sunday. Six-time All-Star Jos Ramrez was back in the lineup for Cleveland, two days after leaving in the third inning because of a right ankle sprain. Ramrez went 0 for 4 with a walk. Bibee (3-2) improved to 3-0 in three career starts against Toronto. He allowed three runs (two earned) and five hits. Bibee came to the mound to warm up for the bottom of the sixth but appeared to be in discomfort, lifting his legs several times and calling the trainer out of the dugout. Tim Herrin replaced Bibee, and Cade Smith worked the seventh. Hunter Gaddis allowed runners to reach second and third with one out in the eighth, but retired Myles Straw and Nathan Lukes to preserve a one-run lead. Carlos Santana extended Clevelands edge to two with a bases-loaded walk in the ninth.  Torontos Vladimir Guerrero Jr. answered with a sacrifice fly in the bottom half but Emmanuel Clase finished for his seventh save in nine chances, stranding the tying run at third base. Toronto right-hander Bowden Francis (2-5) allowed four runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings. Francis has won once in six starts. Daniel Schneemann hit an RBI single in the fourth and Arias followed with a two-run single. Toronto batters had three hits with runners in scoring position against Bibee, one more than hed allowed in his first six starts combined.

"Aranda homers, drives in 3 runs as Rays offense awakens in 7-5 win over Yankees","NEW YORK (AP)  Jonathan Aranda homered and added a two-run single, boosting Tampa Bay over the New York Yankees 7-5 on Sunday to end the Rays eight-game stretch of scoring four runs or fewer. Tampa Bay matched its season high with 16 hits, including four by No. 9 hitter Taylor Walls and three each by Travis Jankowski, Yandy Daz and Aranda. Brandon Lowe hit a two-run single and speedy Chandler Simpson scored from second on an infield hit. Taj Bradley (3-2) stopped a three-start winless streak, allowing two runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings as Tampa Bay won its second straight after a four-game slide. Aaron Judge, hitting a big league-high .423, doubled to extend his on-base streak to 30 games. Cody Bellinger hit his 200th homer, a two-run drive in the sixth with the Yankees trailing 5-0, and Jorbit Vivas had a two-run single in a three-run eighth for his first big league hit. Pete Fairbanks struck out the side in the ninth to remain perfect in eight save chances. Will Warren (1-2) dropped to 0-2 in his last four starts, giving up five runs  three earned  seven hits and three walks with eight strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings. New York lost for the third time in four games. Shortstop Oswald Peraza and catcher J.C. Escarra made errors and left fielder Jasson Domnguez allowed Walls catchable fly ball to drop behind him for a double. With two on and no outs in the third, Judge grounded into a double play.

"Mets Jesse Winker to travel back to New York after right side injury, with IL stint likely","ST. LOUIS (AP)  Mets left fielder Jesse Winker will fly back to New York instead of traveling with the team to Arizona after leaving the first game of a doubleheader at St. Louis on Sunday with right side discomfort. Winker had an MRI after the game, but manager Carlos Mendoza said after the Mets lost the nightcap 5-4 that more imaging was needed and a stint on the injured list was likely. Hes going to go back to New York, Mendoza said. We need to get more pictures on it. They werent clear here. But it looks like an IL situation. Winker was injured in the oblique area while making a throw to the plate in the third inning of the Mets 6-5 loss in the twinbill opener. I felt it pretty much right when I threw the ball, Winker said after the second game. Winker said it was likely an oblique injury but test results were not conclusive. Im going to get more tests done and then were going to wait until all thats settled to determine whats going on here, Winker said. Whatever it is, Im in good hands here. Itll be taken care of. Mendoza acknowledged theres always concern when the word oblique is mentioned. The 31-year-old Winker was making his first start in left field this season. He had played just two innings in left this year while serving mainly as a designated hitter. The Cardinals loaded the bases with one out in the third. Nolan Gorman hit a flyball to Winker, who made the catch and threw home to try and nab Brendan Donovan, who slid in safely before catcher Luis Torrens got the ball. Nolan Arenado was ultimately tagged out in a rundown on the play. 
        
     Jeff McNeil moved from second base to replace Winker in left. Luisangel Acua, who was making his first start at third base, switched to second. Mark Vientos entered to play third and take Winkers spot in the lineup. Winker had a walk and a sacrifice fly in his two plate appearances. Hes hitting .239 this season with one homer and 10 RBIs in 24 games. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-jesse-winker-injury-4c340f8abf79176f3ad996d564f4352c,sports
Naylor hits an RBI single in the 10th inning as the Diamondbacks top the Phillies 11-9,"PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Josh Naylor hit an RBI single in Arizonas three-run 10th inning, and the Diamondbacks topped the Philadelphia Phillies 11-9 on Sunday to salvage the finale of their weekend series. Geraldo Perdomo and Corbin Carroll each had three RBIs for Arizona, which led 7-2 after five innings.  Naylor drove in Eugenio Surez with his grounder into left field. Tim Tawa hit a sacrifice fly off Jos Alvarado (3-1), and Perdomo walked to force home a run. The Phillies got one back in the bottom of the 10th on Max Keplers sacrifice fly off Jalen Beeks. With one out and two runners on, Bryce Harper flied out to center and Kyle Schwarber bounced to first. Philadelphia trailed 8-6 before rallying in the ninth against Shelby Miller (3-0). Schwarber hit his 11th homer after Miller struck out the first two batters. Consecutive singles for Nick Castellanos, J.T. Realmuto and Alec Bohm produced the tying run. Miller did not allow an earned run in his first 13 appearances this season covering 13 2/3 innings. Beeks earned his first save of the season. Harper homered in the first for Philadelphia, and Weston Wilson connected for a three-run shot in the sixth. Schwarber extended his on-base streak to 40 games. Jose Herrera hit a two-run double in the fourth to stake Arizona to a 7-1 lead. Diamondbacks left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez struck out 10 in 5 1/3 innings. He was charged with four runs, three earned, and five hits. 
        
     It was Rodriguezs 12th career game with double-digit strikeouts. Ranger Surez was tagged for seven runs and seven hits in 3 2/3 innings in his first start of the season for the Phillies. He had been sidelined by low back stiffness. Alek Thomas singled and pinch-hitter Gabriel Moreno was hit by a pitch ahead of Perdomos bases-loaded walk in the 10th, providing a valuable insurance run for the Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks improved to 8-3 in series finales this season, including wins in seven of the last eight. After an off day, the Phillies start a three-game series at Tampa Bay. Zack Wheeler (2-1, 3.48 ERA) starts Tuesday night against the Rays Drew Rasmussen (1-2, 2.64 ERA). Arizona heads home to start a three-game series Monday against the New York Mets. Manager Torey Lovullo said Ryne Nelson (1-0, 5.82 ERA) will start in place of Corbin Burnes, whose turn in the rotation is being skipped because of right shoulder inflammation.  ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/diamondbacks-phillies-score-7faf119199a0f225189e450ee255d463,sports

PWHL regular-season champion Montreal opts to open playoffs against 3rd-place Ottawa over Minnesota,"The PWHL regular-season champion Montreal Victoire bucked the standings on Sunday in selecting to open the playoffs facing the third-place Ottawa Charge. In making the announcement, general manager Danile Sauvageau said the team followed a process that included consulting with her staff and players. Sauvageau, otherwise, didnt go into detail in choosing to face Ottawa over fourth-place Minnesota. There was a lot of considerations that went into it, there wasnt just one ingredient, she said. The best-of-five semifinals open Wednesday, with second-place Toronto hosting defending champion Frost. Montreal will open its postseason on Thursday against the Charge, who are making their first postseason appearance. There was very little to differentiate between Ottawa and Minnesota, given the teams finished in a three-way tie with Boston in having 44 points. Boston finished fifth based on having fewer regulation wins. Montreal finished the season series going 4-2 against both Ottawa and Minnesota  though the Charge won the final two outings, including a 3-2 victory on April 26. Since its launch in 2024, the six-team league adopted a rule in which the first-place team chooses whether to play the third- or fourth-place team rather than following the standings order.  Last year, Toronto finished first and went with the 1 vs. 4 matchup in selecting Minnesota as its first-round opponent. The Frost rallied from a 2-0 series deficit to eliminate the Sceptres before going on to claim the first Walter Cup in winning a five-game series over Boston. 
        
     The Victoire closed this season 4-4-2 and clinched first place on Saturday by virtue of Torontos 2-1 overtime loss to Ottawa. Similar to how the PWHLs inaugural regular season ended last year, the playoff race came down to the final day with Ottawa and Minnesota clinching the final two spots along with Montreal securing first place. Ottawa secured its first playoff berth on Katerina Mrazovas goal to seal the Charges 2-1 overtime win over Toronto. Minnesota clinched its berth while also eliminating Boston with an 8-1 win over the Fleet. The New York Sirens finished last for a second straight season. The PWHL is expanding to eight teams next season with the additions of Vancouver and Seattle. ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/womens-hockey-pwhl-playoffs-6601455199717fe40f3b587f925a87b2,sports

White Sox rally to beat Astros 5-4 in game shortened to 7 innings by rain,"CHICAGO (AP)  Luis Robert Jr. tied it with an RBI single with two outs in the sixth inning, stole second base and scored the go-ahead run on Edgar Queros single as the Chicago White Sox rallied to beat the Houston Astros 5-4 on Sunday in a game shortened to seven innings by rain. The game was delayed for 80 minutes before being called. It was the White Soxs second series victory of the season and their first series win against the Astros since July 2021. Chicago had lost or split its last six series with Houston. Chicago reliever Mike Vasil (1-1) earned his first career win after holding the Astros without a hit in 2 1/3 innings.  Lance McCullers Jr. made his first start for Houston since Game 3 of the 2022 World Series. The 31-year-old right-hander missed the entire 2023 and 2024 seasons, but kept the White Sox scoreless Sunday in 3 2/3 innings. McCullers allowed three hits, walked three and struck out four. Astros reliever Steven Okert (1-1) allowed two earned runs in one inning. Zach Dezenzo hit his first homer of the season for Houston and Mauricio Dubn had a two-run single.  With two outs in the sixth and a rain delay looming, Robert dropped a 2-1 pitch into center field for a single. Chase Meidroth came around to score from second, tying it at four. Robert stole second, enabling Quero to bring him home on what turned out to be the winning base hit. Entering Sunday, Chicago was 30th in the majors with runners in scoring position, hitting just .202 this season. The White Sox initially struggled, but finished the game 4 for 13 with runners in scoring position. All five of the teams runs came with two outs. The Astros will continue their road trip in Milwaukee, while the White Sox head to Kansas City for a four-game series against the Royals. Both series are scheduled to begin Monday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/astros-white-sox-score-3697873049fa10f5f9eb72910e8802de,sports
Royals power up with team-record 7 HRs vs Orioles,"BALTIMORE (AP)  Taking a break from their usual small-ball style, the Kansas City Royals flexed their muscles during an unprecedented display of power. The Royals smashed a franchise-record seven home runs Sunday in an 11-6 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. It was a surprising performance by a team that entered with a major league-low 18 homers in its first 34 games. Maikel Garcia went deep twice in his first career multihomer game. Jonathan India hit his first homer with Kansas City, and Luke Maile, Bobby Witt Jr., Vinnie Pasquantino and Michael Massey joined the fun by depositing balls over the wall at Camden Yards. Rather than work runners around the bases with bunts and singles, the Royals took the sluggers route to victory. Pretty remarkable, manager Matt Quatraro said. We made so much how we struggled offensively. A day like that is very satisfying. The Orioles hit four homers of their own in a see-saw duel, but in the end, the Royals  for a rare change  simply overpowered their foes.  It was definitely the first game weve had like that this year, the back-and-forth slugfest, Quatraro said. Guys just had to focus, and they didnt miss their pitches. ... It was a fun game, but nerve-wracking. The Royals hadnt hit as many as six homers in a game since 2020. On this day, however, the elements and the shorter fence in left field proved to be no challenge for a Kansas City team that had scored four runs or fewer in 29 of its first 34 games. 
        
     First thing I saw when the game started with the wind was blowing out to left-center, and they had brought the fences in from last year, Quatraro said. Its a hitters park. We know that. It sure was for the Royals, who pulled away in the eighth when Witt and Pasquantino connected against Yennier Cano, who hadnt allowed a run all year. Not surprisingly, it was the first time this season that Kansas City went deep on back-to-back trips to the plate. The Royals got homers from their leadoff hitter (India) and No. 9 hitter (Maile). For India, the trip around the bases after he cleared the left-field wall in the fifth inning was nothing short of delightful. It felt great, said India, who hit 63 homers in his first four seasons with Cincinnati before he was traded to Kansas City in November. I put a good swing on a good pitch.

Texas Rangers fire offensive coordinator Donnie Ecker after extended struggles,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  The Texas Rangers have fired offensive coordinator Donnie Ecker after the teams extended struggles scoring runs. The decision was announced after the Rangers won 8-1 on Sunday in their series finale against AL West-leading Seattle. Even with that outburst, the Rangers (17-18) were last in the American League with 113 runs. Before the win over the Mariners, the Rangers had scored just 30 runs during a 2-9 stretch, and half of those came when they finished with a season-high 15 runs against Oakland on Tuesday. They opened the series against Seattle with losses of 13-1 and 2-1. Chris Young, the teams president of baseball operations, said after lengthy discussions, it was the appropriate time to provide our hitters with a new voice as we pursue goals of winning the division and reaching the postseason. The team said the structure of the clubs hitting staff would be addressed in the coming days. The 39-year-old Ecker was in his fourth season as the clubs offensive coordinator after being hired on Nov. 1, 2021. He helped the Rangers win their only World Series title in 2023.  ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-hitting-coach-fired-476ec459926b80f98da6678e1292be83,sports

Soccer organizations might have to cover care costs for ex-players with dementia,"LONDON (AP)  Soccer organizations in Britain could be forced to pay toward the care costs of ex-players who have suffered brain conditions caused by heading balls, under proposals to be tabled in Parliament. Campaigners are drafting amendments to the Football Governance Bill with the aim of treating it as an industrial injuries issue and overseeing a scheme to provide care and support for those affected. The proposals seek to require the industry, including the Football Association and the Professional Footballers Association union, to provide the necessary financial support amid concerns existing arrangements are not fit for purpose. The Brain Health Fund, set up with an initial 1 million pounds (now $1.3 million) in 2023 by the PFA with support from the Premier League, has been criticized by campaigners. The Premier League said the fund has supported 121 families with at-home adaptations and care-home fees. Chris Evans, a lawmaker for governing party Labour, is among those who are pushing for the soccer authorities to contribute toward the high care costs faced by players who have gone on to develop Alzheimers, dementia and other neurological illnesses after they have retired. From Englands World Cup-winning team in 1966, both Jack and Bobby Charlton died with dementia, as did Martin Peters, Ray Wilson and Nobby Stiles. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/dementia-soccer-governance-bill-england-651e72a8af4d7c35c8a46b12bbeecb18,sports
Sweeney and Carpenter each homer and combine to drive in 11 as Tigers pound Angels 13-1,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Trey Sweeney and Kerry Carpenter each homered and had four hits, and they combined to drive in 11 runs as the Detroit Tigers pounded the Los Angeles Angels 13-1 on Sunday to win three of four in the series. After Sweeney singled in the first run off Jack Kochanowicz (1-5) in the second inning, Carpenter made it 3-0 with a two-run double to the right-field wall that Jo Adell kept inside the park but couldnt catch. Carpenters eighth homer was a three-run shot off reliever Michael Darrell-Hicks for an 8-0 lead in the sixth. Sweeney homered off Jose Fermin with two on in the seventh and added a two-run single in the eighth off Touki Toussaint. Sweeney finished with six RBIs and Carpenter drove in five  both career highs. Colt Keith hit a two-run homer, his third, for a 5-0 lead in the third. Reese Olson (4-2) tossed 5 2/3 shutout innings, allowing three hits and three walks while striking out eight. Brenan Hanifee allowed a run in 1 1/3 innings. Beau Brieske and Will Vest closed it out. Zach Neto had two hits and drove in the lone run for Los Angeles. Kochanowicz was tagged for five runs in five innings. The Angels, last in the AL West, are 1-3 to begin a 10-game homestand. Carpenters fifth double this season ignited the AL Central-leading Tigers in the middle of a 10-game trip that saw them lose two of three to the Astros on the first stop.

"White Sox reinstate Rojas, promote Freeman and Gilbert, DFA Dalbec","CHICAGO (AP)  The White Sox announced six roster moves ahead of Sundays series finale against the Houston Astros, including putting infielder Josh Rojas on the active roster for the first time this season and promoting two pitchers from Triple-A Charlotte. Rojas, a veteran who signed a one-year contract with Chicago in January, was reinstated from the 10-day injured list after a rehab appearance Tuesday with Charlotte. He suffered a hairline fracture in his right big toe during spring training and was set to make his first start with the White Sox on Sunday at third base. Im excited, its my opening day, Rojas said. Im still a little sore. I think its going to be one of those things that lingers around for a little bit, but its good enough to go. I can do everything full speed, so thats what I was waiting for. Rojas injured his toe on March 15. While he said he tried to play through it, Rojas knew he wouldnt be much help to the team playing at a level that he described as 25% to 30%. A lot of my game relies on being athletic, Rojas said. If I was just a power-hitting third baseman, it might be a different story, but Ive got to be able to run the bases full speed. Ive got to be able to make plays in the hole. Ive got to be able to beat out infield singles. Ive got to be able to do all the little things and my game relies heavily on being able to do those things. My toe was not in a place to be able to do that until about a week ago. Rojas spent the first 4 1/2 seasons of his career in Arizona before a midseason trade to Seattle in 2023. Last year with the Mariners, he hit .225 and played in 142 games. 
        
     Chicago also selected the contract of right-hander Caleb Freeman from Charlotte. The White Sox drafted Freeman out of Texas Tech in the 15th round in 2019 and promoted him to the majors for the first time in his career. Chicagos bullpen has struggled this season, ranking 23rd in ERA. The minor leagues are tough, this is going on Year 7 of pro ball right now, Freeman said. Im just grateful to be here and ready to go. Left-hander Tyler Gilbert was recalled from Charlotte as well. He has played nine games for the White Sox this season, posting a 1-1 record with a 5.59 ERA before being optioned on April 30. In one of several corresponding moves, Chicago placed lefty Fraser Ellard on the 15-day injured list with a left lat strain. Fraser suffered the injury in Saturdays 8-3 loss to Houston, in which he allowed two earned runs in two-thirds of an inning. The White Sox also optioned righty Penn Murfee to Charlotte and designated infielder Bobby Dalbec for assignment. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/white-sox-transactions-10074604f6ac9241b37c82d119b91fca,sports
TCU women first school outside of California to win NCAA beach volleyball championship,"GULF SHORES, Ala. (AP)  TCUs Daniela Alvarez and Tania Moreno came from behind to win the final match on Sunday as the second-seeded Horned Frogs wrapped up their first NCAA womens beach volleyball championship with a 3-2 victory over No. 4 seed Loyola Marymount. TCU (32-5) is the first school other than USC and UCLA to win the title. The Trojans won the first two and the previous four, while the Bruins won two straight in 2018-19. Alvarez and Moreno, who took a year off to play in the Olympics, returned to finish unbeaten in four years as a duo. Alvarez and Moreno dropped the first game 18-21 to LMUs Michelle Shaffer and Anna Pelloia before rallying to win the final two 21-15 and 15-6. The Lions (38-7) eliminated No. 5 seed USC in the quarterfinals and top-seed UCLA in the semifinals. TCU threes pair Sofia Izuzquizal and Allanis Navas earned a point with a 21-16, 21-13 sweep.

Red Sox ace Garrett Crochet is fine after line drive grazes his nose and glove,"BOSTON (AP)  Boston Red Sox ace Garrett Crochet had a close call Sunday when a line drive skipped off his glove and nose on its way to second base for a groundout. Red Sox manager Alex Cora rushed to the mound with a team trainer after the left-hander narrowly missed a direct hit off the bat of Minnesota shortstop Carlos Correa in the fourth inning. The ball skimmed off Crochets glove as he turned his head before it hit his nose and continued its path. Cora and the trainer asked for a towel and Crochet had a small trickle of blood coming out as he blew his nose. Fine, said Crochet after Bostons 5-4 loss to the Twins. It barely grazed me, obviously, just more shooken up at the initial impact than anything. He stayed in and struck out the next batter, Jonah Bride, with a sweeper. He then gave up Brooks Lees single to center before Harrison Bader bounced to short, ending the inning. I immediately go touch my nose just to see if it felt normal, he said. It was numb at first, just, like I said, from the initial impact. Asked if there was any blood coming out, he said: Yeah, just a little bit. Not very much at all. Crochet was pulled after the fifth inning, throwing 89 pitches and giving up a run on four hits with six strikeouts. Hes OK, obviously grinded through the last (inning), Cora said when asked about the shorter outing. The bigger concern may be his velocity on his fastball, which was down a couple mph most of the start. 
        
     Im not sure to be honest, Crochet said, when asked why it was lower. My in-between starts, bullpens, Im working on my mechanics, trying to just clean up command as a whole, velocity as well. Its just the second week of May, first week of May, thats just kind of what Im chalking it up to. The Red Sox picked up the lefty in a trade with the White Sox during the offseason and he agreed to a $170-million, six-year extension with Boston on April 1. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/crochet-red-sox-line-drive-nose-f251ac619b0ccb862b26ba8c9edb7eb7,sports
Guardians RHP Tanner Bibee exits against Toronto after 5 innings because of leg cramps,"TORONTO (AP)  Cleveland Guardians right-hander Tanner Bibee left Sundays start at Toronto after five innings because of cramping in both legs, but said afterward that he doesnt expect to miss any time. Bibee came to the mound to warm up for the bottom of the sixth inning, but appeared to be in discomfort, lifting his legs several times and calling the trainer out of the dugout. Left-hander Tim Herrin replaced Bibee, who earned the win in Clevelands 5-4 victory. Bibee allowed three runs, two earned, and five hits. It was definitely a battle outing, Bibee said. There was a lot of adversity today. For the most part, not having my best stuff, I feel like I battled pretty well. I got through five, felt like I could have got through six. Bibee struck out three and walked two. He left with a 4-3 lead. I thought Tanner, without having fastball command, pitched really well, manager Stephen Vogt said. Probably not as many strikes as he would have liked but I really liked the way he turned it around. I thought the fifth inning was his best and then, unfortunately, he had to come out. Toronto batters had three hits with runners in scoring position against Bibee, one more than hed allowed in his first six starts combined. Bibee said after the game that he was feeling better following treatment. Vogt said he expects Bibee to make his next scheduled start. Hell be good to go, Vogt said. 
        
     Bibee also left a July 2024 start against Detroit after five innings because of leg cramps. Our medical staff is on it, Tanner is on it, Vogt said of the recurring problem. He was able to throw almost all of his pitches before it started. Were going to figure it out. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/tanner-bibee-guardians-9a973b75792961a7eeeda497ea87edfe,sports
Plans are unclear for Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty and others with the Preakness 2 weeks away,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  Sovereigntys Kentucky Derby victory in the muck at Churchill Downs sparked curiosity over whether the colt can build on his signature win over a possibly drier, faster surface on the Triple Crown trail. The question now is whether that test will come sooner or later. Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott didnt sound like someone preparing Sovereignty for a trip to Baltimore to run in the 150th Preakness Stakes on May 17 at Pimlico Race course, offering a cautious approach Sunday. He mentioned a small scrape on the horses right front pastern, likely resulting from clipping heels with another horse coming out of the gate, but said it wasnt serious. The great thing about the Triple Crown is that not many horses are able to do it, Mott said, referring to American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify in 2018. I believe that hes a big, strong horse and if youre ever going to look at one and say, OK, if thats your goal and the goal of the owner, its still in the best interest of the horse. But were going to look long term. The immediate futures for horses who finished just behind Sovereignty or skipped the Derby altogether remained muddy, as well. Two-time Triple Crown-winning trainer Bob Baffert returned to Churchill Downs after a four-year suspension with two entries but scratched Wood Memorial winner Rodriguez, pointing him toward the Preakness rather than Citizen Bull, who finished 15th. Fellow Hall of Famer Todd Pletcher scratched his lone Derby entrant, Grande, on Friday. Theres also a large group of hopefuls who earned Derby points during qualifying and could try other Triple Crown stops. 
        
     The Preakness is the shortest race at 1 3/16 mile, but its quick two-week turnaround from the 1 1/4-mile Derby often gives pause for trainers and ownership groups. With the Belmont Stakes set for June 7, five weeks after the Derby and separated three weeks from the Preakness, that race is viewed by many as a preferred option. That final jewel of the Triple Crown, taking place at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York for a second consecutive year, features the same distance as the Derby because of the shape of the track instead of its traditional 1 1/2-miles. Redemption might be in order for Derby runner-up Journalism, who fell short as the 3-1 favorite. Trainer Michael McCarthy said in a news release that Weve got no complaints and praised his colts effort to rally into the lead briefly before Sovereignty, the 7-1 third choice, overtook him in the stretch and won by 1 1/2 lengths. With a field this size in a race like this, its all about the trip, McCarthy said. It didnt quite work out the way we hoped, but he ran a good race against a good horse. Baeza finished third but trainer John Shirreffs pointed to the Belmont for his California-based horse. Final Gambit charged from last to finish fourth among 19 horses, and trainer Brad Cox said, This gives us confidence to try a fast dirt surface in the future. Mott and Godolphin LLC ownership group representative Michael Banahan expressed the same faith in Sovereignty for his next step. The newest Derby champion emerged briefly on the shed row for media and onlookers, and his handlers felt good about the horses initial condition. They plan to watch him the next few days before making a decision about the immediate part of his bright future. Were just doing the right thing for the horse, what he needs to do, Banahan said. He has a big year, hopefully to continue down the road here. Theres an awful lot of nice races that youd like to put on his resume, as well. So, were just doing the right thing for him. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",https://apnews.com/article/triple-crown-kentucky-derby-churchill-downs-c8c4a8a094a56046ac1dac3ed03b7170,sports
Gauff taking a lot of positives from her performance in Madrid despite loss to Sabalenka in final,"MADRID (AP)  Coco Gauff got past the disappointment of losing the Madrid Open final to Aryna Sabalenka and was celebrating a solid week that will make her the top-ranked American woman on Monday. The 21-year-old Gauff is set to reach No. 3 in the world, moving past countrywoman Jessica Pegula. Overall theres a lot of positives to take, Gauff said. Obviously disappointed with maybe how I played (in the final). I feel like I could have showed up better. But I went from an 0-6 set in the first round and made it to the final, so happy with that. Obviously hoping for more next time. Gauff lost in straight sets  6-3, 7-6 (3)  to the top-ranked Sabalenka on Saturday. She had started her campaign by rallying to a 0-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory over Dayana Yastremska, then picked up straight-set wins over Ann Li, Belinda Bencic, Mirra Andreeva and second-ranked Iga Swiatek in the semifinals. Gauff overpowered Swiatek in a commanding 6-1, 6-1 victory. Speaking on the week as a whole, on the ground I think today was like the only day where I felt really tested, and obviously in my first round, too, Gauff said after the final. So theres a lot of positives to take, and I think especially coming maybe from the last few weeks where I didnt feel as confident on the ground, I think it is a step in the right direction, and just trying to look at the positives of it all. I dont like losing, first final loss since the French Open, so its a feeling that I know I dont like. It was only the second loss in a WTA tour final for Gauff, with the other coming against Swiatek at the 2022 French Open. 
        
     I hate losing a lot, and especially in finals, because its like youre so close, Gauff said. But obviously if I can lose this and go a few more finals undefeated Ill take that. Each time its a learning experience, and maybe I needed to feel this loss again to be motivated again, even more motivated for the next one. The 2023 U.S. Open champion squandered a set point at 5-4 in the second set in the final against Sabalenka in Madrid. She lost 17 points in a row at one stage in the first set on the Caja Magica center court. Gauff had four more winners than Sabalenka, but also seven more unforced errors. My first serve has been such a weapon this week, so just wish I could have served better (in the final), Gauff said. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/coco-gauff-positive-sabalenka-madrid-open-36672229401ac61970790061de378c25,sports
Cubs Shota Imanaga leaves after straining his hamstring while attempting to complete a double play,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Chicago Cubs left-hander Shota Imanaga left Sundays game at Milwaukee after straining his left hamstring, adding another injury to the banged-up rotation for the NL Central leaders. Imanaga got hurt when he left the mound to cover first base on a potential double play during the Cubs 4-0 loss to the Brewers. He departed his previous start with cramping in each of his legs. Well probably do some imaging to see whats going on, Cubs manager Craig Counsell said. Hes never had any lower body muscle strains, so hes a little unsure of what the feeling means. But he felt something, for sure, so well just get it checked out tomorrow and go from there. Counsell said the Cubs would need more information before determining whether Imanaga needed to go on the injured list. The Cubs already have left-hander Justin Steele out for the season with an elbow injury and right-hander Javier Assad on the IL with an oblique issue. If Imanaga has to go on the IL, the Cubs could move Chris Flexen into the rotation. They also have Cade Horton at Triple-A Iowa, and off days coming up on Thursday and May 15. Imanagas injury occurred in the sixth inning of a scoreless game. The Brewers had runners on first and second with one out when Christian Yelich hit a grounder toward first baseman Michael Busch. Imanaga left the mound to try to complete a 1-6-3 double play, but he was in clear discomfort as he headed toward first base. 
        
     As Yelich beat the throw to first, Imanaga grabbed the back of his left leg. After Cubs officials checked on Imanaga and removed him from the game, the pitcher walked with a clear limp as he headed to the dugout. Imanaga pitched five innings in Tuesdays 9-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates before departing because of leg cramps. He was charged with two runs and four hits in 5 2/3 innings against the Brewers. Imanaga noted that he felt amazing before Sundays game, so he isnt sure what caused this latest problem. Im at the point where I dont know exactly whats going on, Imanaga said through a translator. I dont know what the damage is. Well have to see going into tomorrow. Imanaga, 31, is 18-5 with a 2.89 ERA since signing a four-year, $53 million contract with the Cubs in January 2024. The Japanese left-hander finished fourth in the NL Rookie of the Year voting last season. The Cubs got another scare in the ninth inning when star outfielder Kyle Tucker appeared to hurt himself sliding into second on a double steal. Tucker got checked out by Cubs officials, but he remained in the game and expressed optimism afterward that he would be available Monday when Chicago begins a series with the San Francisco Giants. He felt a little something in his right hip when we went out there, then he thought it went away, Counsell said. Well check on him tomorrow, but (were) pretty optimistic. The Brewers had their own injury issues. Right fielder Sal Frelick departed in the fourth with left knee discomfort and was getting an MRI after the game. Right-hander Freddy Peralta left after throwing 89 pitches in six innings because his groin was bothering him, though he downplayed it after the game. I didnt want anything to get worse or something like that, but its nothing that I think I have to be concerned about, Peralta said. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/chicago-cubs-shota-imanaga-374cbe7a974b0d9e011d37ffd755b2ad,sports

Stephen Kolek pitches into the 6th in first MLB start as Padres blank Pirates for 5th straight win,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  Stephen Kolek pitched 5 2/3 scoreless innings in his first major league start and combined with four relievers for the San Diego Padres eighth shutout of the season, a 4-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday for their fifth straight win. Kolek was recalled from Triple-A El Paso before the game. He made 42 relief appearances for the Padres last season as a rookie after being selected from Seattle in the Rule 5 draft. Kolek, who had a 6.38 ERA in five starts for El Paso this season, allowed four hits, struck out four and walked two. Jeremiah Estrada, Adrian Morejon, Wandy Peralta and Jason Adam followed Kolek. The eight shutouts are the most in the majors. Xander Bogaerts had three RBIs for the Padres, who scored all their runs in the first two innings off Andrew Heaney (2-3), who was pulled with two outs in the fourth. Manny Machado doubled and scored on Bogaerts single in the first inning. In the second, Elias Diaz led off with his third home run of the season and Bogaerts hit a two-run double to make it 4-0. Heaney allowed eight hits and four walks while striking out three. The Pirates have lost four games in a row and seven of their last eight. Machado had three hits and Bogaerts, Diaz and Luis Arraez added two apiece. The Pirates Joey Bart, KeBryan Hayes, Matt Gorski and Tommy Pham had two hits each. Down 4-0 in the second, the Pirates put two runners on with one out, but Adam Frazier struck out and Hayes was picked off at second base.

"Contreras, Donovan spark Cardinals to 6-5 victory over Mets in first game of doubleheader","ST. LOUIS (AP)  Willson Contreras drove in three runs on three hits, including a homer, and Brendan Donovan had two hits and two RBIs to spark the St. Louis Cardinals to a 6-5 victory over the New York Mets in the first game of a doubleheader on Sunday. Erick Fedde (2-3) pitched into the sixth inning, allowing three runs on six hits and five walks. Ryan Helsley worked the ninth for his fifth save in seven chances. Blade Tidwell (0-1), a 23-year-old right-hander and the Mets 15th-ranked prospect, lost his major league debut. He gave up six runs on nine hits in 3 2/3 innings, becoming the first Mets starter this year to give up more than four runs. That ended a 33-game streak to begin the season of starters allowing four runs or fewer, which was the longest in the National League in the modern era. Nolan Arenado and Victor Scott II each had two hits with a walk. Pete Alonso hit two doubles and Luisangel Acua, who made his first major league start at third base, added three singles for the Mets. A one-out, two-run single by Francisco Lindor with the bases loaded in the eighth got the Mets within 6-5. Reliever JoJo Romero entered and walked a batter before striking out Alonso looking and getting Brandon Nimmo to fly out. St. Louis chased Tidwell with two outs in the fourth after 82 pitches. Donovan and Contreras each had two-run singles for a 6-2 lead. St. Louis second baseman Nolan Gorman ran and made a sliding catch of popup behind first base in the second inning. Contreras avoided a collision but stepped on Gormans glove hand. Gorman sustained a cut on his left index finger. New York had won its last nine games against St. Louis. Mets RHP Tyler Megill (3-2, 1.74) was to face Andre Pallante (2-2, 4.13) in the nightcap. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-cardinals-score-0ca8aff777ffed003840ef8e8c924f95,sports
Ruud beats Draper in Madrid Open final to win his first Masters 1000 title,"MADRID (AP)  Casper Ruud became the first Norwegian to win a Masters 1000 title after beating Jack Draper 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in the Madrid Open final on Sunday. The former second-ranked Ruud rallied from 5-3 down in the first set and sealed the victory after capitalizing on his lone break at 2-2 in the third.  The 26-year-old Ruud yelled and thrust both arms into the air after clinching the win on his first match point on the Caja Magica clay court. Its been a long time coming, Ruud said. (This was) one of the really big goals I dreamed about when I was young, so its an incredible feeling to accomplish it. Also the way I did it today, it was a great match. I knew Jack had been playing unbelievable all year, and especially in this tournament, so I knew that if I didnt bring my A-plus game, I was going to be whooped around the court. The 15th-ranked Ruud will return to the top 10 thanks to his campaign in Madrid, reaching No. 7 in the rankings on Monday. Luckily, I played really well, Ruud said. Jack has become such an incredible player, on any surface now ... This is a really big boost for me, and I would like to keep it going. The 13-time tour champion is the first Norwegian to lift a Masters 1000 trophy since the series was introduced in 1990, according to the ATP. It was Ruuds third such final after losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas in Monte Carlo last year and to Carlo Alcaraz in Miami in 2022. 
        
     Ruud has more titles (12) on clay than any other player since the start of 2020, according to the ATP. Draper won at Indian Wells in March. After his quarterfinal victory in Madrid, he secured a top-five debut in the rankings.  Draper said Ruud was braver than him in the key moments on Sunday. You deserve this, he said. Youve obviously put in so much hard work and constantly had very good years on the tour ... This sport is brutal, but I think this loss is going to make me better, so Ill keep trying. The tournament in Madrid was disrupted early last week because of a major blackout that brought Spain and Portugal to a standstill on Monday, prompting the postponement of 22 matches in total. Ruud had needed to take a couple of painkillers during his semifinal win over Francisco Cerundolo after feeling a rib ailment during his warmup, but there were no signs of any injury on Sunday.  Draper, who like Ruud had not lost a set on his way to the final, served for the first set at 5-4 but couldnt finish it. The 23-year-old British player was visibly upset, and kept talking to himself and to his staff for a while during the changeover. The mens side of the draw lost most of its top players early. Home-crowd favorite Carlos Alcaraz had to withdraw from the tournament because of an injury, and Novak Djokovic lost to Matteo Arnaldi in his opening match. Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka defeated Coco Gauff in the womens final on Saturday. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/madrid-open-ruud-draper-e05483cf675df62a13d658ac68f8a320,sports
Garcia goes deep twice as Royals hit a club-record 7 HRs in 11-6 win over Orioles,"BALTIMORE (AP)  Maikel Garcia hit two of Kansas Citys franchise-record seven home runs, a rare long-ball barrage that enabled the Royals to beat the Baltimore Orioles 11-6 on Sunday. Bobby Witt Jr. broke a 5-5 tie with a seventh-inning solo shot off Yennier Cano (0-1), and Vinnie Pasquantino followed with drive into the right-field seats. Cano had not allowed a run in his previous 12 outings this season.  Jonathan India, Luke Maile and Michael Massey also went deep for the Royals. Masseys ninth-inning shot set the club record for home runs in a game. Kansas City entered with a major league-low 18 homers in its first 34 games. It hadnt hit as many as six in a game since 2020. Jackson Holliday went deep twice for Baltimore in his first career multihomer game. Ryan OHearn and Cedric Mullins each hit a solo shot. The teams combined for 10 solo homers, tying the major league record, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. It also happened during a White Sox-Tigers game on May 28, 1995, and Diamondbacks versus Cubs on May 20, 2022. Orioles starter Kyle Gibson gave up three runs and five hits in four innings. In his season debut on Tuesday, the 37-year-old yielded four first-inning homers to the Yankees and was pulled in the fourth after allowing nine runs and 11 hits. Making his 100th career start, Kansas Citys Michael Lorenzen surrendered a career-high four home runs and was pulled in the fifth. The four HRs equaled the total he gave up in his previous six starts this season.  Angel Zerpa (2-0) gave up one run in 1 2/3 innings to earn the win. 
        
     Baltimore scored twice and had the tying run at the plate with no outs in the eighth when Lucas Erceg entered and got three straight outs. Kansas City took two of three for its first regular-season series win in Baltimore since 2014. The Royals also won the season series from the Orioles (4-2) for the first time since 2018. Royals: LHP Cole Ragans (1-1, 4.40 ERA) starts Monday night in the opener of a four-game series against the visiting Chicago White Sox.

"Kurtz triples, scores and Ferguson retires 3 straight in the 9th to lift As over Marlins 3-2","MIAMI (AP)  Rookie Nick Kurtz tripled with one out in the ninth inning and scored on a pinch hit by Tyler Soderstrom to lift the Athletics to a 3-2 victory over the Miami Marlins on Sunday. Kurtz sent an 0-1 pitch from Anthony Bender (1-1) down the left-field line and Soderstrom singled up the middle two pitches later to give the Athletics the three-game series and improve to an AL-best 13-7 on the road. The Athletics (19-16) grabbed the lead in the second when Miguel Andujar and Jacob Wilson led off with singles against Marlins starter Edward Cabrera. Both scored on a two-out double by Gio Urshela. Dane Myers threw Urshela out at home on a single by Jhonny Pereda to end the inning. Miami tied it in the fourth with a two-out, bases-empty rally off Athletics starter JP Sears. Connor Norby and Kyle Stowers had base hits and Myers drove in both with a double. Sears allowed two runs on four hits in 6 1/3 innings. Mitch Spence (1-0) got five outs for the win and Tyler Ferguson retired three straight for his first save. Cabrera gave up two runs on seven hits in 5 2/3. Kurtz notched his first extra-base hit in his 11th game since being called up from Triple-A Las Vegas. Soderstrom moved from first base to the outfield to get the 6-foot-5 Kurtz in the lineup.

F1s governing body studying cost cap and ponders McLarens proposal on paying to lodge complaints,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  The president of Formula 1s governing body is studying the cost cap that teams operate under and is considering eliminating it because managing it has become such a headache for the FIA.  Mohammed Ben Sulayem also said before the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday that he supports a proposal floated by McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown that would require teams making any allegations against another to lodge a formal complaint with a monetary deposit. Brown suggested the money would be returned if the allegations proved true, but it should count against the cost cap if unproven as a deterrent to baseless and damaging claims.  Ben Sulayem wants to adopt the rule, but is studying if it should count against the cost cap. That then led him to vocalize his frustration with the entire cost cap system, in which the FIA must review each teams annual spending and make sure they are within the budget.  Im looking at the cost cap and its just giving the FIA a headache. So whats the point of it? Ben Sulayem said in his trackside office about an hour before the race around Hard Rock Stadium.  I dont see the point. I really dont.  The cost cap was introduced in 2021 with new rules that restricts spending and a sliding scale of aerodynamic and CFD testing  financial regulations that has made the competition closer. The cost caps prevent the bigger teams from being able to endlessly spend on development that the smaller teams cannot afford.  
        
     The cost cap for the 2025 season is $140.4 million. As for Browns idea, which Brown raised in Miami by using a bottled labeled TIRE WATER to troll Red Bull Racings accusations that McLaren is using water to manipulate its tire temperatures, Ben Sulayem was in full agreement on charging teams to lodge an allegation.  You cannot just accuse someone without a written complaint, and that protest, you have to pay money, said Ben Sulayem, who even tossed out $50,000 as the potential fee charged. Finally, Ben Sulayem said he expects clarification to the driver code of conduct policy to be completed next week, but he was explicit in that he wont be lifting the ban on profanity. Drivers as of this season can be fined for cursing when in official FIA appearances and the rule has been highly criticized by drivers from multiple series managed by the governing body.  Ben Sulayem said the clarifications coming will address how the code of conduct is applied to individual series, but he wont be lifting the cursing restriction. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-ben-sulayem-a6509003abc8cf260c9afa0d5d90f3ee,sports
Peralta helps Milwaukee avoid a sweep as Cubs lose Imanaga to hamstring injury,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Freddy Peralta pitched six sharp innings to help Milwaukee beat the Chicago Cubs 4-0 on Sunday, with the Brewers lineup breaking through after an injury knocked out left-hander Shota Imanaga in the sixth inning. Milwaukee prevented the Cubs from earning their first road sweep of the Brewers since October 2015.  The game was scoreless when Imanaga (3-2) strained his left hamstring while heading toward first base in an unsuccessful attempt to complete a 1-6-3 double play. Imanaga grabbed the back of his left leg at the end of the play. When Imanaga departed, the Brewers had runners on the corners with two outs. Julian Merryweathers first offering was a wild pitch that brought home Chourio. Merryweather also surrendered an RBI single to Daz Cameron and a two-run double to Caleb Durbin. Cameron entered in the fourth after starting right fielder Sal Frelick departed with left knee discomfort. Peralta (4-2) struck out seven while lowering his ERA to 2.18. He improved to 7-2 with a 2.92 ERA against the Cubs in his career. The Cubs had a chance to take an early lead when Michael Busch drew a leadoff walk in the second inning and was awarded second base an out later due to an obstruction call on Brewers first baseman Rhys Hoskins. Peralta recovered by retiring Pete Crow-Armstrong and Miguel Amaya to end the threat.  Peralta increased his career strikeout total to 997. The only pitchers to collect 1,000 strikeouts as Brewers are Yovanni Gallardo (1,226), Ben Sheets (1,206) and Teddy Higuera (1,081). 
        
     The Cubs return home for a three-game series with the San Francisco Giants. Right-hander Landen Roupp (2-2, 5.10 ERA) pitches for the Giants and left-hander Matthew Boyd (2-2, 2.70 ERA) starts for the Cubs on Monday. The Brewers open a three-game home series with the Houston Astros on Monday.

Bochum draw with Heidenheim leaves both still facing relegation,"HEIDENHEIM, Germany (AP)  Bochum and Heidenheim are both staring relegation in the face after the struggling teams drew 0-0 in a tense Bundesliga encounter on Friday. A defeat would have condemned bottom club Bochum to the drop but a point means it survives at least one more week. The Ruhr side remained last in the Bundesliga, equal on points with Kiel. The result was equally frustrating for Heidenheim, which remained third from bottom, four points above Bochum and Kiel, but four behind Hoffenheim, which has a game in hand. Heidenheim lost goalkeeper Kevin Mller to injury in the 50th minute, when he was taken off on a stretcher after a goalmouth clash with Ibrahima Sissoko. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/heidenheim-bochum-bundesliga-17701506fe7db5d833cfc4da59c3cfa8,sports
Late penalty for Torino scuppers Venezia hopes of escaping Serie A drop zone,"TURIN, Italy (AP)  Kike Prezs first Serie A goal was not enough to lift Venezia out of the relegation zone after Torino scored late to secure a 1-1 draw at home on Friday. Visiting Venezia had already seen an early goal disallowed for offside when Prez put them ahead after 35 minutes, squeezing between two defenders and angling home a low right-foot shot. However, Nikola Vlai converted a 77th-minute penalty to give the home side a share of the points. The result was harsh for Venezia, for which a first away win since February 2022 would have lifted it out of the bottom three. Instead, it remained third from bottom, one point above Empoli and a point behind Lecce, both of whom have a game in hand. The bottom three go down, with last-placed Monza almost certain to drop. Torino was in 10th. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/torino-venezia-seriea-5c844f0d1c1871c84a7dc7f7b31e294a,sports
De Bruyne not finished yet as he gives Man City crucial win over Wolves,"MANCHESTER, England (AP)  Kevin De Bruyne scored and gave Manchester City a crucial but barely deserved 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers and a lift into third place in the Premier League on Friday. The Belgian is leaving City at the end of the season and still providing good memories thanks to his goal against a team that won its last six league encounters. With three games left, City was a firm favourite to take one of the Champions League places. Slightly against the run of play, De Bruyne side-footed home a cut back from Jeremy Doku 10 minutes before halftime in his second-to-last appearance at Etihad Stadium. Wolves will be aggrieved at not taking something from the game but were undone by poor finishing and the City goalposts. In the 22nd, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde opted to pass when it looked easier to shoot but Marshall Munetsi at full stretch could not get on the end of his inviting cross. Five minutes later, Rayan Ait-Nouri hit the post then saw his rebound cleared off the line by Josko Gvardiol. The woodwork saved City again in the second half when a Matheus Cunha strike crashed off the post. City coach Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, scotched rumors hes about to leave the club. He recently signed a contract extension until June 2027. Guardiola said he will take a break from management when he leaves City but he told Sky Sports he did not know when that would be. 
        
     I didnt say Im leaving now, or the end of season, or the end of contract, I said when I finish my time here, be it one, two, three, four, five years, the Catalan said. What I am saying is when I am finished here I will take a break. Some Manchester City fans protested the clubs season ticket pricing and policies before the game, taking their seats only after the match kicked off. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/man-city-wolves-premier-league-bruyne-b01f9caae7b0a505d9d115cb43fc129c,sports
The Whitecaps rise has been one of the surprises of the MLS season so far,"Before the first leg of the Vancouver Whitecaps CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinal against Lionel Messi and Inter Miami, supporters stretched banners across one end of BC Place.  You allowed us to dream again, one said.  The fan sentiment expressed in the tifo has spilled over to the Major League Soccer season as the Whitecaps defy expectations.  I dont know if Ive really been a part of such a close locker room before. Everyone who has come in in the last couple of years has said the same thing, and I think that speaks volumes, top scorer Brian White said. And I think you see that on the field, how close this group is.  While its still early, the Whitecaps sit atop MLS with a 7-1-2 record. Theyve allowed just seven goals, tied for fewest in the league, while scoring 20, tied for most.  White, a new Jersey native who joined Vancouver in 2021, has six total goals and was named the MLS Player of the Month for April. He scored four of those goals in a mid-month match against Austin. Across all competitions this year, the Whitecaps have lost just twice in 18 total games.  This group of guys is amazing, and its not just to say that, I really believe it, said Serbian defender Ranko Veselinovi, who has been with Vancouver since 2020. All the guys are on the same page, we work with each other, we have good relationships. Thats the foundation for success and I think this year we can do special things.  The fast start stands in contrast to Vancouvers more recent history.  
        
     Last season, the Whitecaps finished eighth in the standings and routed the Portland Timbers 5-0 in a wild-card game. But they fell to LAFC in the first round of the playoffs.  The Whitecaps have qualified for the playoffs in three of the past five years but havent advanced out of the first round in that span. Since the team joined the league in 2011, the furthest theyve gone in the playoffs is the quarterfinals, in 2015 and 2017.  Coach Vanni Sartini was fired in late November after three seasons at the helm, and Vancouver didnt name his replacement  Danish coach Jesper Sorensen  until mid-January.  Adding to the offseason upheaval was the announcement the Whitecaps were for sale. Greg Kerfoot has been owner of the club since 2002, when it was part of the North American Soccer League. Steve Luczo, Jeff Mallett and former NBA star Steve Nash joined Kerfoot in 2008, and the Whitecaps became part of MLS in 2011. A new owner has not emerged, and there are concerns among the fanbase that the team could be moved.  But in the meantime, the Whitecaps keep winning. Vancouvers rise has grabbed attention because of the 5-1 aggregate victory over Inter Miami that sent the Whitecaps through to the Champions Cup final at Cruz Azul on June 1. Much has been made about the star-studded Miami teams failure  but Vancouver demonstrated its newfound resurgence with its 3-1 second-leg victory on Miamis home turf. White and Pedro Vite scored goals just two minutes apart to open the second half before Sebastian Berhalter added a third in the 71st minute.  Cruz Azul downed Tigres 2-1 on aggregate in the other semifinal to win a spot in the final. Should the Whitecaps defeat the Liga MX club, they would qualify for a spot in the 2029 Club World Cup and this summers Intercontinental Cup.  Were dreamers, you know, Berhalter said. Why not? Were a small market club. But why not? Why not win the whole thing? Theres also the MLS season. The Whitecaps host Real Salt Lake on Saturday.  The skys the limit to what we can achieve this year, White said. Hopefully, we stay healthy, stay humble, know where we come from, believe in ourselves and continue to push hard. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/vancouver-whitecaps-mls-concacaf-champions-cup-b343a98bb36ae475e611e8e192173f92,sports
"McLaren can be beaten, but Verstappen must be perfect: 5 takeaways from F1s Japanese Grand Prix","McLaren remains the team to beat in Formula 1, but Max Verstappens victorious drive for Red Bull at the Japanese Grand Prix showed only excellence is good enough. Ahead of this weeks Bahrain Grand Prix, here are five takeaways from Suzuka: Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri still have the fastest all-round car on the F1 grid, but McLaren can no longer achieve the sort of win streak that Red Bull had to start its all-conquering 2023 season. Verstappens win showed just how hard it is to beat McLaren. The four-time champion had to do almost everything perfectly in both qualifying and the race. Even then, McLaren came painfully close to taking the lead when Norris drove over the grass at the pitlane exit while trying to get past Verstappen. We really maximized the weekend, Verstappen said, adding he got an assist from cool weather reducing his tire wear, a key aspect where McLaren has had an edge. The last time anyone other than Verstappen scored a point for Red Bull was five races, four months and three teammates ago. Sergio Perez, Liam Lawson and now Yuki Tsunoda have all been nowhere near Verstappen, something which shows how difficult it is for anyone but him to tame a Red Bull car which is considered unusually tricky to drive. Getting pole position and the win in Japan was a showcase of Verstappens skill and adaptability. Tsunoda was disappointed to be 12th at his home race. It was still the best finish for Red Bulls second car since Perez was 10th in Las Vegas in November. 
        
     Andrea Kimi Antonelli had a day to remember as the 18-year-old Italian became the youngest driver in F1 history to lead a Grand Prix and to set the fastest lap. The Mercedes driver, who finished sixth, said it was a nice feeling to lead and now the next goal is to do that on the only lap that matters, the final one. Antonelli cant break Verstappens record as youngest race winner, though. The Dutch driver was 18 years and 228 days old when he won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix. Antonelli will be three days older than that at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday. Antonelli is the standout in F1s biggest rookie class in years, though Racing Bulls Isack Hadjar is improving. He finished eighth in Japan after a tough start to the year. At least Ferrari scored some points after a double disqualification in China, but it wasnt a race to make fans hearts beat faster. Charles Leclerc said his run to fourth place was very boring and Lewis Hamilton admitted it was a lonely race after finishing seventh. Besides missing the podium, Ferrari missed out on the excitement it wanted to create when it signed seven-time champion Hamilton. After the drama of his sprint race win in China and being disqualified the next day, Hamilton was managing expectations at Suzuka. Moving the Japanese Grand Prix to the spring last year, away from its usual fall slot, meant F1 gets Japans famed cherry blossom into the TV footage and cuts travel distances between races. It also brought a headache for organizers. Japans rainy season is in the summer, so in the meantime the grass around the track was dormant and dry. Grass fires forced a red flag in qualifying Saturday and two in practice the day before. Rain helped the track avoid more disruption Sunday.",https://apnews.com/article/f1-verstappen-mclaren-red-bull-suzuka-9e92607e8a2b68dc31ba57bf9c875aaa,sports
Hamlin takes the lead out of pits and holds off Byron in overtime to win at Darlington Raceway,"DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP)  Denny Hamlin did his job so his pit crew could do its most stellar stop at the perfect time. Hamlin came into the pits after a final caution in third place and told himself to hit every mark, then let his guys take over.  And thats what the Joe Gibbs Racing group did, pulling off a perfect winning moment that sent Hamlin out with the lead. He took over on the final restart and held off William Byron to win the Goodyear 400 on Sunday.  It was Hamlins 56th career NASCAR win, his fifth at Darlington Raceway and his second straight this season When you think about 56 wins, thats a huge deal, said Gibbs, Hamlins longtime car owner.  Hamlin said he hung on throughout as Byron and others looked like they might pull out victory. Instead, Hamlin waited out his time and then pounced as he broke away during the green-white-checkered finish. I can still do it, I can do it at a high level and look forward to winning a lot of races this year, Hamlin said.  Hamlin won for a second straight week after his success at Martinsville.  Hamlin chose the outside lane for a final restart and shot out to the lead and pulled away from series points leader Byron and NASCAR wins leader Christopher Bell.  Hamlin looked like hed have a strong finish, but not a winning one as Ryan Blaney passed Tyler Reddick for the lead with three laps left. But moments later, Kyle Larson spun out forcing a final caution and the extra laps.  
        
     It was then time for Hamlins Joe Gibbs Racing pit crew to shine as it got him out quickly and in the lead. Byron, who led the first 243 laps, was second with Hamlins JGR teammate Bell in third.  There are two people I really love right now, my pit crew and Kyle Larson, Hamlin said to a round of boos from those in the stands.  Reddick was fourth and Blaney was fifth. The rest of the top 10 finishers were Chris Buescher, Ross Chastain, Chase Elliott, Ty Gibbs and Kyle Busch.  Hamlin credited the past two victories to his pit crew. The pit crew just did an amazing job, he said. They won it last week, they won it this week. Its all about them.  Blaney had thought he was clear to his first-ever Darlington victory after getting by Reddick late. When he saw the caution flag for Larsons spin, he said he thought, Oh, no! I thought we had the race won.  So did Byron, who sought was to become the first NASCAR driver in nearly 25 years to lead every lap on the way to victory. He got shuffled down the standings during the last round of green-flag pit stops and could not recover. It was looking like it was going to be a perfect race and we were going to lead every lap, he said.  But once we lost control, it was too late to get back up there, Byron said.  Kyle Larson, who won the Southern 500 here in 2023, had high hopes for a second Darlington win. But he slid into the inside wall coming off the second turn on lap three and went right to garage where his team worked the next couple of hours to get him back on track. Larson returned on lap 164 after falling 161 laps off the pace. Larson finished next to last in 37th.  Greg Biffle, the last NASCAR driver to win consecutive Cup Series victories at Darlington in 2006 and 2007, drove the pace car for the Goodyear 400 on Sunday. Biffle has had an eventful few months, flying rescue missions with his helicopter into areas of the Southeast affected by devastating Hurricane Helene in September. Biffle was planning a weeklong trip to the Bahamas when his phone started going off about people stranded in parts of Western North Carolina.  I went to the hangar and the power was out, Biffle said. We got the hangar down open with the tug and got the helicopter out. Once I got in the air, I realized what had taken place.  Biffle then flew the next 11 days from sunup to sundown.

Hamlin still has the fire to win and marked himself a title contender with a second straight victory,"DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP)  Denny Hamlins fire to win is still there. He showed that again at Darlington Raceway. At an age when many of his contemporaries for the past two decades are in the broadcast booth, have moved on to other ventures or simply are holding on without much success, the 44-year-old Hamlin appears at the top of his game. Hamlin followed up his victory at Martinsville by winning in overtime at Darlington Raceway on Sunday. It was his 56th career NASCAR win, his fifth at the track nicknamed Too Tough To Tame and his first consecutive victories since 2012. He has marked himself as a serious contender for his missing accolade, a Cup Series title that hes watched others at Joe Gibbs Racing accomplish during his 20 years with the organization. And hes done working smarter, not harder. As Ive gotten older, Ive realized that Im not going to win these races on raw talent anymore, Hamlin said. Im going to have to outwork people. Im going to have to look at things that maybe other people arent looking at. Team owner Joe Gibbs testified to Hamlins diligence in working the simulator to gain every advantage, not just for his No. 11 team but for all of Gibbs drivers. Hamlin said that approach led him to victory at Darlington, where he knew midway through the race that he didnt have enough to match up with leader William Byron, who led the first 243 laps. But he, crew chief Chris Gayle and his pit crew took advantage of their stops to keep Hamlin moving forward when the race got flagged toward the end. 
        
     Hamlin was third on the final caution  a spinout by Kyle Larson that ruined the victory chances of Ryan Blaney, who had just passed for the lead with three laps remaining  entering the pits and got out in first. He chose the outside lane and burst forward on the restart, never challenged for the victory. Hamlin, Gibbs and Gayle praised the pit crew, who no doubt played a major role in the latest JGR victory. They are just villains. They just want that moment where they can go in there and just rip everybodys hearts out, win the race and walk away, Gayle said. Hamlin has been a bit of a villain, too, for fans. When he said right after getting out of his car that his two favorites at the moment were his pit crew and Kyle Larson for the late caution, those at the finish line at Darlington booed the winner. I think its just my personality. I understand that. I bring it upon myself most times. But I love it, he said. I love the reaction that I get out of people. Hamlin would sure love to hear what they say if he made the championship four and won the final race at Phoenix. He has had opportunities in the past  in 2014, 2019, 2020 and 2021  without success. Hamlin has watch teammates Tony Stewart and Kyle Busch win titles during his time with Joe Gibbs. The coach believes Hamlins time is coming  and quickly. You get somebody that age that still has the drive to get it done, I think Denny has a real drive, and I think were fortunate to have him, Gibbs said. Michael Jordan, co-owner with Hamlin in 23XI Racing, was on hand at Darlington and told Fox TV before the race that Hamlin deserves to win a title given all hes done and that he believes Hamlin will keep working to accomplish that before hes through driving. Hamlin is grateful hes still a winning driver and confident that will continue this season. It still feels good from my standpoint that I can at 44 go out here and win back-to-back races, be in contention week in, week out, still be at the top of my game, Hamlin said. Nothings dropped off. ___ AP NASCAR: https://apnews.com/hub/nascar-racing",https://apnews.com/article/denny-hamlin-nascar-darlington-cddf566b1d237b68d4401650b013336a,sports

"Canelo Alvarez beats Scull to become undisputed champion again, sets a date for Crawford","RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP)  Moments after Canelo Alvarez fended off William Scull to become the undisputed super middleweight champion again, he was facing off against Terence Crawford in the same ring in Riyadh to promote a showdown in September. Alvarez became an undisputed champion in the division for the second time when the judges scored his ho-hum bout early Sunday Saudi local time against Scull 115-113, 116-112, 119-109. The 34-year-old Mexican boxer improved to 63-2-2, with 39 knockouts, and is unbeaten in 10 fights in the super middleweight category. The decision had barely been announced before Turki Alalshikh, head of the General Entertainment Authority of Saudi Arabia, stepped into the ring and ordered it cleared out so that he could bring four-division champion Crawford out of the crowd to face Alvarez, who was wearing one belt around his waist, another over his shoulder and holding one in each arm. Now we want to do the face off for the fight of the century, Alalshikh told the crowd, between the two great fighters in our generation. Alvarez is a four-weight world champion and entered the fight against Scull with the WBA, WBC and WBO titles at 168 pounds. The 37-year-old Crawford (41-0) has won titles in four divisions from lightweight to light middleweight. Alvarez was stripped of the IBF belt last July when he declined to make a mandatory defense against Scull. Hed owned that title since November 2021 when he defeated Caleb Plant. 
        
     The fight against Scull didnt live up to the hype. The Cuba-born Scull entered unbeaten in 23 professional fights. He constantly moved around, dodging, shuffling and frustrating Alvarez, who later said he hated fighting that style of boxer.  Alvarez was fighting outside the U.S. or Mexico for the first time and had to make plenty of adjustments, including to the time zone. The fighters walked into the ring and the anthems started around 6:20 a.m. local time (11:20 p.m. ET Saturday) for the main bout in Riyadh, timed so it was in prime time on the U.S. West Coast. The opening rounds were slow with both boxers feeling for range and the intensity gradually lifted with Scull throwing many more punches but not landing enough. Alvarez, by contrast, stayed patient and was landing body shots. In the end, Alvarez threw almost half as many punches as Scull (152-293) but landed one more (56-55), predominantly power shots to the body. Its OK, we won. Were here with the title as the champion, Alvarez said, adding that neither the timing of the bout nor the quality of the contest was a problem because hed plenty of time to prepare. Im a champion. Im a professional, so thats all, no excuse or anything. As for the Sept. 12 showdown against Crawford, who will be stepping up a weight to take on Alvarez?  I feel great. Crawford is one of the best out there and, you know, I like to share the ring with that kind of fighter, he said. Its my pleasure. Crawford was in the crowd watching in the Saudi capital. Im feeling great. Im feeling blessed. Things happen for a reason, and theres a reason why Im here, he said. In September Im showing the world what greatness look like. ___ AP boxing: https://apnews.com/boxing",https://apnews.com/article/canelo-alvarez-scull-6306dc3a636b84a5b43873013edd5263,sports
"Musovski, Nouhou help Sounders beat St. Louis City 4-1","SEATTLE (AP)  Danny Musovski scored a goal for the fourth consecutive game, Nouhou Tolo  known simply as Nouhou  added a goal and an assist Saturday night and the Seattle Sounders beat St. Louis City 4-1.  Seattle (4-3-4) is unbeaten it four straight, including three wins, since a 3-0 loss to San Diego on April 5 to move above the playoff line in the Western Conference.

"Ohtani and Freeman homer, Sasaki earns 1st MLB win as streaking Dodgers overpower Braves 10-3","ATLANTA (AP)  Freddie Freeman homered and drove in four runs, Shohei Ohtani also went deep and Roki Sasaki earned his first major league win as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves 10-3 on Saturday night for their seventh straight victory. The Dodgers have won the first two games of the series to improve to 5-0 against Atlanta this year. Los Angeles three-game sweep at home early in the season left the Braves 0-7. Sasaki (1-1) allowed three runs and six hits over five innings in a game pushed back more than three hours because of rain. The 23-year-old right-hander gave up a home run to Ozzie Albies but received plenty of offensive support in his seventh big league start since arriving from Japan to much fanfare. The Dodgers piled up 12 hits and pulled away with a four-run fourth. Freeman hit a three-run homer off Scott Blewett in the eighth. Atlanta starter Spencer Schwellenbach (1-3) lasted only 3 2/3 innings. He gave up six runs, five earned, and eight hits. Rain and lightning led to a delay of 3 hours, 6 minutes, before the first pitch. The 10:21 p.m. start was the latest in Truist Parks nine-year history. The game ended at 1:26 a.m. Sunday. Ohtani threw 35 pitches in the bullpen before the game as he continues his comeback from 2023 elbow surgery in his plan to become a two-way player again. Ohtani, who has appeared only at designated hitter this season, still has not faced hitters and has not thrown sliders. From what I hear he was ramping it up a little more with his velocity, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.  Ohtani hasnt pitched in a major league game since Aug. 23, 2023, for the Los Angeles Angels.

LAFC (5-4-2) is unbeaten in four straight games dating to a 1-0 loss to the Dynamo in Houston on April 5. Ordaz, on the counter-attack, put away the rebound of his own shot that was parried by goalkeeper Jonathan Bond, tapping in the putback from point-blank range.  Ebobisse subbed on in the 76th, replacing Ordaz, and scored from just inside the penalty arc in the 79th to cap the scoring.  The Dynamos Franco Escobar was shown a yellow card in the 25th minute and then a red in the fifth minute of stoppage time.  LAFC outshot the Dynamo 18-4, including 10-0 on target.

Race for remaining Champions League spots in France remains wide open,"PARIS (AP)  The race for the remaining Champions League places behind Paris Saint-Germain remains wide open in the French league after Marseille drew 1-1 at Lille on Sunday. With two rounds of matches left, and PSG already crowned champion, second-placed Marseille missed the chance to open up a three-point gap on Monaco after goalkeeper Geronimo Rullis blunder in the 74th minute. The top three teams qualify for the group stage of the Champions League, with the fourth team getting a spot in the qualifying rounds. Marseille has a one-point lead over Monaco, which won 3-1 at Saint-Etienne on Saturday, with a trio of chasing teams  Nice, Lille and Strasbourg  lagging one point further back. Lille striker Jonathan David intercepted Rullis attempted pass inside the box and headed the ball toward Matias Fernandez Pardo, who shot past the goakeeper into the back of the net. Amine Gouiri had put Marseille in front in the 57th minute from Adrien Rabiots assist at the conclusion of a fine collective move. PSG secured the French league title last month with six matches to spare but the fight for the Champions League places has not been lacking suspense. Just five points separate second-placed Marseille from seventh-placed Lyon.  
        
     Lyons hopes of European soccer next season took a blow as the seven-time French champions lost 2-1 against Lens.  Anass Zaroury scored the winner with a superb 30-meter strike into the top corner five minutes from time, soon after Georges Mikautadze leveled for the hosts with a header.  The result left Lyon outside of the European places, six points above eighth-placed Lens. Lyon enjoyed much of the possession but lacked a cutting edge and went behind when Goduine Koyalipou scored following a corner in the 21st minute. Substitute Jim Allevinah scored his first goal for Angers in the French league as his club won 1-0 at Nantes to leapfrog its rival and take a big step towards survival in the top division. In a match of few chances for both squads, Allevinah scored with a low strike in the 52nd minute. It was the first shot on target in the match. Allevinah, a Gabon international, came on after 20 minutes as a replacement for the injured Zinedine Ferhat. Angers moved to 14th place in the standings, one point above Nantes and two points above Le Havre, currently in the relegation playoff spot. Le Havre won 2-1 at Auxerre to move four points above the drop zone. PSG suffered consecutive Ligue 1 losses for the first time in more than two years when it lost 2-1 at Strasbourg on Saturday.  With the match coming between the two legs of the Champions League semifinal against Arsenal, PSG coach Luis Enrique rotated his team, making 10 changes to his staring lineup. PSG will defend a 1-0 lead from the first leg on Wednesday at the Parc des Princes against the Gunners. Also, Brest beat last-placed Montpellier 1-0. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/soccer-ligue1-marseille-lille-a6b575870a8af859e22b59020076f8fb,sports

"Shortstop Anthony Volpe hopes to return to Yankees lineup Monday, 2 days after hurting his shoulder","NEW YORK (AP)  Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe hopes to return to the starting lineup for Mondays series opener against San Diego after missing a 7-5 loss to Tampa Bay.  Volpe hurt his left shoulder on a dive trying to get to a grounder in the eighth inning of Saturdays 3-2 loss to the Rays. I dont know yet if its a yes or a no, but I think its in play and well talk about it, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. I think in Anthonys mind its yes. Volpe remained in Saturdays game after his unsuccessful attempt for a backhand stab on Christopher Morels eighth-inning single, which sparked a two-run rally in Tampa Bays win. X-rays, MRI  good news, Boone said before Sundays game. Hes sore today, but I feel like were probably in a good spot. Well see. Kind of day to day right now. Volpe said after Saturdays game he heard a pop in the shoulder. Its a little unclear in there. Hes got some stuff that they feel like is older stuff, so hard to know exactly, Boone said. Hes definitely a little cranky in the shoulder today. Volpe took dry swings in the trainers room Sunday but Boone decided not to use him as a pinch hitter. Volpe, who turned 24 on Monday, is hitting .233 with five homers, 19 RBIs and four stolen bases in his third season with the Yankees. Oswald Peraza played shortstop Sunday and was 1 for 3. His error contributed to an unearned run. New York already was missing second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. (strained right oblique), third baseman DJ LeMahieu (strained left calf), ace Gerrit Cole (Tommy John surgery) and right-hander Luis Gil (right lat strain), the 2024 AL Rookie of the Year. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/volpe-yankees-4fcfe86c8c6ff979105d968b42e08784,sports

"Weeks after fall, jockey Junior Alvarado rebounds to win a muddy Kentucky Derby aboard Sovereignty","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  Temporarily sidelined by a hard fall, jockey Junior Alvarado put it behind him with the ride of a lifetime in the Kentucky Derby. Most satisfying was guiding Sovereignty past other horses in the slop before drawing a bead on 3-1 favorite Journalism and chasing him down to win the 151st running at Churchill Downs by 1 1/2 lengths. The effort left Alvarado and his mount caked in mud, worn proudly along with the garland of red roses that was draped over the winner. Still sinking in, to be honest, the 38-year-old Venezuelan rider said of his breakthrough, which came in his ninth try. It means the world to me, for me and my family. Coming from my country where the only race we would be able to watch back there was just the Kentucky Derby. I said that would be nice to be in the United States and ride in the Kentucky Derby. Little by little I started to point that out to be, to make it come true. Today, we did just that. Alvarados Derby win highlights a career of Grade 1 triumphs, many on some of horse racings biggest stages. He earned a Triple Crown win in the 2021 Preakness on Rombauer, has a handful of Breeders Cup championships and won the $3 million Pegasus World Cup Invitational two years ago aboard Bill Mott-trained Art Collector at Gulfstream Park in Florida. Saturdays impressive performance came after Alvarado fractured his shoulder in a March 23 fall at Gulfstream after his horse had a heart attack. He returned to racing three weeks later at Keeneland and won a couple of claiming races at Churchill Downs this week  including another fall on Thursday  before bouncing back with a signature ride. 
        
     Riding Sovereignty was never in question despite the injury. He missed the Grade 1 Florida Derby on March 29  where Manny Franco rode the bay colt to a second-place finish behind Tappan Street  but Mott, the Hall of Fame trainer, reiterated that as long as Alvarado was healthy, the horse he rode to two graded stakes wins on the Derby trail awaited him. It gave me peace of mind, the jockey added. The next step was clearing several obstacles as the 7-1 third betting choice coming out of the gate. For starters, clipping heels with a competitor as the 19-horse field passed the grandstand the first time. There was concern that Sovereignty might lose a shoe from the contact. Then, making sure he didnt lose too much ground while rounding the turns. When we turned to the backside, he was still traveling very beautifully until we hit the five(-eighths) pole, Alvarado said. Thats when he kind of said to me, Im ready. Alvarado steered Sovereignty into contention along with Journalism entering the stretch before finally clearing him in the stretch. The finish earned firsts for Dubai-based stable Godolphin, an outright win for Mott after getting the 2019 Derby via disqualification and vindication for Alvarado after a scary setback. Junior did a terrific job of getting him over, Mott said. Fortunately, there was a lot of speed in the race. It set up well for us because they had an honest pace. ... He tipped him out and got him in a spot that he was going to be clear down the backside. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Sovereigntys odds to win were 7-1, not 9-1. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-derby-junior-alvarado-sovereignty-59668eb91e8dd870c6fe1f4c102edafb,sports

"Bubic leads Kansas City to its 4th shutout in the last 8 games, 4-0 over the Orioles","BALTIMORE (AP)  Kris Bubic made it through five innings despite an early rain delay, and the Kansas City Royals hit three solo homers in a 4-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday night. Cavan Biggio, Kyle Isbel and Vinnie Pasquantino went deep for Kansas City, which has won 10 of its last 12. The Royals have pitched four shutouts in their last eight games. The game was delayed 57 minutes because of a thunderstorm after the first inning. Both starters stayed in the game anyway. Bubic (3-2) allowed four hits before three Royals relievers closed out the game. Tomoyuki Sugano (3-2) permitted two runs and four hits in six innings. Jonathan India led off the fourth with a double and eventually came home on Maikel Garcias two-out single. Biggios drive  his first homer of the year  made it 2-0 the following inning. Isbel and Pasquantino went deep in the eighth off Seranthony Domnguez. Garcia had three hits, as did Baltimores Gunnar Henderson. The Orioles only had one runner reach scoring position, and that was in the first with one out. Bubic then struck out Ryan Mountcastle and retired Ryan OHearn on a flyout. The Orioles fell to 2-9 in games against left-handed starters this season. Theyre batting a major league-worst .174 against southpaws, a number that actually improved when they went 5 for 25 against Bubic and reliever Daniel Lynch IV on Saturday. Lynch worked two innings. In the final scheduled game between these teams this season, Baltimores Kyle Gibson (0-1) starts against Kansas Citys Michael Lorenzen (3-3) on Sunday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/orioles-royals-score-657413b121da63ca48d9535b5cd137a2,sports

Must-win matches shake up the playoff race in Super Rugby Pacific,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)  In a weekend of must-win matches in Super Rugby Pacific, some teams achieved and others stumbled in the six-team playoff race. The defending champion Blues were at the top of the must-win category, having begun to lose touch with sixth place when they were beaten a week ago by the Queensland Reds. It was the seventh loss of the season for the Auckland-based team. They had to win Friday against the sixth-place Western Force, and they did 40-19 in a match which was closer than the margin indicated. The Blues victory depended a great deal on their scrum dominance. The win lifted the Blues to sixth overnight before they were displaced from that position when Moana Pasifika beat the Dunedin-based Highlanders 34-29 on Sunday. The Blues dropped back to seventh while the Perth-based Force dropped to eighth, based on points differential. Coach Stern Vern Cotter had made clear his displeasure after the Blues loss to the Reds left their season dangling by a thread with matches remaining against the Force, the Fijian Drua in Fiji, Moana Pasifika and the New South Wales Waratahs. Its never really nice when your coach is questioning your attitude, Blues captain Patrick Tuipulotu said. But I think thats what we needed  a bit of a wake-up call. Moana Pasifika posted its fifth win of the season in another must-win match to move into playoffs contention. But they have a tough finish against the Blues, Crusaders and Hurricanes. 
        
     The Wellington-based Hurricanes needed to back up last weeks performance against the Canberra-based Brumbies, when they became the first New Zealand team to win in Australia this season. That win lifted them into the top six but into a very tight struggle to hold onto a playoffs place. They produced another upset, beating the top of the table Chiefs 35-17 with the help of four second-half tries by winger Bailyn Sullivan who replaced Kini Naholo at halftime. Naholo, who has scored eight tries this season, had a serious knee injury. The Hurricanes moved up to fifth place after Round 12, two points clear of Moana Pasifika and four ahead of the Blues. The Chiefs remained atop the standings in a points tie with the Christchurch-based Crusaders, who couldnt take advantage of the Chiefs loss because of a weekend bye. The Brumbies stayed in third place after a 40-17 win over the Waratahs, who dropped to eighth place, still only a point out of sixth. The Queensland Reds stayed in fourth, despite an upset 36-33 loss to the Fijian Drua. The Fijian Drua maintained an outstanding home record when they beat the fourth-placed Reds in Suva on Saturday. The win echoed the Druas 41-17 win over the Reds in 2023 and 28-19 win in 2024. So far this season the Drua have won three of five home matches but havent yet managed to win away from home and are at the bottom of the table. Over the last three years, the Drua have had 19 home matches and won 14. That includes victories over the Crusaders, Waratahs and Melbourne Force. But the Reds especially have struggled in Fiji. The Drua sealed their win with a 79th minute try on Saturday to replacement Isikeli Rabitu, dealing a blow to the Reds in their first match since their head coach Les Kiss was named to succeed Joe Schmidt as Wallabies coach. Former Wallabies utility Kurtley Beale scored a try to mark his return to rugby after a 10 months break, for the Western Force against the Blues. The 36-year-old Beale didnt shirk contact in his first match since sustaining a ruptured Achilles in a Sydney club game. He played at fullback and turned in a solid 72 minutes before being substituted. Beale had a number of neat touches before crossing in the left corner for a second-half try. Its good to be back but disappointed in the end, he said. The games changing. Its getting fitter, faster, stronger. But I enjoy the challenge. I love the unpredictability of the game. ___ AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby",https://apnews.com/article/super-rugby-pacific-321d1c1f9f32318e6207063b377c1c31,sports

Gallese has 5th straight shutout for Orlando City in 0-0 tie with short-handed Fire,"CHICAGO (AP)  Pedro Gallese had eight saves and his fifth consecutive shutout for Orlando City on Saturday night in a 0-0 tie with Chicago, despite the Fire playing a man down for more than 50 minutes.  Orlando City (4-2-5), which is unbeaten in eight consecutive games, has not allowed a goal in 526 minutes of game time, a club record. The previous mark of 364 was set mostly during the 2023 MLS Cup playoffs.  Gallese made back-to-back saves in the 10th minute, diving to parry a shot from Philip Zinckernagel and then scrambling to swat away a put-back attempt by Hugo Cuypers, before he stopped Jonathan Bambas shot in the 16th.  Fire goalkeeper Chris Brady was shown a red card in the 36th minute after he collided with Orlando Citys Duncan McGuire and Chicago played a man down the rest of the way. Bamba, a midfielder, went off to make room for Jeffrey Gal, the only other goalkeeper on the roster, to replace Brady.  Gal  a 32-year-old in his third season, all with Chicago  made his MLS debut and finished with one save. Chicago (3-4-4) is winless in six straight and had been coming off back-to-back losses, including a 7-2 to Charlotte last time out.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/orlando-fire-score-6b747353e6a6b4924730e83316749b6f,sports

Benteke and Kijima each score in first-half stoppage time for D.C. United in 2-1 win over Rapids,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Christian Benteke and Hosei Kijima each scored a goal in first-half stoppage time Saturday night to help D.C. United beat the Colorado Rapids 2-1.  D.C. United (3-5-3) won for just the second time since it beat Sporting Kansas City 2-1 on March 8.  David Schnegg played an arcing ball-in that was deflected before Benteke bounced a header off the ground and inside the back post in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time. About three minutes later, Kijima ducked in front of defender Matti Peltola at the last second and put away a volley from near the penalty spot that rolled off the fingertips of goalkeeper Zack Steffen into the net to give D.C. United a 2-1 lead at halftime.  Colorados Darren Yapi opened the scoring with a header from point-blank range in the 43rd minutes. On the counter-attack, Rafael Navarro tried to slip a shot from the right side of the area inside the near post, but goalkeeper Luis Barraza swatted it away. Navarro secured the rebound along the goal line and then lofted a cross to Yapi for the finish from the back post.  The Rapids (4-3-4) had their three-game unbeaten streak snapped.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/rapids-dc-united-score-977e35d905093f9e72f159256bbd9ef0,sports

Brewers Murphy says it seems like weve misplaced our edge a little bit after 3rd straight loss,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Brewers manager Pat Murphy thinks something is missing from his teams usual identity as Milwaukee staggers through the first quarter of the season. It seems like weve misplaced our edge a little bit, Murphy said after a 6-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Saturday that dropped the Brewers two games below .500. The Brewers have lost three straight by a combined score of 24-2, a stretch that started with an 8-0 road loss to the Chicago White Sox and continued with a 10-0 drubbing against the Cubs on Friday. Milwaukee went 21 innings without scoring before finally breaking through in the third Saturday. The back-to-back home losses to Chicago have dropped the Brewers five games behind the first-place Cubs in the NL Central standings. Theyre tremendous, Murphy said of the Cubs. Look at what they did against some of the best teams in the league, and how they manhandled us both games. Even though tonight was a little closer, it was still never in doubt. We didnt put pressure on them. The slow start follows a 2024 season in which Milwaukee took over first place for good by the end of April to win its second straight division title. That Brewers team prided itself on rarely getting blown out, as most of its losses went down to the wire. Milwaukee already has lost seven games this season by at least five runs. The Brewers are 0-12 when their opponent scores first, making them the only major league without a win in such situations. And the last two nights have shown how far the Brewers are from the Cubs, at least at this early stage of the season. 
        
     Injuries to the pitching staff have caused many of Milwaukees issues so far. The Brewers knew theyd be opening the season without two-time All-Star Brandon Woodruff and Robert Gasser, but Aaron Civale, Aaron Ashby, DL Hall and Nestor Cortes also are on the injured list. Tobias Myers, who went 9-6 with a 3.00 ERA as a rookie last year, just came off the IL on April 24. Woodruff is expected to return after making a couple more rehabilitation appearances in the minors. All those injuries to starters have taxed Milwaukees relievers. The Brewers entered Saturday with a 5.14 bullpen ERA that ranked 28th in the majors, ahead of only the Los Angeles Angels and Washington. Last year, Milwaukee had a 3.11 bullpen ERA that ranked second in the majors behind Cleveland. The lineup also has struggled. Christian Yelich has a .673 OPS, down from .910 last year when he earned his third All-Star selection. Two-time All-Star catcher William Contreras, who has posted an OPS of .824 or better each of the last three seasons, is at .692. Starting shortstop Joey Ortiz is hitting .186 with a .464 OPS. Milwaukee remains confident it will come around. Luckily, this is early still, first baseman Rhys Hoskins said. I dont want to just fall into that because at some point its not early. But we have a lot of baseball to be played, and I think because of the talent in this room, theres no reason why we wont find ourselves where we want to be come the end of summer. Murphy remains confident as well and says he still has high hopes for this team. He said teams do lose their edge at some point in every season and noted that even happened late last year during the Brewers run to a division title. Im not losing hope, Murphy said. Im not worried about it. I know who these people are, so Im confident they will find it. Im just a little shocked that weve misplaced that edge a little bit. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/milwaukee-brewers-murphy-8ef91ddb328105b404e43f235f53332c,sports

Minnesota United FC hands Austin its fifth shutout this season with a 3-0 win,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Anthony Markanich and Joaqun Pereyra each scored a goal and Minnesota United FC took advantage of an own goal and beat Austin FC 3-0 on Saturday. Austin midfielder Ilie Snchez was credited with an own goal from left of the box at 22 minutes for a 1-0 Minnesota (5-2-4) lead. His mild deflection off a shot attempt by Pereyra created back spin on a ball that slowly rolled through the hands and legs of keeper Brad Stuver. Markanich scored 13 minutes later on a header from the center of the box for a two-goal lead. Pereyra ended the scoring in the first minute of extra time in the second half with a left-footed shot from the middle position outside the box.

Corey Seager activated from the 10-day IL by the struggling Texas Rangers,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  Corey Seager was activated from the injured list Saturday after the Texas Rangers lost eight of the 10 games the five-time All-Star shortstop missed because of a right hamstring strain. Seager went 1 for 4 with a strikeout and a run scored while serving as Texas designated hitter in the Rangers 2-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners. He was hitting .286 with four homers and six RBIs when he got hurt. He had hit .370 with three of those homers over a 12-game span before straining his right hamstring while running to first base against the Athletics on April 22. The two-time World Series MVP missed the minimal time on the IL. Infielder Jonathan Ornelas was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock to make room on the roster for Seager. The Rangers scored 29 runs during their 2-8 stretch without Seager, with more than half of those runs coming when they had a season-high 15 against Oakland on Tuesday. They scored only 14 runs in the other nine games, including a 2-0 win. They lost 13-1 on Friday night in their series opener against the AL West-leading Mariners. Texas entered the game last in the American League with 104 runs scored. The Rangers dropped to 16-18 after dipping under .500 on Friday for the first time since losing to Boston in the season opener. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-mlb-seager-7204cd0ac425201944cb2103d459ac85,sports
Brewers send right-hander Craig Yoho to minors while calling up Elvin Rodrguez,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Milwaukee Brewers right-hander Craig Yoho was sent to the minor leagues Saturday, two days after he walked four batters and allowed five runs in an inning of relief. The Brewers sent Yoho to Triple-A Nashville and called up right-hander Elvin Rodrguez before their Saturday night game with the Chicago Cubs. Yoho is a big part of our future, Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. I really think so. I think we have something there thats pretty special. Hes an incredible kid. His first taste in the big leagues, he did some good things. We need a fresh pitcher today. Its a good time for him to go down and get that command where he wants it. Yoho, 25, possesses an outstanding changeup that had enabled him to dominate in the minor leagues. He struck out nine batters and allowed only one unearned run over 9 2/3 innings at Nashville earlier this season. Last year, he recorded 101 strikeouts over 57 2/3 innings and posted an 0.94 ERA with three minor league teams. But he wasnt able to carry over that success to the big leagues after getting called up April 21. He had a 9.53 ERA in five relief appearances, an ERA that was inflated when he gave up five runs while recording only three outs in an 8-0 loss to the Chicago White Sox on Thursday. He cant just rely on a changeup for a strike, Murphy said. Hes got to do more than that. So hes got to locate the heater better, and its got to be money. Hes got to be a strike-throwing machine. And the changeup comes into play a lot better. 
        
     Murphy remains confident Yoho will make those adjustments and become a successful major league pitcher. Hes the type of kid, I really think hell respond, Murphy said. I do. Hes just really locked in. Rodrguez, 27, returns to the majors after going 0-2 with a 7.53 in four appearances with Milwaukee earlier this season. He also has posted a 4.82 ERA in three games with Nashville. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/milwaukee-brewers-craig-yoho-d17e1e0144253f4be085214893cc9aec,sports
Poulin scores a pair and the Montreal Victoire claim the PWHLs top seed beating the New York Siren,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP)  League-leading goal scorer Marie Poulin recorded two goals - the first 11 seconds in - and the Montreal Victoire clinched the PWHLs top seed to the playoffs by holding off the New York Sirens 3-2 on Saturday. The Victoire (11-8-7-3) received help in gaining the top seed when Ottawa beat Toronto 2-1 in overtime earlier in the day. Toronto needed to beat Ottawa and have New York win for the Sceptres to secure the top seed. On Sunday, Montreal will choose its opening-round playoff opponent  either three-seed Ottawa or No. 4-seed and defending champion Minnesota. Toronto, the second seed, will play the other team. Following Poulins immediate goal, Montreals Catherine Dubois scored at 4:04 in the first period for a two-goal advantage. Poulin closed the scoring for the Victoire at 11:21 in the second period. She finished with 19 goals this season. New Yorks Sarah Fillier scored at 2:39 in the third, and Alex Carpenter scored with 17 seconds left to get the Sirens within a goal. After pulling its goalie, New York kept the pressure on with a player advantage and Montreal never managed to clear the puck. The game ended with the puck trapped in a scrum of players behind the Montreal net. ___ AP womens hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/montreal-victoire-new-york-sirens-score-pwhl-playoffs-05d2206199fae1622341c24f8aaa8b78,sports
"Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe hurts shoulder, X-rays negative but could have more tests","NEW YORK (AP)  It was a painful landing for Anthony Volpe, who grabbed his left shoulder with his right hand and pushed his sunglasses-covered face into the outfield grass as his cap tumbled off. I never really had anything else pop or dislocate or anything like that, so nothing to compare it to, the New York Yankees shortstop said. Volpe remained in the game after his unsuccessful attempt for a backhand stab on Christopher Morels eighth-inning single, which sparked a two-run rally in Tampa Bays 3-2 win Saturday. An X-ray after the game was negative, but Volpe wasnt sure whether he will have an MRI or other tests. Ive never really been in this situation, so its just scary, he said. But it feels good, and all the movements and everything feel good, but just a weird feeling. Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger and Trent Grisham kneeled next to Volpe, and manager Aaron Boone and Oswaldo Cabrera stood as head athletic trainer Tim Lentych checked on the Gold Glove-winning shortstop. Lentych pressed on the shoulder and arm, then helped Volpe to his feet. About three minutes after Volpe went down, the Yankees agreed to let him keep playing. Once he kind of got up and moving around, he kind of felt fine, Boone said. Then we wanted to make sure strength-wise he was in a good position and felt like he was. Volpe, who turned 24 on Monday, is hitting .233 with five homers, 19 RBIs and four stolen bases in his third season with the Yankees. New York already is missing second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. (strained right oblique), third baseman DJ LeMahieu (strained left calf), ace Gerrit Cole (Tommy John surgery) and right-hander Luis Gil (right lat strain), the reigning AL Rookie of the Year. 
        
     I felt just something sharp and something like right on the spot but then after that, it felt OK, Volpe said. Felt good after the testing because you feel like you can trust it but right away you dont really know. New York led 2-1 entering the eighth behind Judges 11th home run and Austin Wells sixth. Pinch-runner Chandler Simpson stole second when play resumed. Brandon Lowe walked against Mark Leiter Jr., and the Rays pulled off a double steal, giving them six stolen bases in the game. Junior Caminero struck out and Curtis Mead singled to left, driving in the tying run. Jos Caballero followed with a grounder up the middle that Volpe bobbled as he rushed to try for an inning-ending double play. Lowe scored the go-ahead run. Trying to make the play before  turn two before I secured the ball, Volpe said. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-volpe-4fcee215bf4cb98dd7d85b9b3329fbbc,sports

(AP Photo/Abbie Parr) It took a few minutes for Saturdays results to be made official while the stewards sorted out a photo for second and reviewed a traffic-choked start.  Mott knew all the while who earned the garland of red roses. This one got there the right way, the Hall of Fame trainer said. I mean, hes done well, hes a great horse, he comes from a great organization and I cant say enough about the horse and the organization that started him out and made this happen. Godolphin is the racing stable of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. It was quite a weekend for the sheikh. His filly, Good Cheer, won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday and earlier Saturday, Ruling Court  a son of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify  won the 2,000 Guineas in Britain.

(AP Photo/Abbie Parr) Ive had quite a long relationship with the Godolphin team and the man behind the Godolphin operation, Sheikh Mohammed, Mott said. Im just honored. 
        
     Sovereignty, also bred by the sheikh, splashed through 1 1/4 miles in 2:02.31 and paid $17.96 to win at 7-1 odds. Hes the record 20th horse with a name starting with S to win. The victory was worth $3.1 million from the $5 million purse. Its great, Mott said. I think it will take a little while to sink in. Journalism didnt have the cleanest of trips in the 19-horse field, but rallied to stay in the fight. He found trouble early before jockey Umberto Rispoli swung him outside to get him in the clear. They made a move at the leaders with Sovereignty and jockey Junior Alvarado right behind them. He was saying to me, Listen, Im ready, so from there I started picking up, Alvarado said. The two colts hooked up for a sixteenth of a mile for a thrilling battle against the backdrop of 147,406 roaring and rain-soaked fans before Sovereignty surged ahead inside the eighth pole and drew clear. I saw the blue silks (of Godolphin) coming at us and I knew that was the one we were going to have to be concerned about, said Michael McCarthy, Journalisms trainer. The winner ran a better race. Alvarado won his first Derby in six tries. He and Sovereignty were reunited after Alvarado had missed the colts last start in the Florida Derby because he was injured. Its more than a dream come true, the 38-year-old Venezuelan said. I thought I had a great chance. I was confident the whole week. Fast-closing Baeza  who got into the race on Thursday after another horse was scratched  was a neck back in third. Final Gambit was fourth and Owen Almighty finished fifth. Citizen Bull, the lone entry for six-time Derby-winning trainer Bob Baffert, set the pace. Baffert was back on the first Saturday in May having serving a three-year suspension by Churchill Downs after his Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first in 2021 and failed a postrace drug test. D. Wayne Lukas, the 89-year-old four-time Derby winner, saw his colt American Promise finish right behind Baffert in 15th. Rain made for a soggy day, with the Churchill Downs dirt strip listed as sloppy and fans protecting their fancy hats and clothing with clear plastic ponchos.

"Orioles put 3B Ramn Uras on the IL, bring up top prospect Coby Mayo from the minors","BALTIMORE (AP)  The Baltimore Orioles put third baseman Ramn Uras on the injured list with a hamstring strain before Saturday nights game against Kansas City. The Orioles called up top prospect Coby Mayo from Triple-A Norfolk. Manager Brandon Hyde said he didnt think Uras, who went on the 10-day IL retroactive to Thursday, would be out too long. I think its a minor hamstring strain, Hyde said. Hes going to have to have a few days off. Mayo entered as a pinch-hitter and went 0 for 2 in Baltimores 4-0 loss to the Royals. Uras has been a bright spot for the Orioles during their slow start to the season, hitting .292 with two homers. Now he joins a lengthy list of Baltimore players on the IL, including outfielders Colton Cowser and Tyler ONeill, infielder Jordan Westburg and several key pitchers. Mayo is baseballs No. 12 prospect according to MLB Pipeline, although he went 4 for 41 in his big league debut with Baltimore last year. Hes hit .252 with six homers and 22 RBIs in 28 games for Norfolk this season. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-orioles-ramon-urias-coby-mayo-6a02703a9eee1e6e6ab102951495dc41,sports
Yankees Jazz Chisholm Jr. surprised MRI of oblique showed he will be out for 4 to 6 weeks,"NEW YORK (AP)  Jazz Chisholm Jr. went into the MRI room expecting to be cleared to keep playing second base for the New York Yankees.  One hour later, he was told he would be sidelined for four to six weeks because of a strained right oblique. Its super frustrating, he said after Saturdays 3-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. I didnt think that was going to happen. Chisholm was placed on the 10-day injured list Friday, three days after getting hurt during a swing in a game at the Baltimore Orioles. He is limited to strengthening and core work. Chisholms scan Thursday showed strains in three different spots. Thats why Im really surprised in what it said, because it doesnt feel like three, doesnt even feel like as bad as the first time I tore my oblique two years ago, he said. Chisholm grabbed at his side after fouling off a first pitch from Kyle Gibson during the first inning, took a ball and then stepped out of the batters box to stretch the side, prompting Boone and an athletic trainer to come out and speak with him. Chisholm doubled into the right-field corner on the next pitch and when the ball was bobbled headed to third and slid in headfirst. He appeared in discomfort and immediately left the game for a pinch runner. He didnt think the extra pitch worsened the injury. If I would have swung and missed, probably, he said. But since I didnt swing and miss, probably not. 
        
     Acquired from Miami on July 27, Chisholm is hitting .181 with seven homers and 17 RBIs in 30 games. He was sidelined between Aug. 12 and 23 last year because of a sprained left elbow sustained on a headfirst slide. Chisholm strained his left oblique on a swing while playing for Miami against Atlanta on July 2, 2023. He returned on July 31. This feels completely different from the first one. So for me, I was super surprised when I saw the results, he said. __ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/chisholm-oblique-yankees-b549d4351364e82bf49efa32bc1a358e,sports
Schneemanns grand slam with 2 out in the 9th inning rallies Guardians to 5-3 win over Blue Jays,"TORONTO (AP)  Daniel Schneemann hit his first career grand slam and added a solo shot, leading the Cleveland Guardians to a 5-3, come-from-behind victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday. With Toronto leading 3-1 and two outs in the ninth inning, Schneemann pulled an 0-1 pitch from Yimi Garca into the stands in right field for his first multi-homer game and fourth long ball of the season. Schneemann gave Cleveland its first run with a solo homer off Chad Green in the eighth. Kolby Allard (2-0) allowed one run in four innings for the win, and Emmanuel Clase finished for his sixth save in eight chances. Bo Bichette hit his first home run of the season for Toronto. However, the Blue Jays wasted six shutout innings from right-hander Kevin Gausman and lost for the first time in four games. Gausman allowed one hit, walked none and struck out nine in six innings. Garca (0-1) blew his second save in four chances. Torontos leadoff hitter, Bichette connected on the first pitch he saw from Cleveland right-hander Gavin Williams in the first. Williams gave up a first-pitch home run for the second straight start. Minnesotas Edouard Julien connected off him in an April 28 loss to the Twins. Williams allowed two runs and seven hits in four innings. He walked five and struck out nine, both season highs. Guardians slugger Jos Ramrez was out of the lineup. The six-time All-Star exited in the third inning Friday after spraining his right ankle when he stumbled over first base on an infield single. 
        
     Steven Kwan led off the ninth with a single and Carlos Santana and Bo Naylor walked before Schneemanns two-out slam. Bichette hadnt homered since May 27, 2024, at Chicago in a win over the White Sox.

"Twins Kody Clemens homers in 1st career Fenway game in front of father, ex-Red Sox pitcher Roger","BOSTON (AP)  Kody Clemens felt right at home in Fenway Park  where his father once ruled on the mound. And his dad got him a gift, too. The Twins second baseman, the son of former Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens, homered into the right-field seats in the sixth inning during his first game at Fenway to help Minnesota to a 4-3 victory Saturday. Its great, Kody Clemens said. The experience at Fenway is amazing. ... To be able to play in the game was super cool. I just had fun out there today. It was awesome.  With his seven-time Cy Young Award-winning father watching from a luxury box along the first-base line, Clemens hit an 0-1 slider from Hunter Dobbins over the short wall in the right-field corner. It was amazing, Roger said, standing in the box during a rain delay with his wife  Kodys mother Debbie  and Kodys wife Jessica.  Just think about  I put myself in his shoes  even though hes my kid, hes here at Fenway, and he obviously wants to perform well, hitting a home run would be the ultimate thing to do and he goes up there up in a clutch situation and does it, Roger said. Just a great moment and Im glad were here.  Kody enjoyed his special moment in front of his family and said hitting one at Fenway was up there, for sure when he was growing up thinking where hed like to hit one out. The family ties and everything, he said. That was super cool. 
        
     Kody said someone told him his dad got the ball back for him. A fan threw the ball back onto the field and the ball attendant retrieved it in shallow right, before tossing it into the stands behind first base. We got the ball, Roger said. He said a friend of his saw where they threw it, then that friend went down and got the fan and his family to bring it up to the box to Roger. They took a photo with the elder Clemens, who said he was sending the fan some items. It was so crazy, Debbie said of what the three of them did, celebrating in the box. It was just great being here and for his first time being able to play. Jessica made her first trip to Boston. Shes going home with an extra gift. Debbie said the ball was going to Kody and Jessica.  The 28-year-old Clemens, who has 15 career homers, was acquired from Philadelphia on April 26 after being designated for assignment by the Phillies. It was just his third at-bat in Fenway and gave Minnesota a 3-1 edge. In his first at-bat Saturday, Red Sox shortstop Trevor Story made a diving catch of his inning-ending liner in the second. Roger Clemens, who was inducted into the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2014, went 192-111 over 13 seasons with Boston, and won the AL MVP and Cy Young Award in 1986. In April 1986, he became the first pitcher to strike out 20 in a game. He had a career record of 354-184 with a 3.12 ERA over 24 seasons, but is not in the Baseball Hall of Fame after falling short of the required 75% vote and running out of eligibility to be on the ballot. He maintains he never used performance-enhancing drugs despite being accused of doing so. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/fenway-clemens-home-run-d590c7aa4f1e33906446ac9bd133e760,sports
Matt Chapmans grand slam leads Giants past Rockies 6-3,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Matt Chapman hit a grand slam to help the San Francisco Giants beat the lowly Colorado Rockies 6-3 on Saturday.  Chapman connected against Jake Bird (0-1) with one out in the sixth, capping a five-run inning after the Rockies scored three times in the top of the frame. It was Chapmans third career grand slam, and the first for the Giants this season. Colorado dropped to a major league-worst 6-27. Luis Matos hit a solo homer for San Francisco. Randy Rodrguez got three outs for the win, and Ryan Walker handled the ninth for his sixth save. The Giants had a 1-0 lead before the Rockies rallied in the sixth. Ryan McMahon chased Jordan Hicks with a tying RBI single. Hunter Goodman singled home Jordan Beck, and Kyle Farmer added a two-out RBI single. Hicks struck out seven in five-plus innings. Rockies starter Bradley Blalock gave up three runs in 5 1/3 innings. He was recalled Friday to take the rotation spot of Ryan Feltner, who went on the injured list with back spasms. Chapman punctuated the Giants response after giving up the lead in the top of the sixth. After Jung Hoo Lee got San Francisco within a run with a bases-loaded single, Chapman drove a hanging sinker by Bird 402 feet into the Colorado bullpen. The Giants scored four or fewer runs in their previous seven games. RHP Germn Mrquez (0-5, 9.82 ERA) is scheduled to pitch for the Rockies opposite RHP Logan Webb (3-2, 2.83 ERA) in the final game of the four-game series. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/giants-rockies-score-c376496f38b7506b393031367e5c4fd0,sports

The 20-year-old man who fell to the warning track at a Pirates game is awake,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  The man who fell from the top of a 21-foot-high wall onto the warning track at PNC Park during a game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday night is awake and alert. The organizer of a GoFundMe page for Kavan Markwood, the 20-year-old who slipped off a railing and onto the field during the seventh inning of Pittsburghs 4-3 win over the Cubs, shared an update Saturday that Markwood is improving. According to Jennifer Phillips, who is organizing the fundraiser, Markwood has made significant progress since being admitted to the trauma center at Allegheny General Hospital on Wednesday in critical condition. After everything hes been through since the accident on Wednesday night, this progress feels nothing short of miraculous, wrote Phillips, who once taught Markwood. He still has a long road ahead of him, but today brought a moment of hope that weve all been holding onto. Phillips added that Markwood can speak and encouraged others to support him during his next phase of recovery. As of early Saturday evening, the GoFundMe had raised more than $27,000. The Pirates have conducted an internal investigation into the incident, which included interviewing fans and analyzing credit card receipts by others in Markwoods group.  Brian Warecki, the clubs senior vice president of communications, said the investigation concluded that Markwood did not buy any alcohol but did consume two beers over the course of the game. 
        
     Markwood attended the game with three other people, the club said. Credit card receipts indicated that one party in the group legally bought seven alcoholic beverages during the contest. The team said it received conflicting accounts from fans who sat near Markwood in the section that sits above the Clemente Wall, which is named for Hall of Famer and franchise icon Roberto Clemente.  One fan told the team that Markwood appeared intoxicated. Others said he did not do anything of note until the moment he stood up to celebrate a hit by Pirates star Andrew McCutchen, at which point Markwood leapt out of his seat toward the 36-inch railing in front of him before flipping over the top. Pittsburgh Public Safety, which includes Pittsburgh Police and EMS, has labeled the incident an accident. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/pittsburgh-pirates-fan-falls-53f36d51a945a33adcc0372c8e421b9e,sports
Astros OF Jake Meyers matches franchise record for total bases in win over White Sox,"CHICAGO (AP)  Jake Meyers felt it was his best game at the plate. At least he couldnt remember a better one. Not in the majors. Not in the minor leagues. Not in three seasons at the University of Nebraska, where he also pitched. Not that I can remember, not like this, Meyers said. Pretty cool. Meyers homered twice on his way to a career-high seven RBIs in an 8-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Saturday. Batting ninth in the lineup, he went 4 for 4 and scored three times while matching a franchise record with 13 total bases. The 28-year-old Meyers began the day with a .262 batting average, no homers and six RBIs in 30 games this season. That was an awesome day by Jake, manager Joe Espada said. He got some good pitches to hit and he didnt miss em. I think Jake was seeing the ball well. Hes a hard worker. He goes through some stretches where he misses some of his fastballs and the pitches he handles. Meyers set career highs with 13 homers and 61 RBIs in 148 games last season, helping Houston win the AL West. He was selected by the Astros in the 13th round of the 2017 amateur draft. He had his big day in Chicago with Yordan Alvarez sitting out because of right hand inflammation. Meyers hit his first homer of the season on Davis Martins first pitch of the third. He tied it at 3 with a two-run triple with two out in the fourth, capping a 10-pitch at bat. 
        
     Meyers three-run drive in the sixth off Penn Murfee put the Astros ahead to stay. Murfee, a right-hander, had just come in to face Meyers, who hits from the right side. It was awesome, Meyers said. It was a lot of fun. An RBI double to center in the eighth gave Meyers 13 total bases. He had no idea he was near the team record, most recently accomplished by Alvarez in Philadelphia last August. I was just trying to keep the rhythm of the game and trying to score some more runs, Meyers said. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/meyers-astros-678f63f472722dfedb0be477d73ac9f8,sports

Stowers hits a game-ending grand slam as the Marlins beat the Athletics 9-6,"MIAMI (AP)  Kyle Stowers hit a game-ending grand slam for his second homer of the day, sending the Miami Marlins to a 9-6 victory over Mason Miller and the Athletics on Saturday. The Marlins were down to their last out when Stowers drove a 101.7 mph fastball from Miller deep to left-center for his sixth homer of the season. He also hit a tying two-run shot in the third against Osvaldo Bido. It was Stowers second multihomer performance in the last three games. He also went deep twice in a 12-7 loss at the Dodgers on Wednesday. Javier Sanoja had two hits and scored two runs for Miami, which had lost six in a row. Lake Bachar (2-0) pitched two innings for the win. Brent Rooker, JJ Bleday and Luis Uras homered for the As, who had won five of six. Jacob Wilson had two hits and scored twice. The As grabbed a 5-4 lead on Nick Kurtzs sacrifice fly in the sixth. Gio Urshela added an RBI double in the eighth. Miller (0-1) came in to pitch the ninth and hit leadoff batter Matt Mervis. Connor Norby and Dane Myers struck out before Mervis advanced to third on Sanojas double. Miller uncorked a wild pitch on a full-count offering to Ronny Simon, scoring Mervis. The closer then walked Xavier Edwards before Stowers went deep. The As opened a 4-2 lead on Uras two-run homer off Max Meyer in the fourth. The Marlins responded with two in the fifth on Sanojas double and Xavier Edwards sacrifice fly in the fifth. 
        
     Meyer was charged with five runs and 10 hits over five-plus innings. Bido allowed four runs and three hits in five innings. Bachar struck out the side in a perfect ninth. Meyer had no strikeouts in his first home start since he had a career-high 14 Ks against Cincinnati on April 21. LHP JP Sears (4-2, 2.94 ERA) will start the series finale for the Athletics on Sunday. RHP Edward Cabrera (0-1, 7.23 ERA) pitches for the Marlins. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/athletics-marlins-score-adcf27e8dc1306bee6679d2714c31232,sports

Tatis scores go-ahead run on a wild pitch in the 9th as the Padres edge the Pirates 2-1,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  San Diegos Fernando Tatis Jr. sprinted home on a wild pitch by Pittsburgh closer David Bednar in the top of the ninth inning to lift the Padres past the Pirates 2-1 at rainy PNC Park on Saturday night. Tatis, who exited Friday nights win in the third inning after taking a 93 mph pitch off his left forearm, led off the ninth with a double. He stole third and took off when a pitch from Bednar (0-3) to Xander Bogaerts skipped in front of catcher Joey Bart. The ball squirted to Barts right and Tatis slide just beat Barts lunging tag to give the Padres their fourth straight victory. Manny Machado hit his third homer of the season for San Diego, which won despite managing just three hits. Jason Adam (3-0) worked a perfect eighth. Robert Suarez walked Oneil Cruz with one out in the ninth, but Bryan Reynolds lined out to Bogaerts at short and Bogaerts doubled off Cruz at first to end it as Robert picked up his 13th save. Pirates starter Bailey Falter dominated the Padres for seven innings. The left-hander limited San Diego to two hits and at one point retired 11 straight before Machados blast over the left field wall with one out in the seventh tied the game. Cruz singled home Alexander Canario for Pittsburghs only run. Cruz also walked four times. KeBryan Hayes had two of the Pirates six singles. Pittsburgh did not record an extra-base hit while losing for the sixth time in seven games. 
        
     The Pirates had the bases loaded against Padres starter Randy Vasquez in the fifth only to have Canario  who came in batting .118  strike out. Pittsburgh left 10 runners on base during Vasquezs five innings of work. Padres manager Mike Shildt is now 27-5 all-time at PNC Park. Most of Shildts success in Pittsburgh came when he was managing the St. Louis Cardinals from 2018-21. The series wraps up on Sunday. Veteran left-hander Andrew Heaney (2-2, 2.50 ERA) gets the nod for Pittsburgh against San Diegos Stephen Kolek, a reliever who will be making his first career start. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/padres-pirates-score-d657a31979413597e849e20e702bd01e,sports
"With dad on hand, Kody Clemens homers in 1st game at Fenway Park to lead Twins past Red Sox 4-3","BOSTON (AP)  Kody Clemens hit a two-run homer in his first game at Fenway Park  with his famous father in attendance  and the Minnesota Twins beat the Boston Red Sox 4-3 on Saturday. With former Red Sox ace Roger Clemens watching from a luxury box along the first-base line, his son drove an 0-1 slider from Hunter Dobbins (2-1) over the short wall in the right-field corner to push Minnesota ahead 3-1 in the sixth inning.  Jarren Duran had an RBI triple and a double for Boston, which has lost three of four. Romy Gonzalez, expected to get the bulk of the playing time at first base after Triston Casas ruptured a tendon in his left knee, had three singles. Clemens homer came during a three-run sixth that gave the Twins a 4-1 edge.  Bailey Ober (4-1) pitched six innings, holding the Red Sox to a run and seven hits. Jhoan Duran got three outs for his third save.  Jarren Duran hit his RBI triple in the seventh before scoring on Rafael Devers single that sliced it to 4-3. The game was delayed by rain for 72 minutes in the seventh. With runners on first and second in the ninth, Jhoan Duran retired left-handed hitter Wilyer Abreu for the final out after walking Alex Bregman intentionally. Ober has allowed just one run five times in his six starts since giving up eight during his first start of the season.

Nola and Realmuto help the Phillies beat the Diamondbacks 7-2,"PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Aaron Nola pitched six shutout innings in his first win of the season, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-2 on Saturday night. J.T. Realmuto and Max Kepler homered for Philadelphia in its sixth win in seven games. The Phillies will try for a sweep of the weekend series on Sunday. Nola (1-5) struck out eight in his first start since he pitched seven sparkling innings in a no-decision against the Cubs last weekend. The veteran right-hander went 0-5 with a 6.43 ERA in his first five starts of the year. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit a two-run homer for the Diamondbacks in the seventh. The Phillies went ahead 3-0 in the second on Keplers two-run shot and Brandon Marshs RBI double. Realmuto hit a three-run drive to deep left in the third, and the Phillies opened a 7-0 lead when Trea Turner scored from third on a throwing error by third baseman Eugenio Surez in the fourth. Diamondbacks starter Brandon Pfaadt (5-2) was charged with six earned runs and nine hits in 4 2/3 innings. Nola allowed a pair of singles to lead off the second before striking out Gurriel and getting Alek Thomas to ground into an inning-ending double play. 39  Kyle Schwarber extended his career-high on-base streak to 39 games when he was hit on the right foot by a Pfaadt pitch leading off the third inning. It was one of three hit batters in the game, with Nola plunking Corbin Carroll and Pfaadt also hitting Alec Bohm. Diamondbacks left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez (1-3, 6.06 ERA) pitches on Sunday, and left-hander Ranger Surez makes his season debut for the Phillies. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/diamondbacks-phillies-score-b1d2e5b4fd651f547ce65868dd729abd,sports
Ryu holes out for eagle and keeps her 2-shot lead in Black Desert Championship,"IVINS, Utah (AP)  Hae Ran Ryu regained control of the Black Desert Championship by holing out for eagle on the 11th hole, sending her to a 4-under 68 to maintain her two-shot lead in the LPGA Tours return to Utah for the first time in more than 60 years. Ryu will be trying to win a tournament for the seventh straight year, dating to when she was an 18-year-old on the Korea LPGA. Her biggest challenge might be Ruoning Yin, the former Womens PGA champion who ran off 10 birdies at Black Desert for a 62, the best score of the tournament and enough to get within two shots. Ryu started with a two-shot lead and twice had players catch her, if only briefly. One of them was Somi Lee, who had a pair of early birdies before her round self-destructed with a double bogey on No. 6 and no birdies until the final hole after she had shot herself out of the tournament. Esther Henseleit of Germany briefly caught Ryu, but only until the 24-year-old Korean stood in the 11th fairway, 82 yards away. Her wedge caught the slope with just enough spin to send it into the cup for an eagle. Henseleit made a 10-foot birdie putt on the 17th to get within one shot. But she hit her drive into the black lava rocks and had to hit another off the tee. Her par chip from just short of the green left her 3 feet away, but she missed what looked to be a routine putt and made double bogey. That gave the German a 68 and left her three shots behind. I guess you have to just think about the good shots you hit, Henseleit said. 
        
     Ryu had a chance to expand her lead until she missed a birdie putt from about the same distance Henseleit had. Ryu, who shared the 54-hole lead at a major last week in the Chevron Championship before closing with a 76, was at 18-under 198. Her last win last year was also at a tournament making its LPGA debut, the FM Championship. Yin, who lost a chance to win another major last week when she three-putted in the five-way playoff at the Chevron, started the day eight shots behind and posted her 62 about the time the final group was making the turn. Im just going to keep saying this: Stay in the present and the past is the past, Yin said. I mean, you cannot guarantee every day is going to be a good day like today, but you just got to keep trying and keep trying to have a great day. Starting times are moving forward for Sundays final round because of rain in the forecast. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/haeran-ryu-lpga-black-desert-ruoning-yin-9c3562f1b2b807e71106f28cc2c32083,sports
Reyes scores lone goal and Thorns down Pride 1-0 in the NWSL,"PORTLAND (AP)  Reyna Reyes scored early in the first half and the Portland Thorns held on for a 1-0 victory over the Orlando Pride on Saturday in the National Womens Soccer League.  In the only other NWSL match, the North Carolina Courage got a 2-0 win on the road against the Utah Royals.  It was just the second loss through seven games this season for the Pride, last seasons NWSL champions, who share the league lead with five wins.  Portland remained undefeated at Providence Park this season with two wins and three draws. The Thorns havent lost at home since October last year, when they fell 2-0 to the Pride.  Reyes first goal for the Thorns this season came in the 16th minute. The Mexican international maneuvered around three defenders with a strike from outside the box that went just inside the post.  Pride goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse collided with a Thorns player early in he second half and had to leave the game. She was replaced by backup McKinley Crone, who made her season debut.  Sam Coffey rejoined the Thorns after missing last weeks 3-3 draw against Racing Louisville with and excused absence.  Portland goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold has one other shutout this season. She finished with four saves against the Pride, which was tied for the league lead with 14 goals.  Portland (3-2-3) moved up to third in the league standings with the win.  
        
     Ashley Sanchez scored in the 12th minute and the Courage (2-3-2) won their second straight after starting the season winless in the first five games.  Kate Del Favas own goal doubled North Carolinas lead just before the half. Her attempt to deflect Ryan Williams cross instead went into her own net.

Crow-Armstrong homers for 3rd time in 2 nights as Cubs defeat Brewers 6-2,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Pete Crow-Armstrong and Dansby Swanson hit back-to-back homers off Jose Quintana in the fourth inning as the Chicago Cubs defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 6-2 on Saturday night. Kyle Tucker also went deep to help the NL Central-leading Cubs beat the two-time defending division champions for a second straight night. Chicagos Jameson Taillon (2-1), Julian Merryweather and Brad Keller combined on a four-hitter. Quintana (4-1) had allowed a total of three runs and one homer over 23 2/3 innings in his first four starts with the Brewers, but he gave up six runs and three homers in five innings Saturday. Crow-Armstrongs three-run shot to right-center broke a 1-all tie in the fourth inning and gave him nine homers this season. Crow-Armstrong homered twice in the Cubs 10-0 victory over the Brewers on Friday. Swanson followed by swinging at a 3-0 pitch and producing a 391-foot drive to left-center. Milwaukees Rhys Hoskins cut Chicagos lead to 5-2 in the bottom of the fourth by hitting a solo shot that Brewers reliever Trevor Megill caught with his cap in the bullpen. Tucker answered by leading off the fifth with a 372-foot drive into the right-field seats. The Brewers other run came in the third, when Jackson Chourio hit a two-out double and came home on Brice Turangs single. That ended the Brewers string of 21 straight scoreless innings. Taillon struck out five and allowed two runs, three hits and one walk in six innings. 
        
     Crow-Armstrongs tiebreaking homer was a 398-foot shot on a 3-2 fastball. Two of his three homers in this series have come on two-strike counts. He sent a 1-2 changeup over the center-field wall in the second inning Friday. The Brewers are 0-12 when their opponent scores first.

Barcelona defender Kound faces a spell out with hamstring injury,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  Barcelona defender Jules Kound sustained a left hamstring injury against Inter Milan in their Champions League semifinal, likely ruling him out of next weeks return leg. Kound has a distal hamstring injury and theres no timeframe on his return, Barcelona said on Thursday. His evolution will determine when he returns to first team activities, the five-time Champions League winner posted on its website. Distal hamstring injuries can take around two weeks to heal and sometimes cause pain behind the knee.  Barcelona plays Inter on Tuesday and is also fighting for the La Liga title, with a potentially decisive home game against defending champion Real Madrid on May 11. Kound has been an almost ever-present for coach Hansi Flick this season and Wednesdays thrilling first-leg match  which finished 3-3 and saw some spectacular goals  was his 53rd appearance of the season. Kound scored a fine goal last Saturday when he hit the winner in extra time against Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final. It was his fourth goal of a season where the France international has emerged as a key player under Flick. A few weeks ago, Kound was outspoken about how soccers congested schedule was having an impact on players bodies and warned of the risk of injury. Manchester City midfielder Rodri raised similar concerns early this season, shortly before sustaining an ACL injury which needed surgery. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-kounde-injury-5f0d5bb95920df2b651ee27344814061,sports
Revamped PSG loses at Strasbourg ahead of Champions League semi against Arsenal,"STRASBOURG, France (AP)  With its focus already on Arsenal, a revamped and young Paris Saint-Germain suffered a second straight Ligue 1 loss on Saturday. Champion PSG lost at Strasbourg 2-1. With the match coming between the two legs of the Champions League semifinal against Arsenal, PSG coach Luis Enrique rotated his team. Only Joao Neves was retained in the starting XI. PSG started with four players born in 2006 or later: Warren Zare-Emery, Senny Mayulu, Axel Tape and Ibrahim Mbaye. Im very proud of the young players, they showed what theyre capable of, Enrique said. We played a very good match but didnt get the result we wanted. Now we need to recover and concentrate on Wednesdays game. Star striker Ousmane Dembele, who picked up a light hamstring injury in the 1-0 win in London, was rested ahead of next weeks game against the Gunners at the Parc des Princes. Bradley Barcola, Mbaye and Goncalo Ramos started up front.  Strasbourg took the lead from a corner. Mamadou Sarrs glanced header was clumsily diverted in by PSG defender Lucas Hernandez. It was Strasbourgs ninth goal from a corner, the highest tally in the French top flight. PSG was punished again just before halftime when Felix Lemarechal curled in a superb strike from outside the box. Barcola pulled one back just after the interval. He collected the ball inside PSGs half, went on a 50-meter run into the area and finished the impressive solo effort from close range with remarkable composure. 
        
     The result extended Strasbourgs unbeaten run to 12 matches and lifted the team to fifth in the standings. Strasbourg has collected more points since the start of the year  40  than PSG. PSG suffered consecutive Ligue 1 losses for the first time in more than two years. PSGs bid to go unbeaten in Ligue 1 was ruined last month when it lost to Nice 3-1. Monaco striker Folarin Balogun scored his first Ligue 1 goal this year following shoulder surgery, as struggling Saint-Etienne was beaten 3-1. The U.S. forward was picked by Maghnes Akliouche and beat the offside trap to seal Monacos win from the edge of the box. Akliouche put Monaco ahead after just two minutes. Zuriko Davitashvili leveled for Saint-Etienne in the second half, three minutes before Moatasem Al Musrati put the visitors back in control. Monaco moved into second place, level on points with Marseille, which has one match in hand and plays at Lille on Sunday. Balogun returned to competition in March after undergoing surgery in December on his dislocated shoulder. The forward had previously been sidelined for about two months and returned to competition at the end of November. But he took a hit during a game against Marseille that aggravated the problem. Saint-Etienne remained in the relegation zone. Goals from Yann Gboho and Aron Donnum helped Toulouse to its first home win since mid-December.

Lando Norris beats teammate Oscar Piastri in eventful sprint race at rainy Miami Grand Prix,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Lando Norris beat McLaren Racing teammate Oscar Piastri to win the sprint race held Saturday ahead of qualifying for the Miami Grand Prix. My luck in Miami seems pretty good at this minute, said Norris, who will try to defend last years Miami victory on Sunday. The 18-lap sprint was eventful even before it started as heavy rain drenched the course and Charles Leclerc crashed in the wet conditions driving his Ferrari out to the grid for the start of the race. He wasnt able to compete in the sprint as Ferrari worked to repair his car in time for qualifying.  The start of the race was then delayed because drivers said the rain made conditions too dangerous and visibility was a concern. And when it finally went green, with 18-year-old Kimi Antonelli leading the standing start as the youngest pole-winner in F1 history, his time out front was brief. Piastri beat the Mercedes driver into the first turn and Antonelli drove off the track and slipped to fourth. He was later hit in the pits by Max Verstappen, who received a 10-second penalty for an unsafe release. Antonelli finished 11th and Verstappen, who had been running third, finished 17th and failed to earn any points for the event. The race ended under yellow because Liam Lawson ran into Fernando Alonso, causing Alonso to crash with three laps remaining. The safety prevented Piastri from trying to reclaim the lead from teammate Norris, who won the Miami Grand Prix last year for his first career F1 victory. 
        
     I dont think Im going to be buying a lottery ticket around this place, Piastri said. I feel like I did everything right so a bit disappointed to come in second. Lewis Hamilton finished third for Ferrari. He moved ahead of Verstappen before Verstappen served his penalty. Im so happy with that, its been a tough year so far, said Hamilton, who is in his first season driving for Ferrari. I never thought it would rain in Miami, its the first time weve all been in the wet here, and what a race it provided us. Alex Albon finished fourth for Williams and was followed by George Russell of Mercedes.  Alonso, Carlos Sainz Jr., and Leclerc did not complete the race.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/miami-f1-sprint-norris-76734ceaf7774b21a17fbf08e947e834,sports

Carson Hocevar earns 1st NASCAR Cup pole and becomes youngest polesitter ever at Texas,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)  Carson Hocevar earned his first NASCAR Cup pole with a qualifying lap of 191.659 mph at Texas on Saturday. The 22-year-old Hocevar is the youngest pole winner ever at Texas Motor Speedway, which will host its 45th Cup race on Sunday. The Spire Motorsports driver, making his 56th career Cup, is on the front row with Cup points leader William Byron, also in a Chevrolet. Hendrick Motorsports driver Byron turned a qualifying lap of 191.564 mph, just ahead of the 191.523 by Austin Cindric, the Team Penske driver who won in his Ford at Talladega last week.  Byrons teammate, Kyle Larson, qualified fourth. Michael McDowell, who drives for Spire with Hocevar, will start fifth.

Sabalenka beats Gauff in straight sets to win Madrid Open for 20th career title,"MADRID (AP)  No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka beat No. 4 Coco Gauff in straight sets to win her record-tying third Madrid Open and 20th career title on Saturday. Sabalenka powered through the first set and edged the American in a tiebreaker for 6-3, 7-6 (3) on the Caja Mgica clay court. Sabalenka added to titles in Madrid in 2021 and 2023 and equaled Petra Kvitovas tournament record. It was also Sabalenkas tour-leading third title of the year after Brisbane and Miami. She also pulled level with Gauff on head-to-head with five wins apiece. Gauff could have risen to No. 2 with a victory. The 2023 U.S. Open champion lost only one set this week until the final. Gauffs great record in finals slipped to nine wins in 11. Sabalenka battered Gauff with her drive early on, winning 17 consecutive points during one section for a 4-1 start. When Gauff found her weakness by spreading her shots around, the former champion dug in to force a second-set tiebreaker and crush any chance of a comeback. Sabalenka missed a championship point on a break chance in the second set, recalling her failure to convert three championship points in a loss to Iga Swiatek in last years final. After yelling at herself for her missed opportunity, the three-time Grand Slam winner shook off her demons, settled down and finished off her tour-high 31st win of 2025. When Gauffs final shot hit the net, Sabalenka thrust her arms into the air. It was a really tough match, Sabalenka said. At the end of the second set it was really intense and I was very emotional. I am happy I was able to handle my emotions.

"Mets-Cardinals game is postponed by weather, will be made up in Sunday doubleheader","ST. LOUIS (AP)  The game between the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Mets scheduled for Saturday was postponed because of rain and will be made up as part of a split doubleheader Sunday. The Mets have a nine-game winning streak in the series after beating St. Louis 9-3 on Friday night. New York swept a four-game set at Citi Field last month, and Sundays games are the last two in the season series. The Mets announced that prospect Blade Tidwell would make his major league debut in the first game against St. Louis right-hander Erick Fedde (1-3, 4.68 ERA). Tidwell, a 23-year-old righty, is 1-2 with a 5.00 ERA in six starts for Triple-A Syracuse this season. He has struck out 37 in 27 innings. In the second game, Andre Pallante (2-2, 4.13) will start for the Cardinals against Tylor Megill (3-2, 1.74), who had been scheduled to start Saturday opposite Fedde. Both Pallante and Megill are righties. Earlier Saturday, the Cardinals recalled right-hander Michael McGreevy from Triple-A Memphis to add depth to a bullpen that already was taxed because of a doubleheader Wednesday in Cincinnati and a rain delay in Thursdays game that cut starter Matthew Liberatores start short. McGreevy had been scheduled to start Memphis game on Saturday. He is 3-1 with a 4.08 ERA in Memphis last year, and he was 3-0 with a 1.96 ERA in four games, including three starts, for St. Louis last year. Reliever Roddery Muoz was optioned to Memphis to make room for McGreevy. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-cardinals-postponed-rain-doubleheader-0c612c48c1dc7225bb0d4cfc8fa96d8c,sports
Astros slugger Yordan Alvarez sits out game at White Sox with hand inflammation,"CHICAGO (AP)  Struggling Astros slugger Yordan Alvarez was held out of Saturdays game against the White Sox in Chicago with right hand inflammation. Houston manager Joe Espada said he didnt believe the injury was serious and Alvarez could return for Sundays series finale. The three-time All-Stars condition has been cumulative and not related to a single event. Hes just been sore for a couple of days, Espada said. So Im gonna give him a day just to see if he can feel better. Alvarez is off to a slow start this season, batting .210 with three homers and 18 RBIs in 29 games.  The 27-year-old outfielder/designated hitter batted .308 last season with 35 homers and 86 RBIs.

Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. is back in the lineup a day after taking a fastball to the forearm,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  San Diego Padres outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. was in the lineup for Saturdays game against Pittsburgh, less than 24 hours after taking a pitch on the forearm. Tatis exited San Diegos 9-4 victory over the Pirates on Friday night in the third inning after getting drilled in the left forearm on a 93 mph sinker from Pittsburgh starter Mitch Keller. Padres manager Mike Shildt said Saturday that X-rays on Tatis were negative. While Tatis will be dealing with some soreness, the swelling from the contusion had dissipated and he was cleared to play. Tatis, who is hitting .345 with eight homers and 25 RBIs so far this season, was batting leadoff against Pittsburghs Bailey Falter. San Diego did make a couple of roster moves on Saturday, calling up catcher Luis Campasano from Triple-A El Paso while sending down utility player Connor Joe in hopes that Joe can get more regular at-bats. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/san-diego-padres-fernando-tatis-02a5939b280b9cd05c0ab54abdf1fd51,sports
Bengaluru go top of the IPL after epic two-run win over Chennai,"BENGALURU, India (AP)  Fast bowler Yash Dayal held his nerve to give table-topping Royal Challengers Bengaluru a sensational two-run win over Chennai Super Kings in a last-ball Indian Premier League thriller on Saturday. Chennai, already eliminated from playoffs contention, needed 15 off the last over to prevent Bengaluru from notching its eighth win and topping the table. Dayal faced Ravindra Jadeja, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and impact player Shivam Dube and used full tosses and yorkers to dismiss Dhoni off the third ball and concede three singles off the last three balls. Chennai was stranded on 211-5 after nearly chasing down Bengalurus 213-5. I felt I should have converted a couple of more shots, and eased the pressure, so I will take the blame for it, Dhoni said.  The 17-year-old opener Ayush Mhatre kept Chennai in the hunt with a scintillating 94 off 48 balls, supported by Jadejas unbeaten 77. Mhatre and Jadeja stitched a rollicking 114-run partnership off 64 balls. Both batters were dropped in Dayals second spell. South African fast bowler Lungi Ngidi, who replaced an injured Josh Hazlewood, the IPLs second leading wickt-taker, brought Bengaluru back in the game with two wickets in two balls in the 17th over. Ngidi deceived Mhatre with a slower ball and had him caught at midwicket, and then Dewald Brevis was out leg before. But replays suggested the ball would have missed leg stump. 
        
     Down to the last over, Dube swung the game back in Chennais favor when he belted a six off a waist-high no-ball. But Dayal bowled three perfect yorkers to Dube and Jadeja for Bengaluru to snatch victory. He (Dayal) is the main bowler of our team, a death-overs specialist, Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar said. It was a clear-cut message to give him the last over. Last year as well, he did the same thing for the team and he did it again (tonight). After half-centuries by Bengaluru openers Virat Kohli and Jacob Bethell, they slumped to 159-5 going into the 19th over. But Romario Shepherd smacked 53 off 14 balls, tied for the second fastest half-century in IPL history, to give Bengaluru a total it could defend. Kohli, who hit his fourth successive half-century to lead the run-scorers list, and Bethell grafted a 97-run opening stand but then Chennai spinners Noor Ahmad (1-26) and Jadeja (0-26) squeezed the run-rate. Chennai looked to contain Bengaluru until Shepherd shredded Khaleel Ahmed in the 19th over and Matheesha Pathirana in the 20th. Shepherd struck four sixes and two boundaries in Ahmeds over, which went for 33 runs. The left-arm fast bowler finished with an expensive 0-65 off his three overs. Shepherd then hit Pathirana for two fours and raised his electrifying half-century by lofting the Sri Lankan fast bowler for successive sixes off the last two balls. Shepherd in the death overs was excellent, Dhoni said. Whatever we were bowling, he was able to hit it for maximum runs. We need to practice more yorkers. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/bengaluru-chennai-ipl-9fe57c2305b12f86452a5d046b766d7e,sports
Red Sox 1B Triston Casas out for rest of season after rupturing left knee tendon,"BOSTON (AP)  Boston Red Sox first baseman Triston Casas suffered a ruptured tendon in his left knee and is out for the remainder of the season, the team said. The 25-year-old Casas ruptured his patellar tendon running to first on a slow roller up the line and fell awkwardly in Bostons victory over the Minnesota Twins on Friday night. After laying on his back in pain  not moving the knee  he was carted off on a stretcher before being taken to a Boston hospital. The team announced Sunday that he had surgery for a left patellar tendon repair at Massachusetts General Hospital. The surgery was performed by Dr. Eric Berkson. I talked to him last night, Chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said in a press conference on Saturday discussing the injury outside Bostons clubhouse. We exchanged text messages (today). We all care deeply about just his overall wellbeing. Manager Alex Cora said Casas worked hard during the offseason to play every day after missing a large amount of last year with torn cartilage in his rib cage. He did an outstanding job in the offseason to put himself in that situation. It didnt start the way he wanted it to, Cora said of Casas struggles. He was going to play and play a lot. Now weve got to focus on the rehab after the surgery and hopefully get him back stronger than ever and ready to go next year. Casas batted just .182 with three homers and 11 RBIs, but Breslow said his loss will be felt, especially with the teams lack of depth at the position. 
        
     He certainly struggled through the first month of the season but that didnt change what we believe his production was capable of being, Breslow said. Its a big loss. In addition to what we think we were going to get on the offensive side, he was kind of like a stabilizing presence on the defensive side of the field  also a big personality and a big part of the clubhouse. During spring training, Casas talked about how his focus at the plate this season was being more relaxed. You really want it until you dont, he said, explaining his thoughts while standing at his locker. Then you cant want it that much. Now, hell have to focus on his recovery plan for next season. Casas, a left-handed batter, was placed on the 10-day injured list Saturday with infielder/outfielder Abraham Toro selected from Triple-A Worcester. Cora said Toro  a switch-hitter  will split time at first along with Romy Gonzalez. who bats right-handed. Breslow said the team might be exploring a long-term replacement. This is unfortunately an opportunity to explore whats available, he said. Well look both internally and outside as well. Cora said there are no plans to move Rafael Devers, who was replaced at third by offseason, free-agent acquisition Alex Bregman, and moved to DH. We asked him to do something in spring training that in the beginning he didnt agree with it and now hes very comfortable doing what hes doing, Cora said. Like I told you guys in spring training, hes my DH. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/casas-red-sox-injury-82e7d7a687c4b779a520a2354b8912ac,sports
"Mrazova nets OT winner to lift Charge past Sceptres 2-1, clinch PWHL playoff berth","TORONTO (AP)  Katerina Mrazova scored 2:52 into overtime to lift the Ottawa Charge to a 2-1 regular-season finale win over the Toronto Sceptres and a playoff berth on Saturday. Brianne Jenner also scored for Ottawa (12-2-4-12). Gwyneth Philips stopped 13 shots. The Charge came in needing a win of any kind, or a Minnesota loss against Boston later Saturday, to secure their first postseason appearance in the PWHL. Ottawa lost 5-2 to Toronto in the regular-season finale last season needing a regulation win to secure a playoff spot. Ottawa lost 3-0 to Minnesota on Wednesday with a chance to move six or seven points ahead of the Frost  with either an overtime/shootout win or a regulation win  and clinch a playoff spot. Sarah Nurse scored for Toronto (12-3-6-9). Kristen Campbell made 22 saves while becoming the fourth PWHL goaltender to reach 1,000 career regular-season saves. The Sceptres entered the day with a chance to steal first place from Montreal with a win and a New York regulation win over Montreal later Saturday. The top-seeded team entering the postseason gets its choice of opponent for the best-of-five semifinal series. Both teams playoff opponents will be determined Sunday. Sceptres: Toronto struggled to get shots on net against the Charge, sometimes settling for shots from the point instead of inching closer into the offensive zone to potentially get a better opportunity. Charge: Ottawa had more offensive volume with shots on net, but didnt have many threatening chances either in regulation. 
        
     Mrzov cut across in front in the slot and whipped it past Campbell to the delight of the Charge fans at Coca-Cola Coliseum. Since the February international break, the Charge are 7-1-2-4, the leagues second-best record behind the Sceptres (7-3-1-3) entering Saturday. The Ottawa offense has been leading the way in that span averaging 3.00 goals per game. ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/pwhl-toronto-ottawa-score-cc9f0b90bcc8e73571747e87e3ce09d8,sports
"Rays overcome Judges 11th homer, steal 6 bases and rally past Yankees 3-2 to stop 4-game skid","NEW YORK (AP)  Curtis Mead and Jos Caballero had RBIs in a two-run eighth inning, and the Tampa Bay Rays overcame Aaron Judges 11th home run to beat the New York Yankees 3-2 on Saturday and stop a four-game losing streak. Judge homered in the first against Zack Littell (2-5), who retired his next 11 batters before Austin Wells started the fifth with his sixth homer for a 2-1 lead.  Judge has four homers in his last six games. The two-time AL MVP is hitting a major league-leading .432 and has a 29-game on-base streak. He is 26 for 52 during a 13-game hitting streak. Taylor Walls hit a second-inning sacrifice fly against emergency starter Ryan Yarbrough, facing his former team because Clarke Schmidt was scratched with soreness in his left side. Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe landed hard on his left shoulder trying for a diving backhand stop on Christopher Morels grounder in the eighth, which went for an infield single. After a walk and three stolen bases, Mead hit a tying single off Mark Leiter Jr. (2-3) for his third RBI this season. Caballero followed with a grounder up the middle that Volpe allowed to pop out of his glove for his fourth error as he started toward second in a try for an inning-ending double play. Edwin Uceta got Judge to ground out with runners at the corners for the final out of the eighth, and Pete Fairbanks got three straight outs to remain perfect in seven save chances. Yankees pitchers walked at least six for the fifth time this season. The Rays finished with six steals. 
        
     Moved to left field in a defensive shift, New Yorks Cody Bellinger made an off-balance leaping catch on Kameron Misner in the eighth, saving two runs. New York has 16 first-inning homers  one more than Kansas City had in all innings entering Saturday. Judge has six first-inning homers. Yankees RHP Will Warren (1-1, 5.63 ERA) and Rays RHP Taj Bradley (2-2, 4.58 ERA) start Sundays series finale. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-rays-score-31ce0fac699106c8f26e351273efe15f,sports
Dodgers recall South Korean All-Star Hyeseong Kim and place Tommy Edman on injured list,"ATLANTA (AP)  The Los Angeles Dodgers recalled South Korean All-Star Hyeseong Kim on Saturday and placed second baseman Tommy Edman on the injured list. Kim agreed to a $12.5 million, three-year contract with the Dodgers on Jan. 3 and opened the season with Triple-A Oklahoma City. Edman was put on the 10-day IL, retroactive to Wednesday, after missing two games with a sore right ankle. He ranks second on the team with eight home runs and 24 RBIs. Tommy ran (Friday) and just still didnt feel great, manager Dave Roberts said before Saturday nights game against the Atlanta Braves. Still some soreness in the ankle. He didnt feel he could play tonight or even tomorrow potentially. Roberts said he expects Edman to spend just the minimum 10 days on the injured list. Edmans injury created an opportunity for Kim to make his major league debut Saturday night. He entered at second base in the ninth inning of a 10-3 victory. Ill figure it out to see if theres an opportunity to start, Roberts said before the game. Right now, he can come off the bench and fill in at certain spots. Chris Taylor started at second in a game delayed 3 hours, 6 minutes, because of rain and lightning. Roberts said Kims versatility as a middle infielder, outfielder and pinch runner was a factor in the teams decision, based on roster depth for what Roberts said is potentially a short stint in the majors. Kim, 26, played eight seasons in South Korea, including the last six with the Seoul-based Kiwoom Heroes.  In 28 games with Oklahoma City, he batted .252 with five home runs, 19 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-edman-kim-19ac5230896d3cc80df3b6cdb457fdf5,sports

Meyers homers twice and drives in a career-high 7 as the Astros beat the White Sox 8-3,"CHICAGO (AP)  Jake Meyers homered twice and set a career high with seven RBIs, helping the Houston Astros beat the Chicago White Sox 8-3 on Saturday. Batting ninth, Meyers had four hits in his third career multihomer game. Hunter Brown (5-1) struck out nine in six innings, winning his fifth straight decision. The right-hander allowed three runs  all in the first inning  and four hits. Houston had lost two in a row, including the opener of the three-game series on Friday. Andrew Vaughn had two hits and two RBIs for last-place Chicago. Fraser Ellard (0-2) got the loss. White Sox right-hander Davis Martin permitted three runs and eight hits in five innings. Meyers hit his first homer of the season on Martins first pitch of the third. He tied it at 3 with a two-run triple with two out in the fourth, capping a 10-pitch at bat. Meyers connected for a tiebreaking three-run shot in the sixth against Penn Murfee, and he also doubled home Zach Dezenzo in a two-run eighth. Houston played without slugger Yordan Alvarez, who was sidelined by right hand inflammation. Brown has won five of six starts since a 3-1 loss to the Mets on March 28. Chicago jumped in front in the first. Andrew Benintendi singled home Chase Meidroth, and Vaughn added a two-run single. With two men on and two outs in the sixth, the right-handed Murfee entered to face the right-handed hitting Meyers. He hit Murfees second pitch, a high inside sweeper, 409 feet to left. 
        
     Meyers entered with no homers and six RBIs in 30 games and 84 at-bats.

Transgender women soccer players to be banned from womens teams in England and Scotland,"LONDON (AP)  Transgender women will be banned from playing on womens soccer teams in England and Scotland following a U.K. Supreme Court ruling last month, the sports governing body said Thursday. The Football Association said it had decided to change its rules that had allowed transgender athletes to play on womens soccer if they had reduced testosterone levels. The Scottish Football Association made a similar decision that applies to competitive women and girls soccer.  The U.Ks highest court issued a ruling two weeks ago that defined a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female. The head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said after the ruling that transgender women would be excluded from womens toilets, hospital wards and sports teams. While the ruling was cheered by some feminist groups, it has been condemned by trans-rights groups who said it would have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life. The issue has been polarizing in the U.K. and beyond, particularly in the United States, where President Donald Trump has signed executive orders to prohibit participation of transgender athletes in sports and to use a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are being challenged in court. The FA said that its policy before Thursday had been to make the sport accessible to as many people as possible, but that it would make alterations if there were changes in law, science or the operations of grassroots football.  
        
     We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify, and we are contacting the registered transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can continue to stay involved in the game, the FA said in a statement. About 20 transgender women have been playing in English grassroots games this season. The people I know that are talking about this are saying: Well, thats it for football for me, said Natalie Washington, a member of the group Football v Transphobia. Most people clearly dont feel that they can go and play in the mens game for reasons of safety, for reasons of comfort. Fiona McAnena, of the group Sex Matters, welcomed the English FA decision, saying it was long overdue. The FA has had ample evidence of the harms to women and girls caused by its nonsensical policy of letting men who identify as women play in womens teams, McAnena said. The requirement to lower their testosterone tells you that everyone knew they were not women. McAnena said that every other sporting body needs to take similar action. The group that oversees netball, an offshoot of basketball played mainly by women, said Thursday that its female category would apply to those who were born female.  England Netball said its decision wasnt the result of the court ruling. It said that it would have three gender categories of participation: female, male and mixed, with the latter category allowing people to compete according to their gender identity.",https://apnews.com/article/transgender-women-soccer-england-fa-football-association-d9c49c04298b10fd1fd1a3e6307917c5,sports
Forget the Premier League for a weekend and buckle up for a wild last day in the Championship,"MANCHESTER, England (AP)  Liverpool has been crowned Premier League champion with weeks to spare.  The fight for survival is done.  And while there is still a wide open battle to secure Champions League qualification, as far as English soccer is concerned the best show in town this weekend is in the second-tier Championship. In the final round on Saturday, as many as 10 teams are vying for a place in the playoffs or scrapping to avoid relegation. Theres also the not-so-small matter of which team will go up to the Premier League as champion, with Leeds and Burnley neck and neck at the top of the standings.  So buckle up and get ready for a day of drama. Relegated from the top flight over the past two seasons, Leeds and Burnley have bounced back in style. If both win their final game they will be promoted on 100 points each.  Leeds, relegated in 2023, leads the way on goal difference, meaning a win at second-from-bottom Plymouth will almost certainly be enough to seal the title. For Burnley, relegated last year, to go top if both teams win, it would need to better Leeds result by an improbable 14 goals. Burnley is playing playoff-challenging Millwall.  
        
     Third-placed Sheffield United was also relegated last year and has an almighty fight on its hands to join Leeds and Burnley back in the top flight.  Third place means the playoffs, where four teams play in two semifinals and a final to secure the last promotion spot. Sunderland, in fourth, has also qualified for the playoffs, leaving five teams to compete for the last two spots. Just three points separate fifth-placed Bristol City and ninth-placed Middlesbrough. Coventry, Millwall and Blackburn are also in contention. The standout game is sixth-placed Coventry vs. Middlesbrough. A win for Middlesbrough would see it leapfrog Coventry, but it would still need other results to go its way to be sure of a playoff place. Luton Town, a Premier League team last season, has one more game to avoid making it back-to-back relegations. Luton is one of five teams, realistically, fighting for survival on the final day. Luton, which plays West Brom, is one of three teams that start the day one point above the relegation zone along with Derby and Preston. Plymouths fate has not yet been sealed but with a goal difference of -36, relegation is all but certain in a match against top-of-the-table Leeds.  Only two points separate Stoke in 18th and Hull in the last relegation spot in 22nd. A draw for Hull at Portsmouth could be enough to see it climb out of the bottom three if other results go its way. One game that is sure to be fraught with tension is Derby vs. Midlands rival Stoke, where defeat for either team would leave them relying on other results to stay up. Champions League qualification is the main issue still to be determined in the Premier League.  With England getting a bonus fifth place for next season, the fight to finish in the top five remains wide open with Newcastle, Manchester City, Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa close together. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/premier-league-promotion-championship-07e20bb41c0a040b3befc1e4a6b4f86c,sports
Bundesliga Preview: What to watch in German soccer this weekend,"BERLIN (AP)  Bayern Munich hopes to confirm the resumption of normal service in the Bundesliga by wrapping up another title on Saturday. An outstanding campaign from Xabi Alonsos Bayer Leverkusen ended Bayerns record 11-year reign last season, but the Bavarian powerhouse has bounced back from that unexpected interruption to put itself in position for what would be a record-extending 34th German championship. A win in Leipzig on Saturday would clinch it, irrespective of Leverkusens visit to Freiburg the next day. Bayern leads the defending champion by eight points with three rounds remaining. This round could also see the first team relegated from the division with Bochum fighting for its survival on Friday.  Bayern will need to beat Leipzig without the suspended Harry Kane, who looks set to win his first ever major title while watching from the stands. Kane picked up his fifth yellow card last weekend in the 3-0 win over Mainz. Leipzig is fighting for Champions League qualification and could delay Bayerns party as it bids to finish among the top four.  Leverkusen is already thinking of next season with Bayern poised to clinch the title but fourth-placed Freiburg is also fighting for Champions League qualification.  Bottom side Bochum visits relegation rival Heidenheim on Friday, when it realistically needs a win to keep alive its slim hopes of avoiding the drop. Heidenheim, in the relegation playoff place four points above Bochum, would send Bochum down to the second division if it wins.  Borussia Dortmunds late push for Champions League qualification continues at home to Wolfsburg on Saturday. Dortmund appears to have turned a corner under new coach Niko Kova with three straight wins across all competitions since its 2-2 draw at Bayern.  Michael Olise is arguably Bayerns stand-out player this season after arriving from Crystal Palace last summer. The France winger set up one goal and set up another against Mainz to take his tally to nine goals and 16 assists in the Bundesliga.  Thomas Mller will likely fill in for the suspended Kane against Leipzig. It might be the veterans last start for Bayern in his 501st Bundesliga appearance as hes set to leave the club at the end of the season.  Florian Wirtz is another player who could potentially leave amid speculation linking the Leverkusen star to Manchester City and Real Madrid.  Hoffenheim captain Oliver Baumann is out of his teams match at Borussia Mnchengladbach because of concussion from his clash with Carney Chukwuemeka in the loss to Dortmund last week. Chukwuemekas knee struck the goalkeepers head in a race for the ball.  Theres better news for another goalkeeper as Freiburgs Noah Atubolu has recovered from a shoulder injury and could return against Leverkusen.  Leverkusen is reportedly resigned to coach Xabi Alonso leaving for former club Real Madrid and is considering former Barcelona coach Xavi and former Manchester United coach Erik ten Hag as possible successors.  The 2024 champion announced Ibrahim Maza from Hertha Berlin as its first signing for next season on Thursday. Leverkusen has also been linked with Serbian goalkeeper ore Petrovi  on loan at Strasbourg from Chelsea  and Paris Saint-Germains 17-year-old defender Axel Tape.  Eric Deiers contract at Bayern is up at the end of the end of the season and the England defender has reportedly opted for a switch to Monaco. Gladbach defender Ko Itakura has emerged as a target for Bayern, though Dortmund is also interested in the Japan international with Nico Schlotterbeck out for several months.  Ill need a ticket next year.  Thomas Mller considers a novelty after 25 years at Bayern. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/bundesliga-preview-bayern-acc2373397460b858c30929ac05a4c55,sports
Qatar replaces Garcia as national coach with Lopetegui,"DOHA, Qatar (AP)  Qatar appointed former Real Madrid and Spain boss Julen Lopetegui as the national coach on Thursday. Lopetegui, 58, has signed a contract until the 2027 Asian Cup, where Qatar will go for a third consecutive title. His first game in charge is on June 5 at home to Iran, and then in Uzbekistan five days later. Ready for a new chapter. Welcome Lopetegui, the Qatar Football Association wrote on social media. Were excited to embark on this journey together. Lopetegui replaces fellow Spaniard Luis Garcia, who took the job only last December and whose departure was also announced on Thursday. The QFA extends its deepest appreciation to Mr Garcia for his professionalism and dedication throughout his time with the team, the QFA wrote on social media. After poor results in World Cup qualifying, Qatar is fourth in Asia Group A and already out of the running to finish in the top two spots that guarantee a place at the 2026 tournament. But there is still a chance for the 2022 host to qualify for the first time through a playoff route. Lopeteguis last two jobs were in the Premier League with Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Ham, where he was fired in January. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/qatar-coach-lopetegui-garcia-afd58e58b8ecbac73906419611c7e289,sports

Riley Greene homers twice during eight-run ninth inning to lead Tigers to 9-1 win over Angels,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Riley Greene homered to open the ninth inning and capped an eight-run outburst with a three-run shot to lead the Detroit Tigers to a 9-1 win over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night. Colt Keith had a solo homer and Javier Bez hit a two-run drive in the inning against closer Kenley Jansen, who opened the season with eight scoreless innings but was pitching for the first time in eight days. With his three-run shot off left-hander Jake Eder, Greene became the first Tigers player to homer twice in an inning since Magglio Ordonez against the Oakland Athletics on Aug. 12, 2007. According to the Elias Sports Bureau. he became the first player in major league history to hit two homers in the ninth inning of a game.  Tyler Holton (2-2) pitched a scoreless eighth inning for the win. Jansen (0-1) gave up six runs and six hits in the ninth, as the Angels lost their seventh straight and 15th in the last 19 games. Angels shortstop Zach Neto crushed Detroit left-hander Tarik Skubals first pitch of the game for his fourth homer. The Tigers tied the score 1-1 in the seventh on Trey Sweeneys homer off reliever Ryan Johnson. Angels starter Jose Soriano allowed six hits in six innings, striking out five and walking one.  Skubal, the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner, allowed one run and four hits in six innings, striking out eight and walking one. Tempers flared in the bottom of the third when Neto and Skubal exchanged words after the Tigers ace blew a 99-mph fastball by Neto for strike three. Both benches emptied, but no punches were thrown. 
        
     Travis dArnaud singled to lead off the fifth inning. It was the last baserunner the Angels had, as Skubal and relievers Chase Lee, Holton and Tyler Owens combined to retire the final 15 batters, eight by strikeout. The Angels have hit safely in 4,000 consecutive regular-season games since being no-hit by Minnesota Twins left-hander Eric Milton on Sept. 11, 1999. Thats the longest active streak without being no-hit in the major leagues.

Robbie Rays gem leads the Giants over the Rockies 4-0,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Robbie Ray held the Colorado Rockies to two singles over seven innings and the San Francisco Giants ended a three-game losing streak with a 4-0 victory Friday night. Coming off its first consecutive wins this season, Colorado lost for the 17th time in 20 games, dropped to a big league-worst 6-26 and was blanked for fourth time this year. Ray (4-0) struck out eight, walked two and allowed only one runner to get into scoring position. The 2021 AL Cy Young Award winner with Toronto needed only 86 pitches. Hayden Birdsong gave up one hit over the final two innings to complete the first shutout of the season for San Franciscos pitching staff.  The Giants got to Antonio Senzatela (1-5) for three runs in the second inning. The key hit was an RBI double by LaMonte Wade Jr., who entered with a .123 batting average. San Francisco third baseman Matt Chapman was in a 6-for-44 slump when he came to the plate in the third. Chapman took Senzatela deep to left for a solo home run, his sixth homer of the season. The game lasted only 2 hours, 2 minutes.  Colorado had runners at the corners with two outs in the sixth before Ray got Hunter Goodman to ground out to Chapman at third to end the threat. San Francisco has won each of Rays seven starts this year. Thats the longest season-opening streak for a Giants starter since Bill Swifts 11 starts in 1992. Swift led the NL with a 2.08 ERA that year.

Crow-Armstrong credits the depth of the Cubs lineup for helping him produce fast start,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Pete Crow-Armstrong says he has his teammates to thank for sparking him to his fast start this season. Crow-Armstrong hit two homers in a 10-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday night to give him eight this year, two off his 2024 total in 123 games as a rookie. He also already has 12 steals to go along with an .859 OPS. The 23-year-old outfielder has delivered much of that production while batting seventh in the order, where he was hitting again Friday. Its so easy to hit in this lineup, Crow-Armstrong said. I just feel so confident going up to the plate in the seven hole. Talk about flying under the radar. I feel like I can kind of hide in there in a way because its so easy to want to go have a good at bat when youve got eight other guys who can really do it behind you and in front of you. The Cubs are leading the majors with 6.1 runs per game with a lineup featuring plenty of power and speed. The Cubs have an MLB-leading 44 steals  theyve been caught only six times  and rank third with 49 homers. Many of those homers have come in the bottom third of the order. Crow-Armstrongs two solo shots Friday gave the Cubs a total of 18 from the seventh, eighth or ninth hitters in the lineup. Thats why you score a lot of runs, is were getting production from all over the lineup and from a number of different people, Cubs manager Craig Counsell said. Thats been a strength of this team so far. 
        
     Crow-Armstrong has showcased that with two two-homer games this season. He also went deep twice April 13 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He already had a reputation as an elite defensive outfielder heading into this season, but he was still unproven as a hitter. Crow-Armstrong batted .237 with a .286 on-base percentage, 10 homers, 47 RBIs and 21 steals last year. Through his first 33 games this season, Crow-Armstrong is hitting .271 with a .309 on-base percentage, eight homers and 23 RBIs. He homered off Quinn Priester in the second inning and Joel Payamps in the seventh on Friday, drawing chants of PCA from the Cubs fans who made the trip to Milwaukee. Its nice kind of seeing myself grow into my power, or just being able to use it properly, Crow-Armstrong said. But doubles is what I want. At the end of the day, doubles is what Im going for, hitting to the big part of the field. Again, to bring it back to the lineup, its super comforting knowing that Ive just got to get on first base. Its not all the time I have to be in scoring position, but a single usually turns into a double with a few of us on this team. Kind of knowing that is big. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/chicago-cubs-cf118a37fa6575f8af6f7e19e7a3a10d,sports
Pete Alonsos hot start is a catalyst for NL East-leading Mets,"ST. LOUIS (AP)  In a sport where the most successful players fail in most of their at-bats, Pete Alonso knows perfection is not possible. But that wont stop him from trying. Alonso hit the go-ahead home run in the Mets 9-3 win at St. Louis on Friday night to keep up his strong start. This game is really imperfect, and I never really truly feel like that its ever going to be perfect, but I just want to be able to strive for that perfection, Alonso said.  Through 33 games, Alonso has an 1.137 OPS for the NL East-leading Mets. A career .249 hitter entering 2025, his batting average is .345 and hes also drawn 24 walks. Alonso said his drive to take his game to the next level was spurred on by getting a taste of the playoffs last year, when New York made it to the NL Championship Series. Every game counts, Alonso said. Beyond that, every at-bat and every swing  or decision not to swing  matters. This is year seven (in MLB), Alonso said. I know what I need to do to be successful. And for me, I think just holding on to holding on to my swing mechanics and just trying to be the best version of myself every single pitch, every single at bat, every single night. Brandon Nimmo, Alonsos teammate his entire big-league career, has seen the difference. I think its just another exclamation point on all the work that hes done this offseason. It seems like hes in an amazing spot, to me, Nimmo said. Its not just a flash in the pan. Like, this is sustained success.  
        
     Last season, Alonso struck out in nearly a quarter of his plate appearances, tying for the 14th-most in the league. Hes reduced that number to less than 15% so far this season. We know the power is there, and we know hes a good hitter, but he gets in trouble when he starts chasing, Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. I feel like now, like hes taking his walk and hes getting pitches to hit and hes not missing them. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/pete-alonso-mets-9a637a35d9e73aefd6583dd15503ce8b,sports
Tiernan scores twice as Angel City outlasts Spirit 4-3,"Riley Tiernan scored her second goal of the match in the eighth minute of second-half stoppage time to give Angel City a 4-3 win over the Washington Spirit in the National Womens Soccer League on Friday night. Elsewhere in the NWSL, the Houston Dash fell 2-1 at home to Racing Louisville and the Seattle Reign edged the Kansas City Current 1-0. Tiernan opened the scoring at Audi Field with a quick finish from the center of the box in the eighth minute. Gisele Thompson scored off a cross from her sister Alyssa Thompson in the 22nd minute to make it 2-0. It was the first time sisters had combined for a goal in NWSL history. Spirit defender Esme Morgan scored her first NWSL goal in the 30th and Gift Monday finished into an open net in the 40th to make it 2-2 at halftime. Angel Citys Katie Zelem made it 3-2 with a left-footed shot in the 72nd minute, but the Spirit tied it again Morgans second of the match. Christen Press flicked on a corner kick for Tiernans winner, her fifth goal of the season. Angel City (3-2-2) interim head coach Sam Laity received a red card after Tiernans winning goal. It is the first time that the Spirit (4-3-0) has lost two consecutive NWSL matches since September 2023. 
        
     Emma Sears scored in the 70th minute to give Racing Louisville the come-from-behind win at Shell Energy Stadium. The 24-year-old winger scored her fourth of the season on a breakaway counterattack. Although her strike went straight at Dash goalkeeper Jane Campbell, the ricochet skidded off Campbell and into the net. Houston (2-4-1) had taken the lead on Avery Pattersons goal on the edge of the box in the eighth minute. After lightning in the area delayed the game for nearly an hour, Kayla Fischer tied things up at 1-1 by hitting a long-range goal in the 20th.  Louisville (2-3-2) has now taken seven points from its last three away matches. Lynn Biyendolo scored the games only goal in the 37th minute at Lumen Field. Reign (3-2-2) coach Laura Harvey then opted to sit back in a defensive game plan. In the second half, the Current (5-2-0) outshot their opponent 10-1, 3-0 on target. Kansas City head coach Vlatko Andonovski brought reigning NWSL MVP Temwa Chawinga, who has been dealing with a hip issue, off the bench in the 61st minute but she could not find the equalizer. It is the second consecutive defeat for Kansas City after going undefeated through the first five weeks of the season. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/seattle-reign-angel-city-washington-spirit-houston-dash-racing-louisville-8c4b3334999941f85ef044852bc8305e,sports

Tigers slugger Riley Greene has historic 2-homer ninth inning in 9-1 win over Angels,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Riley Greene didnt want to dwell too much on becoming the first player in major league history to homer twice in the ninth inning of a game. The Detroit Tigers slugger hit a leadoff shot and then added a three-run drive later in the inning in a 9-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night. Yeah, I just found that out  pretty cool, Greene said after fueling an eight-run, seven-hit outburst in the ninth. But the game is over. We got to show up tomorrow and try to win another baseball game. The score was tied 1-1 when Greene, facing closer Kenley Jansen, led off the ninth with a 371-foot homer off the top of the right-field wall. Colt Keith followed with a homer to left-center for a 2-1 lead, Jace Jung singled with one out, and Javier Bez hit a two-out, two-run shot to left for a 5-1 lead, giving Bez home runs in three straight games. Detroit, an American League-best 21-12, wasnt through. Kerry Carpenter singled, Zach McKinstry doubled, knocking Jansen out of the game, and Carpenter scored on a wild pitch to make it 6-1. Spencer Torkelson walked, giving Greene a shot at history, and the cleanup man seized the moment, crushing a 409-foot homer to right-center off left-hander Jake Eder for a 9-1 lead. Greene became the first Tigers player to hit two homers in an inning since Magglio Ordonez against the Oakland Athletics on Aug. 12, 2007. The only other Tigers player to homer twice in an inning was Hall-of-Famer Al Kaline, against the Kansas City As on April 17, 1955. 
        
     Hes made an All-Star team, hes been a featured player on our team, he hits in the middle of the order, he gets all the toughest matchups, and he asks for more, Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said of Greene, who is batting .276 with an .828 OPS, seven homers and 20 RBIs on the season. You want guys to be rewarded when they work as hard as they do, and tonight was a huge night for him. It was the second straight night in which the Tigers landed a few late-inning haymakers in Anaheim. Detroit scored eight runs on seven hits in the eighth and ninth innings of Thursday nights 10-4 victory over the Angels, who have lost seven straight and 15 of their last 19 games. Theres no quit in our team, said ace Tarik Skubal, who gave up one run and four hits and struck out eight in six innings Friday night. We grind out at-bats, we dont give away at-bats, and I think our record shows that. They grind out starters, relievers  I know I wouldnt want to face a lineup like that. Every at-bat, theyre in it. ___ AP MLB: https://www.apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/tigers-greene-065dd8a05513d50622c14a1044f679e7,sports

Rabada had left the Indian Premier League last month, saying at the time he returned home for personal reasons.

It was unclear whether he would be able to play in South Africas World Test Championship final against Australia at Lords next month. The 29-year-old Rabada said he was deeply sorry and looking forward to returning to the game. Moving forward, this moment will not define me, he said. I will keep doing what I have always done, continuously working hard and playing with passion and devotion to my craft.

American curlers Thiesse and Dropkin earn spot in Milan-Cortina Olympic mixed doubles field,"Americans Cory Thiesse and Korey Dropkin clinched a berth in the 2026 Olympic mixed doubles curling competition when they beat Canada 8-4 at the world championships in Fredericton, New Brunswick, on Saturday to earn a fifth-place finish that was enough for a spot in Milan-Cortina. While were disappointed to have not finished on the podium, we were beyond thrilled to make the playoffs and secure our spot at the Olympics! Thiesse said. Its a dream come true for both of us. It will be the first Olympics for Dropkin, who was runner-up to five-time Olympian and 2018 gold medalist John Shuster at the U.S. mens trials for each of the last two Winter Games. Thiesse was an alternate for Nina Roths womens team in Pyeongchang in 2018. We work so hard for this, and its rewarding to see hard work pay off, Thiesse said. Honored and excited to be representing the USA in Cortina! Thiesse and Dropkin won the U.S. mixed doubles trials this winter to earn the right to represent the country at the world championships in Canada. But the Americans needed to finish at least fifth in Fredericton to qualify for the Olympics. After beating Canada on Saturday, Thiesse and Dropkin had to wait out Scotlands 9-6 win over Australia in another placement match to clinch a spot in Italy. It was such a strong field here and were proud of the way we played against some of the best teams in the world, Thiesse said.

Olympian charged in Florida with battery on female fellow athlete,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)  An Olympic track medalist is charged in Florida with punching a woman, a hurdler who also competed in the Olympics. A Broward County Sheriffs Office arrest report says that Fred Kerley, 29, allegedly hit Alaysha Johnson with a closed fist at a hotel near Fort Lauderdale on Thursday. Kerley is charged with misdemeanor battery in the incident that left Johnson with a bloody nose. Kerley won a silver medal in the 100-meter race at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and a bronze medal in the same event at the Paris Olympic Games in 2024, where Johnson also competed. The arrest report says they previously had a relationship and got into a heated argument at the Florida hotel where they were staying before a track meet in the area. Kerleys attorney, Richard Cooper, said in an email Saturday that he has a target on his back that leads to unfounded allegations by fierce and sometimes jealous competitors. We ask the public not to rush to judgment as the exculpatory facts eventually come to light, Cooper said. Fred looks forward to getting back to competing and away from distractions as his legal team works to resolve these accusations. Its not Kerleys first brush with the law. This comes just a few months after he was arrested for allegedly punching a Miami Beach police officer on Jan 2., an incident in which police used a Taser on him. He was also charged in May with domestic battery against his wife, according to court records.  His lawyers say he is innocent of those charges as well.",https://apnews.com/article/olympic-athlete-fred-kerley-arrested-battery-f5b5ea47e8f4f2193221556827a757cb,sports
Yankees Clarke Schmidt is scratched from start against Rays and replaced by Ryan Yarbrough,"NEW YORK (AP)  Yankees pitcher Clarke Schmidt was scratched from Saturdays start against the Tampa Bays Rays because of soreness in his left side and was replaced by Ryan Yarbrough. Schmidt said the injury was unrelated to the right rotator cuff tendinitis that sidelined him between his only spring training outing on March 11 and his season debut on April 16. An MRI on Friday did not show any injury, and Yankees manager Aaron Boone said he made the decision after Max Fried pitched seven innings in a victory over the Rays in the series opener. I told them I was good to go today, Schmidt said before the Yankees 3-2 loss Saturday. I actually left the field expecting to start today and then Max went deep in the game and there was maneuverability with the bullpen. Schmidt is 0-1 with a 5.52 ERA in three starts and 14 2/3 innings. The 29-year-old right-hander said he felt extra soreness after throwing a season-high 90 pitches on April 27 against Toronto and expects to start on Tuesday night against San Diego. The Yankees have an off day on Thursday, allowing Schmidt to get a fifth day of rest before pitching in Seattle. Clarke was just a little concerned, especially just what hes been through, being a little behind and everything and having some minor things pop up, Boone said. So, yeah, it was definitely a relief and he should be OK moving forward. A 33-year-old left-hander who drops down, Yarbrough threw 53 pitches in relief of Will Warren in Mondays 4-3 loss at Baltimore. 
        
     Its a very different look than what you typically see, Boone said. Yarbrough pitched for Tampa Bay from 2018-22, making one start and two relief appearances in the 2022 World Series. We asked a lot of him in different roles, Rays manager Kevin Cash said. He did pitch a lot of really big innings for us with a lot of success. Cash said Boone let him know of the change in a text and phone call Friday night. It caused Cash to change his lineup. I think most guys understand that we were going to run a bunch of lefties had it been Schmidt, but then we had to pull back, Cash said. It was all sorted out within 20, 25 minutes after the game. Yarbrough allowed one run and one hit in four innings with three walks and two strikeouts, throwing 64 pitches. His niftiest move was avoiding Yandy Dazs shattered bat and fielding his comebacker for the final out of the second inning. Walked a couple leadoff hitters, which wasnt ideal, Boone said. Going into the day if you would have said four innings, one run, sign us up all day long, so he gave us exactly what we needed. Boone had told Yarbrough of the start before the pitcher left the clubhouse Friday night. Yarbrough tried to persuade the manager to allow him to pitch the fifth inning. The cutter was not really where I wanted it to be, he said. Not a really good feel with it today and maybe got a little too headstrong with it. Right-hander Marcus Stroman, sidelined since April 11 by left knee inflammation, threw a bullpen session Friday.  Hes had some injections in there to kind of try and rid himself of just that last bit of uncomfort, Boone said. I dont know as far as the buildup. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-schmidt-injury-17cfb9048dfa33660ed51f18ac692e1d,sports

Pujols joined Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Alex Rodriguez as the only players in baseball history with 3,000 hits and 600 homers. 2021  The minor leagues start their season, after having been on hiatus since September of 2019 due to the Coronavirus pandemic. In the interim, the governing structure, Minor League Baseball, has been thoroughly reorganized and in effect replaced by the Professional Development League. 2022  By pitching 7 innings of one-hit ball, Adam Wainwright gets credit for a 10 - 0 win by the Cardinals over the Royals. It is the 202nd time that the battery of Wainwright and C Yadier Molina have combined on a win, tying the all-time record set by Warren Spahn and Del Crandall of the Boston and Milwaukee Braves. _____",https://apnews.com/sports/albert-pujols-baseball-san-francisco-giants-walker-buehler-alex-rodriguez-8b1ec873bad6c84f60d57efe9dcd7b15,sports
Barcelona teenager Yamal praised by friend and foe for performance against Inter Milan,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  After witnessing from the touchline how Lamine Yamal pushed his Inter Milan lineup to the limit, Simone Inzaghi said talents like the Barcelona teenager come around only once in a half century. Hes the kind of talent who is born every 50 years, I had never seen him live and he really impressed me today, the Inter coach said after Yamal helped Barcelona rally in a scintillating 3-3 draw Wednesday to start their Champions League semifinal series. Lamine Yamal caused us so many problems in the last 25 minutes of the first half. Barcelona coach Hansi Flick described his 17-year-old player as a genius after Yamal put on his latest talent show in his 100th game for the clubs senior squad. Hes special. Ive said it before, but hes a genius, Flick said. In the big matches, he shows up, and I think he enjoyed the situation. Im really happy that this talent, if it only comes every 50 years like Simone said, Im glad its for Barcelona. 
        
     Yamal dismissed any comparison to Lionel Messi in his first press conference for his club a day before Inter came to town. But his performance recalled the best days of Messi as his teammates fed him passes and let him pick Inter apart from the right flank. Each time he had the ball he was either searching for a teammate in scoring position or dipping his head and dribbling past his marker. His goal was one for the YouTube compilations. Inter had a 2-0 lead and the momentum from goals by Marcus Thuram and Denzel Dumfries, and it appeared like theyd left Yamal with nowhere to go in the 24th. But he slipped around one defender, sped past a second, and then, putting the ball on his left foot, he curled a shot past the turning heads of at least two more Inter players. The ball smacked the far post and was cradled in the net. That goal made Yamal  at 17 years, 291 days  the youngest scorer in a Champions League semifinal. He went so close to bettering that moments later when he glided past two defenders and sliced a shot from a sliver of an angle off the crossbar. This guy is incredible, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland posted on SnapChat with a screenshot of Yamals shot off the bar. Yamal fed passes to Ferran Torres and Dani Olmo for back-to-back shots that Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer saved before Raphinha took over and headed a ball down for Torres to ram home for 2-2 before halftime. Dumfries put Inter ahead again before Raphinha ensured the draw with a long-range strike that found the net. But Yamal was disappointed that a final push for a winner came up short. The whole world can see what a good footballer he is. Hes a player who shines, Inter midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan said. We tried to stop him, but that was so difficult because hes got great talent. I hope we dont let him play this much next week. Yamal said he appreciated the praise but just wanted to focus on the next match with a European Cup just two wins away. I am happy to have helped the team, and now we need to go for more, he said. We knew we could have won the game but now we are just focused on the second leg and going through. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/lamine-yamal-barcelona-inter-milan-eb40d010e2dbd5c13ab282307e3965cb,sports
Whitecaps beat Inter Miami 3-1 to eliminate Lionel Messis squad from Champions Cup,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)  Brian White and Pedro Vite scored two minutes apart and the Vancouver Whitecaps stunned Inter Miami 3-1 in the second leg of their CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinal on Wednesday night, spoiling Lionel Messis squads hopes of making the tournaments final.  Sebastian Berhalter also scored for Vancouver, which advanced with a 5-1 aggregate to face either Cruz Azul or Tigres UNAL in the Champions Cup final on June 1. Miami entered Wednesdays match trailing 0-2 in aggregate after being shut out in the first leg last Thursday. That meant they needed to win by at least three goals in regulation on Wednesday to advance. Messi helped set up Jordi Albas goal nine minutes into the game, but the reigning MLS MVP was held without a goal for the fourth straight match. They have a great team, Whitecaps coach Jesper Sorensen said of Inter Miami, and its not always easy for them because they have these players who come in with all the pressure on them. In the tournaments history, four MLS clubs, including Inter Miami last week, have lost the first leg of a semifinal by a 2-0 on the road. No team has come back to advance to the final. Miamis hopes were dashed quickly in the second half Wednesday, when Vancouver  which leads MLS with 23 points  erased a one-goal deficit minutes into the frame.  Berhalter found White for the equalizer in the 51st minute and Vite sent a deflection past Oscar Ustari in the 53rd. Berhalter, who had an assist on the first two goals, put the game away with a shot from the center of the box into the bottom left corner in the 71st.  
        
     We did ourselves a very good favor last week, Sorensen said, because we didnt need to rush things (tonight), and we didnt need to go panicking because we were up 2-0 (in aggregate). Berhalter has accounted for all five of the Whitecaps goals in the semis after scoring one in the opener, but he will miss the championship because of yellow card accumulation. He was shown one in the first half after a foul on Miamis Tadeo Allende.  Alba got Miami on the board with his first goal of the season on a feed from Luis Suarez, who received a pass from Messi. Suarez had a number of chances, but misfired on them all. The 38-year-old hasnt scored in his last 10 matches. Miami also dropped its third straight match, its longest losing streak since Messi joined the club in July 2023. We need to improve, Miami coach Javier Mascherano said. Going forward, we need to learn from the last week because obviously the feeling is really, really bad. They were much better than us. If we want to compete, we need to improve and we need to learn from this situation. ... I think this team can do much better. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/concacaf-champions-cup-miami-whitecaps-messi-bd9d04866ff2d55759e9a73d14215880,sports
Yamamoto allows only 1 hit in 6 scoreless innings and Betts homers as Dodgers hold off Braves 2-1,"ATLANTA (AP)  Yoshinobu Yamamoto allowed only one hit through six scoreless innings, Mookie Betts hit a home run and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves 2-1 on Friday night for their sixth consecutive win. Austin Riley doubled with two outs in the sixth inning for Atlantas first hit off Yamamoto (4-2). The right-hander lowered his ERA to 0.90, the best mark in the major leagues. He left the game with a 2-0 lead. Matt Olson led off the seventh with a homer off Dodgers right-hander Kirby Yates. Right-hander Evan Phillips walked Olson with two outs in the ninth before ending the game on Sean Murphys grounder to the mound for his first save. There was a rain delay of 1 hour, 13 minutes in the ninth. Yamamoto walked Marcell Ozuna on 11 pitches in the first inning and walked Ozuna again in the fourth for Atlantas only baserunners before Rileys double. The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead against right-hander Grant Holmes (2-2) on Will Smiths bases-loaded sacrifice fly to right field in the fourth inning. The fly ball drove in Betts, who reached on an infield hit off the back of Holmes upper left leg. Holmes set a career high with nine strikeouts while allowing two runs on four hits in six-plus innings. Betts fifth homer in the sixth extended the Dodgers lead to 2-0. Yamamoto snagged a 106 mph line drive hit by Sean Murphy to open the second inning that was Atlantas biggest threat for a hit before Rileys double to center field. 
        
     Through seven starts, Yamamoto has allowed four earned runs on 24 hits and 13 walks in 40 innings. He has given up five or fewer hits in each game. The series continues with Saturday nights matchup of young right-handers, Atlantas Spencer Schwellenbach (1-2, 2.87 ERA) and Roki Sasaki (0-1, 3.55) of Los Angeles. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-braves-score-3f93248bd8014512f886509e831e3590,sports
Michael Busch hits grand slam and Pete Crow-Armstrong homers twice in Cubs 10-0 win over Brewers,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Michael Busch hit his first career grand slam and Pete Crow-Armstrong added two solo shots as the Chicago Cubs beat the Milwaukee Brewers 10-0 on Friday. This marked the first matchup of the season between the NL Central-leading Cubs and the Brewers, who won this division each of the last two seasons. Chicago took the lead for good by scoring two runs in the first inning off Tyler Alexander (1-3), who served as the Brewers opener before giving way to Quinn Priester. The Cubs scored seven runs against Priester in the second to break the game open. Busch sent an 0-2 curve over the wall in left-center field for his sixth homer of the season, giving Chicago an 8-0 advantage. Two batters later, Crow-Armstrong delivered a 418-foot blast to center on a 1-2 changeup. Crow-Amstrong went deep again in the seventh inning, hitting a 399-foot shot to right on a 2-1 slider from Joel Payamps for his eighth homer of the season. Cubs starter Ben Brown (3-2) struck out four in six innings while allowing four hits and no walks. Chris Flexen worked the final three innings for his third career save, and first since 2022. The Brewers were shut out again two nights after closing a 10-game trip with an 8-0 loss to the Chicago White Sox. The last time the Brewers were shut out in back-to-back games was in May 2023. After allowing a leadoff single to Dansby Swanson in the second, Priester walked Nicky Lopez on a 3-2 sinker and then walked Ian Happ on four pitches to load the bases with nobody out. Those two walks set the stage for the Cubs seven-run outburst. 
        
     Crow-Armstrongs two homers from the No. 7 spot in the lineup continued the Cubs run of success from the bottom third of their lineup. The Cubs have 18 homers this season from players batting seventh, eighth or ninth. They entered Friday leading the majors in that category. Cubs RHP Jameson Taillon (1-1, 4.01 ERA) goes against Brewers LHP Jos Quintana (4-0, 1.14) on Saturday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/cubs-brewers-score-5d35a284d1ddf2eeacf986b1fcbe0542,sports

Jonathan Cannon (2-3) allowed two runs on nine hits with five strikeouts in six innings as the AL-worst White Sox won consecutive home games for the second time this season and improved to 9-23. White Sox rookie infielder Chase Meidroth singled and scored on a one-out double by Quero for a 1-0 lead in the first inning. Robert, who had reached on a walk was thrown out at the plate on the play. Chicago took a two-run lead in the second when Meidroths two-out hit scored Bobby Dalbec, who had singled. Houston got a run back in the fourth on consecutive doubles by Christian Walker and Yainer Diaz. Robert hit his fifth home run  a two-out solo shot for his 500th career hit  and Quero added an RBI single to make it 4-1 in the fifth. Diaz singled and scored on a Jake Meyers single in the sixth and later added a solo homer, his third of the season, in the eighth as Houston closed within 4-3. Chicago broke it open with three runs in the eighth off Astros relievers Tayler Scott and Bennett Sousa.  Houston starter Framber Valdez (1-4) allowed four runs on seven hits with six strikeouts and two walks in five innings. The Astros, trailing by a run, used a single and two errors to load the bases with one out in the second off Cannon. The right-hander kept his composure and retired Cam Smith on a lineout before getting Meyers on a force out.  The White Sox have won just one series this season, taking 2 of 3 in Boston from April 11-13.

Hunter Greene strikes out 12 as Reds beat Nationals 6-1,"CINCINNATI (AP)  Hunter Greene struck out 12, the second-highest total of his big league career, while allowing two hits over six innings and leading the Cincinnati Reds over the Washington Nationals 6-1 on Friday night. Tyler Stephenson hit a two-run double in his season debut after recovering from a left oblique strain sustained during spring training. Greene (4-2) averaged 99 mph with his fastball and got 21 swings and misses among 114 pitches  four more than any other major league pitcher had thrown in a game this season. He started 16 of 22 batters with strikes and threw 83 strikes in all, lowering his ERA to 2.53. He walked two. Greenes only game with more strikeouts was when he fanned 14 against Minnesota on Sept. 20, 2023.

"Alonso and Nimmo homer, Mets beat Cardinals 9-3 for ninth straight win over St. Louis","ST. LOUIS (AP)  Pete Alonso and Brandon Nimmo homered and the New York Mets beat St. Louis 9-3 on Friday night to avoid their first three-game losing streak this season and win their ninth straight game against the Cardinals. Francisco Alvarez added three singles and three RBIs to back Clay Holmes (4-1), and New York got its first win over Sonny Gray (3-1), who had been 4-0 against the Mets.

Yamamoto is emerging as the new staff ace at just the right time for the Dodgers depleted rotation,"ATLANTA (AP)  A Los Angeles Dodgers rotation filled with injuries has seen a new ace emerge in right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto pitched like the leader of a rotation  and perhaps one of the games top starters  in the Dodgers 2-1 win over the Atlanta Braves on Friday night, taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning and giving up no runs. Hes turning himself into a staff ace, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. Austin Riley doubled with two outs in the sixth inning for Atlantas first hit off Yamamoto (4-2). The right-hander lowered his ERA to 0.90, the best mark in the major leagues. He left the game with a 2-0 lead after allowing one hit with two walks and six strikeouts in six scoreless innings. Yamamoto confirmed he feels he is pitching at the same top form he showed in the Nippon Professional Baseball league in his native Japan. Yes, Ive been able to be at a high level, Yamamoto said through a translator. I think it feels very close to my top pitching. Yamamoto said he wasnt focused on the possibility of a no-hitter, but Roberts said it entered his thoughts for a quick minute. He had no-hit stuff tonight, Roberts said, adding the right-handers control and mastery of his splitter set the foundation for his dominance. I thought tonight the splitter was fantastic, Roberts said. His command was back to being who he is. The last (game) he wasnt that sharp. 
        
     But even when giving up four walks in a 3-0 loss to Pittsburgh on April 25, Yamamotos less impressive starts have still been above par. He has yet to allow more than five hits or two earned runs in any of his seven starts this season. The emergence of Yamamoto as an ace is especially important as the Dodgers try to adjust to having three starting pitchers on the injured list. The staff is without Blake Snell (shoulder inflammation), Tyler Glasnow (shoulder inflammation) and Clayton Kershaw (recovery from toe and knee surgery). Yamamoto has allowed only four earned runs in 40 innings. For Roberts, that places him among the games elite starting pitchers. You look at a handful of guys that when they take the mound you know theyre going to go six innings and give you a chance to win the game, Roberts said. Theres been so much consistent production from Yoshi, it is real. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-braves-yamamoto-6f8c99ecefcee6560c0f75fc091035ef,sports

Burro racing wins over runners in backcountry ode to mining history,"CERRILLOS, N.M. (AP)  Backcountry runners are embracing the physical and emotional challenge of racing with pack burros that dont always move at their pace. Burro races honor Old West history and hinge on a delicate partnership between runner and beast of burden. Burros, a Spanish-derived word for donkeys and their wild cousins, must carry a saddle, pick, pan and shovel in homage to a bygone era and the mythical sprint by miners to a land claims office with their pack animal. Pack burros and their human companions race through the streets of a former mining town and across backcountry desert trails in Cerrillos, N.M., on Saturday, May 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Morgan Lee) Pack burros and their human companions race through the streets of a former mining town and across backcountry desert trails in Cerrillos, N.M., on Saturday, May 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Morgan Lee) Some 70 teams tested their skills Saturday in a race winding through the historic, turquoise-mining town of Cerrillos in northern New Mexico. Runners led burros by rope on 6-mile (10-kilometer) and 3-mile (5-kilometer) courses on unpaved roads and single-track desert trails. More ambitious burro races in Colorado can extend for nearly 30 miles (48 kilometers). Racers often buy or inherit burros from owners who run out of money, time or patience. Others adopt burros that were corralled by the federal government to prevent overpopulation. Novices easily can rent an ass to try it out for kicks.  
        
     The race in Cerrillos, which provided the rugged backdrop in the 1980s Western Young Guns, started with a madcap sprint as competitive teams galloped to the front of the pack, and other burros instinctively attempted to keep pace. Runners cant ride the burro but can push, pull and coax the animal as long as they dont abuse it. Some racers swing a rope in circles  like a lasso  to encourage movement. Others on the trail cry out, Hup, hup! Joe Polonsky of Monument, Colorado, took up burro racing in 2018. He described himself as a mediocre ultramarathon runner, but in burro racing he is a top contender. I am fortunate because Jake does like to be up front at the start of the race, Polonsky said about his four-legged partner. So I will let him pull me. Burros wear a halter, which is less restrictive than a horses bridle and bit, attached to a 15-foot (4.5-meter) rope held by the runner. Some racers tether the rope to their waist and draft off the burro.

(AP Photo/Morgan Lee) Pack burros and their human companions race through the streets of a former mining town and across backcountry desert trails in Cerrillos, N.M., on Saturday, May 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Morgan Lee) Marvin Sandoval of Leadville, Colorado, and his mini burro named Buttercup finished first Saturday, completing the longer course in just over 49 minutes. Hundreds of cheering spectators lined the street, and the nearest competitors were out of sight. The secret to his racing success, Sandoval likened Buttercup to a unicorn: She wants to be out front, she climbs really well. A burro race can devolve into a contest of wills when the animals get defiant and wont budge.  But experienced racers say that doesnt mean the donkeys are being stubborn. They are smart and naturally curious animals. When they sense danger, discomfort or the unknown, they lock down in place, unlike horses that quickly flee.  If something scares them and theyre nervous, theyre going to just stop and assess the situation, Polonsky said. Healthy donkeys typically live 40 years or more and vary in size from waist-high minis that may weigh 300 pounds (135 kilograms) to bulky mammoths. Burros first appeared in the region more than 400 years ago, led from Mexico City by Spanish settlers and Catholic friars.

(AP Photo/Morgan Lee) For those who rent or borrow a burro for the race, they are encouraged to show up early or even the night before to get acquainted with their racing buddy, not unlike a blind date, said Lisa Kazmar, a massage therapist from Edgewood, New Mexico, who owns four burros with names taken from Harry Potter novels. You dont know what the new donkey is going to do. It can be very scary, Kazmar said. Burro racing emerged shortly after World War II in depopulated Colorado mining towns and now is an official state-heritage sport with marquee races in Leadville, Buena Vista and Fairplay that blend county-fair cheer and athleticism. The pun-loving Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation manages the modern race circuit that extends from the Tombstone Donkey Dash in Arizona to a Weekend at Burney race in Cassel, California, and a new burro stampede this year in the Magdalena Mountains of New Mexico. Tennessee got in on the action five years ago with a race held annually in April. Race and team sponsors include veterinary clinics, as well as brands selling sneakers, hydration drinks and beef jerky. At Cerrillos, the teams competed for Western belt-buckle trophies, including a last ass award for the final finisher.

(AP Photo/Morgan Lee) Success in racing doesnt come easy, according to Shane Weigand of Edgewood, New Mexico, a construction manager, burro race organizer and backcountry outfitter for burro-pack trips and tequila-burro weddings. You have to spend a lot of time on the trail with your burro, building up that relationship and trust, he said. __ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the first name of Marvin Sandoval.",https://apnews.com/article/wild-burro-racing-donkey-mining-new-mexico-9f20f6736401139529c8946162b97046,sports

This Met Gala is filled with pro athletes. Dressing them is a unique challenge,"HOUSTON (AP)  When Brittney Griner became the first WNBA player to attend the Met Gala in 2023, just months after being released from a Russian prison in a high-profile prisoner swap, she looked effortlessly cool and chic in a custom-made Calvin Klein suit. Behind the look was celebrity stylist Courtney Mays, who has dressed some of sports biggest stars for more than a decade. Putting together a glamorous gala look for any celebrity is a tall task, but, when working with the unique proportions of professional athletes  Griner is 6'9""  the job becomes much more complicated. Couple that with working under the constraints put forth by Vogue editor Anna Wintour: The Met Gala chair provides a list of designers she envisions the guest in  then its up to the stylist to put together a look within those parameters.  It was a learning experience for me, Mays said. I had a voice in that world, in a way, but also when Anna says: I want you to wear this, you kind of have to go along with it. Mays said they chose Calvin Klein to celebrate an American designer and tap into the patriotism of Griners emotional return. And also, somebody that was a little bit minimalist and could really execute something that wasnt necessarily about the clothes, but really about the homecoming and her journey and the union between she and her wife, Mays said. They opted for a champagne-colored look for Griner and a white, corseted dress for her wife Cherelle, sort of like a fresh start, a new lease kind of metaphor. 
        
     Mays and the team pulled the look together in three weeks, flying to Phoenix once a week for long and intense fittings with several tailors. Then Mays tapped Los Angeles shoemaker George Esquivel, who had previously made shoes for NBA stars Kevin Love and DeAndre Jordan, to craft a custom mens size 18 pair for Griner. Mays personal experience as a 6-foot-tall woman has helped her relate to the dressing struggles of many of the athletes she works with. I am a plus-size woman, and so fashion for me has always been sort of bittersweet, but also an opportunity for me to be creative in how I found pieces to wear, she said. And so, the fact that Ive been able to work in the sports world, which means I have clients that are 6'9, ... women that wear size mens 12 and 13 shoe, I have to really think outside the box. Over the last few years, more and more athletes have received coveted invites to the annual fundraiser. This year, sports are at the forefront of the gala with Formula One star Lewis Hamilton as a co-chair, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James as an honorary chair and several other athletes on the host committee. Hamilton was asked Thursday what hed be wearing to the gala. I dont even know, he said. Not putting much thought to it. But he gushed about his work with Wintour. Its amazing working with Anna and her team, he said. Its been a privilege to be able to continue to do stuff with fashion. Its fun. But Annas been really understanding. I havent had a lot of time to deal with it a huge amount  but the work has been in drips over the past like two years already with us, so, yeah, excited for people to see it. Wintour told Good Morning America on Friday that she still doesnt know what Lewis is wearing but trusts him. Mondays Met Gala kicks off this years Metropolitan Museum of Art spring costume exhibit, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, and the accompanying dress code is Tailored For You. Mays has long pushed for increased representation of athletes, especially those who are Black, in luxury fashion spaces. Im hoping that this sort of turns a leaf in the way that fashion respects the Black community, but also just underrepresented people, because youre going to see so many people at the Met that are going to champion Black designers, she said. Im hoping that you see people that you havent seen before. Im hoping that it sort of opens up the conversation so that were not having to fight so hard to get approval from the luxury space, that were supposed to be here. Though styling Griner was her first experience with the Met Gala, Mays work has long been a mainstay of professional basketballs unofficial runway known as tunnel fits. NBA players started the trend, arriving at the arena dressed to the nines and being photographed walking through the tunnel to the locker room. In recent years, WNBA stars have followed suit, with their style getting much more attention. Mays, who has styled Love, Jordan and 20-year NBA veteran Chris Paul, also has a heavy imprint on WNBA style. Shes dressed the New York Libertys Breanna Stewart, the Connecticut Suns Tina Charles and retired star Sue Bird. What she does best is she makes it so that I feel my best in the clothes that Im wearing, Stewart said. And really, thats the biggest thing behind it. Because when you see all these tunnel fits and people walking, you want them to portray who they are and feel their best. Mays sees her work with WNBA players as a perfect way to showcase her passion for championing diversity and inclusion. As the media starts to lock into tunnel fits and what the girls are wearing, I hope we get to see more of a wider lens cast on some of the style sensibility, she said. We locked really heavily into women that men think are attractive, if Im just being honest, and I hope that were able to see some of the women that are masculine-presenting, some of the women that are dressing more gender-fluid. Theres such a vast, wide spectrum of different styles, and I think thats whats so cool about the tunnel fits, is that you see such a diversity and style sensibility. The 6-foot-4 Charles has worked with Mays since she was taken with the first overall pick in the 2010 draft. Dressing while she was growing up was sometimes tricky but collaborating with Mays has simplified things. She leans toward expertly tailored suits that highlight her height and athletic build. Shes the one who gave me my confidence in my appearance, and so its been a great partnership, Charles said. It just goes a long way off the court when Im not with her and just how I feel. Mays is participating in the Met Gala again this year, and says to expect a visual attempt to show that diversity in style when you see women in sports. My ethos has always been how can we converge sport and style in a way thats authentic and in a way that feels diverse, she said. And what was really interesting to me is, with the Mets chairpeople, to see two athletes a part of the conversation  I think that opens the door for other athletes to participate. ___ AP Basketball Writer Doug Feinberg in New York and AP Auto Racing Writer Jenna Fryer in Miami contributed to this story.  ___ For more coverage of the Met Gala, visit https://apnews.com/hub/met-gala.",https://apnews.com/article/met-gala-athletes-styling-fd97ff252fa6408a5a7825f2df381919,sports

Rayo Vallecano back to winning ways at Getafes expense in Madrid derby,"MADRID (AP)  A first half header from Florian Lejeune gave Rayo Vallecano a 1-0 win over Getafe in the Madrid derby on Friday. Lejeune headed home Isi Palazns corner in the seventh minute to lift Rayo into ninth place in La Liga. It was only the home clubs second win and second clean sheet in its last 11 league games but the margin of victory could have been greater were it not for the heroics of David Soria in the Getafe goal. Neither side showed much style in a scrappy game that reflected both teams inconsistent seasons. It was Getafes fourth defeat in a row and third consecutive 1-0 loss and it also suffered the blow of a late red card for captain Djen Dakonam, who was dismissed for dissent. Getafe remained in 12th place. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/rayo-vallecano-getafe-la-liga-c3e388eb22974eba5068d29976a52831,sports

Dodgers Tommy Edman missing 2nd straight start with sore right ankle in series opener at Braves,"ATLANTA (AP)  The Los Angeles Dodgers, already struggling to overcome injuries to their pitching staff, were missing second baseman Tommy Edman in their starting lineup in Friday nights series opener against the Atlanta Braves. Edman, who ranks second on the team with eight home runs and 24 RBIs, hurt his right ankle in Tuesday nights 15-2 win against Miami. After missing Wednesdays game and having an off day Thursday, Edman still wasnt ready to start in the first of 10 straight road games. Edman worked out before Friday nights game in what manager Dave Roberts said could be a key session. My expectation is he would be available to pinch hit, Roberts said, adding he believes Edmans status is a day to day thing. When asked whether the injured list is a possibility for Edman, Roberts said Today could be telling. Miguel Sosa started at second base. The Dodgers entered May with three starting pitchers on the injured list. Left-hander Blake Snell (shoulder inflammation) is with the team in Atlanta. Roberts said Snell is scheduled to start throwing when the team continues its trip at Miami next week. The rotation also is without Tyler Glasnow (shoulder inflammation) and Clayton Kershaw (recovery from toe and knee surgery). The Dodgers also have two key relief pitchers, Blake Treinen (forearm tightness) and Michael Kopech (shoulder impingement) on the injured list. Roberts said Kopech is scheduled to begin an injury rehab assignment next week. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-edman-injuries-3dd088b2cf09479d7f110826b94eb4aa,sports
Orioles GM takes the heat for starting rotation collapse: Thats my responsibility,"BALTIMORE (AP)  If the second half of 2024 was a reality check for the Baltimore Orioles  their first real stretch of mediocrity since they became contenders again  the start of this season is a near-crisis. This young Baltimore team experienced very little failure while winning 101 games in 2023, but now the Orioles are well aware of what baseballs more humbling side feels like. I think were getting a little more familiar (with adversity) than we wanted to be, general manager Mike Elias said before Friday nights 3-0 win over Kansas City. Elias met with reporters to address his teams 12-18 record in April. The Orioles arent just in last place in the AL East, they also had the worst run differential in the American League before Fridays game. The young core of hitters that was so fearsome early last year has struggled mightily in 2025. Elias has reason to view that as a temporary blip, but the other main culprit this year  the collapse of the starting rotation  might be harder to fix. Zach Eflin, Grayson Rodriguez and Albert Suarez are on the injured list and Dean Kremer took a 7.04 ERA into Fridays start before breaking through with seven scoreless innings. Tomoyuki Sugano has been fine, but Charlie Morton is 0-6 with a 9.45 ERA and will work out of the bullpen for now. Kyle Gibson allowed homers to four of the first five batters Tuesday in his first big league start of the season. It is difficult to contend with that level of injuries, but even that aside, theyve had a poor start, and thats my responsibility. Im in charge of baseball operations, Elias said. When we have a bad record to start the year, thats my responsibility. 
        
     Elias opened himself up to second-guessing in the offseason when the Orioles lost Corbin Burnes to free agency and he gave one-year contracts to Sugano, Morton and Gibson. One-year deals are usually considered pretty safe  even if they work out badly, they expire quickly. But Baltimore committed over $33 million to that trio, so if they keep performing this poorly as a group it would constitute a real misuse of resources. In fairness, a rotation of Rodriguez, Eflin, Sugano, Kremer and Cade Povich could have been serviceable  with Kyle Bradish and Tyler Wells expected back at some point from elbow surgery  but the injuries to Eflin and Rodriguez have forced Morton and Gibson to produce, and thus far they havent. Baltimores 5.47 ERA entering Friday ranked 29th among the 30 teams, lower than only Miamis 5.89. The Orioles did manage to take two of three from the first-place New York Yankees earlier this week, but even that required a pair of one-run wins sandwiched around a 15-3 loss. There have simply been too many games in which Baltimore finds itself way behind because of poor pitching. Nobodys happy with how weve performed so far. We have higher expectations for ourselves, manager Brandon Hyde said. I talk with Mike multiple times a day. Were not satisfied in the least bit. We know our team can play better than we have. Elias said he remains confident in Hyde. When things are going great  and they have at times here, weve had that  and then when were experiencing failure, its really important in that job and in my job too to be consistent with your approach, Elias said. Hes doing that. Eflin (lat strain) and reliever Andrew Kittredge (knee) are expected to make minor league rehab appearances Sunday, and Elias said Rodriguez (elbow inflammation) might be able to throw by the end of this month. We are all working very hard and we have a lot of faith in this very talented group, Elias said.

"Filly Good Cheer stays unbeaten, rallying in the mud to win 151st Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  Neither a muddy track nor a shaky start to the biggest race of her career deterred Good Cheer from staying perfect. The unbeaten filly rallied on the outside through the slop to overtake Tenma by the final furlong and win the 151st Kentucky Oaks by 2 1/4 lengths on Friday at Churchill Downs.  Louisville-born trainer Brad Cox watched the heavy 6-5 favorite cover 1 1/8 miles in 1:50.15 on a wet but sealed surface with Luis Saez aboard. Good Cheer paid $4.78, $3.62 and $3.02 for her seventh dominant victory. The bay daughter of Megdalia dOro and Wedding Toast by Street entered the Oaks with a combined victory margin of more than 42 lengths, and on Friday, she added more distance to her resume with a stunning surge. Its the biggest in a string of graded stakes wins dating back to last fall, and it came with a garland of pink lilies. We know she is a very special filly, said Saez, who rode to his sixth consecutive win aboard Good Cheer. Of course, we were a little nervous, but I know she has a lot of talent. I rode her pretty confident because we know ... shes going to make a big move. Cox, who grew up blocks from Churchill Downs, earned his third Oaks win in seven years, Saez his second in three. Good Cheer ownership group Godolphin LLC won its second Oaks in three years and seeks its first Kentucky Derby win on Saturday with Sovereignty and East Avenue. 
        
     The trainers Oaks win follows a stakes win by filly Immersive, who won last years Breeders Cup Juvenile Fillies race on the way to clinching the Eclipse Award as the top 2-year-old. Cox took satisfaction in how Good Cheer ran with no room for error as the overwhelming favorite of 13 horses. She travels around the turn and then youre like, Well, shes coming, he said. And then all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, shes three (lengths) in front of them. So she definitely passed the eye test.  Drexel Hill paid $21.02 and $11.76 for second while Bless the Broken was third and returned $4.78. A thunderstorm that roared through about two hours before the scheduled post left the track soggy and sent many of the 100,910 fans seeking shelter at the tracks urging. The $1.5 million showcase for 3-year-old fillies was delayed by 10 minutes, and the conditions proved to be a minor nuisance for Good Cheer.  She was off the pace after starting from the No. 11 post but well within range of the leaders before charging forward through the final turns. Good Cheer was fourth entering the stretch and closed inside and into the lead, pulling away for her fourth win at Churchill Downs and second in the mud. Once you get her out and open, shes going to dig in and run hard as well, Michael Banahan of Godolphin LLC said. I was happy enough where she was down the backside and I know there was a little bit of speed in the race as well. Luis had her in a good spot and she looked like she was running comfortably. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-oaks-churchill-downs-a63666f4adbf0a577b03d31e98b1c133,sports
"Blade Tidwell to make big league debut for Mets, start Sunday against Cardinals","ST. LOUIS (AP)  Pitching prospect Blade Tidwell will be called up by the New York Mets to make his major league debut as the starter Sunday at the St. Louis Cardinals, manager Carlos Mendoza said Friday. The Mets are in a stretch of playing on 13 consecutive days, and promoting Tidwell will allow their other starters to get a break. He earned it, Mendoza said of Tidwell, a second-round draft pick in 2022. We know the stuff is there. We saw flashes of it in spring training. And the way hes been throwing the ball, especially of late. Entering Friday, the Mets rotation had allowed four runs or fewer in 32 consecutive starts, the longest such stretch to start a season in the National League in 125 years. New York leads the majors with a 2.68 ERA and 303 strikeouts. Twice last month, including the last time through the rotation, the Mets have gone with a bullpen game and started Huascar Brazoban. Mendoza said Tidwell would start so he could maintain his pregame routine. Tidwell, a 23-year-old right-hander, is 1-2 with a 5.00 ERA in six starts for Triple-A Syracuse this season. He has struck out 37 in 27 innings. I think the balls in play (are) a little high in Triple-A, you know, but it comes down to executing  throwing strikes  because we know how electric his stuff is, Mendoza said. Were all proud of him, and hes going to get an opportunity. Before Fridays game, the Mets also made a bullpen move. Right-hander Austin Warren was recalled from Syracuse and righty Ty Adcock was optioned there after making just one appearance. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-blade-tidwell-debut-9b967c75f3ee80cb85ee43adedcd200b,sports
Red Sox RHP Walker Buehler placed on 15-day IL due to shoulder bursitis,"BOSTON (AP)  The Boston Red Sox placed right-handed starter Walker Buehler on the 15-day injured list with right shoulder bursitis Friday, one day after the team sent him from Toronto to Boston to undergo tests. Buehler had been scheduled to start Friday as the Red Sox opened a three-game series against the Minnesota Twins at Fenway Park. The reason for the tests stem from his inability to bounce back after his last start which was last Saturday when the 30-year-old allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings to beat Cleveland, his third straight winning start. Buehler is 4-1 with a 4.28 ERA in his six starts since signing a one-year, $21.05 million contract with the Red Sox this past offseason. He spent the first seven years of his MLB career with the Los Angeles Dodgers, winning two World Series. Taking Buehlers place on Bostons roster is RHP Hunter Dobbins, who was called up from Triple-A Worcester. Also Friday, the Red Sox reinstated catcher Connor Wong and optioned Blake Sabol to Worcester. Wong was in Fridays lineup, hitting seventh. He landed on the 10-day IL on April 8 with a left pinky fracture.",https://apnews.com/article/walker-buehler-il-red-sox-eadfdbb611d534ee9b9b237546dbdd12,sports
Brewers Murphy and Cubs Counsell say theyve remained friends even while managing division rivals,"MILWAUKEE (AP)  Milwaukees Pat Murphy and the Chicago Cubs Craig Counsell have a friendship that goes back well over three decades. That wasnt going to end now that theyre managing NL Central rivals. Im sure all of you have great friends in the world, people that youve been associated with for many, many years in different way, Murphy said Friday before the Brewers lost 10-0 to the Cubs in the seasons first matchup between the teams. Maybe the relationship changed a little bit. Maybe you used to live in the same town. Maybe now you dont. But your really, really true friends, you dont have to call them on the phone every night and say, What happened last night? What did he say? Or what did he say? Craig and I will be close forever. I respect him. I love him. I love his family. Counsell and Murphy had worked together in some capacity for much of the last 35 years or so before Counsell left his job as Milwaukees manager to become the Cubs skipper after the 2023 season. Murphy, a key part of Counsells staff in Milwaukee, was promoted to Brewers manager. Their relationship started long before either reached the big leagues. Counsell played college baseball on Notre Dame teams coached by Murphy from 1989-92. When Counsell was hired as the Brewers manager after the 2015 season, he made Murphy his bench coach.  They saw each other just about every day for most of the next eight seasons. Now that theyre working for different teams, they naturally dont talk as often. 
        
     Nor can they confide in each other the way they could while working on the same staff. Its changed in that were competitors instead of teammates, so I think during competitive times, (the relationship is) different, Counsell said. Its stayed the same in kind of when were off game time, were friends. That friendship continues even as they work for rivals. I know people would love to have us get in a fight and have a back-and-forth between the Cubs and us  fights and all that kind of (stuff), Murphy said. Maybe that will happen, but well still always be friends. Hes done a lot for my life, and Im very grateful for the friendship. Counsells decision to leave the Brewers enabled Murphy to get his first MLB manager opportunity since 2015, when he led San Diego on an interim basis. Murphy responded by leading the Brewers to a second straight NL Central title and becoming the Milwaukees first NL Manager of the Year. Im happy for his success, Counsell said. Thats first and foremost. Youre happy your good friend has tremendous success. Were obviously competitors. His wins dont always bode good for me or for us. Youre still happy for his success. So far this season, Counsell has had more success. The Cubs blowout win Friday enabled them to maintain their two-game lead over Cincinnati in the NL Central. The Brewers are in third place, four games behind the Cubs. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/counsell-murphy-cubs-brewers-559822c25446a2e49a887f4929627f59,sports
"Times Square boxing event ends in a stunner as Rolando Romero beats Ryan Garcia. Haney, Lopez win","NEW YORK (AP)  Ryan Garcia arrived in Times Square in a Batmobile, hoping to look like a superhero in his return to boxing. Minutes later, he was hurt and on the canvas, looking up at the billboards and bright lights on the marquees surrounding the ring after being knocked down by Rolando Rolly Romeros crushing left hand in the second round. Wham! Pow! Romero went on to beat Garcia by unanimous decision Friday night, a surprising finish to a night of boxing like none other. Garcia praised Romero and his power, but he was perhaps done in just as much by the event itself. Even a Batmobile is slow in Manhattan traffic, and Garcia didnt realize it would take so long to get from the hotel to the venue after he had warmed up. Once he got there, he noticed there were so few fans with seats near the arena that there was no crowd push that the fan favorite needed. I wasnt a fan of that at all. It felt like a sparring match, Garcia said. You could hear everybody and it just didnt feel authentic to me, but no excuses. Times Square was the setting for Garcias first fight since he was suspended for a year after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs in his victory over Devin Haney that was later overturned and ruled a no contest. The plan was for Garcia and Haney to move on to a rematch if they both won Friday, but only Haney (32-0) held up his end of the bargain. 
        
     He beat Jose Ramirez (29-3) by unanimous decision in a matchup of former 140-pound champions, after Teofimo Lopez defended his junior welterweight title with a unanimous decision victory over Arnold Barboza Jr. On a night that saw ring girls replaced by impersonators of celebrities such as Snoop Dogg, Hulk Hogan and Michael Jackson, a couple people wearing Elmo costumes and a drummer playing  standard sights and sounds in Times Square on a Friday night  Romero (17-2) ended up as the star of the show.  He seemed to gain more confidence in the later rounds, letting more hard shots go as it become clear Garcia (24-2) didnt seem capable of stopping him. He won 115-112 on two cards and the other judge scored it 118-109. But Romero, who was knocked out by Gervonta Davis in a previous title shot in New York, didnt argue that he should now take Garcias place against Haney. Man, I aint even thinking about whats next, he said. I think Devin and Ryan should get their rematch and make a big one. The Garcia who knocked Haney down three times was nowhere to be seen in Times Square  which will undoubtedly lead to questions about how much the drugs affected that performance last April 20. I just think that whole year took a lot off my body physically and mentally, Garcia said. Haney and Lopez looked like themselves. So much going on around them looked nothing like a normal big-fight night. Fighters were delivered from the hotel a couple of blocks away by cars, with Lopez arriving in a traditional yellow taxicab and Garcia coming in Batmans vehicle. The cars had to stop at traffic lights in between before pulling up outside the ring for the fighters to take a shortened ring walk. Lopez, a Brooklyn product who has fought in title bouts in Madison Square Garden, put on a strong performance in a venue unlike the famed arena 10 blocks to the south. He improved to 22-1, celebrating in front of his hometown fans and a crowd that included fellow boxers Mike Tyson, Terence Crawford and Shakur Stevenson, and New York Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns, with his arms raised in the shadows of the pole from where the ball drops on New Years Eve in New Yorks tourist center. Turki Alalshikh, the head of Riyadh Season and the General Entertainment Authority of Saudi Arabia, wanted something unique for Ring Magazines first boxing card in the U.S. after purchasing it last year. Thus began the plan to fight in Times Square, bypassing Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center for the trip to New York. Seventh Avenue remained open to traffic  with cars being held only briefly when the fighters cars crossed over  with orange fencing blocking the view of fans standing across the street wondering what was happening inside. Those who did have ringside access  and it was unclear how many did or how they got it, though it wasnt a large number  could pass the time between bouts reading the ticker that scrolled along the outside of ABCs Times Square studios just above the ring. It wasnt as big as I expected it to get, Lopez said of his bout, before adding it felt bigger as the night went on. ___ AP boxing: https://apnews.com/boxing",https://apnews.com/article/times-square-boxing-garcia-haney-lopez-ab96969d83df8e6765cfe982d5e96773,sports
Guardians Jos Ramrez leaves game with sprained right ankle after stumbling over first base,"TORONTO (AP)  Jos Ramrezs right ankle is sore after the Cleveland Guardians star stumbled over first base during Fridays loss at Toronto, but manager Stephen Vogt said the six-time All-Star third baseman wasnt too badly injured. The reports are good, Vogt said after Ramrez mildly sprained the ankle in a 5-3 loss. Just being cautious, long season. He said he could have kept going but we cant take that chance. Ramrez left in the third inning after being hit by a throw from pitcher Chris Bassitt and stumbling awkwardly over first on an infield single.  With Steven Kwan at first base and two out, Ramrez hit a slow roller towards the mound. Right-hander Bassitts throw to first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit Ramrez on the upper back, and he stumbled over the base before hitting his left knee on the dirt. Ramrez lay on his back for a moment before receiving attention from an athletic trainer, then stood and walked off the field. Its never fun to take anyone out of a game, let alone Jos, but it was the right thing to do, Vogt said, adding that Ramrez will be evaluated again Saturday.  Ramrez did not appear to be favoring his ankle as he exited the clubhouse. Vogt said he will let Ramrez guide the timing of his return, but acknowledged that Torontos artificial surface might be a factor. Jos is our guy, Vogt said. He knows his body. He knows if hes good to go. Were always wary of the turf here. We know all about it, so were always smart. 
        
     Daniel Schneeman ran for Ramrez and went to second base, with Gabriel Arias moving from second to third. Ramrez went 2 for 2 before departing, boosting his average to .274. He has five home runs and 15 RBIs in 31 games. In Thursdays 4-3 win over Minnesota, Ramrez become the first primary third baseman to reach 250 homers and 250 stolen bases. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/jose-ramirez-guardians-3204c5c04176e4374485ee100cc0c798,sports
Angels star Mike Trout is confident his latest injury wont sideline him for extended period,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Mike Trout says he is convinced the bone bruise in his left knee wont sideline him for an extended period. Well, theres no structural damage, the Los Angeles Angels star said Friday. Yesterday, I was in some pain.Today, I can walk normally. The doctor said just stay off it for a couple of days, then get back into it slowly and go. A three-time AL MVP, Trout was removed from Wednesdays game in Seattle when he he got hurt lunging for the first-base bag on a third-inning groundout. The Angels placed the 33-year-old on the 10-day injured list Friday, a move retroactive to Thursday. Last year, Trout tore the meniscus in his left knee on April 29, and Trout thought hed return in six-to-eight weeks. He aggravated the injury in his first minor league rehabilitation game in July and sat out the rest of the season. Trout had two surgeries on the knee last season. He didnt think this injury was severe. I didnt feel a pop or anything, I just felt something weird, he said. I thought it was just scar tissue breaking up.  I kind of lunged to the side (of the bag) and it smashed the two bones. I havent felt anything in my knee for the last three, four months. Ive been feeling good. Trout is hitting .179 with a .727 OPS, nine homers, 18 RBIs and 36 strikeouts in 106 at-bats.  Trout started the Angels first 29 games this year after he was limited to 266 games over four seasons because of a 2021 calf strain, a 2022 back injury, a 2023 broken hamate bone and last years knee problem.  
        
     He is signed to a $426.5 million, 12-year contract through 2030. The Angels moved him from center field to right this season and started him seven times in the designated hitter spot in an effort to reduce the physical strain on his body, keep his legs fresher and prevent injuries. Los Angeles entered Fridays game against Detroit with 14 losses in its previous 18 games, a stretch in which the Angels hit .197 with a .582 OPS, 186 strikeouts and 29 walks in 615 plate appearances and 45 runs, an average of 2.5 a game. They ranked last in the major leagues in on-base percentage (.271) and walks (67). Its hard, manager Ron Washington said of Trouts loss. Weve already felt what its like to be without him. I really want to feel what its like to have him. We were struggling when Mike was in (the lineup). But I still like his presence. I want to have him on the field, in the dugout and in the clubhouse making a difference. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/trout-bruise-injured-list-074a5d00e1a47b6c5408f795dd2570ca,sports
Japan sensation Naoya Inoue makes rare visit to US to defend undisputed junior featherweight title,"LAS VEGAS (AP)  All four major boxing junior featherweight belts sat in front of the combatants on Thursday, but Ramon Cardenas wouldnt look at them because theyre not mine yet. He hopes to take those belts from Naoya Inoue and, well, good luck with that. The Japanese sensation nicknamed Monster is an enormous favorite in his return to Las Vegas. He is back for the first time since twice fighting at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, first in a no-fans-allowed bubble and then inside a resort theater. Neither is anything like T-Mobile Arena where on Sunday night the 32-year-old Inoue (29-0, 26 knockouts) will face Cardenas, a 29-year-old from San Antonio who is 26-1 with 14 KOs. The co-main event is another title bout. WBO featherweight champion Rafael Espinoza (26-0, 22 KOs) of Mexico goes against Edward Vazquez (17-2, 4 KOs) of Fort Worth, Texas. Inoue is a -10000 favorite at BetMGM Sportsbook and -900 to end the fight early, but he also knows he wont have the benefit of a home crowd like he would at Tokyo Dome. Inoue also is fighting on Cinco de Mayo weekend rather than someone like Canelo Alvarez, the crowd favorite who often takes center stage in Las Vegas at this time but this weekend is competing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Inoue said through an interpreter he didnt know what to expect regarding the crowd, calling the match an away game. 
        
     The ideal situation is to show the American fans my boxing and to win with a knockout, Inoue said. But more than anything, I want everyone to see what they have not been able to see live in Japan. He has achieved legendary status in his homeland and hasnt been taken the distance in more than five years, becoming a four-division champion and the undisputed champ in two weight classes. Returning to the U.S. is Inoues chance to introduce himself to a new fan base, and having the fight on ESPN rather than pay-per-view will help him reach a wider audience. U.S. fans will get a chance to see what all the hype is about. An impressive performance wouldnt put him on the same level of fame in this country as his compatriot Shohei Ohtani, but it would be a start. Its also a big opportunity for Cardenas, who knows what an upset victory would mean to his career. He hasnt been in this type of atmosphere, and ever since watching Floyd Mayweather Jr. win by split decision over Oscar De La Hoya in 2007 in Las Vegas, Cardenas has wanted to compete in the fight capital of the world. Now he has his chance. And in the main event. Fighting for a world title is one thing, but fighting for undisputed is more than I could have ever asked for, Cardenas said. That makes me hungry. That makes me want it more. He isnt blind to the challenge that lies in front of him and spoke respectfully of Inoue, but that doesnt mean Cardenas plans to be his opponents punching bag. Im not coming here to collect a check, and that right there makes me dangerous, Cardenas said. If I was here to collect a check, I wouldnt show up, but Im here and Im here to win. ___ AP boxing: https://apnews.com/boxing",https://apnews.com/article/inoue-cardenas-japan-vegas-c222dee284ab0d3202b1ee9ce3c87320,sports
"Kremer, OHearn lift Orioles over Royals 3-0; Witts 22-game hitting streak ends","BALTIMORE (AP)  Dean Kremer allowed three hits in seven innings, Ryan OHearn hit a go-ahead, two-run homer and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Kansas City Royals 3-0 on Friday night for a rare low-scoring victory in their first shutout this season. Last-place Baltimore improved to 2-16 when scoring three or fewer runs and won back-to-back games for only the second time this year. Kremer (3-4) and Michael Wacha (1-4) battled for six scoreless innings before Adley Rutschman led off the Baltimore seventh with a double. OHearn followed with a drive to left-center field for his sixth home run of the year. Emmanuel Rivera, playing because infielder Ramn Uras was scratched with right hamstring tightness, added an RBI single later in the inning. Kansas City lost for just the second time in 11 games. Bobby Witt Jr. went 0 for 4, ending his 22-game hitting streak, as the Royals were blanked for the fourth time. Yennier Cano pitched the eighth, and Flix Bautista finished the four-hitter for his sixth save in six chances. Wacha allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. Kansas City turned inning-ending double plays in the first and second, and Kremer got some help in the seventh when shortstop Gunnar Henderson made a nice sliding play on a grounder behind second base. Royals catcher Salvador Perez did not play because of hip issues. Manager Matt Quatraro said hes day to day. 
        
     Kansas City had a man on second with one out in the second when Mark Canhas comebacker bounced off Kremer to the right side of the infield. First baseman Ryan Mountcastle fielded the ball and flipped it to Kremer, who had hustled over to cover. After the rare 1-3-1 putout, Kremer retired Drew Waters on a grounder to end the threat. OHearn had 131 RBIs in five seasons with Kansas City before being traded to the Orioles for cash before the 2023 season. In two-plus seasons in Baltimore, hes already driven in 132 runs.

"Schwarber, Kepler go deep late to vault Phillies past Diamondbacks 3-2","PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Kyle Schwarber and Max Kepler hit solo homers in the seventh inning to lead the Philadelphia Phillies to a 3-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday night. Schwarber moved into a tie for the major league home run lead when he hit his 10th of the season off Arizona reliever Jose Castillo (0-1) to tie the game 2-2. One out later, Kepler hit a home run into the right-field seats to put the Phillies ahead. It was his fourth homer this season and his first off a left-handed pitcher this year. Schwarber also had an RBI double in the first inning to give Philadelphia an early lead.  Tanner Banks (1-0) earned the win in relief by pitching a 1-2-3 seventh. Jose Alvarado pitched the ninth for his sixth save for Philadelphia. Jess Luzardo pitched 5 1/3 innings and allowed two runs on nine hits for the Phillies, who have won five of their last six. Arizona starter Merrill Kelly was having an efficient and effective start, throwing just 60 pitches through five innings and allowing one run on four hits, but he appeared to injure himself while warming up in the sixth inning and had to be removed from the game. The Diamondbacks did not announce the nature of the injury before the conclusion of the game. Luis Perdomo and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. had RBI singles for Arizona, which has lost six of its last nine. Johan Rojas, who came into the game as a defensive replacement, made a lunging catch in center field and crashed hard into the fence, but hung on to help preserve the one-run lead in the ninth inning. Schwarber extended his major league leading on-base streak to 38 games with his first inning double.

Red Sox 1B Triston Casas carried off on stretcher after awkward fall in game with Twins,"BOSTON (AP)  Boston Red Sox first baseman Triston Casas was carried off the field on a stretcher in the second inning of a 6-1 win over the Minnesota Twins at Fenway Park on Friday night due to a significant left knee injury, according to manager Alex Cora. Well have more information tomorrow (Saturday), Cora said. The 25-year-old Casas was taken to a local hospital for further testing. To be honest, it seemed like he was in shock, Cora said. When you see the cart, youre like whoa. Its more than a twisted ankle or something like that. Casas fell as he was attempting to leg out an infield hit that starter Joe Ryan bobbled before his under-hand throw to first baseman Ty France. Replays showed that Casas collided with France and the atmosphere in the Red Sox dugout mimicked the eerie calm that fell over the entire ballpark once Casas went down and didnt get up immediately. They put in so much work and effort in the offseason to try and play 162-plus (games), then something like that happens. Thats the reason why you dont take it for granted, Cora said. (Casas) loves being a big leaguer. He loves coming to the ballpark at 10 in the morning and leaving at midnight. For now, I think its going to be taken away, but hes going to be back. Casas entered the game hitting .184 with three home runs in 28 games. Romy Gonzalez replaced him in the lineup Friday and doubled in a run during the eighth inning. 
        
     Casas missed 98 games from mid-April until Aug. 16 with a left rib strain. He has started the past three opening days at first base for Boston. Horrible. Obviously, were all thinking of him. Hoping for the best. You hate to see it, Red Sox third baseman Alex Bregman said. Were a big family in here.

Padres OF Fernando Tatis Jr. sustains left arm contusion after getting hit by pitch vs Pirates,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  Padres outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. left San Diegos game against Pittsburgh on Friday night with a left arm contusion after being hit by a pitch. The Padres said that initial X-rays were negative and that Tatis was receiving treatment and would continue to be evaluated. Tatis was batting with two outs in the top of the third inning and was behind 0-1 in the count when he was hit on the left forearm by a high, inside pitch by Pirates starter Mitch Keller.  Tatis immediately dropped his bat and ran backward out of the batters box, cradling his left arm. He dropped to his knee and let his left arm dangle in front of him. Trainers came to Tatis aid and there was obvious swelling quickly on the forearm where he was hit by the pitch. Oscar Gonzalez entered the game to run for Tatis and took his spot in right field.

Haeran Ryu overcomes slow start and leads LPGAs Black Desert Championship by 2 shots,"IVINS, Utah (AP)  Haeran Ryu tried to keep her eyes on the fairways instead of the black lava rock framing them and it worked in her favor again Friday for a 5-under 67 that gave her a two-shot lead going into the weekend at the Black Desert Championship. Ryu has missed only two fairways and three greens over 36 holes at the Tom Weiskopf design, where ample fairways can look narrow because of rocks. Coming off a nine-birdie start, Ryu was 1 over through four holes when a birdie on the fifth sent her on her way. Her round included a chip-in birdie and the highlight of her day, a hybrid on the par-5 ninth that rolled out to 5 feet for an eagle. She was at 14-under 130, two shots clear of Somi Lee, who played bogey-free for a second straight round of 66. Lee has gone 26 holes without a bogey. Another shot behind were Esther Henseleit of Germany, who had a 68, and Soo Bin Joo, the 20-year-old South Korean who made only two pars through her opening 11 holes, followed by seven straight pars. It added to a 68 and a clear thought on how to spend the rest of her afternoon following a round that at one point put her in the lead. Im going to go to straight to my room. Pretty tired right now, Joo said. My leg started cramping up on 18 to be honest. Its my first time being on the lead. And then I had fun a lot, but I think Im going to get some good rest and clear my mind and just get ready for the weekend. Black Desert is the only course that hosts events for the PGA Tour and LPGA Tour, with Matt McCarty having won last fall. Utah had not seen a top tour in some six decades. 
        
     Ryu only played the par 5s in 1 under during the opening round and was two shots better on Friday, when she played in the afternoon. Yesterday I played in the morning so was a little bit cold and my drive distance a little bit less than today, she said. So today I play in the afternoon, I got a little more shorter club for the second shot. Ariya Jutanugarn and Wei-Ling Hsu each shot 70 and were at 10-under 134. Former Womens British Open champion Hinako Shibuno shot a 65 to get back in the mix, joining a large group that was five shots back. It was an eclectic leaderboard at Black Desert, with the top 10 players represented by seven countries, which did not include the United States. Kristen Gillman and Andrea Lee were the low Americans, both six shots behind. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/lpga-haeran-ryu-utah-black-desert-5ee25e597be9fd14750366e76e0e70fb,sports
"Fried combines on 1-hitter, wins 6th straight start to lead Yankees over Rays 3-0","NEW YORK (AP)  Max Fried combined with two relievers on a one-hitter to become the major leagues first six-game winner and lead the New York Yankees over the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0 on Friday night. Aaron Judge hit his second triple of the season and doubled in the sixth ahead of Paul Goldschmidts three-run homer to raise his major league-leading average to .430 and extend his on-base streak to 28 games. Nearly two weeks after a no-hit bid against the Rays ended in the eighth inning with a retroactive scoring change, Fried (6-0) allowed a clean single to Jos Caballero with one out in the fifth.  Fried struck out six, walked two and got 10 groundball outs as he won his sixth straight start and helped the Yankees improve to 7-0 in his outings. He lowered his AL-leading ERA to 1.01 in his third scoreless start this season. Fried is 4-0 with a 0.00 ERA following Yankees losses. Goldschmidt hs third homer of the season in the fifth after left-hander Mason Montgomery relieved Ryan Pepiot (2-4). Devin Williams threw eight pitches in a perfect eighth in his third straight hitless outing since he was dropped as New Yorks closer. Luke Weaver struck out two in a perfect ninth for his third save. New York has pitched three shutouts this year  all against the Rays. Tampa Bay has lost four straight games, totaling just three runs. The Rays have been blanked five times. 
        
     Goldschmidt raised his average to .361, second in the majors behind Judge, and is hitting a big league-best .586 (17 for 29) against left-handers. Pepiot allowed two runs and five hits in a season-low 4 1/3 innings. Montgomery threw five straight sliders against Ben Rice to get a strikeout. He went to his fastball against Goldschmidt, who hit an 0-1 pitch into the right-field seats.  Fried picked off Christopher Morel in the second. Frieds 32 pickoffs since 2017 are the most in the majors.  Tampa Bay RHP Zack Littell (1-5, 5.03 ERA) opposes New York RHP Clarke Schmidt (0-1, 5.52) on Saturday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-rays-score-9d8e709c22d2c705266357b533462d43,sports
"Lukes delivers tiebreaking hit in eighth, Ramrez leaves injured as Blue Jays beat Guardians 5-3","TORONTO (AP)  Nathan Lukes hit a two-out, two-run single in the eighth inning to snap a tie and give the Toronto Blue Jays a 5-3 win over the Cleveland Guardians on Friday night. Guardians star Jos Ramrez left in the third inning because of a sprained right ankle. The six-time All-Star was struck in the back by a throw from pitcher Chris Bassitt as he ran out an infield single and stumbled awkwardly over first base before ending up in the dirt. Lukes lined the winning hit off right-hander Jakob Junis (0-1) to end Clevelands three-game winning streak. Brendon Little (1-0) pitched 1 2/3 innings and Jeff Hoffman finished for his seventh save in seven chances. Hoffman retired Gabriel Arias to end it, stranding runners at second and third. Toronto won its third straight game after losing eight of its previous nine. Clevelands Carlos Santana hit a leadoff homer in the second, but Alejandro Kirk answered with a two-run single in the third. Guardians catcher Bo Naylor tied it with a solo homer in the fourth. George Springer restored Torontos lead with a solo shot in the fifth, but Santana knotted it again in the sixth, chasing Bassitt with an RBI single. Bassitt allowed three runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. Guardians left-hander Logan Allen allowed three runs, two earned, and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. Lukes lined a 1-1 sinker to right field, driving in Springer from third base and pinch-runner Daulton Varsho from second. The Blue Jays are 9-1 this season when they score five runs or more. Blue Jays RHP Kevin Gausman (2-3, 4.50 ERA) is scheduled to start against Guardians RHP Gavin Williams (2-2, 5.14) on Saturday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/guardians-blue-jays-score-ca2ed4c3d4630c526bab81e819a887f0,sports
"Gunnar Hoglund wins major league debut, leads Athletics to 6-1 win that extends Marlins skid to 6","MIAMI (AP)  Gunnar Hoglund won his major league debut by allowing one run over six innings to lead the Athletics over Miami 6-1 on Friday night and extend the Marlins losing streak to six. A 25-year-old right-hander who pitched at the University of Mississippi, Hoglund (1-0) struck out seven, walked none and allowed six hits, including Dane Myers leadoff home run in the sixth. Hoglund was selected by Toronto 19th overall in the 2021 amateur draft and was among the prospects acquired by the As in the March 2022 trade that sent third baseman Matt Chapman to the Blue Jays. Hogland threw 81 pitches, including 34 four-seam fastballs that averaged 93.6 mph. He got six swings and misses on fastballs, three on changeups and two on sinkers. JJ Bleday, who played for the Marlins as a rookie in 2022, hit his third home run. His solo shot in the third boosted the lead to 3-0 against Valente Bellozo (0-2), who allowed five runs, four hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings. The Athletics (18-15) improved to a big league-best 12-6 on the road. They went ahead in the second on Nick Kurtzs RBI single and Jacob Wilsons bases-loaded walk. Hoglund struck out Max Mervis on a 1-2 changeup to strand runners at the corners in the fourth. Miami has been outscored 61-22 during its six-game skid.

Utah dropping beach volleyball and cites its change in conferences as a factor,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Utah has decided to drop beach volleyball as a varsity sport after eight years in part because of conference realignment. Utah introduced beach volleyball  an Olympic sport since 1996  in 2017, when the Utes competed in the Pac-12 Conference. The Pac-12 had nine beach volleyball programs at the time but most of those schools have since left for the Big Ten, ACC and Big 12. Utah is now in the Big 12, which has just three other beach volleyball programs and no automatic qualifying spot for the NCAA Tournament for its league champion. This was an extremely difficult decision, athletics director Mark Harlan said this week. We looked at the landscape of intercollegiate beach volleyball and the future opportunities of our student-athletes.  Calling beach volleyballs growth at the college level stunted, Harlan noted that just 12 power conference schools sponsor such teams with little evidence of the sport expanding at this time.  Harlan said the Utah athletic department would work closely with each of our impacted student-athletes to provide them with all of the support they need and honor the scholarships of those who decide to complete their education at Utah.  Should a current or incoming student-athlete elect to pursue their sport at another school, Utah will do all that it can to facilitate the process, Harlan said, adding that scholarship funds which had been dedicated to the beach volleyball program will be redirected to our other womens sports. Utah will now sponsor 19 intercollegiate sport programs in the coming academic year. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/utah-beach-volleyball-dropped-e21019b4ff1a301ebd040a0390346b37,sports
Gill and Buttler bat Gujarat up to second in IPL after big win over Hyderabad,"AHMEDABAD, India (AP)  Captain Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler lashed half-centuries as Gujarat Titans defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by 38 runs in the Indian Premier League on Friday. Gujarat racked up 224-6 thanks to Gills 76 off 38 balls, Buttlers 64 off 37 and Sai Sudharsans 48 off 23, and Hyderabad never look threatening as it was restricted to 186-6. Fast bowlers Prasidh Krishna, 2-19, and Mohammed Siraj, 2-33, stalled Hyderabads chase. Hyderabad top-scorer Abhishek Sharma, with 74, got little support from the other end. The win lifted Gujarat to second on the 10-team table, while Hyderabad, a finalist last year, lay at ninth and on the brink of elimination from playoffs contention. The 225 target was steep, and only steeper after Krishna removed opener Travis Head for 20 to Rashid Khans stunning diving catch and No. 4 Klaasen for 23. Ishan Kishan continued to struggle since his century in the opening game as he labored for 17 balls to 13 runs, and Gerald Coetzee, playing his first match of the season, found a leading edge and gave Krishna a regulation catch at deep third man. Sharma did the bulk of the scoring and hit six sixes and four boundaries before Gujarat sealed the game with four wickets for six runs within 12 balls. Siraj took out Aniket Verma and Kamindu Mendis for a combined three runs and was on a hat trick but captain Pat Cummins defended it. Hyderabad, apart from Sharma though, struggled to pose a threat. 
        
     Openers Gill and Sudharsan set the platform for Gujarat. Their electrifying 82 runs together off 41 balls in the powerplay, including 13 boundaries, was Gujarats best ever. The left-handed Sudharsan, who smashed five boundaries in one over off Mohammed Shami, became the leading run-scorer in this IPL. Hes also the second fastest batter in Twenty20s to complete 2,000 runs, in 54 matches. Sudharsan was out in the seventh over, caught behind, but Buttler joined Gill and upped the ante with smart, powerful hitting. Gill reached his fifty in 25 balls, and was run out at 149-2 on a single he called, by Harshal Patels throw deflected by wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen. Gill hit 10 fours and two sixes. Buttler, dropped on 22 by Cummins, reached his fifty in 31 balls. He eventually fell to a catch on the boundary off a Cummins delivery in the penultimate over. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/gujarat-hyderabad-ipl-00a8f9b92e5b5fcfa30116777e86cc8f,sports
Reds place outfielder Austin Hays on the 10-day injured list and activate catcher Tyler Stephenson,"CINCINNATI (AP)  The Cincinnati Reds placed outfielder Austin Hays on the 10-day injured list because of a left hamstring strain and activated catcher Tyler Stephenson on Friday. Hays, who is batting .365 in 13 games with five home runs and 13 runs batted in, injured himself while running the bases during Cincinnatis 3-1 victory on Monday over the St. Louis Cardinals.  The Reds chose to retroactively start Hays stint on the injured list on Tuesday. Stephenson has been sidelined by a left oblique strain since the regular season began. He played in 138 games last season, 127 of them as catcher. We are thrilled to have Stephenson back. He is a big part of what we want to be doing, Reds manager Terry Francona said before Cincinnati hosted Washington on Friday night. Especially with Hays out, he gives us that veteran right-handed bat. Stephenson  who had career highs with 26 doubles, 19 home runs and 66 RBI in 2024  will share catching duties with Jose Trevino and Austin Wynns. Trevino, signed to back up Stephenson behind the plate, is hitting .324. Wynns is hitting .394 in 12 games as Trevinos backup. Francona said having three catchers on the roster is probably not going to be something that lasts forever. It will allow us, if we DH one of them, we can pinch run easier, Fancona added. Were very fortunate. We left camp a little concerned. You lose one of your big guns, but the guys did a good job. That helped us a ton. Francona rejected the idea of Stephenson playing first base. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/reds-austin-hays-tyler-stephenson-758a5140cf75047bcd398dd5b0a12ac2,sports
Trump administration settles with Maine over funding freeze after dispute over trans athletes,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP)  President Donald Trumps administration on Friday agreed to halt all efforts to freeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program after initially suspending those dollars due to a disagreement between the state and Trump over transgender athletes. In response, the state will drop its lawsuit that had been filed against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey announced.  Its unfortunate that my office had to resort to federal court just to get USDA to comply with the law and its own regulations, Frey said in a statement. But we are pleased that the lawsuit has now been resolved and that Maine will continue to receive funds as directed by Congress to feed children and vulnerable adults. An email message seeking comment was sent Friday to the Agriculture Department. The settlement closes a dispute first sparked by the federal governments decision to freeze federal funds to Maine for certain administrative and technological functions in the states schools.  A letter from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins explained that the decision stemmed from a disagreement between the state and federal governments over whether Maine was complying with Title IX, the federal law that bans discrimination in education based on sex. Trump had accused Maine of failing to comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports. Soon after the secretarys letter was sent, Maines Department of Education could not access several sources of federal funds for a state nutrition program, according to the courts written order. 
        
     Maine quickly sued the Trump administration, where the states attorneys argued that the child nutrition program received or was due to receive more than $1.8 million for the current fiscal year. Prior year funds that were awarded but are currently inaccessible total more than $900,000, the lawsuit states. The lawsuit also said that the program was anticipating about $3 million that is typically awarded every July for summer meal program sponsor administration and meal reimbursement. A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze funds last month after finding that Maine was likely to succeed in its legal challenge. The state of Maine went to court and fought this unlawful attempt to freeze critical funding for our school lunch program  and we won, said Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in a statement. I applaud the work of Attorney General Frey and his staff in representing the state in this action against USDA, and preserving healthy school meals for 172,000 Maine school children.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-maine-usda-transgender-sports-cf1754471bcc8a6418f3308a6aed8fc5,sports
The 151st Kentucky Derby could be a mudders delight with rain in the forecast,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  The Kentucky Derby is tough to win, with a huge field of stampeding horses and 150,000 screaming fans in the stands. Toss in a rainy forecast that could turn the Churchill Downs dirt strip into something resembling peanut butter and it gets trickier. A field of 19 3-year-olds is set to run 1 1/4 miles for a $3.1 million prize and the garland of red roses on Saturday. Mucking things up is a forecast of 65 degrees (18 degrees Celsius) with a 90% chance of rain. The soggy weather isnt just a bummer for those wanting the fairest of track conditions. The Derby is also a big party and fashion show, and rain means pulling out ponchos  no umbrellas allowed  to protect the huge hats and floral dresses. Thirteen of the Derby contenders  including early 3-1 favorite Journalism  have never raced on a wet track. Clods of flying mud hitting their faces could be a turnoff. I may go through three pairs of goggles, said Brian Hernandez Jr., who will be aboard Burnham Square. Six longshots have experience in the muck, with four winning. Coal Battle is 2 for 2, while Japan-based Luxor Cafe is 3 for 4. The others are Neoequos and American Promise, trained by 89-year-old D. Wayne Lukas. The last Derby run on a sloppy track was in 2019, when Country House won via a disqualification that had nothing to do with the weather. The last muddy track was in 1989, when Sunday Silence won. 
        
     Trainer Bob Baffert goes for a record-setting seventh victory in his return from a three-year suspension. Hell saddle Citizen Bull, last years 2-year-old champion. The colt breaks from the dreaded No. 1 post, leaving him little choice but to get to the front before the rest of the field comes over, potentially cutting him off. Were going to tell him to get out of there like he just robbed a bank, Baffert said. No horse has won from the No. 1 post since Ferdinand in 1986. Bafferts other horse, Rodriguez, was scratched Thursday with a bruised foot, moving Baeza into the field. Trainer Todd Pletchers only entry, Grande, was scratched Friday for the same reason. Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen tries to snap an 0 for 26 Derby losing streak with a pair of 20-1 shots: Publisher and Tiztastic. Both are next to each other in the starting gate. Sovereignty, the early 5-1 second choice, won at Churchill Downs last fall. Hell try to snap an 0 for 13 Derby skid for Godolphin, the racing stable of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. I know he loves this track, jockey Junior Alvarado said, so Im sitting on a good run with him now. Sandman, the early 6-1 third choice, is the most expensive horse in the field at $1.2 million. Conversely, 30-1 shot Chunk of Gold was bought for $2,500. Theres been a lot of expensive horses not pan out and theres been a lot of cheap ones that have panned out, Chunk of Gold trainer Ethan West said. Its not like hes a big, robust, grand-looking animal. Hes very good-looking, but he doesnt look like Journalism, thats for sure. Journalism looked the part of the Derby favorite while training during a mostly rain-free week on the track and breaks from the No. 8 post. The history of the Derby is usually a pretty vibrant opening quarter-mile, trainer Michael McCarthy said. Hell be part of that, probably just back off the speed. The Southern California-based colts mothers name is Mopotism and wanting a name ending in ism, co-owner Aron Wellman took inspiration from his old gig as sports editor of the Beverly Hills High School newspaper. Now more than ever, in the climate that were living in, journalists and responsible journalism is so important, he said. Its so poignant that a horse named Journalism is going to have all eyes on him. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-derby-churchill-downs-4f8fb9472dfc675070168ff9fded28c5,sports

Iowa basketball coach Ben McCollum agrees to 6-year contract with starting pay of $3.35M,"Iowa mens basketball coach Ben McCollum agreed to a six-year, $22.75 million contract that runs through the 2030-31 season, according to the memorandum of understanding he signed last month. The document, obtained Friday through an Associated Press public records request, outlines a pay package that lists McCollums base salary at $500,000 each year with supplemental pay that increases annually. His formal contract was not available for release, the university said. McCollum will earn $3.35 million in his first year, with his compensation rising to $4.1 million in the sixth year. McCollum would be in line for six-figure bonuses if the Hawkeyes reach the NCAA Sweet 16, topped by $400,000 for winning the national championship. A Big Ten regular-season title would earn him $75,000 and a conference tournament championship $50,000. Additional bonuses are tied to his players academic performance. He will have a salary pool of about $2.1 million for assistant coaches. McCollum, whose hiring was announced March 24, led Drake to the Missouri Valley Conference regular-season and tournament championships and a win in the NCAA Tournament in his only season with the Bulldogs.

"After a fans terrifying fall in Pittsburgh, a look at safety measures across MLB","NEW YORK (AP)  When a fan flipped over the railing and fell off the 21-foot-high Clemente Wall in right field at Pittsburghs PNC Park on Wednesday night, it elicited memories of spectators who have died from similar falls at other major league stadiums. Kavan Markwood was in critical condition as of Thursday after falling onto the warning track in right field just as Pirates star Andrew McCutchen hit a two-run double in the seventh inning to put Pittsburgh ahead 4-3. Markwood was tended to for approximately five minutes by members of both the Pirates and Cubs training staffs as well as PNC personnel, before being removed from the field on a cart. He was taken to the trauma center at Allegheny General Hospital. Pittsburgh Public Safety, which includes Pittsburgh Police and EMS, posted on X Thursday that the incident is being treated as accidental in nature. Fans died after steep falls at ballparks in Arlington, Texas, in 2011 and Atlanta in 2015.  Heres a look at some safety measures instituted by MLB and its teams: Railing heights at ballparks are team decisions based on local laws and codes. The railing that runs along the Clemente Wall is three feet (36 inches) in height, which exceeds the building code requirements of 26 inches, according to Pirates vice president of communications Brian Warecki. Those rail heights have come under scrutiny at other ballparks after fans died. The Rangers raised the height of the front row rails at their former ballpark by as much as 12 inches to 42 inches in July 2011 after a fan named Shannon Stone fell about 20 feet.  The Atlanta Braves settled a lawsuit in 2018 with the family of Gregory Murrey, who died after falling from Turner Fields upper deck three years earlier. Murrey fell over a rail that was 30 inches high  industry code standards mandated 26 inches or taller.  Until 2015, many ballparks had netting separating fans and the field only directly behind home plate. Following several incidents that season in which fans were hospitalized after being hit by foul balls, MLB encouraged teams to extend netting or screens to run dugout-to-dugout behind home plate in December 2015. Three years later, all 30 ballparks had netting reaching to the far ends of each dugout. In 2019, a 2-year-old girl fractured her skull when struck by a foul ball at the Houston Astros stadium. The club later reached a settlement with the girls family. The following offseason, MLB announced seven major league teams would expand protective netting to the foul poles and 15 others would expand their netting generally to the area in the outfield where the stands begin to angle away from the field. The remaining eight clubs already had installed netting that extended substantially beyond the far end of the dugouts. MLB does not mandate alcohol sales cutoffs, but most clubs have stopped selling alcohol around the end of the seventh inning for years. After new rules aimed at increasing the pace of play led to shorter game times in 2023, several clubs extended alcohol sales until the end of the eighth inning. Many of those teams have reverted back to the seventh-inning cutoff. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB .",https://apnews.com/article/mlb-fan-safety-e5b0721cb418e4042c8129360773c320,sports
"Jeff Sperbeck, former agent for John Elway, dies after golf cart injury. Heres what we know","LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP)  The death of Jeff Sperbeck, a business partner and former agent for NFL Hall of Famer John Elway, after falling off a golf cart on Saturday appeared to be a horrific accident that didnt involve criminal activity, said Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, whose agency is investigating the incident. Sperbeck, 62, died on Wednesday, after his injury at a Southern California golfing community. Witness Ali Simon told KESQ-TV of Palm Springs that Elway was at the scene of the crash. This appears to be a horrific accident, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told the Denver Post. And unfortunately for all of those involved, one of the people  well, a couple of them  happen to be very high-profile celebrities. And that makes this more of an issue than it probably should be. Elway, who played his whole career on the Denver Broncos, issued a statement saying he was devastated by the loss of his close friend. Here is what we know about the incident. 
        
     Riverside County fire authorities were called to The Madison Club, an upscale country club and residential community in the desert community of La Quinta near Palm Springs, on Saturday evening for a report of a person suffering serious injuries after falling off a golf cart.  Sperbeck was then taken to the hospital, and he died early Wednesday from his injuries. Elway was at the scene of the crash, witness Ali Simon told KESQ-TV. Simon said she did not see the accident occur, but saw a man lying on the ground surrounded by people and Elway on the phone. TMZ has reported that Elway was driving the golf cart, citing unidentified sources. KUSA-TV in Denver also cited an unnamed source saying Elway was driving. Law enforcement officials have not said who was driving the golf cart, and Elway did not confirm or deny it in a statement about Sperbecks death. Medical personnel at the scene didnt find evidence suggesting Elway was drunk, Bianco told the Denver Post. He did not elaborate about how personnel reached that conclusion. Bianco said first responders didnt immediately call the sheriffs office to the scene, and typically would notify law enforcement if there were a concern. He said his agency got involved following media interest in the case and is reviewing surveillance footage and witness testimony. The investigation will be short, he said. Ed Obayashi, Modoc County deputy sheriff and special prosecutor, said law enforcement might not initially be called to investigate an injury involving a single person, for example, who falls down the stairs or from a bicycle. But if a death occurs, Obayashi said law enforcement officials are typically asked to investigate so the coroner can complete a thorough report. It could be a matter of routine, or there may be some information they received that requires them to investigate it, said Obayashi, who trains law enforcement officials on legal issues. Elways attorney, Harvey Steinberg, told Colorados 9NEWS it was an accident. The investigation has confirmed what we already knew: This was a tragic accident and sometimes things happen in life that we will never comprehend, Steinberg said. Sperbeck, who is from the Orange County seaside community of San Clemente, began managing Elway in 1990, when Elway was quarterback for the Denver Broncos. He represented more than 100 NFL players during a three-decade career as an agent and business adviser. He was best known as Elways longtime friend, business partner and agent who helped manage the Hall of Famers extensive off-field business empire, which included restaurants, car dealerships and a winery. We are grieving this unimaginable loss as a family alongside our dearest friends the Elways and the many other clients Jeff called friends, the Sperbeck family said in a statement. Sperbeck managed Elways marketing and business ventures, and the two collaborated with winemaker Rob Mondavi Jr. in 2015 to co-found 7Cellars by John Elway. Sperbeck was also involved in numerous charitable endeavors and co-founded a sports marketing firm. Elway issued a statement following Sperbecks death.  I am absolutely devastated and heartbroken by the passing of my close friend, business partner and agent Jeff Sperbeck, he said. There are no words to truly express the profound sadness I feel with the sudden loss of someone who has meant so much to me.",https://apnews.com/article/jeff-sperbeck-agent-death-golf-cart-elway-0b10a26e9a526d9ec397cd245fffcae8,sports
Texas Rangers are struggling on offense and send slumping slugger Jake Burger down to Triple-A,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  The Texas Rangers optioned slumping slugger Jake Burger to Triple-A Round Rock on Friday, at a time when the entire team is struggling to score runs.  The move was made before the Rangers 13-1 loss at home in the opener of a three-game series against AL West-leading Seattle.  Burger, a first baseman and one of the Rangers key offseason acquisitions, hit .190 with three home runs, 12 RBIs and a team-high 32 strikeouts in 100 at-bats his first 30 games. Getting back to the best version of himself. I think more than anything its a reset mentally, said Chris Young, the teams president of baseball operations. Fair or unfair, his performance is magnified a little bit by the performance of others, the collective performance. Were just not at the level we need to be. Texas selected the contract of first baseman Blaine Crim from Round Rock. Infielder Jonathan Ornelas was recalled from the Triple-A squad and infielder Nick Ahmed was designated for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster for Crim. Crim went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts in his major league debut, batting eighth and playing first base. The 27-year-old, a 19th-round draft pick in 2019, hit .313 with seven homers and 25 RBIs in 28 games for Round Rock. The Rangers have lost eight of their last 10 games. They have scored 29 runs in that stretch, but most of those came when they had a season-high 15 against Oakland on Tuesday. They scored only 14 runs in those other nine games, including a 2-0 win. 
        
     Texas is last in the American League with 104 runs scored. The latest loss dropped the Rangers to 16-17 overall, under .500 for the first time since losing to Boston in the season opener. Theres no hidden messages with these moves, Young said. Were not going well offensively. This is simply were committed to winning, and the players that are performing are going to get playing time. Designated hitter Joc Pederson, a free agent last winter when he became the teams other prominent offensive addition, was hitting .104 after going 0 for 3 Friday night. That is twice his season low of .052 after a recent 0-for-41 drought, the franchises longest hitless stretch since at least 1974. The 29-year-old Burger was acquired from Miami in a trade during the winter meetings in December. He hit 29 homers and had 76 RBIs for the Marlins last season, after a combined 34 homers and 80 RBIs in 2023 when he was with the Chicago White Sox before a trade-deadline deal to Miami. We just think to get him in a situation where he can have a chance to reset, relax a little bit, find his swing, manager Bruce Bochy said of the move. Hes going to be back up here. Hes going to help us win a lot of games this year. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-mlb-burger-fae1750a4ec8f3bb7e59bd401179cbbf,sports

Sanson on target again as Nice moves into Champions League spots in Ligue 1,"NICE, France (AP)  Another goal from in-form striker Morgan Sanson gave Nice its third victory in a row and a 1-0 win over Reims in Ligue 1 on Friday. A week after he scored twice in Nices shock 3-1 win at champion Paris Saint-Germain, Sanson was again on target. With 15 minutes gone, a cross from the left was only partially cleared and fell perfectly for him to knock it into the empty net. The former Aston Villa striker missed most of this season through injury but has returned in fine form. Fridays goal was his third in his last two games. The win takes Nice above Lille and Monaco into third place. Reims remains 13th. Meanwhile, Paris will have two first division clubs next season for the first time in 35 years after Paris FC earned promotion. Paris FCs 1-1 draw at Martigues, and a draw by third-placed Metz, sealed a top two place in Ligue 2 and automatic promotion.

AP Photos: Colorful plumed hats fills Churchill Downs as fans embrace the 151st Kentucky Derby,"Despite the chance of rain in the forecast, colorful plumed hats are again a fashion staple at Churchill Downs for the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, Kentucky. The tradition of wearing hats to the Derby began with its first running in 1875. They began taking on a life of their own in the 1960s, growing larger and more ornate so the people wearing them could be spotted on television. The hats are just one of the features among the 150,000 fans jammed under the Twin Spires for a fashion show mixed with an all-day party that is heavy on traditions like mint juleps, singing My Old Kentucky Home while they wait for the 2-minute drama to see the winning horse get a garland of red roses draped on its back.

Former China national team coach Li loses appeal of 20-year bribery sentence,"Former China national team coach Li Tie lost his appeal against a 20-year prison sentence handed down on corruption charges, a Chinese court announced Wednesday. Li, who once played in the Premier League for Everton, was sentenced in December after being found guilty of giving and accepting bribes of around 120 million yuan ($16.5 million) while coaching both Chinese Super League club Hebei China Fortune and the national team between 2015 and 2021. He appealed the sentence, but the judge at the Hubei High Peoples Court upheld the original verdict. Li can now choose to take his case to the Supreme Peoples Court, the highest judicial body in the country. China has been seeking to stamp out corruption and match-fixing in soccer for decades. In 2024, Li was just one of a number of high-profile figures in the sport to be prosecuted in an anti-corruption sweep. Former China Football Association (CFA) president Chen Xuyuan was jailed for life for accepting bribes while former CFA vice-president Yu Hongchen, ex-deputy secretary general Chen Yongliang, and former Super League general manager Dong Zheng were also sentenced to lengthy prison terms. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/china-soccer-corruption-appeal-li-tie-2cb820cc6a9b76e85b05e404d1951dab,sports
Bournemouths Evanilson has 3-match ban overturned after red card against Man United,"LONDON (AP)  Bournemouth striker Evanilson had a three-match ban overturned on Wednesday following his red card against Manchester United in the Premier League. The Brazilian was dismissed in the 70th minute of the 1-1 draw with United at the Vitality Stadium on Sunday following a challenge on Noussair Mazraoui. The suspension was removed after a successful claim of wrongful dismissal by Bournemouth, with Evanilson appearing to slip before taking out Mazraoui. Evanilson will now be available to face Arsenal on Saturday, as well as for games against Aston Villa and Manchester City. An independent regulatory commission has removed Evanilsons three-match ban following a successful claim of wrongful dismissal, read a statement from the Football Association. The AFC Bournemouth forward was sent off during the Premier League fixture against Manchester United on Sunday, 27 April, for serious foul play. Evanilson was originally shown a yellow card by referee Peter Bankes for his foul on Mazraoui. Following an intervention from the video assistant referee, the punishment was upgraded to red after Bankes watched replays of the incident on a pitch-side monitor. United scored a stoppage-time equalizer to deny 10-man Bournemouth victory. With four games to play, Bournemouth is in 10th place  a point adrift of both Fulham and Brighton as they chase European qualification. 
        
     Im frustrated, for us its two points that are massive, big consequences, Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said after the United match regarding Evanilsons dismissal. Now the repercussions are bigger because you dont have time to recover these points and its two points that for us are very costly. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/bournemouth-evanilson-ban-9cbcaecaa9b97296deb02717dd636ed0,sports

Barcelona and Inter Milan draw 3-3 in thrilling first leg of their Champions League semifinal,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  Lamine Yamals curler that went in off the post after the teenagers great dribble? Marcus Thurams nifty back-heeled flick? Raphinhas missile that hit the bar and the goalkeeper before finding the net? And dont forget Denzel Dumfries bicycle kick, before he scored again with a powerful header. You have your pick of great goals from Barcelona and Inter Milans thrilling 3-3 draw to start their Champions League semifinal on Wednesday, setting up a must-see sequel next week in Milan. Opta Stats said it was joint-highest highest score for a draw in a Champions League semifinals since Bayern Munich and Dynamo Kiev finished with the same score in April 1999. What was supposed to be a contrast of styles between the top-scoring Barcelona and the stingiest defense in the competition turned into a shootout. We saw a fantastic match and we knew that semifinals are difficult. We could even have won, Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said. Our fans know that weve been giving our utmost in difficult times and we know that Tuesday will be a final. 
        
     Inter matched Barcelonas firepower with two goals from corner kicks, and the hosts needed another stellar performance from 17-year-old Yamal in his 100th appearance for his club. Except for Inters start and strength in set pieces, Barcelona imposed its game and had 66% possession and created 10 shots on goal to Inters three, according to UEFAs stats  but had to settle for a draw. Thuram was a doubt for the starting 11 after missing Inters previous three matches  all losses without a goal. But the striker used the back of his heel to turn in a cross by Dumfries to stun the hosts just seconds after kickoff. Dumfries then put Inter into what appeared to be a comfortable lead when he scored his first of two goals with a bicycle kick after a corner kick was headed onto him in the 21st. Yamal sparked Barcelona into action in the 24th when he dribbled past two defenders and sliced a shot in off the far post. He went close to an equalizer moments later after gliding down the endline and firing a shot with just a sliver off an angle off the crossbar. Yamal is a fantastic player, in the big matches you can see his quality, and he showed it today, Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said about his forward. At 2-0 down, he continued, I knew that this was a semifinal between great clubs and I knew that the huge experience they have was being demonstrated. They are good at set plays too, but Lamine showed us the way forward. His goal to make it 2-1 was so important. Ferran Torres rammed in a headed pass by Raphinha to equalize for Barcelona in the 38th. Inter suffered another blow when Lautaro Martnez had to be substituted at halftime, but Dumfries charged in to head home a corner kick to put Inter back ahead in the 63rd. Raphinha needed two minutes to pull Barcelona level again when his blistering shot from outside the top of the box struck the crossbar, ricocheted off the back of goalkeeper Yann Sommer and found the net. Playing at home, we had the obligation to win, Raphinha said. But the result is not that bad and we will prepare for the second game so we come out on top. Barcelona is trying to reach its first final since 2015, when it collected its fifth title. In its first season under Flick, the Spanish club is also trying to repeat the treble of major trophies it won a decade ago. Inter is aiming for its second final in three years, after losing to Manchester City in the trophy match in 2023. The last time three-time winner Inter lifted the European Cup it beat Barcelona at the same stage in 2010. The winner will face either Paris Saint-Germain or Arsenal in Munich on May 31. PSG beat Arsenal 1-0 in London on Tuesday in their first match. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-inter-champions-league-semifinals-822523780ac99a58d28b1a1dfea94ffd,sports

Mike Trout is going on the injured list again with a bone bruise in his left knee,"ANAHEIM, Calif.

NBCs coverage of Kentucky Derby has grown and evolved as it gears up for its 25th Run for the Roses,"When NBC carried the Kentucky Derby for the first time in 2001, the broadcast lasted only 90 minutes. On Saturday, when it carries the Run for the Roses for the 25th time, 90 minutes wouldnt be enough for all the feature stories that will run leading up to post time. NBC Sports will present 12 1/2 hours of coverage across two days on NBC, USA Network and Peacock. There will be five hours for Fridays Kentucky Oaks on USA Network and Peacock. Saturdays coverage begins on USA Network at noon ET before moving to NBC at 2:30 p.m. while Peacock will stream all 7 1/2 hours. So much has changed since we first started in 2001. At that time, we thought 90 minutes to cover a two-minute race. How are we going to fill all this time? Now we are still trying to figure out how were going to get this story in and that story in because there are so many great stories to tell, said Donna Brothers, the only member of the broadcast team involved with all 25 Derbys on NBC. NBC has done five hours of coverage on the main network on Derby Day since 2018. Sam Flood, the executive producer and president of NBC Sports Production, said the true evolution behind adding more hours while making the coverage appeal to a cross-section of viewers began after he produced his first Derby in 2006. I remember getting done with the show, which I think was two hours. I kept thinking, we can do so much more, Flood said. There are so many assets here that should be showcased, and thats when we started blowing it out, adding more hours and slowly shifting more and more hours on to NBC and off the cable platforms. 
        
     The expansion has also included the Kentucky Oaks. It started airing on Bravo in 2009 before moving to the NBC Sports Network and then USA Network. The Derby broadcast has evolved into one of the most diverse sports events that NBC does yearly and is on par with the Olympics, which it carries once every two years, and the Super Bowl, which it has once every four years.  It also might be the only place where a viewer can see fashion, recipes from one of the hosts of Bravos Top Chef, and race predictions from NBC News chief data analyst Steve Kornacki. Mike Tirico, the host of NBCs coverage since 2017, said doing the Derby served as good preparation for hosting the Olympics as well as a stint as a guest host on the Today show last week. My time doing the Derby helped me to do the Today show last week, not vice versa, he said. This show is so cool. It goes from speed figures to fascinators. It goes from betting to bourbon. We cover it all in the five hours with a great team of people who dive in and take their space and own it. We all build towards the race. The audience does the same.  Tirico succeeded Tom Hammond as host. Hammond, a University of Kentucky graduate, was a guiding force around NBCs early coverage and introducing the sports most prominent personalities to viewers. Lindsay Schanzer, the supervising producer of NBCs coverage, said one of the advantages of having nearly 4 1/2 hours leading up to post time at 6:57 p.m. ET is the chance to focus on the stories of the 20 horses that will line up in the starting gate. Among the stories planned are the return of trainer Bob Baffert  who served a three-year suspension after Medina Spirit failed a drug test  89-year-old trainer D. Wayne Lukas and Michael McCarthy, the trainer of prerace favorite Journalism, whose family was displaced from home in Southern California due to the wildfires. Because of the many different topics in the broadcast, Schanzer has an interesting approach in how she books the coverage with what she calls a colors document, where each element of coverage has its own color. I like to look at it from a broad perspective to make sure theres not too much of one color in one area, and every color is kind of represented across the show so that if youre watching it, youre getting a little bit of a taste of everything, she said. One color could be a fashion element, one could be Kornackis insights, one could be an interview with a horseman. I try to look at it in a holistic way like that. The approach has certainly worked. Last years broadcast averaged 16.7 million viewers, the largest Derby audience since 1989. That included an average minute audience of 714,000 streaming on Peacock. Overall, 11 of the past 15 Derbies held in May have averaged at least 15 million. Weve had all kinds of things happen (since 2001), and thats whats so unique about the sport, but specifically about the Derby, said Jon Miller, NBC Sports president of acquisitions and partnerships. You have 20 horses that come into that gate and long shots that can pull off the upset. You have favorites, you have great ownership stories, and you have legendary trainers. Who knows who is going to surprise this year? But thats whats great about it. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing and Derby coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/kentucky-derby",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-derby-nbc-508a06d1146194b19f6cdd502a14305c,sports

Transgender women banned from womens cricket in England and Wales,"LONDON (AP)  Transgender women are to be banned outright from womens and girls cricket in England and Wales. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said Friday it had updated its previous restrictions following a U.K. Supreme Court ruling last month. With immediate effect, only those whose biological sex is female will be eligible to play in womens cricket and girls cricket matches, the ECB said Friday. Transgender women and girls can continue playing in open and mixed cricket. The announcement comes a day after transgender athletes were banned from playing on womens soccer teams in England and Scotland by the Football Association. Transgender women were already banned from the top two tiers of elite womens cricket from the start of this year but had been permitted to compete in the womens game at lower levels including recreational cricket.  No longer. The U.K.s highest court issued a ruling two weeks ago that defined a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female. The head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said after the ruling that transgender women would be excluded from womens toilets, hospital wards and sports teams. While the ruling was cheered by some feminist groups, it has been condemned by trans-rights groups who said it would have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life. The issue has been polarizing in the U.K. and beyond, particularly in the United States, where President Donald Trump has signed executive orders to prohibit participation of transgender athletes in sports and to use a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are being challenged in court. Fiona McAnena, director of campaigns at Sex Matters charity, said: The ECBs two-tier policy was never coherent. Restricting the top end of the womens game to female-only showed that it understood mens size and strength confer an unfair advantage in womens sport. But protecting around 300 women in England and Wales while leaving the other 33,000 female cricketers to face male bowling and batting was indefensible. A spokesperson for Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ charity, said: The recent decisions of sporting bodies to ban trans women from womens sport have been made too soon, before the implications of the Supreme Courts ruling have been worked through by lawyers and politicians or before statutory guidance has been issued. It is very disappointing as several of them have been long term and vocal supporters of our Rainbow Laces campaign, advocating for inclusion in sport for all ages and at all levels. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/cricket-transgender-ban-england-06dd07e6568f086fcb0698cca339666a,sports
"Kentucky Derby field reduced to 19 with scratch of Grande, leaving owner Mike Repole shocked","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  Grande has been scratched from the Kentucky Derby, reducing the field for Saturdays 151st edition to 19 horses. He joins Rodriguez on the sidelines after that colt was scratched on Thursday. Unfortunately, the vets have decided to scratch Grande, owner Mike Repole posted Friday on X. He has been battling a slight cracked heel this week which has been improving. Repole said various diagnostic tests on Grande came back clean, including a PET scan requested by Kentucky state veterinarians. He said the 3-year-old colt had been training and looking great on the track all week. We were very confused with all the clean diagnostics and improvement all week, why they rushed to judgment to scratch today, Repole wrote. We are also shocked and confused why this decision was made now. We were given no real explanation why Grande was scratched 36 hours before the race. Repole has had this happen twice before. In 2011, Uncle Mo was scratched the day before the race because of a gastrointestinal infection. In 2023, Forte was scratched the morning of the race due to a bruised right front foot. The self-made billionaire from New York is 0-for-8 in the Derby. We all love these horses and our number one concern is the safety and welfare of these amazing Thoroughbreds. That is, and should always be the priority, Repole wrote. With all the diagnostics we have taken, the great vets we use, and the experience of Hall of Fame trainer Todd Pletcher, we are baffled and confused by what criteria vets are using to determine who scratches, who doesnt and whenespecially when every diagnostic tells us the horse is safe and sound. 
        
     Rodriguezs scratch moved Baeza into the field. He was the only horse on the also-eligible list, so there will be no replacement for Grande. Grande was the lone runner for two-time Derby-winning trainer Pletcher and was to be ridden by Hall of Famer John Velazquez. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-derby-churchill-downs-grande-ff28c73afdabcbb0682234ee44c3e1fe,sports

Yankees second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. expected to miss 4-to-6 weeks with strained right oblique,"NEW YORK (AP)  Yankees second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. is expected to miss four-to-six weeks because of a strained right oblique. Chisholm was placed on the 10-day injured list Friday, three days after getting hurt during a swing in a game at the Baltimore Orioles. Manager Aaron Boone said Chisholm has a high-grade strain. I actually just was talking a couple of minutes ago to him he even said he couldnt believe it. So well see, Boone said before a series opener against Tampa Bay. I think its going to be some time. In his mind its going to be real quick but I think its going to be a while, but well just see how he heals up. Chisholm grabbed at his side after fouling off a first pitch from Kyle Gibson during the first inning, took a ball and then stepped out of the batters box to stretch the side, prompting Boone and an athletic trainer to come out and speak with him. Chisholm remained in the game, doubled into the right-field corner on the next pitch and when the ball was bobbled headed to third and slid in headfirst. He appeared in discomfort and immediately left the game for a pinch runner. Thats kind of why the number is four to six weeks, Boone said. That being said, Jazz, his history is he is quick healer, so well see, but thats kind of the easy diagnosis. Chisholms roster move was retroactive to Wednesday, and the Yankees recalled infielder Jorbit Vivas from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. 
        
     Acquired from Miami last July 27, Chisholm is hitting .181 with seven homers and 17 RBIs in 30 games. He was sidelined between Aug. 12 and 23 last year because of a sprained left elbow sustained on a headfirst slide. Vivas batted ninth in his major league debut, drew two walks and played second base. He hit .319 with two homers and 15 RBIs in 26 games at Triple-A. DJ LeMahieu went 1 for 3 with a walk and played seven innings at second base in a rehab game Friday for Double-A Somerset after a cortisone injection to treat discomfort in his hip earlier this week. LeMahieu has not played for the Yankees since straining his left calf in his spring training debut on March 1. He played four rehab games for Double-A Somerset from April 22-27 before the injection. I think a couple of days down was him being very proactive and like we got the make sure we get this right, Boone said. Its good that hes back playing. Boone said LeMahieu, if he recovers, could be an option at second while Chisholm is sidelined. Giancarlo Stanton, who was moved to the 60-day injured list Thursday, could soon face pitchers. Boone said Stanton may face rehabbing reliever Jake Cousins (right elbow flexor strain) next week. Still more of the same, like going through his running progression, doing high-speed stuff with the hitting, Boone said. He might hit live this week, I think early next week. I think Cousins has a live and G could be in that potentially. Stanton took swings on the field on April 22 in Cleveland, his first on-field hitting since being disagnosed with tendinitis that has shut him down before since spring training. Clayton Beeter, recovering from right shoulder impingement syndrome, had his rehab moved to Double-A Somerset. Beeter has an 8.10 ERA in three rehab appearances between Somerset and Class A Tampa. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/chisholm-oblique-yankees-9a8eb0eb3ca39ffe55821185894a0b13,sports
This Date in Baseball - Carl Crawford tied a major league record with six stolen bases in a game,"May 3 1927  Brooklyns Jesse Barnes defeated his brother Virgil Barnes for a 7-6 victory over the New York Giants. It was the first matchup of pitching brothers in major league history. 1936  Joe DiMaggio made his major league debut for the New York Yankees and had three hits in a 14-5 victory over the St. Louis Browns. 1951  Rookie Gil McDougald of New York drove in six runs in one inning to tie a major league record as the Yankees beat the St. Louis Browns 17-3 at Sportsmans Park. McDougald had a two-run triple and a grand slam in an 11-run ninth inning. 1959  Detroits Charlie Maxwell hit four consecutive homers in a doubleheader sweep of the New York Yankees, 4-2 and 8-2, at Briggs Stadium. 1963  Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds hits his first major league home run off St. Louis Cardinals ace Ernie Broglio. 1975  Cincinnati Reds manager Sparky Anderson decides to switch Pete Rose from left field to third base. 1979  Clevelands Bobby Bonds hit the 300th home run of his career against Moose Haas in a 6-1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Bonds, with 413 stolen bases at the time, became the second player to have 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases, joining Willie Mays. 1980  Ferguson Jenkins of the Texas Rangers became the fourth pitcher in major league history to win 100 or more games in each league. Jenkins beat the Baltimore Orioles 3-2 at Arlington Stadium. Cy Young, Jim Bunning and Gaylord Perry also reached the milestone. 
        
     1980  Willie McCovey of the San Francisco Giants hits his 521st and final career home run against Scott Sanderson of the Montreal Expos, helping the Giants to a 3-2 win. His shot ties him with Ted Williams on the all-time list. McCovey will enter the Hall of Fame in 1986. 1992  Baltimore closer Gregg Olson, age 25, became the youngest pitcher in major league history to record 100 saves. 1994  Philadelphia reliever Andy Carter made his major league debut and was ejected from the game after hitting two of three San Diego Padres batters he faced. 1998  Dan Wilson of the Seattle Mariners hits the first inside-the-park grand slam in the franchises history. 1999  Bostons Creighton Gubanich hit a grand slam for his first major league hit in a 12-11, 10-inning loss to Oakland. Gubanich became the fourth player to accomplish the feat and the first since Seattles Orlando Mercado did it Sept. 19, 1982. Bill Duggleby (1898 - Phillies) and Bobby Bonds (1968 - Giants) were the others. 1999  Jeff Kent of the San Francisco Giants went 5-for-5 and hit for the cycle in a 9-8 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. 2001  Johnny Oates resigns as the Texas Rangers manager and will be replaced by the teams third base coach Jerry Narron. A poor start of 11-17 due to a lack of pitching, and owner Tom Hickss high expectations after signing prized free agent Alex Rodriguez, had led to speculation the Texas skipper would soon be fired. 2009  Carl Crawford tied a modern major league record with six stolen bases to help Tampa Bay beat Boston 5-3. Crawford was 4-for-4 with an RBI and became the fourth player to swipe six bases in a game, joining Eddie Collins (twice), Otis Nixon, and Eric Young. 2011  Francisco Liriano pitched the major leagues first no-hitter of the season, throwing his first career complete game in Minnesotas 1-0 victory over Chicago.

Uncapped Cook and Cox in England cricket squad for Zimbabwe test,"LONDON (AP)  Uncapped Essex pair Sam Cook and Jordan Cox were included in the England squad for the one-off cricket test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, starting May 22. Cook, a skillful seamer, was named in the 13-man squad on Friday, along with hard-hitting batter Cox who was set for a test debut in New Zealand before Christmas only to miss out when he broke his thumb in the nets. The 27-year-old Cook has 318 first-class wickets in 88 games, with an average of 19.77, but has previously found himself leapfrogged by a succession of quicker bowlers. With James Anderson and Stuart Broad retired and Chris Woakes yet to play this season through injury, there is a vacancy for a swing and seam specialist with more modest pace. Cook performed impressively on England Lions tour of Australia in January, taking 13 wickets in three games. England captain Ben Stokes has yet to play this season for Durham as he recovers from a badly torn hamstring, but it is unclear how much bowling he will be able to do. Stokes team will be heavy favorites in the four-day match against Zimbabwe, which is playing its first test in England since 2003, Highlights of all Englands home international matches will continue to be shown by the BBC, as well as eight live double-headers in the Hundred, after the broadcaster renewed its deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board for another four years. ___ England squad: Ben Stokes (captain), Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, Harry Brook, Sam Cook, Jordan Cox, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Josh Tongue. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/cricket-england-squad-zimbabwe-test-da5193a02d45a4d5a98eab00cd98ca69,sports
"With help from painkillers, Ruud beats Cerundolo to reach Madrid Open final against Draper","MADRID (AP)  With the help of painkillers, Casper Ruud overcame a rib ailment to defeat Francisco Cerundolo in straight sets and reach the Madrid Open final on Friday. Ruud will face Jack Draper, who beat Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (4) in the other semifinal to make his third final of the year. Ruud received treatment on his rib three games into the match and went on to win 6-4, 7-5 on the Caja Magica center court. The 15th-ranked Norwegian saved 15 of the 18 break points he faced against the 21st-ranked Argentine. Ruud said he felt something in his rib during the warmup, just before going out on the court. He said he felt it in nearly every shot, especially the serve. I wasnt sure I was going to be able to finish the match, honestly, Ruud said. I got a couple of painkillers, which is not the ideal thing, but at the same time in a situation like this, you have to do that now and then. It was easing and getting better as the match went on. A former world No. 2, Ruud will return to the top 10 thanks to his campaign in Madrid. He could reach No. 6 in the rankings with a win in the final. Ruud  a 12-time tour champion  would also become the first Norwegian to lift an ATP 1000 trophy since the series was introduced in 1990, according to the ATP. Ruud had lost two matches in a row against Cerundolo, who knocked out top-seeded Alexander Zverev earlier. 
        
     The sixth-ranked Draper improved his record against 11th-ranked Musetti to 4-0. Draper won at Indian Wells in March. After his quarterfinal victory in Madrid, he secured a top-five debut in the rankings. I felt like both of us, our quality didnt really drop from the first ball, Draper said. Credit to Lorenzo, hes obviously playing so good on the clay. I played him on hard, and on grass when we were juniors, growing up with him. But on clay, hes a different beast, so to get this win on this court in this stage, semifinals, it means so much to me. Draper, who hasnt lost a set on his way to the final, said this time his mom brought him some extra luck.  Seems like every match shes come to Ive been terrible. So I was thinking when she said she was going to come yesterday I was like, Oh, Im not sure if you should come, he said. But no, she ended up coming, and glad she did, because tonight was a really good performance, and maybe her lucks changed when she comes to watch me play, so well see.

"NCAA, Iowa State negotiate sports betting discipline for 5 football support staffers","The NCAA has taken disciplinary action against five current or former Iowa State football support staff members for combining to make more than 6,200 online bets totaling more than $100,000 on professional and college games, including mens and womens basketball games involving the Cyclones. The five were identified during a state investigation into sports wagering activities in campus athletic facilities from 2021-23. They face no criminal charges. In a negotiated resolution finalized last week, Jace Heacock, Chase Clark, Michael Dryer, Kyle Highland and Mason Williams acknowledged they knowingly violated NCAA sports wagering bylaws and all are subject to a one-year show-cause order through April 24, 2026. Any of the five hired by another schools athletic department will be required to attend the annual NCAA Regional Rules Seminar at his own expense and serve a two-week suspension during the show-cause period. Iowa States athletic department declined to comment on the case Friday. The NCAA classified the violations as Level II for the individuals involved, meaning the breaches could compromise the integrity of the NCAA collegiate model. Heacock, son of defensive coordinator Jon Heacock, was a football graduate assistant in 2021 and 2022. He was hired back as director of football analytics April 24. His biography on ISUs athletic website did not mention where, or if, he worked in 2023 and 2024. He was found to have placed 787 bets totaling about $55,359. 
        
     Clark, former assistant director of football equipment operations, placed 2,305 bets totaling about $18,676, including 46 bets on ISU mens and womens basketball. He now is an assistant equipment manager for the Detroit Lions. Dryer, former assistant of equipment operations, placed 1,182 bets totaling about $11,536, including 25 bets on ISU mens and womens basketball. His LinkedIn page indicated he worked in sales for a sporting goods company after he left Iowa State. Highland, former football recruiting operations assistant, placed 509 bets totaling about $6,365, including eight bets on ISU mens and womens basketball. He now is Armys assistant director of football operations. Williams, former associate for athletics equipment operations, placed 1,455 bets totaling about $11,679, including 12 bets on ISU mens and womens basketball. The state Department of Criminal Investigation turned over the names of the five men to Iowa State officials as part of its investigation into underage online sports wagering at colleges in the state. Dozens of athletes at Iowa and Iowa State were caught in the sting and charged with, among other things, underage gambling and identity theft.  Many of the athletes pleaded guilty and paid a fine; charges were dismissed against others. More than three dozen athletes have joined in a civil lawsuit against the DCI, alleging the agency violated their rights and smeared their reputations. ___ This story has been corrected to remove an incorrect workplace for Williams. ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/iowa-state-gambling-7a65c605d6f1faf95a3696b2701cc88d,sports
Titan Donnarumma saves the day for PSG again in the Champions League,"LONDON (AP)  Gianluigi Donnarumma was hailed as a titan by Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique after producing some brilliant saves against Arsenal to ensure his team took a lead into the second leg of their Champions League semifinal next week. The Italy goalkeeper continued his impressive form in the knockout stage by pulling off two one-handed stops low down to his left, first to deny Gabriel Martinelli and then Leandro Trossard, and preserve PSGs clean sheet in a 1-0 win Tuesday. Previously this campaign, Donnarumma was PSGs star in a last-16 win over Liverpool with two saves in a penalty shootout at Anfield, while a series of great saves in the second half of the second leg against Aston Villa allowed the French champion to squeeze through the quarterfinals. Luis Enrique rarely veers away from his praise for the collective but the Spanish coach let that mantra slip a touch after the Arsenal game. I really want to underline the work of 14 or 15 players, he said. Obviously there were some players that shone a bit more than others and when youre playing away against a team thats so good at set pieces, you need a titan in goal. Actually, it was at a set piece that Donnarumma  occasionally weak under the high ball  made his one error of the night against Arsenal. He chose to come off his line in an attempt to get to the ball as Declan Rice swung in a free kick early in the second half, but then changed his mind and found himself stranded as Mikel Merino headed into an empty net. 
        
     Donnarumma was, however, bailed out by a video review that spotted Merino was offside. Otherwise, the 26-year-old Italian  still bearing the scar on his right cheek from a nasty injury sustained against Monaco in the French league in December  was a reassuring presence, with his agility to tip aside Trossards left-footed shot particularly outstanding. He made the saves like he did against Liverpool and Villa, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said, and thats the difference in the Champions League. Indeed, theres something about playing in England that seems to inspire Donnarumma. The 1.96-meters goalkeeper might never top those penalty-shootout saves against England in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley Stadium that helped Italy win the European Championship for the first time four years ago. At club level, however, he is proving a key reason why PSG might be ready to win the Champions League for the first time. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/donnarumma-psg-arsenal-champions-league-353eba07bab3f9e42c4d387e83f71bc5,sports
Corporate box owners in Mexico are still uncertain about their properties for the 2026 World Cup,"MEXICO CITY (AP)  A corporate box owner at the iconic Azteca stadium filed a complaint with Mexicos consumer protection agency Tuesday seeking clarity over his use of the seating for the 2026 World Cup.  The stadium, recently renamed Banorte ahead of next years tournament, has been closed for renovations since May of last year.  FIFA wants full control of the World Cup stadiums from 30 days before the first match until seven days after the last. Its unclear what that means for the owners of the luxury seating.  The consumer wants to know if his rights to use his box during the World Cup are going to be upheld, said Angel Diego, a lawyer representing one of the luxury box owners who asked to remain anonymous. We are inviting the company that owns the stadium to express clearly what their intentions are. The history of how the boxes were purchased makes things complicated. To help finance the construction of the stadium in the 1960s, Mexican businessman Emilio Azcrraga Milmo sold luxury boxes to private investors for 115,000 pesos, or about $9,000 at the time, giving the owners rights to use them for 99 years. That included access to soccer matches, concerts and other events, including the 1970 and 1986 World Cups in Mexico. But for the 2026 World Cup, the stadium owners are asking the luxury box owners to relinquish their access.  There is only one solution and that is that they respect our contract. The World Cup is 408 days ahead. We have plenty of time to work this out, said Roberto Ruano, a spokesman for the association of 134 box owners. It is not a request; we have the right to use them. 
        
     The 83,000-seat stadium will host five games during the 2026 World Cup, including the tournament opener. The owners of the stadium, a company related to Televisa, Mexicos largest television network, have released images of work done on the pitch and the lower seats, but the corporate boxes apparently havent been touched. Ruano, whose father bought the title for a luxury box, said the box owners have been talking with stadium officials for about a year but havent reached a resolution. For the moment we are not going to do anything because we are still in amicable discussions with the stadium and we do not want to break them, Ruano added. The doors are open, the dialog has not been interrupted. Last week, stadium officials said that a solution to the conflict was close, but didnt provide more specifics. Ruano says that some box owners outside of his association have agreed to release their seats for the 2026 tournament in exchange for upgrades and other benefits, including tickets, but he doesnt want that. My box belongs to me, we have a designated space already and that is what we want, Ruano said. We are going to give them more time to try to fix this before doing something else. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/azteca-stadium-world-cup-box-fifa-9175d2a22234233b4e48ca6c4058d216,sports
Dembele downplays injury concerns after scoring in PSGs Champions League win at Arsenal,"LONDON (AP)  Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembele didnt seem too worried about a minor injury he sustained after scoring in Tuesdays 1-0 win over Arsenal in the Champions League semifinals.  Dembele scored in the fourth minute but then had to leave the field in the 70th with an apparent hamstring problem.  PSG coach Luis Enrique later said the injury was nothing serious, its something very minor.  And Dembele himself also downplayed the situation, French newspaper LEquipe reported. I felt a little something, but its OK, LEquipe quoted Dembele as saying before boarding the team bus.  Luis Enrique said the forward would undergo further tests on Wednesday.

How a fighter pilots mental techniques helped tiny Bod/Glimt reach the Europa League semifinals,"How did an unheralded Norwegian team from a tiny town north of the Arctic Circle become one of the fairy-tale stories of European soccer?  For Bod/Glimt, the transformation has been underpinned by a fighter pilot who developed mental techniques for his squadron before bombing missions in Libya. Bjrn Mannsverk discovered a group of players exuding negative energy and prone to a collective mental breakdown when he was asked in early 2017 to join the backroom staff of a team that had just been relegated to Norways second tier. His task as mental coach at Bod/Glimt? To make players talk openly about their feelings, lower stress levels, change their attitudes and routines about things like preparation and nutrition, and remove the stigma around mental training. Winning or losing no longer mattered. It was all about following a philosophy and culture established by Mannsverk, a former Royal Norwegian air force squadron leader whose military duties took him to Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks and to Libya for a NATO-led intervention in 2011. The results have been extraordinary. After securing an immediate return to Norways top division, the team  based more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Oslo in a fishing town, Bod, with a population of around 55,000  has captured four of the countrys last five league titles. It started in 2020 with a first in the history of a club founded in 1916. Bod/Glimt has also had some big results in Europe in recent seasons  a 6-1 thrashing of Jose Mourinhos Roma in the Conference League 2021 stands out  and this year it has become the first Norwegian club to reach the semifinals of a major European competition. 
        
     The first leg against Tottenham in the Europa League takes place in London on Thursday. Its Bod/Glimts biggest ever match. It is a fairy tale, almost a miracle, Mannsverk told The Associated Press in a video interview. How can you actually come from (Norways) second division in 2017 to playing a Champions League playoff and teams like Arsenal five years later? But I think its possible ... if you have the right mentality and you work hard over time. An active air force pilot for more than 20 years, Mannsverk and others in his squadron were the subjects of a mental training project in 2010 where the focus was on meditation and every day repeating boring stuff, but with 100% attention. It meant that when he was in Libya the following year, he had the mental capacity to handle the dangerous missions he was asked to perform. His squadrons mantra  train as you intend to fight  worked. Even though I got strong feelings when my first bombs hit the target and it was in infernal flames and fragments and everything, he said, it was like, My training said that its OK, this is happening, recognize that, but know I have to return and do my job. With Bod until recently having a NATO air base, it was simply a happy coincidence that Bod/Glimts leadership came across members of the squadron at the same time as it was seeking a silver bullet  as Mannsverk put it  to improve the teams mental conditioning. A project was born and fully embraced by manager Kjetil Knutsen following his appointment in 2018.  Bod/Glimt has never looked back. Mannsverks fingerprints are all over the teams behavior, though he acknowledges there has been such a buy-in by the players that they now take decisions by themselves. Like having a rotating cast of eight captains to share leadership duties. Like when the players gather into a circle  Mannsverk calls it the Bod/Glimt Ring  after conceding a goal to discuss what happened and maintain solidarity. Like the players having no specific targets, apart from being the best version of themselves. Inge Henning Andersen, Bod/Glimts chairman, told the AP that midfielder Ulrik Saltnes considered retiring because he used to suffer from stress-related stomach issues that flared up around matches. Saltnes opened up about his problems to Mannsverk and finally found a way out of it, Andersen said. The team plays at an intensity that far exceeds its rivals, which players attribute to Mannsverk. I dont think it would be possible to play like that without Bjrn and the mental work we do, Saltnes once told the BBC. Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou has come up against Bod/Glimt twice before, losing on both occasions when in charge of Celtic in the Conference League in 2022, and he gave a nod to his opponents mental fortitude when asked about its strengths. They have a real clear identity in the way they play, the Australian coach said Wednesday. I think theyve created a real resilience in the group, a mental resilience that irrespective of who they play, whether thats in the Norwegian league or the Champions League qualifiers or the Europa or Conference League, they treat every opponent the same. This seasons Europa League campaign is giving Bod/Glimt widespread attention, notably for its location. The teams Aspmyra stadium  with a capacity of less than 9,000  is one of the most northernly in world soccer at 67 degrees latitude. Tourists have long come to the town on the tip of Norways west coast because it is a good spot to see the northern lights. Bod, named the European Capital of Culture in 2024, has less than an hour of sunlight during its shortest days, meaning players take supplements to combat a lack of sunlight. It can be bitterly cold and windy in the long winters, making for tough trips for opponents from other countries. On paper, Tottenham, one of the worlds richest clubs, starts as a huge favorite against Bod/Glimt. The likely crowd of nearly 63,000 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for Thursdays match will be bigger than Bod's population. Youd love us to think that  that youre a small club and we dont rate (you), a smiling Postecoglou replied to a leading question from a Norwegian reporter at the pre-match news conference. The English club is having one of its worst seasons in a generation and currently lies 16th in the 20-team Premier League. It gives Bod/Glimt a realistic shot at an upset, like it produced when getting past Italian team Lazio in the quarterfinals. Its another chance, then, for the club to write another amazing chapter in its remarkable journey. We like to tell our story, Mannsverk said. The philosophy is a good thing. We know its difficult in football, where theres so much money involved, to give a coach or a team the time. And it takes time to change and drill in the mentality. This was not done overnight ... but Im totally convinced that it will work more or less all over. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/bodo-glimt-tottenham-europa-league-b14c934fc14f54402264ae286cf33b2d,sports
"Josh Berry races to 1st Cup Series victory, gives Wood Brothers 101st win with Las Vegas score","LAS VEGAS (AP)  Josh Berry spent much of his career content as a journeyman racer who probably would never make it beyond the local short-track scene.  When he got a break in NASCAR  Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt Jr. has believed in Berry for years  he made the most of it by winning five Xfinity Series races for JR Motorsports. That led to a shot in the Cup Series, then a full-time job last year with Stewart-Haas Racing.  But when SHR decided to shutter at the end of last season, Berry was dumped into the free agent market and immediately grabbed by Wood Brothers Racing. In his fifth race with his new team, Berry scored the first Cup Series victory of his career by taking NASCARs oldest team to victory lane Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.  Im just thankful to be in the situation I am driving fast race cars, Berry said. With my experience on the short tracks, you think thats where youre going to win. But if Ive learned anything in this sport it is that you never know when its going to be your day. Berry, driving the famed No. 21, had the first victory for a Ford team through five races this season. William Byron opened the year with a Daytona 500 victory in a Chevrolet and Christopher Bell in a Toyota won the next three races.  Berry, meanwhile, had to run down Daniel Suarez following a restart with 19 laps remaining to take control. Although Harrison Burton won at Daytona last summer for the Wood Brothers, Berrys victory is the first not at a superspeedway since Ryan Blaney won for the team in 2017 at Pocono. 
        
     This one was legit, team president Jon Wood said. You know sometimes theyll put an asterisk besides a speedway race and say Well, its speedway racing. But (Berry) dominated those last 20 laps. The Wood Brothers are celebrating their 75th season in NASCAR. Everybody with Wood Brothers Racing gave me a great car and we just battled and battled, and man, it was our day, Berry said. I just cant believe it. It was such a battle with Daniel there at the end. Beating and banging at a mile-and-a-half (track) is crazy. But whoever was going to get out front was probably going to win. It was the 101st victory for the organization spanning 20 drivers.  Suarez in a Chevrolet for Trackhouse Racing finished second. Definitely a little disappointed, but congratulations to the 21 team and Josh. They did a great job, said Suarez. Theyve been fast lately. Theyve been in contention. So congratulations to them. Ryan Preece was third in a Ford for RFK Racing. Byron was fourth for Hendrick Motorsports, followed by Ross Chastain of Trackhouse, Austin Cindric of Team Penske and Alex Bowman of Hendrick.  AJ Allmendinger of Kaulig Racing was eighth and Hendrick drivers Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott rounded out the top 10. Seven Chevy drivers finished in the top 10.  Joey Logano had late control of the race until Las Vegas native Noah Gragson hit the wall with 25 laps remaining to bring out the ninth caution of the race. Berry was in second when the caution came out and second behind Suarez on the restart. Berry won in his 53rd Cup race and just his fifth race with the Wood Brothers. The 34-year-old Tennessee driver was a 40-1 underdog to win Sunday and his win put the Wood Brothers back into the playoffs for a second consecutive season. The team has a tight alliance with Team Penske, which has input in who drives the No. 21.  Bell came to Las Vegas on a three-race winning streak with an opportunity to become the first driver since Jimmie Johnson in 2007 to win four consecutive Cup races.  But his chance to extend his streak was stymied when Joe Gibbs Racing had to change the throttle body on the No. 20 Toyota after Bell qualified 13th and the penalty dropped him to the back of the field for the start of the race.  He never recovered in what was an overall subpar day for the four-driver JGR contingent.  Bell, who complained about the handling of his car most of the race, finished a team-high 12th. Only eight drivers have won four straight Cup races in the modern era of NASCAR that began in 1972.  I dont know. Its fine. It was a grind, for sure, Bell said. I dont really know how I feel yet, but we certainly didnt do what we did the last couple of weeks and that was just have a nice clean race. Chase Briscoe was 17th and Ty Gibbs, who rolled a sprint car Saturday night at the dirt track at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, finished 22nd. Denny Hamlin, winner of more than $200,000 over two nights of playing slots in a Las Vegas casino, couldnt convert his luck to the track and finished 25th.  The Cup Series races next Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway, a track that had been in the playoff rotation the last three years but has now been moved to a spring race. Tyler Reddick won last October and Bell won in 2023.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-las-vegas-bell-7f381d67e2181a0278ab18b5ad9c164a,sports
"In NASCAR antitrust fight, Michael Jordans manager goes from adviser to stock car series to target","LAS VEGAS (AP)  Long before the battle over the charter system led to the antitrust lawsuit now engulfing NASCAR, its executives found Michael Jordan and his small group of advisers a beneficial resource in discussing growth for the top racing series in the United States.  They held meetings with Curtis Polk, Jordans right-hand man, to go over best practices and other areas that could be improved.  That was when Jordan still owned the NBAs Charlotte Hornets. Now he owns a NASCAR team, and 23XI Racing  along with Front Row Motorsports  is suing the stock car series over alleged antitrust violations.  Caught in the crosshairs is Polk, who was singled out in NASCARs countersuit as the mastermind for a near mutiny by the race teams over revenue sharing. The countersuit NASCAR filed earlier this month wrongly called Jordans longtime business manager and partner a sports agent and repeatedly singled out Polk as the ringleader against the current charter agreements signed last fall by most Cup Series teams. NASCAR also claimed Polk threatened a boycott of the Daytona 500 qualifying races and persuaded teams to boycott a meeting with NASCAR.  The teams signed the charters just before last seasons playoffs after a take-it-or-leave-it offer by NASCAR. Although the charter system remains flawed  teams want them made permanent like a franchise in other major sports  it does guarantee a spot in the field and other revenue incentives. Thirteen teams signed but 23XI and Front Row held out  in large part because of a clause in the charter that prohibits teams from suing NASCAR  and since both teams didnt like the terms, they wanted the right to sue over antitrust allegations. And now we are here: Counterclaims, warnings that a 23XI court victory could cause NASCAR to disband the entire charter system, a December trial date and a full-throated attack against Polk. 
        
     I dont think Mr. Polk really understands the sport, NASCAR attorney Christopher Yates told The Associated Press. I think he came into it and his view is it should be much more like the NBA or other league sports. But its not. No motorsport is like that. Hes done a lot of things that might work in the NBA or might be OK in the NBA but just are not appropriate in NASCAR. Jordan, through a spokeswoman, wanted it known that he and Polk are in lockstep and everything Polk has done represents the NBA icon. Polk owns a piece of 23XI alongside Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin. Curtis and MJ stand united. His perspective is if you are coming after Curtis, you are coming after him, said the spokeswoman. He doesnt look at this as just business. Its personal. Hamlin also took exception to Yates comments. Thats like saying a chef doesnt know how to cook. Hes built Michael Jordans empire for the last 30 years. The guy knows the business, Hamlin said. Curtis has just been fantastic for our team and certainly a pioneer, I believe, and a trailblazer for new ideas that our team uses every single time we hit the racetrack and how we do business. Many team executives at Las Vegas Motor Speedway over the weekend declined to speak on the record about NASCARs attack on Polk. Some say they believe NASCARs warning that if 23XI is successful in court, the charters will be disbanded. Others say NASCAR just wants scared teams to reason with 23XI, but disbanding the charter system is an empty threat because they are existing seven-year contracts between NASCAR and 13 organizations representing 30 cars. NASCAR said Monday it doesnt want to disband the charter system, and referred to Yates statement on the counterclaim that the 23XI lawsuit opens up a Pandoras box and calls into question whether the charter system will continue. NASCAR Hall of Fame car owner Richard Childress did defend Polk, who was chosen as a negotiator by the Race Team Alliance in the charter extension talks. Curtis hadnt did anything that anyone else hadnt did, Childress said. He didnt do nothing that everybody else on the RTA did and thats all I will say. Curtis didnt do anything to anybody and thats the quote.  Although he did start as an agent, Polk has advised Jordan since 1989 and manages Jordans financial and business affairs, family office and related companies. Polk was part of the Hornets ownership group, was the managing partner of Hornets Sports & Entertainment and an alternate governor on the NBAs Board of Governors. Polk advised Jordan during the launch of Nikes Jordan Brand in 1997 and was an executive producer of The Last Dance, the award-winning docuseries chronicling the Chicago Bulls and Jordans NBA rise. Polk has also managed the financial affairs of numerous sports stars; in 1996, Polk negotiated four of the five highest contracts in NBA history at that time.  So, yes, NASCAR is correct in that his background is not in motorsports. Thats apparently the biggest problem and a familiar one in NASCAR: A decade ago, co-founder Rob Kauffman of Fortress Investment Group bailed out Michael Waltrip Racing and pushed for the RTA and the initial charter system that debuted in 2016.  Kauffman, always considered an outsider to NASCAR, is no longer an active team owner.  Like Kauffman, NASCAR doesnt appear to view Polk as one of the good ol boys simply satisfied by the adrenaline rush of bumping and banging race cars 38 weekends per year. Like Kauffman, he wants to understand why the France family-owned series allegedly monopolizes the support.  Many team executives blanched when asked their opinion on Polk and the role he played in charter negotiations, clearly not interested in landing in NASCARs crosshairs.  Curtis is a smart guy. Hes a really smart guy, was all Joe Gibbs Racing President Dave Alpern, a member of the RTA negotiating committee, would say to AP.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-antitrust-lawsuit-9cc1f778f63e357cbba1f274eb98a2f7,sports
"McLaren has ominous pace, Lewis Hamilton has work to do: 5 takeaways from F1s season-opener","Lando Norris heads to the second round of the Formula 1 season in China with a lead over champion Max Verstappen after winning a thrilling race in Australia.  Ahead of Sundays race in Shanghai, here are five takeaways from the season-opening Australian Grand Prix: Without the rain and the safety car, the Australian Grand Prix might not have been much of a contest. The two McLarens of Norris and Oscar Piastri quickly built a lead of more than 15 seconds to Verstappen in third early in the race. The McLarens were also three-tenths of a second faster than anyone else in qualifying. So much for preseason predictions that this year could be exceptionally close between multiple teams. Norris acknowledged McLaren are favorites but warned the team shouldnt get complacent. If you start thinking things are good and groovy, thats when you get caught, he said. We will have races where we struggle. Lewis Hamilton briefly led on his Ferrari debut. Unfortunately for the seven-time champion, a strategy blunder meant Ferrari left Hamilton and his new teammate Charles Leclerc on dry tires in increasingly heavy rain. Missed a big opportunity, Hamilton told Ferrari over the radio. Hamilton finished 10th, two places behind Leclerc. Hamilton and Ferrari may need to work on their communication. After more than a decade working with Peter Bono Bonnington at Mercedes, Hamilton was frustrated at regular radio updates from his new engineer Riccardo Adami. Leave me to it, please, he said repeatedly.  
        
     No one expected Liam Lawson, in his 12th career F1 race, to beat his four-time champion teammate Verstappen. However, Lawson also underperformed compared to Yuki Tsunoda, his old teammate, after being picked over Tsunoda for the Red Bull seat. Lawson qualified 18th and made little progress before crashing out. Tsunoda qualified fifth and was competitive, though a team strategy error meant he finished 12th. If Lawson doesnt improve, Red Bull could face even more scrutiny of its decision to pick him. Formula 1s biggest rookie class in years struggled  with one big exception. The 18-year-old Andrea Kimi Antonelli became the second-youngest driver ever to score F1 points, behind only Verstappen, as he finished fourth with a strong drive from 16th.  Of the other drivers starting their first full F1 seasons, Lawson, Saubers Gabriel Bortoleto and Alpines Jack Doohan crashed out, Racing Bulls Isack Hadjar crashed before the start and Haas Oliver Bearman was the last finisher in 14th.  Alex Albon benefited from his new teammate as he finished fifth for Williams best result since 2021. Carlos Sainz, Jr. crashed out early but joined the team staff on the pit wall to offer Albon advice over the radio on how best to handle the rapidly changing weather. Were a very bonded team, Albon said.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-lewis-hamilton-liam-lawson-mclaren-60bc062ab8180c5783f0baad8a257343,sports
F1 teams face tougher tests to stop flexible rear wings which could give an advantage,"PARIS (AP)  Formula 1s governing body will use stricter tests starting at this weeks Chinese Grand Prix to stop teams using rear wings which could potentially bend at speed to give a pace advantage. The FIA said on Monday it took the decision after viewing footage filmed in practice sessions for last weeks season-opening Australian Grand Prix. A flexible wing which bends backward under air resistance at high speed could offer an advantage by reducing the effect of drag on a car. Having analyzed footage from the rear wing deformations combined to the static deflections measured inside the FIA garage in Melbourne, the FIA has concluded that sufficient grounds exist for a tougher test to be introduced from the forthcoming Chinese Grand Prix on the upper rear wing, the FIA said in a statement on social media. The FIA had already tightened the rules on rear wings once before this season. All cars at the Australian GP were deemed fully legal after passing the tests in use at the time, the FIA said. McLaren previously faced scrutiny last season over footage appearing to show its rear wings bending at high speed in the Azerbaijan GP. The cars were considered legal.  The FIA is also introducing stricter tests for cars front wings from the Spanish GP in May and June. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/fia-f1-wings-chinese-gp-e27d7e56ab3d04084332b2e3cf241b8e,sports
Olympic golf to get a mixed-team event for the 2028 Los Angeles Games,"AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP)  Mixed teams are coming to golf at the Los Angeles Olympics. The International Olympic Committee made it official Wednesday when it released the official program for the 2028 Games, in which female athletes are expected to have a slight majority for the first time. Golf only returned to the Olympic program at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games after a 112-year absence, and it has awarded medals to only one competition  72 holes of stroke play  for men and for women. The International Golf Federation had been lobbying for a mixed-team competition for the last several years without taking away too much time from golfers schedules on various tours. Still to be determined are how many teams will compete and the qualification process. The International Golf Federation is thrilled with the IOC Executive Boards decision to approve the addition of a mixed-team event to the Olympic Golf program, the IGF said in a statement. It said more details would be released next week. The IOC had an online board meeting Wednesday that was co-chaired in Lausanne, Switzerland, for the first time by Kirsty Coventry since she was elected IOC president last month. She takes over in June for Thomas Bach and will be the first female IOC president in its 131-year history. The mens competition would start on Wednesday  one day earlier than before  and end on Saturday. The mixed teams would be held on Sunday and Monday, with foursomes (alternate shot) used for one round and fourballs (better ball) the other. 
        
     Tuesday would be a practice day for the women, and their competition would start Wednesday through Saturday, one day before the Summer Games come to a close. The golf competition is scheduled for Riviera Country Club, a revered PGA Tour stop that has hosted major championships. Riviera is to host the U.S. Womens Open for the first time in 2026, and the U.S. Open returns in 2031. A mixed team event would require only two more days for the players who qualify for the Olympics. Its unlikely any of the top players would be competing the following week at a regular PGA Tour or LPGA Tour event. Scottie Scheffler won the mens gold medal at the 2024 Paris Games by closing with a 62 at Le Golf National. Lydia Ko won the womens gold in Paris  she won the silver in Rio and the bronze in Tokyo in 2021  which also gave her points required for the LPGA Hall of Fame. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/olympics-la-golf-mixed-team-riviera-25b2cbf81e6e48d02df51b5ae31061c0,sports

Black dandyism claims long-overdue spotlight on the Met Gala stage,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Black dandyism is taking center stage at the Met Gala, with cultural powerhouses leading this subversive, sharply tailored style into the global fashion spotlight.  As a gala host committee member, Janelle Mone and other trendsetters are helping shape the conversation, framing Black dandyism as a proud tradition  rather than a mere trend  claiming its long-overdue moment of visibility.  Its always important to educate and reeducate to the world as much as we possibly can through art and through our greatness, said Mone, the Grammy-nominated performer who had made dandy style a signature of her fashion. Mone, inspired by family members who proudly sported the look throughout her upbringing, views the spotlight as an opportunity to pay homage to the past and inspire the future. Dandyism is pretty much a part of my fashion DNA through tailoring and suiting, the singer-actor said. Ive honored my ancestors and my family who wore their uniforms, wore their suits to serve our community. It fell right in line with who I am, and the people I want to bring with me that helped build this country. On Monday, with the world watching, a wave of fashion disruptors and stylists will usher Black dandyism from the margins to the Met Gala, as the Metropolitan Museum of Art unveils its new costume exhibit, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style. It marks the Mets first show centered exclusively on Black designers and the first in more than two decades to spotlight menswear. Its also a tribute to the rich legacy of dandyism, a style that has long carved space for radical self-expression, especially for those overlooked or misunderstood. Its been a long time coming, said Kyle Smith, the NFLs first-ever fashion editor, who has styled the leagues top players, including Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, Los Angeles Rams wideout Puka Nacua and receiver Kenny Stills. 
        
     Its great to see the recognition that Black culture is having or has in fashion for years, Smith said. Its been there and very subtle, or just not recognized. I think this years theme is long overdue. Im excited to see everybodys outfits and how they interact with the idea of Black dandyism. This years Met Gala co-chairs include Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and honorary chair LeBron James, with Mone joining the host committee alongside the likes of Simone Biles, Spike Lee, Ayo Edebiri and Andr 3000. I think honoring minorities, honoring Black and brown people in these spaces and outside every day, is important, said Mone, who plans to use the red carpet to debut an exclusive collaboration with 1800 Tequila. The ones who have dedicated their lives to this country to serve, build and give us art to sustain us for a lifetime. We should continue to honor them and push forward and stand on their shoulders. Several trailblazers helped popularize Black dandyism, a style whose roots trace back to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. From the beginning, dandyism served as a sartorial declaration, reclaiming elegance and luxury as tools of empowerment, challenging stereotypes and honoring Black legacy. This Met Gala moment stands on the shoulders of icons like Frederick Douglass, who wielded sharp dress as a form of power, and Duke Ellington, who transformed suiting into cultural brilliance. Host committee member Dapper Dan reimagined Harlem fashion, remixing luxury into bold statements of Black pride, while the late Andr Leon Talley  with his capes and commanding presence  redefined fashion authority. Todays Black dandies carry that legacy forward, blending tradition and rebellion in every lapel for a style that speaks volumes before a word is ever spoken. We are the walking versions that they imagined, said El Lewis, an Atlanta-based stylist, who has worked with several entertainers including Usher, Young Thug, Chloe and Halle Bailey, and Justin Skye. A lot of these people died not being able to have these realities come to fruition. We have a lot of autonomy to ourselves, and I think thats what they were probably seeking. They wanted to be able to do anything at any moment at any time. And I think thats what they get to see us do. Stylist Brian Robinson said that if Talley were alive, he would have left an unforgettable mark on the galas defining looks. He would definitely be behind conversation pieces underneath the restraint to educate, Robinson said of Talley, the influential former creative director and editor at large at Vogue magazine. He died at the age of 73 in 2022. He would have been able to put dandyism in a positive light for people to understand the importance of being able to celebrate and highlight our culture, said Robinson, who has worked with Keyshia Cole and Naturi Naughton. He would push for the understanding of the agricultural aesthetic of style, being able to understand how it highlights not only your personality, but how it can also make you feel good as a person. Smith hopes the Met Gala inspires people to embrace the joy of dressing up, because thats the heart of dandyism. Hes eager to see that spirit reflected both on the streets and in the player tunnels at professional games. I want to see it more in our tunnel fits in the NFL, he said. Take some fashion tips from the Met. Look at what everybodys wearing and how theyre exploring fashion. I want to see how everybody expresses themselves and how they leave their mark in the fashion world. ___ For more coverage of the Met Gala, visit https://apnews.com/hub/met-gala.",https://apnews.com/article/black-dandyism-met-gala-janelle-monae-ea44ae058aee522236cdb1ddc4c349aa,sports
"Rockies rally past Giants 4-3, denying Justin Verlander his 1st win since joining San Francisco","SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Jordan Beck hit a tying double in the eighth inning and Hunter Goodman singled home the go-ahead run two batters later as the Colorado Rockies rallied past San Francisco 4-3 on Thursday night to deny Justin Verlander his first win with the Giants. Colorado came back against reliever Tyler Rogers (2-1) and snapped a 12-game skid at Oracle Park, where San Francisco had owned the longest active home winning streak against one opponent. Angel Chivilli (1-2) got four outs for the win and Zach Agnos worked a perfect ninth for his second save. Verlander struck out four and pitched into the seventh but remains without a win since joining San Francisco. Wilmer Flores and Mike Yastrzemski each hit an RBI double in the sixth to put San Francisco ahead 3-1. The Giants have their first three-game losing streak this year, leaving the Chicago Cubs and New York Mets as the only teams not to drop three straight. The 42-year-old Verlander, who signed a $15 million, one-year contract in January determined to show he can still pitch at an elite level, has made seven starts for the Giants. But the three-time Cy Young Award winner and nine-time All-Star is yet to reach the win column.  He didnt come through in the home opener April 4 and has struggled to get run support.  Heliot Ramos hit his first career leadoff homer against Rockies starter Kyle Freeland, but Colorado tied it on an RBI single by Brenton Doyle in the third. San Francisco placed infielder Tyler Fitzgerald on the 10-day injured list with a fractured left rib and recalled infielder Brett Wisely from Triple-A Sacramento. 
        
     Colorados Ryan McMahon homered in the seventh to make it a one-run game. Camilo Doval relieved Verlander one out later and retired the next two batters.  The Giants have lost five of Verlanders seven starts, scoring 13 total runs in those defeats and only 15 in all his outings combined. RHP Antonio Senzatela (1-4, 5.22 ERA) pitches Friday night for Colorado opposite Giants LHP Robbie Ray (3-0, 3.73). ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/giants-rockies-score-verlander-aadc4bc6931260ed85ab4ab4d0126b0b,sports

Tigers score 8 runs in final 2 innings of 10-4 comeback win over Angels,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Dillon Dingler capped a five-run eighth inning with a three-run homer, Javier Bez and Gleyber Torres each hit a solo shot in the third, and the Detroit Tigers rallied for a 10-4 win over the skidding Los Angeles Angels on Thursday night. Spencer Torkelson added a two-run homer  his ninth of the season  in a three-run ninth as Detroit improved to an American League-best 20-12 and sent the Angels to their sixth straight loss. After the game, the Angels announced that star outfielder Mike Trout will be placed on the 10-day injured list again because of a bone bruise in his surgically repaired left knee.  Tigers starter Casey Mize (5-1) gave up four runs and seven hits in seven innings, including Logan OHoppes solo homer in the second and Jorge Solers two-run shot in the third. Detroit trailed 4-2 in the eighth when Torres, who had three hits, singled off reliever Ryan Zeferjahn, who had retired the side in order in the seventh. Angels manager Ron Washington summoned left-hander Reid Detmers (0-2), who walked Riley Greene and gave up an RBI single to Andy Ibez. Angels center fielder Jo Adell fumbled Ibezs hit for an error, allowing two runners to advance. One out later, Zach McKinstry lined an RBI single that tied it and Dingler, who had three hits, drove a 409-foot homer to left for a 7-4 lead. Los Angeles left-hander Yusei Kikuchi gave up two runs and five hits in five innings, striking out five and walking one.  The oft-injured Trout missed his first game of the season after being removed from Wednesdays loss in Seattle with left knee soreness. He had two operations to repair separate meniscus tears in the knee last year, limiting him to 29 games in a season cut short on April 29. 
        
     Bez, the Tigers shortstop-turned-center fielder, made a leaping catch of Solers fifth-inning drive above the yellow line on the right-center field wall to take away a home run. Solers two-run shot in the third was the Angels second homer with a runner on base since April 10. Of the teams 43 home runs this season, 33 have been solo shots. Tigers LHP Tarik Skubal (3-2, 2.34 ERA), the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, starts Friday night against Angels RHP Jose Soriano (2-4, 4.50). ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/tigers-angels-score-dingler-0149ad9f36fd2260f5a686b680cbb068,sports

Jose Trevinos 2-run homer sparks Reds to 9-1 victory over Cardinals,"CINCINNATI (AP)  Jose Trevino hit a two-run homer and Spencer Steer added a solo shot as the Cincinnati Reds defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 9-1 on Thursday afternoon in a game delayed 1 hour, 37 minutes by rain. Trevinos two-out, two-run homer off Matthew Liberatore put the Reds ahead 2-0 in the second. Brendan Donovan scored from first on Nolan Arenados single when Elly De La Cruz booted the ball in short left field for his major-league leading seventh error, making the score 2-1.

"Yankees put OF/DH Stanton on 60-day injured list, claim OF Bryan De La Cruz off waivers from Atlanta","NEW YORK (AP)  The New York Yankees transferred outfielder and designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton to the 60-day injured list on Thursday while claiming outfielder Bryan De La Cruz off waivers from the Atlanta Braves. Stanton is rehabbing from torn tendons in both of his elbows and hopes to be back sometime in June. He began doing some on-field hitting about a week ago with the Yankees, who open a series against the Rays on Friday night in New York. The 28-year-old De La Cruz, who was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, was hitting .191 for the Braves this season. He was sent to their Triple-A affiliate at Gwinnett on April 17, where he hit .200 over 11 games.

Rodriguez scratched from Kentucky Derby with minor foot bruise. Baeza moves into the 20-horse field,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  Rodriguez was scratched Thursday from the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, leaving trainer Bob Baffert with one entry in his return to Churchill Downs after serving a three-year suspension. Tom Ryan of Starlight Racing, one of the colts multiple owners, said on X: Out of an abundance of caution, we have made a very tough decision to scratch our Derby horse, Rodriguez. He has a small but slightly sensitive foot bruise that will need a few more days. Ryan said the colt will be pointed toward the Preakness on May 17.  The decision leaves Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith without a mount in what would have been his record-extending 29th Derby start. Baffert will saddle Citizen Bull, last years 2-year-old champion, in pursuit of a record-breaking seventh Derby win. The colt drew the dreaded No. 1 post and will be under pressure to break quickly before the rest of the field comes over on him. With the defection of Rodriguez, Baeza will make the field of 20 3-year-olds. The colt has been on the grounds since last week training in the hopes he would get in. He is trained by John Shirreffs, who teamed with Smith to win the Derby in 2005 with 50-1 shot Giacomo.

Soto ends Citi Field homer drought by hitting 2 in Mets loss to Diamondbacks,"NEW YORK (AP)  Carlos Mendoza wasnt worried about Juan Soto after the New York Mets star slugger didnt homer in his first 15 home games at Citi Field. More importantly, neither was Soto. The Mets $765 million man hit his first two homers at home on Thursday  but those were the only runs for New York in a 4-2 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Its always good to see it, Mendoza said. We knew he was close. Soto had 12 homers in 35 games as a visiting player at Citi Field, but entered Thursday hitting just .241 in 54 at-bats at home this season. He also had 10 walks to go along with eight strikeouts and four doubles  as well as a second-deck foul ball into the right field seats that was initially called fair against the Philadelphia Phillies on Apr. 21. Soto completed his home run trot before umpires overturned the call. Try not to expand or anything like that  try to see the ball well, if Ive got to take my walk, Ill take my walk, Soto said. Im not in a rush to hit a homer or to hit game-tying hits. Soto was hitless with three walks in his first 11 plate appearances of the three-game series against Arizona, but five of the first eight balls he put into play were hit 101 mph or harder and another had an exit velocity of 98.9 mph. Both of Sotos opposite-field homers Thursday  in the sixth off Zac Gallen and in the eighth off Kevin Ginkel  had exit velocities lower than his 110.1 mph first-inning groundout to short. 
        
     Yeah, hes hitting balls on the ground, but now, finally, not only hitting balls in the air, but when hes going in that direction  left-center  hes a pretty dangerous hitter, Mendoza said. It was good to see that today. Among big-name Mets additions over the past 30-plus years, only Bobby Bonilla (22 games in 1992) went longer without hitting his first homer at home. Carlos Beltran homered in his 13th home game in 2005, while Sotos current teammate Francisco Lindor went deep for the first time in his 11th homer game in 2021. I dont have any pressure, Soto said. These guys (and) Mendoza have been really clear with me, to make me feel comfortable going out there and playing. I dont have any pressure at all. Its just two homers that werent enough to get the win.  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-juan-soto-a16825883a898313f4580efa72e5d1af,sports
Nationals try to improve a bad bullpen by adding Chafin and designating Poche for assignment,"PHILADELPHIA (AP)  The Washington Nationals tried to improve whats been a terrible bullpen by agreeing to terms on a $1 million contract for 2025 with Andrew Chafin on Thursday and designating Colin Poche for assignment. Both relievers are left-handers. Chafin, who turns 35 next month, was released Wednesday from a minor league contact with the Detroit Tigers. He split last season between the Tigers and the Texas Rangers, going 4-3 with a 3.51 ERA across 56 1/3 innings in 62 appearances. Chafins 500 appearances since the start of 2017 are the most among relievers in the majors. Poche was 1-2 with an 11.42 ERA in 13 games with the Nationals this season.

"Jos Ramrez reaches milestone, then scores winning run in Guardians 4-3, 10-inning win over Twins","CLEVELAND (AP)  Jos Ramrez became the first player in Cleveland franchise history to reach 250 career homers and 250 steals and then scored the winning run in the 10th inning as the Guardians rallied for a 4-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Thursday. Ramrezs single drove in Steven Kwan to tie it at 3. Ramrez then stole second base to become the 24th player in major league history  and only active one  to reach the milestone. After Kyle Manzardo was intentionally walked, pinch-hitter Angel Martnez hit a sharp grounder into right field off Justin Topa (1-2) to score Ramrez and give Cleveland its second walk-off win of the four-game series.  Kolby Allard (1-0) got the win as the Guardians took three games in the four-game set and went 6-4 on their 10-game homestand. There were two rain delays totaling 2 hours, 23 minutes on what was ironically Weather Education Day. An 18-minute rain delay between the sixth and seventh innings ended up benefiting the Twins. Minnesota scored a pair of runs in the seventh and took advantage of Clevelands fielders struggling with damp conditions. Harrison Bader led off the inning with an infield single after Cleveland third baseman Will Wilson slipped while fielding the grounder. Bader scored on an RBI single by Christian Vzquez after Noel slipped in right center. Cleveland had the bases loaded with one out in the ninth, but was unable to convert when Jhoan Duran struck out Bo Naylor and Kwan. 
        
     Guardians outfielder Jhonkensy Noel hit a 450-foot home run in the fifth inning. The solo shot to left-center off Simeon Woods Richardson tied his longest homer at Progressive Field and marked the 12th time since MLB Statcast started in 2015 that a Cleveland batter had gone at least 450 feet deep at home. Twins: Head to Boston for a weekend series. RHP Joe Ryan (2-2, 3.18 ERA) gets the call for Fridays opener. Guardians: Begin a six-game road trip in Toronto on Friday.

Shelby Miller earns 1st save for Diamondbacks nearly a decade after first being traded to Arizona,"NEW YORK (AP)  Shelby Miller never developed into the ace the Arizona Diamondbacks envisioned following a blockbuster trade in December 2015. Perhaps he can become the Diamondbacks closer almost a decade later. Miller earned his first save for Arizona on Thursday, working a perfect ninth inning to finish a 4-2 win over the New York Mets. Its always good to get a win, however we can do it, however I contribute, whether were up one or 10, Miller said. Ill pick up the ball whenever my name is called. Miller picked up the save hours after Arizonas bullpen was thrown into further disarray when Justin Martinez was placed on the 15-day injured list with right shoulder inflammation. Martinez and A.J. Puk, who was shifted to the 60-day IL as he recovers from a left elbow injury, combined for seven of the Diamondbacks first nine saves. It doesnt mean hes going to close every game, manager Torey Lovullo said after Miller threw just eight pitches. But hes going to get some save opportunities for sure. Miller was one of the most promising young starters in baseball when the Diamondbacks acquired him from the Atlanta Braves on Dec. 9, 2015, for a package that included Dansby Swanson, the first overall pick in the 2015 draft. But Miller, who had a 3.22 ERA for the Braves and St. Louis Cardinals in his first four big league seasons, went 3-12 with a 6.15 ERA in 20 starts in 2016 before undergoing Tommy John surgery after four starts in 2017  Lovullos first year as manager. 
        
     That makes the save a little bit better, Miller said with a smile. I couldnt be more happy for him to get this W. The fact that were connected that way, it does mean a lot, Lovullo said. Miller played for three other teams and had moved to the bullpen by the time Swanson won the World Series with Atlanta in 2021. After pitching briefly for the San Francisco Giants in 2022 and recording a 1.71 ERA for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2023, Miller appeared in a career-high 51 games for the Detroit Tigers last season. The 34-year-old right-hander signed a non-roster deal with Arizona in February and is 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA in 13 appearances this season. The save Thursday was the fourth of his career. Its a story of perseverance. For me, its a story about a guy that just is never giving up, Lovullo said. Hes bounced around over the course of his career through a bunch of organizations, but he has never given up. And were getting those benefits now. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/diamondbacks-shelby-miller-1b40d4bae10bc8867eb3e534c52d8707,sports

Clevelands Jos Ramrez becomes first third baseman with 250 career homers and steals,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Jos Ramrez picked the perfect opportunity to join another exclusive baseball club. Clevelands six-time All-Star became the first primary third baseman in history to reach 250 career homers and 250 stolen bases during the 10th inning of the Guardians 4-3 victory against the Minnesota Twins. At that moment, the last thing youre thinking is any milestones or personal records, Ramirez said through an interpreter. To me it was where we had the chance to get running, obviously get in a position where I can score with a base hit given the situation of the game.  Ramrez, who has 260 homers, got his 250th steal with one out in the 10th inning after he got aboard with an RBI base hit. The 32-year old native of the Dominican Republic is the 24th player to accomplish the feat, and the only active one in the majors. He is also the first Cleveland player reach 250-250 and just the second switch-hitter, joining Carlos Beltrn (435 homers, 312 stolen bases). Its a testament to hard work for a really long time and being really, really good for a long time, manager Stephen Vogt said. He came through big with the hit and then he gets the stolen base in the milestone and scores a winning run as well. He should have. He just continues to get accolade after accolade and I really enjoy watching it. After Kyle Manzardo got aboard on an intentional walk, Ramrez acknowledged the small crowd still at Progressive Field after two rain delays totaling 2 hours, 23 minutes, and pointed at the scoreboard when it showed he had reached the milestone. 
        
     It was a good moment, but especially seeing all the guys on the dugout trying to cheer me up and chanting my name. So thats kind of like something that make me smile, he said. Ramrez then scored the game-winning run on Angel Martinezs single. He also made sure he got the base to add to his collection, saying he would add it to the three other bases he has marking other accomplishments. Ramrez dazzles his teammates on an almost daily basis, so its not a surprise to them that hes added his name to another elite list. Hes a guy that leads by example, catcher Bo Naylor said. He goes out there, plays his hardest, and when you see one of the leaders on your team doing that, theres no excuse for you to not be able to do that. He takes on that role himself and just does such a good job of keeping all of us accountable without making his voice heard in a way. Hes one of the guys that makes this whole team go and every accomplishment that hes had come along the way, its been super awesome to be able to witness it one and be able to celebrate it with him afterward. Along with the other milestones, Ramrez joins Robin Yount, Craig Biggio and Derek Jeter as the only players to accomplish the 250-250 feat with only one team. Milestones are important, but for me the really important part is to keep playing and trying to win, said Ramirez, who made his big-league debut in 2013 Winning is the most important thing for me and I feel still young. I feel like I can still continue doing this and hopefully we can continue adding up. ___ Freelancer Tom Withers contributed to this story. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/guardians-ramirez-9d657b21bec21e70852af3cf96d90e63,sports
Alvarez hopes to again unify super middleweight division in early Sunday morning fight vs. Scull,"The typical routine for Canelo Alvarez is to train in Southern California and fight in Las Vegas, and its a formula that has helped him develop one of boxings great careers. Now at 34, Alvarez is showing hes willing to change his habits  a reported $400 million, minimum four-fight deal with Riyadh Season probably no small factor in that decision. The first of those bouts takes place Sunday at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia against little-known William Scull for the undisputed super middleweight championship. The main event ringwalk begins at about 6 a.m. local time to accommodate the American and Mexican pay-per-view audiences. A lot of people talk about the time change, fighting at 6 a.m., but I think when you work somebody as disciplined as Canelo is, has that experience, he can adjust to any time of timetable, Alvarezs trainer and manager, Eddy Reynoso, said through an interpreter. He could be fighting at 3, 4, even midnight, it doesnt matter. Hes a champion. Hes shown that and he will go on to show that. Oddsmakers agree. Alvarez (62-2-2) is an overwhelming -5000 favorite at BetMGM Sportsbook to get back the IBF title he lost after turning down a previous opportunity to fight Scull (23-0), who then was elevated to that organizations champion. Now Alvarez wants that belt back, which would make him an undisputed champion for the second time. It means a lot because thats history for my career, Alvarez said. 
        
     Its a fight Scull, who was born in Cuba but lives in Germany, wasnt expecting. But were always in training and youre ready and youre thinking about the possibility that something could come like this, Scull said through an interpreter. I have to thank Team Canelo for accepting this fight. He understands few expect him to beat Alvarez or even be competitive. BetMGM lists Canelo at -200 to win by knockout for the 40th time in his career even though his most recent KO occurred nearly four years ago. Scull pointed to his history of leaving Cuba 23 years ago and fighting in 24 countries as proof of his resilliency. Ive always faced different cultures, gone into fighting other opponents where people have underestimated me, Scull said. I thank God for this opportunity to go unify (the title). I dont really care what people say. All I know is that Im going into the fight to show that yes, you can. The soft-spoken Scull knows the opportunity that lies in front of him. He is grateful that at 32 a chance has finally come to make a name for himself beyond hard-core boxing fans. To come closer to Canelo status. Alvarez is here for business, and not just financial. He traveled to Riyadh three weeks ago to adjust to the time difference and the triple-digit temperature desert climate hes accustomed to dealing with in Las Vegas. The Mexican champion and fan favorite called it a dream to fight in a different country, and he hoped to send a message hes there for more than just the money. There was a little bit of trash talk at the end of the news conference promoting this fight, though its been tame by boxing standards. Everybody talks (stuff), but when they step in the ring, its going to be something different, Alvarez said. Hes going to feel something different for sure, believe me. This is nothing new for me. ___ AP boxing: https://apnews.com/boxing",https://apnews.com/article/canelo-alvarez-scull-saudi-arabia-e06d92823affd7a071410ceb5a7c92ba,sports
"Red Sox RHP Walker Buehler returns to Boston for tests on sore shoulder, wont start Friday","TORONTO (AP)  Red Sox right-hander Walker Buehler returned to Boston on Thursday to have tests on his sore right shoulder and wont start against the Minnesota Twins on Friday, manager Alex Cora said. Rookie Kristian Campbell was scratched from the series finale against the Blue Jays in Toronto because of right rib discomfort, the Red Sox said. Rob Refnsyder came in to play left field and Jarren Duran moved from left to center. Buehler is 4-1 with a 4.28 ERA in his six starts since signing a one-year, $21.05 million contract with the Red Sox last December. He allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings to beat Cleveland last Saturday, his third straight winning start. Before joining Boston, Buehler won two World Series titles in seven seasons with the Dodgers. Cora said right-hander Brayan Bello will start in Buehlers place when the Red Sox return home Friday to begin a three-game series against Minnesota. Bello is 2-0 with a 3.27 ERA in two starts since being activated off the injured list because of a strained shoulder. Campbell is batting .301 with four homers and 12 RBI in 29 games.

Kenta Maeda cut by Tigers to clear roster spot for reliever Tyler Owens,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  Kenta Maeda was cut by the Detroit Tigers on Thursday to open a spot in the bullpen for hard-throwing prospect Tyler Owens. Maeda was designated for assignment after compiling a 7.88 ERA over seven relief appearances in the second season of a $24 million, two-year contract. Detroit has seven days to trade or release him, or send him outright to the minors if he clears waivers. The 37-year-old right-hander has enough major league service time that he could refuse a minor league assignment and choose to become a free agent instead. Its tough because when he was good, he really helped us, and when he struggled, we really didnt get him back on track, so its a frustrating end to his time here, Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said before Thursday nights series opener against the Los Angeles Angels. Owens was recalled from Triple-A Toledo. We do want to create opportunities for the young players and the young pitchers, and were really excited about Tyler and some of the adjustments we asked him to work on at the beginning of the season to get his velocity and execution where it needs to be, Hinch said. Maeda went 3-7 with a 6.09 ERA in 29 games last season, including 17 starts. He was demoted to the bullpen after posting a 7.26 ERA in his first 16 starts, but had some success in a relief role with a 4.44 ERA in 46 2/3 innings. But after failing to win a rotation spot this spring, Maeda, who missed the 2022 season because of Tommy John surgery, struggled in a mop-up role, his velocity down and the command of his splitter spotty. 
        
     We were pretty excited with how he was throwing, how he was moving, this spring, but when we got into the season, he wasnt the same person we saw in the spring or last season, when we moved him to the bullpen, Hinch said. He tried to tweak a few things, but it wasnt producing the stuff coming out of his hand or the results. Maeda had many of his best seasons in Los Angeles, where he went 47-35 with a 3.87 ERA in 137 games  including 103 starts  for the Dodgers from 2016-19. Then he was 6-1 with a 2.70 ERA in 11 starts for Minnesota during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, finishing second in AL Cy Young Award balloting. Owens, whose fastball sits between 96-98 mph, went 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA in 12 games for Toledo, striking out 11 and walking nine in 14 innings. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/kenta-maeda-tigers-e12a4a96802f22902e3ee2d3995a57a4,sports
Quarterback Demond Williams Jr. has evolved as a leader heading into second season at Washington,"SEATTLE (AP)  Barring injury, theres no debating who Washingtons next quarterback will be  and its one coach Jedd Fisch has thought highly of for a long time. Sophomore Demond Williams Jr., who appeared in 13 games for the Huskies as a freshman and completed over 78% of his passes, initially enrolled at Arizona when Fisch was still running the show in Tucson. As Washington wraps up spring practice with its annual scrimmage on Friday night, it has become clear to Fisch that Williams isnt just the undisputed play-caller. Hes certainly evolved as a leader, Fisch said. You can certainly feel and see him out there. The fact that its his team now, hes not sitting back. He can understand that its truly, truly up to him if the offense is struggling to get the offense going. Truly up to him if the offense is having success to keep the success going. Williams spent most of last season as the backup to Mississippi State transfer Will Rogers, but flashed his potential in the Sun Bowl against Louisville by completing 26 of 32 passes for 374 yards and four touchdowns. This spring, the quarterback continued to exhibit his deft passing touch, especially on short, rhythm routes. Despite a shorter stature, the 5-foot-11, 190-pound Williams could very well be the kind of quarterback Fisch wants to run the Huskies offense. We got 14 weeks (until the regular season starts) and we got to get really good together, Fisch said. Im going to commit to seeing how good we can be as a quarterback-play-caller tandem. And then on the same token, I know hes going to commit to see how good of a player he can be, so Im excited about it. This time last year, Fisch had his hands full in terms of simply fielding a full roster for the spring game in his first year as Washingtons coach. At no position was that felt more than offensive line, because the Huskies had just seven offensive linemen available for the spring game last May. On Wednesday, Fisch said he anticipated 17 offensive linemen would be able to participate. The difference is  I mean its even hard to describe because No. 1, they look better, Fisch said. Their size is better. Theyre moving better. Theyre playing at a really high level as a group. Fisch highlighted the addition of Carver Willis, a sixth-year offensive tackle who spent the last five seasons at Kansas State. Willis was an honorable mention All-Big 12 player in 2024. Big get for us on the offensive line, Fisch said. Hes certainly shown to be everything that we thought he was going to be. Local product Rahshawn Clark, who went to Garfield High School, has stood out to Fisch ahead of his redshirt freshman season. Fisch envisions Clark, who is listed as a safety, playing a good amount of nickelback while Tacario Davis and Ephesians Prysock are the projected starting cornerbacks. Im proud of the way hes playing, Fisch said, and I think hes going to be a really, really good player for us. Last year, the Huskies defense was 28th in the nation in total yards against per game (328.4). Fisch will be joined by a pair of new coordinators this fall. Jimmie Dougherty, who was the passing game coordinator and QB coach at Washington last year, is now the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Former Purdue coach Ryan Walters, who went 5-19 across two seasons leading the Boilermakers, is the new defensive coordinator. Dougherty is taking over for Brennan Carroll, while Walters is assuming the position previously held by Stephen Belichick. Both Carroll and Belichick are following their fathers to their next coaching opportunities. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Guerrero hits go-ahead homer in 8th as Blue Jays rally past Red Sox 4-2,"TORONTO (AP)  Vladimir Guerrero Jr. put Toronto ahead with a three-run homer in the eighth inning, Daulton Varsho had a solo shot and the Blue Jays beat the Boston Red Sox 4-2 on Thursday night. Toronto trailed 2-0 through six innings before Varsho connected off Tanner Houck in the seventh, his second homer in two games. Varsho was activated off the injured list Tuesday after missing the start of the season while recovering from right shoulder surgery. Mason Fluharty (2-0) retired all four batters he faced and Yimi Garcia finished for his second save. Toronto won back-to-back games for the first time since a three-game winning streak from April 15-18. Guerrero erased a 2-1 deficit with a 404-foot drive to left field off Justin Slaten in the eighth. Slaten (0-2) took the loss for the second straight game, spoiling Houcks strong start. Houck allowed one run and four hits in seven innings. He walked none and struck out six. The Red Sox have lost his past five starts. Blue Jays right-hander Jos Berros permitted two runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. He walked two and matched a season high with eight strikeouts. Bostons runs came on a bases-loaded double by Alex Bregman in the fifth. Nathan Lukes hit a one-out single in the eighth and Bo Bichette doubled over the head of Wilyer Abreu in right field. Guerrero followed with his fourth homer of the season. The Blue Jays are 3-0 when hittting two or more home runs in a game. They hit a season-high three in Wednesdays 7-6 victory.

Lord earns 1st MLB win as Nationals beat Phillies 4-2 to prevent sweep,"PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Luis Garcia Jr. singled, doubled and drove in a run, Brad Lord pitched effectively into the sixth inning for his first major league win and the Washington Nationals avoided a three-game sweep with a 4-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday night. Nathaniel Lowe also drove in a run for Washington, which had lost three in a row overall. Lord (1-3) allowed two runs and six hits in five-plus innings. The rookie right-hander struck out four and walked one.  Jose A. Ferrer fanned three in two scoreless innings of relief, and Kyle Finnegan got three outs for his 10th save. Trea Turner had three hits for Philadelphia, which had won four straight. Alec Bohms RBI single in the fifth put the Phillies in front 1-0 before the Nationals scored all their runs in the sixth off Taijuan Walker (1-3) with some help from the Phillies. Lowes RBI single tied it at 1, and the Nationals went in front when Bryce Harper couldnt field Keibert Ruizs hard-hit grounder at first base. Lowe scored on the error, and Ruiz reached third. Garcias single plated Ruiz, and the Nationals tallied their final run on a double steal, with Garcia scoring from third and Dylan Crews going from first to second. Walker cruised through five scoreless innings, allowing one hit, before an adventurous sixth. After a leadoff double by CJ Abrams, James Wood hit a hard liner off Walkers leg. Walker stayed in the game but wasnt as effective from that point forward. He didnt make it through the inning, though only one of the four runs the Nationals scored against him was earned.

"Jurgen Klopp congratulates Liverpool on 20th league title, extremely positive about teams future","LIVERPOOL, England (AP)  Ex-Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has congratulated his former team on winning a record-equaling 20th English league title and suggested the era of success for the Reds is not over yet. Klopp led Liverpool to a full set of trophies in more than eight years in charge, including the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020. Super grateful for the past, super, super happy about the present, extremely positive about the future! Klopp said in an Instagram post. Congratulations - YNWA, he added, referencing the team anthem Youll Never Walk Alone. Klopp left the club a year ago.

Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar ready to learn on the job in his first F1 weekend in Australia,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP)  Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar is heading into the season-opening Formula 1 race in Australia with fewer than 500 laps in a Grand Prix car under his belt The 20-year-old Hadjar has been dubbed Petit Prost  a young version of former F1 star Alain Prost  by the French media for his successes in F2 last year, when he finished runner-up with four victories. That was two more than champion Gabriel Bortoleto, now with Sauber. The French driver has had just four practice sessions in F1 and last years post-season test for Red Bull Racing and the brands second Grand Prix team, now known as Racing Bulls. He says its enough ahead of his first F1 race weekend. Ideally, I would go on different tracks, of course, because now Melbourne in an F1 car is pretty challenging, Hadjar said. By F1 experience, Ive been on really easy tracks  Bahrain and Abu Dhabi mostly. So now on really challenging tracks, its going to be a fair bit different. He says he doesnt need more practice laps, though, even if hes one of the least experienced of the six rookies on the F1 grid. Australian F1 Grand Prix official practice starts Friday, with qualifying Saturday and the race on Sunday afternoon. You just need mileage, and you need the real racing, Hadjar said. Going out alone to do the 300 kilometers (186 miles) to qualify for FIAs Super License to race F1 is good for understanding the car setup, he added, but when youre racing 19 other cars, its completely different. 
        
     So I need to do my first race. You need to learn on the job for that. Hadjar has good memories of Melbourne, having won the F2 feature race for Campos Racing last year and ensuring he goes into the weekend with confidence. An F1 track becomes really different once you go into an F1 car, he said. But I would say, I had the dream weekend here last year in F2, so its like playing at home. ___ AP Formula 1: https://apnews.com/hub/formula-one",https://apnews.com/article/f1-australian-gp-hadjar-racing-bulls-33943ea60b16929c22f9bbf225d014e8,sports
Dembeles early goal gives PSG 1-0 win over Arsenal in 1st leg of Champions League semifinals,"LONDON (AP)  Paris Saint-Germain is leaving England on a high again and within touching distance of a second Champions League final. Ousmane Dembeles early goal gave PSG a 1-0 win over Arsenal on Tuesday in the first leg of their semifinal, and only a couple of late misses prevented the advantage from growing bigger. It was a great night, PSG midfielder Vitinha said. We could have scored more but we are glad for 1-0 and we will do everything in our power to go to the final. Having already eliminated Premier League champion Liverpool and Aston Villa in the knockout stages, PSG outplayed Arsenal as well in a stadium where it lost 2-0 in the league phase in October. This youthful PSG side has come a long way since then, and once again showed that its a better team without superstar Kylian Mbappe  whose Real Madrid lost 3-0 at the Emirates Stadium in the quarterfinals. Despite that recent history, PSG showed no hesitation in taking the game to Arsenal from the start. And Dembele opened the scoring in the fourth minute after he was left all alone in the area and was picked out by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia for a first-time finish that snuck in via the far post. The goal came after 26 consecutive passes in the buildup, which stats provider Opta said was the most for PSG in a Champions League game since at least 2003-04. We showed the kind of team we are, PSG coach Luis Enrique said. We tried to play our way and scored the goal early playing the way we play. 
        
     It was the hosts who looked affected by the moment  and the absence of suspended midfielder Thomas Partey  in their first Champions League semifinal since 2009. They couldnt cope with PSGs pace in transition and the visitors lead easily could have been bigger after a dominant first half. They started quick with a goal and they dominated the first 15-20 minutes, Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya said. Its only halftime, we take positives. Kvaratskhelia caused Arsenal problems throughout and had a penalty appeal turned down in the 17th minute and a shot saved by David Raya in the 26th. Raya made a better save in the 31st to deny Desire Doue as PSG continually was the more threatening team. At the other end, Gianluigi Donnarumma denied Arsenal an equalizer on the stroke of halftime with a one-handed save to keep out a shot from Gabriel Martinelli. With former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger looking on in the stands, the Gunners improved in the second half. Mikel Merino thought he had equalized shortly after the break when he headed in a free kick from Declan Rice, but it was disallowed for offside after a lengthy VAR check. Donnarumma, who played a key part in the wins over Liverpool and Aston Villa, then had to make another low one-handed finger-tip save to steer Leandro Trossards shot wide after a quick counter in the 56th, but that was as close as Arsenal came to an equalizer. Thats the work of a goalkeeper, no? Save the team, Luis Enrique said. They work every day for that. PSG substitutes Bradley Barcola and Goncalo Ramos both had chances to double the lead late on when clear through on goal. But Barcola shot narrowly wide and Ramos rattled the crossbar to keep Arsenal close going into the second leg in Paris next week. We have to go to Paris and win the game. We are more than capable of doing it, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said. If you want to be in the Champions League final, you have to do something special. And we are going to need to do something special in Paris. Both teams are looking for a first Champions League title, and second final. PSG lost to Borussia Dortmund at this stage last year. The French side lost to Bayern Munich in its only Champions League final in 2020, while Arsenal was runner-up to Barcelona in 2006.

Real Madrid defender Rdiger gets 6-game ban for conduct toward referee,"MADRID (AP)  Real Madrid defender Antonio Rdiger was handed a six-game ban Tuesday for his conduct toward a referee during the teams loss to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final. Rdiger shouted at the referee and seemed to throw a small bag of ice during extra time in Madrids 3-2 loss to Barcelona on Saturday. The disciplinary committee of the Spanish football federation said Rdigers ban was for minor violence toward the officials. Another Madrid player, Lucas Vazquez, was handed a two-match suspension because of his protest toward the match officials. Rdiger has since apologized for his behavior but the incident prompted former Germany player Dietmar Hamann to call Sunday for the defender to be left out of Germanys squad for the Nations League final four in June. The 32-year-old Rdiger successfully underwent surgery on a meniscus tear in his left knee on Tuesday and will begin his recovery process shortly. The club did not give a timeline for his return but the recovery is expected to take several weeks. Rdiger said surgery was unavoidable after playing through severe pain. Now Im finally pain-free again, and the surgery was a success, he said on Instagram in a post that included photos of him in the hospital after the surgery, one in bed and another in a wheelchair while holding crutches. I want to be able to play again as soon as possible as two big tournaments with the Nations League and the Club World Cup are in front of me, but I have to look from week to week now and we will see. I will do everything I can to make it happen. Germany plays Portugal in the Nations League semifinals in Munich on June 4.

Inter looking to power back up ahead of Champions League match at Barcelona,"MILAN (AP)  Strange things happen when Inter Milan plays Barcelona in the Champions League semifinals. The last time the two teams met in the final four of Europes elite club competition, in 2010, Barcelona had to make a 15-hour journey by bus to Milan after an ash cloud caused by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull shut down airspace. Barcelona lost that first leg 3-1 and a stout defensive performance by Inter in the return match saw it advance to the final 3-2 on aggregate  where it beat Bayern Munich to clinch a historic treble under Jose Mourinho. Inter fortunately didnt have to make a similarly arduous journey despite an unprecedented blackout bringing much of Spain and Portugal to a standstill Monday. Power had almost fully returned to Spain early Tuesday morning and Inters charter flight took off as scheduled for Barcelona at around 5 p.m. local time ahead of the first leg of their semifinal on Wednesday. Barcelonas 17-year-old star Lamine Yamal said he was caught at the teams training grounds on the outskirts of the city when power went out just after noon on Monday. The truth is that we didnt know what to do. I was with my teammates all day at the training center, Yamal said on Tuesday. The blackout made us all very nervous. But of course now we are only thinking about the semifinal that we are very motivated to play. 
        
     Inter coach Simone Inzaghi will be hoping his team can power back up for the game as well.  Inter heads to Barcelona following a dire run of results that has seen its dreams of another treble evaporate. For the first time in more than 13 years, Inter has lost three straight matches without scoring a goal. Since a 2-2 draw against Bayern in the Champions League quarterfinals, the Nerazzurri have lost 1-0 to both Bologna and Roma in Serie A and 3-0 to AC Milan in the second leg of their Italian Cup semifinal. That has also seen them been leapfrogged at the top of the Serie A table by Napoli, slipping three points behind the new league leader. We must always be ambitious, we have always shown that, Inzaghi said Tuesday. We dont know how the season will end: the league no longer depends on us, in the Champions League we are among the best four teams in Europe. These guys have given everything, clearly the last week was not positive but the team is fine, they are hungry, they will go into this semifinal with their heads held high, with a lot of desire and then we will see who will go to the final. Those three games, however, had something in common: Marcus Thuram was missing. Thuram, who has been out with a left thigh issue, has scored 17 goals and provided nine assists across all competitions for Inter this season. Without the France forward, Lautaro Martinez has appeared fatigued attempting to carry Inters attack. And Marko Arnautovic, Thurams replacement, has been ineffective. But Thuram has returned to training, although it remains to be seen whether he is able to start on Wednesday. Thuram trained with the team for the first time today, we hadnt seen him since Bayern, Inzaghi said. We did some good work  short  he showed some good signs, but I have to evaluate tomorrow morning and Ill talk to him again. Inter is seeking a second Champions League final in three seasons after it lost to Manchester City in the trophy match in 2023. ___ AP writer Joseph Wilson contributed to this report from Barcelona, Spain. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/inter-barcelona-champions-league-thuram-4ff96567979f162195857fe96afc1685,sports
F1s Mercedes chief Wolff says hes not looking to sign Verstappen for 2026,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP)  Mercedes team principal and chief executive Toto Wolff has denied rumors on the eve of the Australian Grand Prix weekend that hes still seeking to sign reigning F1 world champion Max Verstappen for 2026. Mercedes, which has a new driver lineup this year that sees rookie prospect Andrea Kimi Antonelli join George Russell, is hoping to emerge from its recent lean spell in F1 that has seen it score just five wins from the last three seasons, four of which came in 2024. But while Verstappen was reportedly on Mercedes shopping list last year as a top-gun replacement for its then-outgoing star Lewis Hamilton, Silver Arrows team boss Wolff says extending Russells contract beyond 2025 is the priority. I think weve said it pretty clearly last year, and (Verstappen) said the same, we need to concentrate on our driver line-up, we need to do (the best with) that we have, Wolff said Thursday in Melbourne. I dont flirt outside if Im in a good relationship, and that is true for this year, too. So, at the moment that is not on any, lets say, radar and I dont plan to shift my concentration away from these guys and make sure that George has a contract (extension) pretty soon and we agree on the final things. 
        
     Wolffs future driver lineup came into focus this week after McLaren extended its deal with Australian Oscar Piastri, which puts him out of reach during the sports next big expected grid shuffle in 2027. We have had a chat (with Russell) a few weeks ago about what the right timing would be to liaise, and Im  naively or not  someone that sticks to what he says, Wolff said. These three (including reserve driver Valtteri Bottas) are the combination that I want to go forward with Mercedes, and I have no reasons to doubt that. Were going to find some time, I guess, before the summer. Russell, a long-time Mercedes protg who joined the works team in 2022 fresh from three years at Williams, is keen to stay in silver. Weve had such a long-term relationship, and theres so much trust, Russell said. We are focused on getting Mercedes back on top and trying to win races, and championships, and to be honest in this sport, the performance speaks. Hamilton made it clear in Melbourne that hes moved on, following his record-breaking stint with Mercedes, with the seven-time F1 world champion enjoying life at Ferrari as he prepares for his maiden start with the Scuderia. Hamilton, whod been powered by Mercedes for his entire F1 career from 2007 to 2024, made a shock switch to Ferrari starting this year, following negotiations with Mercedes in 2023 that saw him offered a shorter tenure to future proof the operation. Hamilton signed the one-plus-one (option year) deal in August 2023, but made a swift u-turn in January last year to join the Prancing Horse from 2025. And the veteran Brit has been enjoying every moment spent at Maranello. Youre looking at things from a different perspective, and that makes it exciting and challenging, Hamilton said Thursday. This is definitely the most exciting period of my life. Im really enjoying it, and Im so excited to get in the car tomorrow. Hamilton is also working like hes a rookie again, this time at age 40  and with a record 105 wins and 104 pole positions. Im back at kind of square one, Hamilton said. Im really just putting all the time I have in. Ive been at the factory, like four days a week. Ive been given absolutely everything to training, to push my mind and my body further than I have before, trying to see if I can excel, and just squeeze more juice out of this. ___ AP Formula 1: https://apnews.com/hub/formula-one",https://apnews.com/article/australian-gp-f1-melbourne-47fbb2d3a6e4f50d86f088f30b6f4b93,sports
Lewis Hamilton ready to race for Ferrari for the first time in F1s season-opening Australian GP,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP)  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton racing a Ferrari for the first time. Reigning world champion Max Verstappen arriving without a lot of mileage in his Red Bull. Lando Norris helping McLaren set a benchmark with his pace in testing. Formula 1 is expecting a hyper-competitive milestone 75th anniversary season in 2025, and it starts this weekend with the Australian Grand Prix. Theres no shortage of unknowns in terms of the pecking order, and the weather. Most of the headlines ahead of Sundays Australian GP have revolved around Hamiltons move to Ferrari from Mercedes. The normally relaxed pre-event news conference at Albert Park was overflowing with journalists and photographers on Thursday to hear from a rejuvenated Hamilton about how much hes enjoying the prancing horse-ride. The 40-year-old British driver is going into his 19th season in F1 but has had a different outlook since his first day in January at the Scuderias Maranello HQ, where hes teammates with Charles Leclerc. I dont really approach this role with pressure, Hamilton said. I think over the years, the pressure I put on myself has always been 10 times higher than any other pressure that could be put upon me. I havent joined this team and been made to feel any pressure. I have an expectation for myself  I know what I can bring. I know what I can deliver. And I know what its going to take. 
        
     Norris has been trying to downplay his long-run pace that impressed the paddock during pre-season testing in Bahrain last month and made McLaren an early-season favorite. I know theres a lot of expectation, Norris said. It was just my one race run I did that kind of just made everyone believe this quite heavily. It was a good race run, but it was also in the most perfect conditions. He tried to temper expectations by saying McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri s run the following day was a lot slower. Not because he drove worse, Norris explained, but simply because the conditions on the final day were considerably slower. Theres no denying, though, that McLaren is confident going into the opening race of the season, even if theyre not quite sure of their ultimate pace. No one really knows what to expect, said Piastri, who is aiming to become the first Aussie to win the Australian F1 Grand Prix. Testing went pretty well, but you dont know where everybody stands. I think were pretty happy with how our test went, but Melbourne is a completely different track to Bahrain. Weather is going to be different to Bahrain and different every hour, by the look of it. Ferrari took the contest to long-time rival McLaren in the second practice as Leclerc closed out the session on top, just over one-tenth of a second ahead of Piastri and Norris Leclerc and Norris traded fastest times throughout the late afternoon run, with their pace witnessed by 125,548 people at the leafy inner-city Albert Park circuit, a record Friday crowd for the Australian Grand Prix. Hamilton had a much stronger second session for Ferrari, with the seven-time world champion finishing fifth, just over fourth-tenths behind teammate Leclerc. Theres still balance work to do overnight, and were missing a bit of pace, but thats expected, Hamilton said. Its about building step by step, maximizing what we have, and continuing to push forward. Red Bulls second team, Racing Bulls, shaded the main squad, with Yuki Tsunoda and Isack Hadjar showing surprising speed to end the session in fourth and sixth. World champion Max Verstappen could do no better than seventh, almost a half-second behind in the second session.  Today, the grip wasnt great, and we were struggling on all four tires, particularly in sector one and in the final sector, Verstappen said of his Red Bull car. It feels like we are not up there at the moment, but we will work to find more pace. Haas rookie Oliver Bearman didnt enter the second practice after his crash in the morning session. The final practice will precede Saturday qualifying, which starts at 4 p.m. local time (0500 GMT). Piastri, born and bred in Melbourne, is correct. The southern Australian city is set to deliver this weekend on the famous four seasons in one day expression that often describes Melbournes ever-changeable weather. The Albert Park circuit should be comfortable for F1s opening practice sessions on Friday, with a partly cloudy day expected and a top of 27 degrees Celsius (80 Fahrenheit). Temperatures are expected to rise to 37C (98F) on Saturday for qualifying and then drop again again for the race on Sunday, when theres also rain on the forecast. A wet race would certainly mix things up, with teams needing to guess on setup following two days of dry running. Verstappen, though, whose Red Bull team did the least mileage in pre-season testing, says hes prepared for any conditions. I would like it to be dry because its just nicer, (and) also for the fans, Verstappen said. But if its wet, its wet. Its fine as well. Piastri wont be the only Aussie on the Melbourne grid. Jack Doohan, the son of five-time motorcycle world champion Mick Doohan, is starting his first full season with Alpine  which appears to have taken a significant step forward over its 2024 pace. Although speculation through pre-season has been whether Doohan will keep that seat, with his French team bringing in former Williams driver Franco Colapinto as a reserve. I have a contract for at least this year, if not more, said Doohan, who is one of six rookies this season, the most on the F1 grid since 2001. And the uncertainties? You dont bother worrying about them. I think I have to perform each and every time Im in the car. Ferrari secured a 1-2 finish in Melbourne last year led by Sainz, just two weeks after an appendectomy that sidelined him in Saudi Arabia. But the 30-year-old Sainz will likely be fighting for points and not podiums this time around now that hes at Williams. Im definitely going to do my best to score (points) as soon as possible, Sainz said. Ferrari is the most successful team in Australia with 14 GP wins, dating back to Adelaide in 1987. Hamilton is one of five drivers on the current F1 grid to have won in Melbourne, with his victories in 2008 and 2015. Sundays season opener will be the 39th World Championship Australian Grand Prix, and the 28th in Melbourne. It starts at 3 p.m. local time (0400 GMT). ___ AP Formula 1: https://apnews.com/hub/formula-one",https://apnews.com/article/f1-australian-gp-hamilton-ferrari-cca35dfaffff45dac9fc55a4256efb9a,sports

Not a bad way to start the year, thanks everyone, Norris said on his team radio shortly after the qualifying session ended ahead of Sundays opening race of the Formula 1 season.

(AP Photo/Asanka Brendon Ratnayake) Hamilton was circumspect about his qualifying finish. It isnt quite where we wanted to be but overall Im satisfied with the progress we have made over the past two days, Hamilton said. We didnt expect to be eight- or nine-tenths (of a second) behind pole but given this is a weekend of firsts for me, I didnt underestimate how steep the learning curve would be. Norris went into Q3 on the back foot after his first lap was deleted for a track limit infringement at turn four, where he put all four wheels off the track. But he delivered when it mattered with his one run. Its a tough one, because you want to take a lot of risks, especially on this track, Norris said. Its a track where youve got to commit and youve got to know you know what your target is and once youve turned in, youre kind of hoping for the best in a lot of cases. 
        
     Obviously I took too many of my first (Q3) lap and got track limits, so I was in a difficult position with knowing how much risk I wanted to take, but I put it together well. And the Brit is confident he can maintain that form in the race. I think we were decent in Bahrain, and I think were going to be pretty good here, Norris said. We were pretty good here last year and that was with a much worse car, so were going in with one target clearly, which is to have two cars at the top. Piastri was not unhappy to be second, having maximixed his lap, which enabled McLaren to lock out the front row for the second straight race, following 2024s season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. But the Australian hasnt given up on becoming the first Australian to win his home F1 Grand Prix. It would be really special to be able to achieve that, Piastri said. But, Im not setting my sights too to firmly on that, weve got a lot of work to do (first) to try to maximize the race tomorrow  we (also) have to see what the weather does first. Day-long rain is in the forecast on Sunday. Red Bulls Max Verstappen qualified third, shrugging off pre-season pace concerns for the team about its RB21 car. But he downplayed his chances of challenging the McLarens in the 58-lap race on a day when his new teammate Liam Lawson qualified well down in 18th, following a scrappy Q1 lap that questioned the teams decision to replace Mexican Sergio Prez for 2025. Yeah, I mean, I dont expect like any kind of miracles about it, the Dutchman said. I think its OK but its not on the same level (as the McLaren). But, Ill just do my best, (and) see what happens.

His 18-year-old rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli, who skipped F3 as part of his fast track through the junior categories, was a shock Q1 exit on his F1 debut and will start 16th. Ferrari had expectations it could challenge for the title, with Leclerc starting seventh and Hamilton eighth  for a disappointing fourth row lockout that means itll be fighting for points, not podiums, should rain not materialize. Racing Bulls, Red Bulls second F1 team, continued to impress in qualifying  with Yuki Tsunoda securing fifth on the grid, which is his highest placing since Brazil 2024. Isack Hadjar, his French rookie teammate, put in a solid performance to start 11th. Williams also showed its pre-season pace was real, after the British squad got both its drivers into the top-10 with Alex Albon sixth and defending Australian champion Carlos Sainz ninth. Alpines Pierre Gasly closed out the top-10 with his resurgent A525 car, three places ahead of his Aussie teammate Jack Doohan. ___ AP Formula 1: https://apnews.com/hub/formula-one",https://apnews.com/article/formula-1-australian-gp-8a4f42de90f5233d17e6c5223880382a,sports
"Young amateurs Justin Hastings, Hiroshi Tai part of Masters field repping 26 nations and territories","AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP)  Justin Hastings grew up on a Caribbean island akin to a tropical paradise, a golfers nirvana if only it had a few more holes. Hiroshi Tai picked up the game at Singapore Island Country Club, about as far from Augusta National as one could get. Yet the pair of amateurs have made it to the Masters, overcoming long odds to continue a tradition that was dear to club cofounder Bobby Jones. Hastings and Tai are among a field of 95 teeing off for the first round Thursday representing 26 countries and territories, the most in the tournaments history. In the case of Hastings, the second player ever from the Cayman Islands, the game was learned from his father, a casual player himself. The 21-year-old Latin America Amateur champion was soon getting dropped off after school every day to hit balls, even though his playing options were limited to an 18-hole public course and a 9-hole private course. I come from a competitive family. I was competing in tournaments very early, Hastings said, and I think thats what drove me especially is just getting better and seeing myself compete and eventually win. Lest anyone think he doesnt have some game, consider this: Hastings currently has the best career scoring average at San Diego State, a mark he took from Xander Schauffele, the reigning PGA Championship and British Open winner. I was not aware of that, said Schauffele, who met Hastings when he crashed one of the Aztecs practices. I would never have called myself some all-star in college, but thats good for him. And thank you for that. Thats helping my confidence. 
        
     There is no shortage of confidence in Tai, the first player from Singapore to earn a Masters invitation. It came after winning the NCAA championship last May, when the then-Georgia Tech sophomore outdueled two of the games top amateurs, Luke Clanton and Gordon Sargent. Obviously being at Georgia Tech, Tai said, theres a lot of history involved with the Masters with Bobby Jones being a founder, and obviously he played at Georgia Tech, graduated from there. So theres a lot of history at Georgia Tech and connected with the Masters. Its been a really cool experience. Mike Weir, Corey Conners, Taylor Pendrith and Nick Taylor were striding up the eighth hole during their practice round Tuesday when a fan wearing a green and yellow Make America Great Again cap politely clapped for them. The four Canadians just as politely acknowledged him. Turns out theres no place for partisan politics at the Masters. Probably more jokes about being the 51st state than anything, Taylor said, when asked what its like playing in the U.S. during this unsettled moment for longtime allies. Nothing crazy. Uber driver here or there that if somehow it comes up Im Canadian may apologize, may not. I dont know. Yeah, its definitely an interesting situation for us, but Ive been down here a long time. It is what it is. I try to ignore it, to be honest. Thats not always easy to do, especially when someone is trying to be frat-boy funny, Taylor said. I particularly dont find it that funny, he added. Seve Ballesteros was the first Spaniard to win at Augusta National. Carla Bernat Escuder is the latest, triumphing last weekend in the Augusta National Womens Amateur. In between came countrymen Jose Maria Olazbal, Sergio Garcia and Jon Rahm. Why has Spain produced so many champions at the home of the Masters? I think the main inspiration for all of us is simply one man, and thats Seve, said Rahm, the 2023 champion. What he did early on winning here as a 23-year-old, being the first European to win and being able to do it multiple times, it kind of set something special for Spanish players, and then Ollie quickly after followed that. I think it all started with Seve. At the same time, for the most part, Spanish players being known for being rather creative with good short games, I think thats usually a recipe that works really well at Augusta National. And theres no surprise that theres now five champions here. The Spaniards often stick together, too. Rahm was joined by Olazbal, Garcia and Josele Ballester  who last August became the first player from Spain to win the U.S. Amateur  for his practice round Tuesday. Rory McIlroy is not just trying to complete the career Grand Slam at Augusta National, the site of so much heartache and so many close calls. The Northern Irishman also is trying to deliver the Emerald Isle its first green jacket. McIlroy has been closest, finishing a distant second to Scottie Scheffler in 2022. His good buddy, former British Open champ Shane Lowry, tied for third the same year. Padraig Harrington won the British and PGA Championship but never did better than a tie for seventh at the Masters, while another British Open winner  Darren Clarke  never managed a top 20. Good results for those from Ireland and Northern Ireland. Just not quite good enough. Look, I think obviously if its not me, I hope its him, Lowry said of McIlroy triumphing on Sunday. Trying not to think about it too much because obviously it would be a very special thing to happen. Were both in good form, we have both prepared very well, I know that, and we both will give it our best shot. Thats all we can do. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/masters-augusta-national-ed24ca23d6516da5ff7ce3c42c7303c9,sports
Longtime Cubs fan revels in Pete Crow-Armstrong using his groups song for walkup music,"CHICAGO (AP)  John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life. During the teams last homestand, he got a text message from a high school friend. It was the first text he had received from him. Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had just used Front to Back  a song from Hauldrens electronic music group, Levity  as his walkup music in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. I was like What? Like, no way, Hauldren recalled. I, like, had to do my research for myself. Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star. Crow-Armstrongs girlfriend has a cousin who is friends with the girlfriend of PJ Carberry, another member of Levity. My girlfriend, her cousin and her sister actually all just went to go watch them in Arizona, Crow-Armstrong said. I had already been talking about making one of their songs my walkout, so I just decided to do it. Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry Junes Still Boomin for his walkup song. He said he isnt a big fan of dubstep  the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time  but he likes Levitys stuff. Music is a prominent part of Crow-Armstrongs daily routine, and he enjoys the process of picking a walkup song. Musics the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever, he said. 
        
     Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrongs baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side. But he was always a Cubs fan. It just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too, he said. So thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while. The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together. Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of Front to Back at their place in Bucktown  not far from Wrigley Field. My window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff, Hauldren said. And so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me. After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point. Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicagos Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group. Im just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs, he said. Like I couldnt be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/cubs-levity-music-7b62c36e78839c6ec3e1a5629a62c21b,sports
Coco Gauff routs Iga Swiatek to reach Madrid final against No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka,"MADRID (AP)  Coco Gauff overpowered defending champion Iga Swiatek 6-1, 6-1 to reach the Madrid Open singles final for the first time Thursday. Gauff broke Swiateks serve three times in the first set and twice in the second to cruise to a 64-minute semifinal victory over the second-ranked Swiatek at the clay-court tournament. Gauff will face top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, who defeated Elina Svitolina 6-3, 7-5 to reach the Madrid final for the fourth time in her career. It was Gauffs first win over Swiatek on clay. The mentality that I had in the whole match was aggressive, the fourth-ranked Gauff said. Maybe it wasnt her best level today, but I think I forced her into some awkward positions. Swiatek had recovered from losing the first set 0-6 to Madison Keys on Wednesday. I couldnt really get my level up, the four-time French Open champion said. Coco played good, but I think its on me that I didnt really move well, I wasnt ready to play back the shots with heaviness, and with that kind of game. It was pretty bad. The last time Swiatek won only two or fewer games in a match  on any surface  was a 6-0, 6-2 loss to Jelena Ostapenko in Birmingham in 2019. For me, Gauff added, it was just making sure my level stayed the same. In the second, I raised it. 
        
     Sabalenka returned to the final after ending Svitolinas unbeaten run on clay this year  she was 9-0 on the surface in 2025, without losing a set. Sabalenka won the title in Madrid in 2021 and 2023, and was runner-up to Swiatek last year. Gauff is 5-4 against Sabalenka and won their only prior meeting on clay, in Rome in 2021. The American also won their most recent meeting, at the 2024 WTA Finals in Riyadh. By beating Svitolina, Sabalenka became the first player to obtain 30 main-draw wins at WTA events in 2025. In the mens quarterfinals, Casper Ruud advanced by defeating Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 7-5 to become the first player born in 1990 or later to reach 30 tour-level semifinals on clay. The 15th-ranked Norwegian had been 0-3 against Medvedev in his career. I looked at our stats last night and saw he beat me on grass, outdoor hard and indoor hard. The last surface was clay so I thought, please dont make it 4-0, Ruud said. I tried to use the surface to my advantage. I thought the level was pretty good from both players, I was impressed with Daniils ability to produce power here on clay. Ruud will next face Francisco Cerundolo, who rallied to defeat teenager Jakub Mensik 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2. Cerundolo had beaten top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the previous round. In another quarterfinal, fifth-ranked Jack Draper defeated Matteo Arnaldi 6-0, 6-4. Arnaldi had beaten Novak Djokovic in the second round. Draper will enter the top 5 in the rankings for the first time thanks to his run in Madrid. He will face 10th-seeded Lorenzo Musetti, who beat Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 6-3. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/gauff-swiatek-sabalenka-madrid-open-arnaldi-mensik-54ec48fcf029defba658913eeec879ae,sports
The man who fell over a railing at PNC Park is in critical condition. Police say it was an accident,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  A man who fell from the 21-foot-high Clemente Wall in right field at PNC Park during Wednesday nights game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs remained in critical condition on Thursday morning. Pittsburgh Public Safety, which includes Pittsburgh Police and EMS, posted on X Thursday that the incident is being treated as accidental in nature. The man who fell was identified Thursday as Kavan Markwood, according to information supplied by the Southern Alleghany School District. District Workforce Development Coordinator Laura Thomson said in a statement that the district is keeping the former student and standout athlete in its thoughts and prayers. She identified Markwood was a 2022 graduate who made a lasting impact on the district community as an athlete and a man of character, and said he was MVP of the football team during his senior year. Thomsons statement said Markwood is best known for his resilience, strength and kindness. He is a friend to all  someone who lifts others up and faces challenges with courage and grace. Markwood fell onto the warning track in right field just as Pirates star Andrew McCutchen hit a two-run double in the seventh inning to put Pittsburgh ahead 4-3. Players began waving frantically for medical personnel and pointing to the man. Markwood was tended to for approximately five minutes by members of both the Pirates and Cubs training staffs as well as PNC personnel, before being removed from the field on a cart. He was taken to the trauma center at Allegheny General Hospital, where he remained on Thursday. 
        
     Pittsburgh owner Bob Nutting said the club was deeply saddened and truly heartbroken over what he called a terrible accident. In times like these, we must come together, support one another, and keep him and his loved ones in our prayers, Nutting said in a statement. We also want to thank and appreciate the efforts of the first responders who rushed to his attention and provided him with compassionate care. The railing that runs along the Clemente Wall in right field is three feet (36 inches) in height, which exceeds the building code requirements of 26 inches, according to Pirates vice president of communications Brian Warecki. Fans were sitting in the front row above the Clemente Wall on Thursday ahead of the series finale between the two teams. McCutchen, a five-time All-Star and franchise icon, said Thursday that the team was devastated, adding that they prayed together after the game. Asked to describe his viewpoint of the sequence, McCutchen declined, saying he is trying not to think about it and is more focused on the mans health. Were just hoping for the best for him, he said. I hope he pulls through because hes the reason why we are here. Hes the reason why we play the game. People that show their support so we can do something we love, partly because of him and because of fans. So, I just pray that hes all right. Pirates manager Derek Shelton and Cubs manager Craig Counsell both alerted the umpire crew of the situation immediately after the play. Even though its 350 feet away or whatever it is, I mean the fact of how it went down and then laying motionless while the play is going on, I mean Craig saw it, I saw it. We both got out there, Shelton said. I think the umpires saw it because of the way it kicked. Its extremely unfortunate. Thats an understatement. Players from both teams could be seen praying and McCutchen held a cross that hung from his neck while Markwood was taken off the field. The game was paused for several minutes while he received medical attention but there was no official stoppage in play. Police said any medical update on the fan will be provided by medical personnel in conjunction with the mans family. Fans have died from steep falls at baseball stadiums in the past. In 2015, Atlanta Braves season ticket holder Gregory K. Murrey flipped over guard rails from the upper deck at Turner Field. That was four years after Shannon Stone, a firefighter attending a game with his 6-year-old son, fell about 20 feet after reaching out for a foul ball tossed into the stands at the Texas Rangers former stadium. Both incidents prompted scrutiny over the height of guard rails at stadiums. The Rangers raised theirs, while the Braves settled a lawsuit with Murreys family. A spectator at a 2022 NFL game at Pittsburghs Acrisure Stadium died following a fall on an escalator. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/pittsburgh-pirates-fan-falls-chicago-cubs-2ff0eb48d03b98787b3523ed20e5ad3b,sports
"Ian Wilkes has helped train 2 Kentucky Derby winners, seeks first on his own with Burnham Square","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  Ian Wilkes viewed the reporters outside his barn as a sign he must be doing something right. The veteran trainer is thoroughly embracing the attention that Burnham Square has brought him as a Kentucky Derby starter. Even better, he is the points leader heading into Saturdays 151st running at Churchill Downs after entering the final big qualifying weekend on the margins. Its great to get to the Derby. Thats the race everyone wants to win, Wilkes said of his gelding, who rallied from the rear to earn 100 points at Keeneland on April 8 and vault to the top of the standings. He finished with 130 to edge Sandman (129) and Journalism (122.5), two of the Derby favorites. Wilkes added, Its been just a nice preparation for the horse. It gets better and better each time, just putting the building blocks together. Just keep building for the Derby. Whether that momentum carries over into a signature win remains to be seen, but the native Australian has his second Derby starter and first since McCraken finished eighth in 2017. Having visited the winners circle twice in different roles working for nowretired Hall of Fame trainer Carl Nafzger, Wilkes knows about the process and the rewards of draping that garland of roses. He was an exercise rider and groom for Nafzger while training Unbridled, who won the 1990 Derby and Preakness before closing the year with a Breeders Cup Classic victory that clinched the Eclipse Award as top 3-year-old. Wilkes was Nafzgers assistant in 2007, when Street Sense was a back marker through 3/4 mile before quickly surging into contention and beating Hard Spun by 2 1/4 lengths. 
        
     Everybody contributed, but something about Wilkes effort told Nafzger hed be successful in his own right. We had some good horses, but Ian just had a special way with them, good hands and a good eye for talent, Nafzger, 83, recalled about a relationship that began in the late 1980s. Wilkes had a bunch of graded stakes wins of his own by the time Nafzger turned the operation over to him in 2008. More victories have followed, highlighted by Breeders Cup Classic breakthrough in 2012 with Fort Larned. As Nafzger recalled watching Burnham Square work out last weekend beneath the Twin Spires, he also marveled at how personnel has remained stable under Wilkes. Consistency is key to success and Wilkes even-keeled skills in handling people and the rollercoaster nature of horse racing was cited among his many skills by Nafzger and colleagues. We all have good runs and we all have droughts, Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen said. His demeanor and his attitude and his temperament towards people is steady. I cant say that about myself. Right now, Wilkes is basking in a roll with Burnham Square that he hopes will continue in racings marquee event. Im going to enjoy every day and just have some fun, and hopefully its my turn, he said. Burnham Square has won two of three starts as a 3-year-old, sandwiching Blue Grass and Holy Bull stakes wins around a fourth in the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream. Despite topping the Derby standings, he will start the $5 million, 1 1/4-mile Triple Crown opener facing 12-1 odds from the No. 9 post beside red-hot 3-1 favorite Journalism, aiming to become just the fifth winner from that spot and first since Riva Ridge in 1972. And unlike the Blue Grass  where he trailed the field through two turns before moving forward and eventually running down pacesetter East Avenue in the stretch  there are 19 other competitors to navigate. Burnham Square will be ridden by jockey Brian Hernandez Jr., who guided the stunning comeback at Keeneland and swept last years Derby and Kentucky Oaks aboard Mystik Dan and filly Thorpedo Anna, respectively. Even with a chance to become the first jockey to win back-to-back Derbys since Victor Espinoza 10 years ago, Hernandez looks forward to rewarding Wilkes and owner Janis Whitham with a seminal achievement. They put me on my first Grade 1 winner with Fort Larned, and Im fortunate enough to win a Breeders Classic, he said. But to come back and win a Kentucky Derby for him, that would be the ultimate for the Whitham family and Ian as well. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-derby-churchill-downs-52ac1ab16612ecd1f26ef638336d72cb,sports

The 30-year-old Robert had been a career minor leaguer before making his big league debut last season, when he allowed two runs over 5 2/3 innings in four appearances for Texas. He had been off to a good start this season at Triple-A Round Rock, too, with a 1.54 ERA through his first 10 appearances. The Phillies plan to start him off at Triple-A Lehigh Valley. The 20-year-old Segura began last season with the Phillies rookie-level club before moving up to Class A Clearwater, where he initially struggled.

Royals option Noah Cameron to Triple-A after he took a no-hitter into the seventh in his MLB debut,"The Kansas City Royals optioned Noah Cameron back to Triple-A Omaha on Thursday, one day after the left-hander took a no-hitter into the seventh inning in his big league debut against the Rays in Tampa Bay. Cameron was called upon to make a spot start for staff ace Cole Ragans, who has been dealing with a sore groin. He did not allow a hit until Curtis Meads one-out single down the left-field line in the seventh. Royals manager Matt Quatraro promptly took him out of the game, and the Kansas City relief corps finished off the 3-0 victory over the Rays. You cant put it into words, said Cameron, who grew up rooting for the Royals in St. Joseph, Missouri, about an hours drive north of their home at Kauffman Stadium. It is something Ive always dreamed about, especially with this team. And it is just crazy. Not what you would expect, but Im glad to get out of there with what happened. You just cant make it up. No pitcher has thrown a no-hitter for Kansas City since Bret Saberhagen on Aug. 26, 1991, a span of 5,244 games that represents the third-longest active no-hit drought in the majors. Only the Guardians and Blue Jays have gone longer. I thought he was going to do it, Quatraro said. The pitch count was really manageable. ... We know he throws strikes, and he was challenging guys. He had a good mix. Just really impressive. Kansas City delivered three defensive gems to help Camerons bid. In the first inning, Hunter Renfroes leaping catch against the right-field wall robbed Yandy Diaz of extra bases. Maikel Garcia stabbed Meads hard-hit grounder in the second to start a double play. And in the third, Bobby Witt Jr. snagged Jose Caballeros grounder in the hole and threw him out at first. 
        
     The 25-year-old Cameron wound up throwing 79 pitches, allowing that one hit with five walks and three strikeouts over 6 1/3 innings. Hes the first player to throw that many hitless frames in his big league debut since the Blue Jays Nick Kingham, who got two outs in the seventh inning against the Cardinals on April 29, 2018. The splendid start by Cameron shouldnt have come as a complete surprise. He is widely considered among the organizations top five prospects, and he was 2-0 with a 3.22 ERA over his first five starts for Omaha this season. In corresponding roster moves Thursday, the Royals selected right-hander Taylor Clarke from Omaha to provide some additional depth in the bullpen, and they transferred right-hander James McArthur to the 60-day injured list. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/kansas-city-royals-noah-cameron-mlb-no-hitter-fc14df98a620852c7e13fec1be8bb5ce,sports
"Michigan State athletic director Alan Haller leaving, Tom Izzo will be co-interim AD","EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP)  Michigan State athletic director Alan Haller is leaving the school and deputy athletic director Jennifer Smith and mens basketball coach Tom Izzo will serve as co-interim ADs, university president Kevin Guskiewicz announced Thursday. Hallers last day will be May 11. Guskiewicz did not disclose the reason for Hallers exit. Im grateful for Alans leadership since I joined the university and appreciate the success our programs have seen under his leadership, Guskiewicz said in a statement. He is deeply committed to this university and has led with honesty and integrity. Guskiewicz said a national search would begin to find a successor to Haller, who was promoted from deputy athletic director in 2021. Haller played football and ran track at Michigan State and later worked 13 years in the schools Department of Police and Public Safety. He joined the athletic department in 2010 and had a number of roles. Under Haller, the Spartans won Big Ten championships in mens basketball, womens soccer, womens gymnastics, mens hockey and womens cross country, as well as postseason appearances for several programs. This is a pivotal time for college athletics, where innovation, effective communications and community engagement are more important than ever, Guskiewicz said. Our next athletic director will lead one of the nations more storied athletic programs, home to 23 varsity sports, a passionate fan base, a long legacy of academic and athletic excellence and, most importantly, an ambitious future. 
        
     Hallers exit comes as Division I programs prepare for major changes in college athletics. Schools will be allowed to share up to $20.5 million in revenue with athletes beginning July 1, pending final approval of a multibillion-dollar antitrust settlement. The direct payments to athletes will be in addition to third-party name, image and likeness deals facilitated by school-affiliated collectives. Mens basketball has continued to be the Spartans most successful revenue sport under Haller, with Izzos team winning the 2025 Big Ten regular-season championship and reaching the NCAA Elite Eight. Football is in a three-year down cycle. The Spartans were 5-7 overall and 3-6 in the Big Ten last season, Jonathan Smiths first, and they are projected to finish in the bottom half of the conference again this year. Haller earned high marks for his hiring of womens basketball coach Robyn Fralick, who has led the Spartans to back-to-back 20-win seasons and NCAA Tournament appearances, and mens hockey coach Adam Nightingale, whose program has swept Big Ten regular-season and tournament titles two straight years. It has been a tumultuous decade for Michigan State athletics off the field of play. Haller was an associate athletic director when a female Michigan State graduate filed a complaint about disgraced sports doctor Larry Nassars sexual abuse in 2014. MSU agreed to pay $500 million to settle claims from more than 300 women and girls who said they were assaulted by Nassar, who is serving a life sentence in a federal prison. Three months into his tenure in 2021, Haller signed off on a $95 million, 10-year contract for football coach Mel Tucker. Two years later Tucker was fired after he was said to have sexually harassed activist and rape survivor Brenda Tracy during a phone call in April 2022. In 2022, seven Michigan State football players were charged for their actions during a melee in Michigan Stadiums tunnel after a loss to the Wolverines. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",https://apnews.com/article/michigan-state-spartans-haller-izzo-ba2c4c7e5e0c732c28eaa76844c8db9f,sports
Rangers put catcher Kyle Higashioka on the 10-day injured list with a rib muscle strain,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  The Texas Rangers placed catcher Kyle Higashioka on the 10-day injured list Thursday with a mild left intercostal strain and recalled right-hander Caleb Boushley from Triple-A Round Rock for their game against the Athletics. The move for Higashioka is retroactive to Wednesday, when he sat out a 7-1 loss to the As with sore ribs. The Rangers selected Tucker Barnhart from Round Rock before that game and he was in the lineup at catcher for the series finale Thursday. Higashioka, who signed a two-year deal with Texas in December, is hitting .254 with a homer and eight RBIs in 17 games. Boushley allowed five runs in three appearances covering 7 2/3 innings for Texas earlier this season. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/texas-rangers-kyle-higashioka-7858920ad82970675c227110fc056a71,sports
"Road to Garcia-Haney rematch runs through Times Square, where both box Friday in famed New York spot","NEW YORK (AP)  The road to a Ryan Garcia-Devin Haney rematch runs right through the heart of Times Square. When they fought last year, Garcia initially opposed bringing the match to New York, believing a bout between two California boxers belonged in the West. But Oscar De La Hoya, a superstar during his own career and now Garcias promoter, argued that to be really big, a fighter had to conquer the Big Apple. Look at Garcia now. Its hard to miss him in the city, his face plastered on billboards towering high above Times Square  right below where the ball drops on New Years Eve and where he and Haney return Friday night in separate bouts in a ring set up in the center of the citys famed tourist spot. Im just excited to be back here in New York after such a historic event last time, Garcia said. It felt so sweet, so were going to have to do it again sooner or later, right? Thats the plan. If Garcia (24-1, 20 KOs) beats Rolando Rolly Romero (16-2, 13 KOs) in the main event, after Haney (31-0, 15 KOs) meets fellow former 140-pound champion Jose Ramirez (29-2, 18 KOs), a rematch of Garcias victory last year that was later overturned to a no-contest when he failed a test for performance-enhancing drugs is expected. Garcia would be the fan favorite if it happened in New York, where locals booed Haney on Wednesday during the final news conference. 
        
     When I dust Jose Ramirez off on Friday, Im going to get to your boy Ryan after, Haney shouted back. Teofimo Lopez (21-1, 13 KOs) defends his junior welterweight title against Arnold Barboza Jr. (32-0, 11 KOs) in the opener of the tripleheader that will be streamed on DAZN pay-per-view. Six excellent fighters, but the talk of this card is the venue. Itll be all about staying focused. The fighters have to be laser focused, De La Hoya said while standing in the ring that was still being constructed Thursday as traffic passed by. Dont pay attention to all the noise outside of this ring. Its going to be very difficult for every single fighter, because as you can imagine there will be people everywhere, thousands of people watching. Organizers still havent revealed all the details, and De La Hoya wasnt sure how many people will have access to watch live from seats near the ring. Theyre talking about having us be presented to the ring in a cab or something, Lopez said. Getting around in a taxi in Midtown Manhattan on a Friday night? Good luck with that. Tell me about it. I feel like they dont understand, said Lopez, who is from Brooklyn. Especially in Times Square. But Ring Magazine wanted something unique for its first event in the U.S., bypassing the possibility of having the event at Madison Square Garden or Barclays Center. It was at the latter venue in Brooklyn last April 20 when Garcia and Haney met in a event that turned into somewhat of a fiasco, largely due to Garcias erratic behavior in the buildup. He was more than 3 pounds over the limit the day before the fight, showing no care in the world as he chugged what appeared to be a bottle of beer while on the scale during the ceremonial weigh-in event after the official one had already been conducted behind closed doors. That left him ineligible to take Haneys title after he scored three knockdowns and won a majority decision. Eventually he didnt even get the win, with the result changed and Garcia suspended for a year after his positive test. Garcia said he was going through some personal problems at that time that included drinking and smoking but is in a much better state of mind these days. Im just here living life, he said, wearing a suit and tie. Everybody goes through their ups and downs, everybody goes through their things, but its how you come back, its how you bounce back and Im just here to show people that you can bounce back from anything. More than 100 screens are expected to be set up around Times Square. There were no details about contingencies for the weather, with the forecast calling for a chance of thunderstorms in the New York area Friday. The elements are one reason why Lopez, who is normally in the main event, is content to fight a few hours earlier this time. Its cool, man. Its perfect. I dont mind it, he said. Look, the weather is only going to get more chillier outdoors. Ill be up first, Im happy with it. Ill get in and out. ___ AP boxing: https://apnews.com/boxing",https://apnews.com/article/times-square-boxing-garcia-haney-lopez-a9e127a89aaeebc9ed4f933fb7852cd6,sports
Diamondbacks place reliever Justin Martinez on 15-day IL with right shoulder inflammation,"NEW YORK (AP)  The Arizona Diamondbacks placed reliever Justin Martinez on the 15-day injured list with right shoulder inflammation Thursday, a day after after his velocity dipped while he failed to record an out against the New York Mets. To replace Martinez, the Diamondbacks recalled left-hander Jos Castillo from Triple-A Reno. Left-handed reliever A.J. Puk (left elbow inflammation) was moved to the 60-day injured list. Martinez entered with a three-run lead in the ninth inning Wednesday night, but allowed Tyrone Taylors homer before walking Francisco Lindor and Juan Soto. Ryan Thompson got the final three outs in the 4-3 win. Martinezs fastball was clocked between 95 and 96 mph  down a couple of mph from his previous appearances against the Atlanta Braves last Friday and Saturday and down 5 mph from his peak velocity last season. Martinez, who flew back to Arizona on Thursday morning to undergo an MRI, battled right shoulder fatigue during the back half of April. It was clear last night, we were all watching the same thing  his stuff was down, Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said Thursday before the series finale against the Mets. Were going to find out whats going on with his shoulder. He feels strongly theres nothing wrong, but we felt like, at the very least, we give him a little bit of a blow, get him healthy, get him back to full speed. Thats the most important thing. Lovullo said he didnt know who would step in as the closer for the Diamondbacks. Martinez and Puk have combined for seven of Arizonas nine saves this season. 
        
     We miss A.J. and were going to miss J-Mart  but theyre going to heal and theyre going to come back and help us win games, Lovullo said. In the meantime, everybodys going to hold down the fort, keep their seats warm  hold down the fort and help us win baseball games. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/diamondbacks-justin-martinez-41f2d35f73dc80c30b7703db3cd2fc05,sports
"Mumbais big win ends Rajasthan IPL playoffs bid, 14-year-old Suryavanshi dismissed for 0 runs","JAIPUR, India (AP)  Crickets 14-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi was out for a two-ball duck as the Mumbai Indians won their first Indian Premier League game in Jaipur since 2012 and ended the Rajasthan Royals hopes of qualifying for the playoffs on Thursday. Mumbai top-order batters, led by half-centuries from opening pair of Ryan Rickelton (61) and Rohit Sharma (53), carried the five-time champion to 217-2 after Rajasthan captain Riyan Parag won the toss and elected to field. Suryavanshi, who made headlines with his scintillating 35-ball century against Gujarat Titans last Monday, was caught off the second ball he faced from fast bowler Deepak Chahar and Rajasthan folded for 117 to lose by 100 runs. With its sixth straight victory, Mumbai displaced Royal Challengers atop the table on a better net run-rate with both teams having 14 points. Rajasthans eight defeats in 11 games has put them out of contention for the playoffs. Rajasthan couldnt recover from 47-5 inside the batting powerplay when Trent Boult (3-28) and Jasprit Bumrah (2-15) picked up two wickets each before Impact Player Karn Sharma spun the lower order to finish with 3-23. Yashasvi Jaiswal (13) smacked two sixes against Boults first three deliveries before the left-arm New Zealand fast bowler hit the right length and shattered the stumps. Boult then had Nitish Rana caught at deep square leg before Bumrah struck twice in his first over when Prag and Shimron Hetmyer both got undone by fast bowlers short pitch deliveries as Rajasthan lost half of its side in space of first 29 balls. Sharma then took three wickets in space of his seven balls and Rajasthan was in danger to fold for less than 100 before Archer made top-scored with 30 off 27 balls. Boult then finished off the game when he beat Archer with a slower bouncer and was had him caught at fine leg. Left-hander Rickelton and Sharma laid a solid platform of a big total as they stitched Mumbais first century opening wicket partnership in IPL outside home since 2020 by combining in a 116-run stand. Sharma successfully overturned onfield lbw decision against him of left-arm fast bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi early in the powerplay with Rajasthan bowlers getting some early swing. After a cautious start in the first three overs both batters smashed 42 runs in the next three overs to get Mumbai going. Rickelton hit seven fours and three sixes before he played across the line and was clean bowled by Maheesh Theekshana (1-47) and Sharma, who made his rare half-century in T20s without a six, holed out in the outfield of Parag (1-12) while searching for his first six. Yadav attacked from the onset and created a new IPL record of 11 consecutive scores of 25 or more as he showed plenty of intent against spinners and fast bowlers. Yadav hit four boundaries and three sixes as Rajasthan bowlers, including Jofra Archer tried to bowl yorkers but missed their lengths frequently. Pandya too manipulated the field well by staying deep in his crease and hit six fours and a six as both batters scored at more than 12 an over in the last seven overs. Farooqi and Archer were smashed for 96 runs of their combined eight overs while fast bowler Akash Madhwal, who made his IPL debut after Sandeep Sharma was ruled out due to broken finger, returned with figures of 0-39. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/rajasthan-mumbai-ipl-c4a8a3559aacff76b019dc475fdaf37a,sports
"After loss in Madrid, Swiatek hopes to start moving better to rebound from recent struggles","MADRID (AP)  Iga Swiateks struggles continue. Again unable to move well on the court, the five-time Grand Slam champion extended her streak of not reaching a final after a demoralizing 6-1, 6-1 loss to Coco Gauff in the semifinals of the Madrid Open on Thursday. Swiatek hasnt gotten past the last-four in any tournament since winning the French Open  for the fourth time  last June. She hadnt won just two or fewer games in a match on any surface since 2019. I feel like I havent been moving well, Swiatek said. The tennis also was like on and off, you know, for most of the tournament. So I wasnt really sure what I have in my tool box. I didnt even have a plan B because nothing was working today. The second-ranked Swiatek said everything kind of collapsed because of her difficulties moving on the court. I feel like I wasnt even in the right place with my feet, you know, before the shots, she said. Yeah, I wish I would have moved better, because I think that would get me an opportunity to bounce back, because this is usually what happens. But today for sure I didnt move well. Swiatek lost six games in a row for the second straight day. She had recovered from losing the first set 0-6 to Madison Keys on Wednesdays quarterfinals. In her opening match in Madrid, Swiatek trailed teenager Alexandra Eala a set and a break before bouncing back. I didnt play well even on these matches that I won, Swiatek said. I think I pushed kind of with my head, you know, for more than I even should, tennis-wise. 
        
     The last time Swiatek won only two or fewer games on any surface was a 6-0, 6-2 loss to Jelena Ostapenko in Birmingham in 2019. The 23-year-old Pole said hopefully one day its going to click, but Im not expecting anything, Im just going to try to work on trying to move better and give herself greater chances. For sure I feel heavy, and you are like forcing everything instead of going by intuition and by itself, you know, she said. Because I know how I can move, and usually I didnt have to think about it much. But for last weeks it hasnt been that easy. Ive been like forcing myself to go lower, to be more precise with my feet, because its not going by itself. Swiatek said she didnt think her struggles moving were linked to a lack of self confidence. No, because I felt fine today, she said. Im not a different player than I was like for past years in terms of my attitude or my emotions. Swiatek, a four-time French Open champion, has been nearly unbeatable on clay, according to the WTA. Only Steffi Graf (.750) has a higher win rate against top 10 opponents than Swiatek (.700) in the previous 35 years. Swiatek was the defending champion at the Madrid Open. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/iga-swiatek-madrid-open-gauff-2ebe06c9b618a86b98606b3eb936b794,sports
"Cubs take Paul Skenes deep 3 times, Suzuki homers twice in all as Chicago pulls away for 8-3 win","PITTSBURGH (AP)  Dansby Swanson, Kyle Tucker and Seiya Suzuki all took Pirates ace Paul Skenes deep in the fifth inning as the Cubs pulled away for an 8-3 victory on Thursday. Suzuki later added a two-run shot off reliever Kyle Nicolas as Chicago took two of three from the last-place Pirates. Skenes (3-3), fresh off a masterful performance in a win over the Los Angeles Dodgers last Friday, labored through his shortest start of the season.  The 22-year-old reigning National League Rookie of the Year lasted just five innings. His four walks matched his total on the season coming in and the aggressive Cubs pounced in the fifth to turn a two-run deficit into a 3-2 lead. Swanson led off the fifth with his sixth homer. Tucker added his eighth two batters later and Suzuki put Chicago in front to stay with a shot to the left-field bleachers. Ian Happ, a Pittsburgh native, had three hits. Swanson, Suzuki and Michael Busch had two hits apiece for the Cubs. Colin Rea (2-0) allowed two runs in a season-high six innings for Chicago. Bryan Reynolds hit his ninth home run for Pittsburgh. The Pirates have dropped four of five. A crowd of 13,633 turned out for the matinee, including some in the same front-row seats in right field above the 21-foot high Clemente Wall where a fan fell from on Wednesday night. The unidentified male was in critical condition at Allegheny General Hospital on Thursday after what Pittsburgh Police described as an accident. The public address announcer read a statement from Pirates owner Bob Nutting before the first pitch in which Nutting called the incident one of the most difficult moments many of us have ever experienced.

"MLB offense rises with temperature, batting average of .242 up from .240 through April last year","NEW YORK (AP)  Baseball offense has picked up as the temperature has climbed in much of the U.S., raising the major league batting average above the level from early last season. Batters are hitting .242 through April, up from .240 through the first full month of the 2024 season but down from .248 through April in 2023. MLBs overall batting average was .239 through the first full week of the season, starting at .231 through the partial initial week and .243 for the first full week.

Right-hander batters are hitting .242, down one percentage point through April 30 last year, and lefties are hitting .241, a rise of five percentage points. Last years final batting average of .243 was higher in the post-1900 era than only .237 in 1968, .239 in 1908, .242 in 1967 and .2427 in 2022. The average rose to .248 in 2023 in the first season of restrictions on defensive shifts.  Nine-inning games are averaging 2 hours, 37 minutes, the same as through the first full month last year.

Vinnie Pasquantino had a single, a double and two RBIs for the Royals, who have won nine of their past 10.  The crowd of 8,794 was the first non-sellout in 22 games this season for the Rays at Steinbrenner Field. Mikael Garcia hit a line-drive double to center field for the Royals, stole third base and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Michael Massey to tie it 1-1 in the fourth.

"Juan Soto hits his first homers at Citi Field with the Mets, but D-Backs win 4-2","NEW YORK (AP)  Juan Soto hit his first two home runs at Citi Field as a member of the Mets on Thursday afternoon, but the Arizona Diamondbacks earned a 4-2 win to hand New York a rare home series loss. The Diamondbacks won the final two games of the three-game series  the first time the Mets have lost back-to-back contests at Citi Field since July 27-28, when they fell to the Atlanta Braves. New York, which is 13-3 at Citi Field this season, had its franchise-record streak of 10 straight home series wins snapped. Zac Gallen (2-4) allowed only two hits over six innings.

Pirates star Paul Skenes endures an erratic start during loss to the Cubs,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  Paul Skenes could tell during his pregame bullpen session on Thursday that he wasnt quite right.  The Chicago Cubs then went out and offered tangible proof, taking the Pittsburgh ace deep three times in the fifth inning of what became an 8-3 Pirates loss on Thursday in a performance that was decidedly unSkenes-like, at least by the 22-year-olds remarkably high standards. It started during his intricate warm-up, when the impeccable command thats defined so much of the reigning National League Rookie of the Years rise to stardom abandoned him.  Bullpen was a little all over the place, Skenes said after falling to 3-3. And then went out in the game and was a little all over the place. Skenes had allowed four walks across his first six starts. He matched that total in the first three innings, including a sequence in the third in which he threw 12 of 15 pitches for balls to walk the bases loaded.  While he escaped thanks to an inning-ending double play, the reprieve didnt last. Dansby Swanson turned an 0-2 splitter that stayed high and over the middle of the plate into his sixth home run of the season. Three batters later, Kyle Tucker sent a 96 mph fastball  a tick lower than the velocity Skenes usually averages  into nearly the same spot in right-center where Swansons homer landed to tie the game. Skenes then fell behind Seiya Suzuki 3-0. Chicago manager Craig Counsell let Suzuki swing away and Suzuki delivered with a shot to the bleachers in left field to put the Cubs in front to stay. 
        
     Hes a great pitcher, Suzuki said afterward through a translator. He might not have been in the best condition today. But with him, youve got to stay aggressive. In that count, I was hoping for him to just throw it in the zone and Im glad I got my A swing off. Skenes had only allowed one homer on the season and 11 total across his first 29 starts. The Cubs clobbered more than a quarter of that total in a five-batter stretch to beat Skenes for the first time in five tries since the top overall pick in the 2023 amateur draft made his debut against Chicago nearly a year ago. They fouled off some good pitches, hit some good pitches, Skenes said. Ive just got to execute better. There was also a bit of fatigue involved. Skenes dazzled in a victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers last week, shutting out the World Series champions over 6 1/3 innings in a start that served as a homecoming for the Southern California native. Six days later, on a sticky mid-spring day less than 24 hours removed from a nightmarish scene in which a fan fell off the 21-foot-high Clemente Wall at PNC Park in the middle of the game, Skenes wasnt quite as crisp against the highest-scoring team in the majors. Bench coach Don Kelly  filling in for Pirates manager Derek Shelton, who was attending his sons college graduation  chalked it up to just one of those starts. Hes a competitor, man, Kelly said of Skenes. He went out there and gives you everything hes got every single day. He wanted to keep going and get after it. I dont think his stuff was as sharp there in the third, and then in the fifth it trended down too. Skenes struck out just two batters, a career low, and gave up loud contact from the first pitch. He retired the Cubs in order in the first but Ian Happ, Tucker and Suzuki all made loud outs, the exit velocity on all three of the outs registering more than 90 mph. The Cubs have now seen Skenes more than any other opponent during his still-young career. Its been a bit of a mixed bag. He one-hit them for six innings in his second major-league start but also slogged through five innings against them in late August, only to toss five shutout innings in a rematch the next week. I think it changes a little bit each time, Skenes said. They came out swinging today. Didnt really change throughout the game. Just got to a few pitches. It didnt help that he didnt receive much run support. Thursday marked the third straight start in which the Pirates scored three runs or fewer and only once this season has Pittsburgh had more than four runners cross the plate when Skenes is on the hill. The last-place Pirates are just 3-4 when Skenes starts, even with his ERA at 2.74, just outside the top 10 in the National League. His next three starts could all be on the road. His next scheduled turns in the rotation are at St. Louis, the New York Mets and Philadelphia. Skenes, a diligent student of the game who has already developed a reputation as one of the most meticulous preparers in baseball, isnt confused about what the problem was on Thursday. Or on how to fix it next time out. Execute my pitches, he said. Thats the biggest one. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/paul-skenes-pittsburgh-pirates-84a80f5fe8209772e7cf7623d75ae204,sports
Former Brazil coach Dorival Jnior taking over Corinthians to the end of 2026,"SAO PAULO (AP)  Former Brazil coach Dorival Jnior signed with Corinthians on Monday to the end of 2026. It is his first job since he was fired by the five-time World Cup champion in March after losing to Argentina 4-1 in 2026 qualifying. Jniors first match in charge of Corinthians will be on Wednesday in the Brazilian Cup against Novorizontino. It is an important moment of my career. I hope to leave a legacy, Jnior said in a video shared by Corinthians on social media. He takes over from Argentine coach Ramn Diaz, who was fired this month. The team including Dutch striker Memphis Depay has defense problems. Corinthians is 12th in the Brazilian league after six matches, with seven points.

Barcelona targets European title hat trick after winning UEFA Youth League final,"NYON, Switzerland (AP)  Barcelona is on course for a hat trick of European titles after beating Trabzonspor 4-1 in the UEFA Youth League final on Monday. It was won the day after Barcelona reached the Womens Champions League final and two days before the mens team hosts Inter Milan in the first leg of the Champions League semifinals. Leading from the 11th minute, on the first of two precise left-foot strikes by Mali youth international Ibrahim Diarra, Barcelona was rarely tested to claim a record third European youth title. Trabzonspor got a deserved goal in the 88th. No club has swept European titles at each level since the Youth League started in the 2013-14 season. Barcelona won the inaugural edition and also lifted the trophy in 2018. Barcelonas youth system is so strong that first-team players Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsi were still eligible for the under-19 team that plays in the UEFA Youth League. The starting lineup on Monday had 10 players older than superstar winger Yamal, who turned 17 last July on the eve of helping Spain win the European Championship final against England. Barcelona was too strong for Trabzonspor, the first Turkish team to reach even the round of 16 in the competition. Hundreds of its noisy claret-and-blue fans outnumbered Barcelonas support in the small stadium next to UEFA headquarters. Diarras opening goal was added to in the 18th when defender Andres Cuenca tapped in a loose ball after goalkeeper Erol Can olak pushed away a powerful header by Landry Farr. 
        
     Barcelona captain Hugo Alba placed a rising shot in the 57th and Diarra again found the bottom corner of the net in the 68th. A late header by Trabzonspor defender Bican Tibukolu hardly dimmed the celebrations for Barcelona, which could have a stellar end to the season. The La Liga-leading mens team must get past Inter over two legs to earn a Champions League final on May 31 in Munich against Paris Saint-Germain or Arsenal. The womens team faces Arsenal in their Champions League final on May 24 in Lisbon. The youth team coached by Juliano Belletti  who scored a Champions League-winning goal for Barcelona against Arsenal in 2006  did its part on Monday. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/uefa-youth-league-final-barcelona-trabzonspor-b92a78ea16f060701e5a97b090a0122c,sports
Arteta rallies Arsenal to believe in Champions League glory ahead of semifinals against PSG,"LONDON (AP)  Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is urging his players to believe they can win the Champions League for the first time because they have already beaten the best opposition you can face in the competition. Defeating defending champion Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in the quarterfinals  after victories home and away  has raised expectations that Arsenal can go all the way. Arteta acknowledged everyone associated with Arsenal is feeling the weight of history heading into the semifinals against Paris Saint-Germain, starting with the first leg at Emirates Stadium on Tuesday, and he wants his team to embrace that. Asked whether Arsenal should be classed as the tournament favorite after its displays against Madrid, Arteta said they have generated enthusiasm and possibilities no one probably expected. But when you look at our history  and you go back to our history  we have never done it, he said. So there is so much to do. Hopefully if someone believes we can do it, its because of the performances and what the team is transmitting against big opposition. Arsenal lost the Champions League final to Barcelona in 2006 and in the semifinals to Manchester United in 2009, and hasnt been back to the last four since. Theres a lot of people working at the club for many, many years and theyve never been in this position, Arteta said. That tells you how unique and beautiful it is. It is the biggest competition, the European Cup, and weve never done it. We need to earn the right to be in that final. 
        
     Arteta is taking inspiration from Arsenal reaching the Womens Champions League final for the first time since 2007 after beating record eight-time champion Lyon 4-1 on Sunday. Its incredible what they have done, Arteta said. To achieve it in the manner they have done it, theyve shown the road, the pathway, how we can do it. In a rallying cry, Arteta urged fans to bring your boots, your shorts, your T-shirts and lets play every ball together against PSG in the hope of recreating the atmosphere at the Emirates for the first leg against Madrid, which Arsenal won 3-0. If we want to do something special, he said, that place has to be something special that we havent seen. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/arsenal-arteta-champions-league-psg-136a703b4bced718533d74f7d6d605a2,sports
Bologna misses out on Serie A top four after draw,"UDINE, Italy (AP)  Bologna held on for a scoreless draw at Udinese in Serie A on Monday and a precious point in its bid to play in European competition next season. Bologna dominated possession but goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski was made to work much harder than his counterpart. The team was one point out of the top four Champions League qualifying places. Bologna played in the Champions League this season for the first time in 60 years. Lazio could have replaced Bologna in fifth place but drew at home with Parma 2-2 from 2-0 down.

In the U.S., ESPN.  Other countries are listed here. The 5.2-kilometer (3.2-mile) Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit is laid out around a lake in Melbournes inner suburbs and uses roads which are open to the public for the remainder of the year. Its a relatively fast track but overtaking is often difficult. This will be the first time since 2019 that Australia hosts the season-opening race. The 2020 Australian GP was cancelled two hours before the scheduled season-opening racing weekend because of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the lowlights of Max Verstappens 2024 world championship season was at Melbourne Park, where he went out in the fourth lap of the race with a fiery mechanical failure.

      Lando Norris says hell drive with elbows out to compete with Max Verstappen this F1 season  Meet Formula 1s biggest rookie class in year  Lewis Hamilton wants to win another F1 title at 40. It hasnt been done since the 1960s 5  Verstappen is targeting a fifth world title in a row. Only three other drivers  including Lewis Hamilton  have won five titles. Of those, only Michael Schumacher won five consecutively.  8  Hamilton is aiming to win a record-breaking eighth title after joining his new team, Ferrari. 24 - The Australian Grand Prix kicks off a 24-race schedule, matching the record set last year for the longest F1 season. Lewis Hamilton qualified eighth-fastest in his Ferrari debut as McLarens Lando Norris claimed pole position. Norris went into the third session of final qualifying on the back foot after his first lap was deleted for track limit infringements at turn four, where he had all four wheels off the track. Norris teammate and Melbourne-born Oscar Piastri was second, enabling McLaren to lock out the front row for the second straight race, following 2024s season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Red Bulls Max Verstappen, the defending world champion, claimed third, shrugging off pre-season pace concerns for the team about its RB21 car. It isnt quite where we wanted to be but overall Im satisfied with the progress we have made over the past two days ... but given this is a weekend of firsts for me, I didnt underestimate how steep the learning curve would be  Hamilton on qualifying eighth.

Piastri signs multi-year extension at McLaren ahead of new Formula 1 season,"WOKING, England (AP)  Oscar Piastri has signed a multi-year contract extension with McLaren, the F1 team said Tuesday. The announcement came five days before the first race of the new season at Piastris home Australian Grand Prix. Piastri was already under contract at McLaren until the end of next season. The team didnt give details of the extension but said it meant the 23-year-old Piastri would be staying for the long term. Its a great feeling knowing that Im part of McLarens long-term vision, Piastri said in a statement. The team had the belief in me when we signed in 2022, and the journey weve gone on over the past two seasons to help return McLaren to the very top of the sport has been incredible. Piastri made his F1 debut with McLaren in 2023 after a contract dispute with Alpine. The Australian won two races last year to help McLaren to win the constructors title. He was fourth in the drivers standings as Max Verstappen held off a challenge from Piastris McLaren teammate Lando Norris to win the title. McLaren chief executive Zak Brown said it was a no-brainer to extend Piastris contract. Weve got the best driver lineup on the grid, and in the past two seasons, weve seen how much of an asset to the team Oscar is both on and off track, Brown said. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/mclaren-oscar-piastri-contract-f1-a5c9b73cba628a8d894cafe2c37c5968,sports
Domenicali agrees to five-year extension to stay on as F1 president and CEO through 2029,"Stefano Domenicali, who has overseen Formula 1s explosive growth on the calendar and popularity in recent years, will stay on as president and chief executive through 2029 through a five-year contract extension, the global racing series and ownership group Liberty Media announced Wednesday. The 59-year-old Italian has been in charge of F1 since 2021 and has steered the series as it expanded to 24 races, added sprint events and two new U.S. grand prix in Miami and Las Vegas, and will add an 11th team, American-owned Cadillac Formula 1, in 2026. The series is in the final year of its U.S. broadcast deal with ESPN. Stefano has been an excellent steward of the business, building on its successful foundation and accelerating Formula 1s rate of growth both commercially and in fan engagement, said Derek Chang, president and CEO of Liberty Media. His energy and enthusiasm for the sport translate into highly effective strategy and results. Domenicali is a former Ferrari team principal and Lamborghini CEO. I am honored to continue to lead this incredible sport, which I love and has been part of my life since my childhood and grateful to the Liberty Media Team for their trust, Domenicali said. Domenicali took over as president and CEO after the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. The series was on the cusp of rapid growth, notably in the U.S., fueled by its popular Drive to Survive series on Netflix and the tumultuous drivers championship duel in 2021 between Mercedes Lewis Hamilton and Red Bulls Max Verstappen. Verstappen won the title in a disputed final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. 
        
     Since then, the series added races in Miami in 2022 and Las Vegas in 2023, and returned to China last year for the first time since the pandemic. It also signed a 10-year sponsorship deal with French luxury brand giant LVMH. His tenure has not been without bumps in the road. The series initially rejected a bid for the 11th team when it was headed by Michael Andretti, prompting an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. Domenicali was rumored last year to possibly leave F1 for MotoGP once Libertys purchase of the global motorcycle racing series was approved. The Formula 1 season starts Sunday at the Australian Grand Prix, where Verstappen begins his quest for a fifth consecutive title, and Hamilton, now with Ferrari, pursues a record eighth championship. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/formula-1-domenicali-president-74e33872c0587b61721b9cd5dfb6cc2c,sports

Lords, which first held a match in 1814, also previously hosted the 50-over Womens World Cup final between England and India in 2017. The sell-out Womens Cricket World Cup final at Lords in 2017 remains a landmark in the rise of the womens game, and I cannot think of a more fitting stage, International Cricket Council chair Jay Shah said on Thursday. We are excited by the promise of thrilling T20 action that will not only captivate fans here, but also serve as a showcase for crickets return on the Olympic stage in Los Angeles 2028. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/t20-women-world-cup-final-2026-cricket-0a74a07b54343a713cd664ef2985c6fb,sports
US ice dancers Alex and Maia Shibutani return to competition with an eye on 2026 Olympics,"The Shib Sibs are making a comeback with an eye on more Olympic figure skating medals. The popular brother-sister ice dance team of Alex and Maia Shibutani announced Thursday they will return to competition this season in the hopes of making the loaded American squad for the next years Milan-Cortina Games. The 34-year-old Alex and the 30-year-old Maia have skated together most of their lives, and for a long stretch were the dominant U.S. ice dancers. They are three-time world medalists and two-time Olympians, finishing ninth at the 2014 Sochi Games and third at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, where they also were part of the American squad that won a team bronze medal. The Shibutanis stepped away from competition after those Olympics, choosing to focus on school and other interests. Theyve authored four childrens books and worked as choreographers and ambassadors for diversity and representation, and two years ago, they were inducted into U.S. Figure Skatings hall of fame. They extended their hiatus when Maia Shibutani was diagnosed with a malignant tumor on her kidney in 2019. She underwent surgery to remove the mass, and additional treatment resulted in a long, painful recovery. These past seven years have challenged and inspired us in ways we never expected, Maia Shibutani said. Im so happy and grateful to be healthy and in a position to make the decision to return to the sport I love in this way. 
        
     The Shibutanis continued to skate in exhibitions over the years, and they remained close to the Olympic movement, albeit in a different way. Last summer, Alex Shibutani worked as a photographer and Maia Shibutani did media work at the Paris Olympics, where U.S. figure skaters were finally awarded their team gold medals from the 2022 Beijing Games. Alex Shibutani also is a member of the athletes commission for the organizing committee for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Now, the Shibutanis hope to be on the next American squad headed to the Olympics. They will be training with longtime coach Marina Zoueva and Massimo Scali, who recently helped Alysa Liu return from her own brief retirement to win the first womens world title for a U.S. figure skater in nearly two decades. It wont be easy for the Shibutanis to make the team for the Milano-Cortina Games. Madison Chock and Evan Bates just won their third consecutive ice dance world title and will be prohibitive favorites to stand atop the Olympic podium, while Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko were fifth at worlds and Caroline Green and Michael Parsons were ninth. The U.S. has qualified the maximum three ice dance teams for the Winter Games, which means someone will be left out. As Olympic medalists and U.S. Figure Skating hall-of-famers, its incredibly exciting to have Maia and Alex return to competition next season, said Justin Dillon, the senior director of athlete high performance for U.S. Figure Skating. They are strong ambassadors for the sport, both on and off the ice. Their comeback adds to the excitement surrounding Team USA after a very successful year and makes the team stronger as we look toward the Olympic season. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-figure-skating-shibutani-ice-dance-cabdd7ed3e36ec6fcc9ebc89d9654cd2,sports

Canada hires World Cup-winning coach Gordie Herbert to take over mens national basketball team,"Gordie Herbert played for Canada at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. And now hes in position to coach Canada at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Canada Basketball brought Herbert  who coached Germany to a World Cup title in 2023  home on Thursday, announcing that the British Columbia native will take over as its mens national team coach in 2026. His first two major international events as Canadas coach would be the 2027 World Cup in Qatar and the Olympics a year later. Herbert is taking over for Brooklyn Nets coach Jordi Fernandez, who stepped down as Canadas coach earlier this year after leading the country to a bronze medal at the 2023 World Cup and a fifth-place finish at last years Paris Olympics. Im incredibly honored and excited for the opportunity to coach my home country, Herbert said. Canada Basketball has made tremendous progress in recent years, and the depth of talent in the program is as good as anywhere in the world. Herbert stepped aside as Germanys coach after last years Paris Games. He led Germany to the World Cup title in the Philippines, then took that team to a fourth-place finish at the Olympics. Canada has made great strides internationally in recent years, climbing to No. 6 in FIBAs current world rankings  behind the U.S., Serbia, Germany, France and Spain. The Canadians were third at the 2023 World Cup, beating the Americans for the bronze medal, and have a core led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, R.J. Barrett and Lugentz Dort. 
        
     His championship pedigree, command of the FIBA game, and understanding of what it takes to compete for medals on the world stage make him the ideal leader for this next chapter of Canada Basketball, Canada Basketball general manager and executive vice president Rowan Barrett said. Canada hasnt medaled at the Olympics in mens basketball since a silver in 1936. The bronze it won at the 2023 World Cup was its first medal in that competition. Herbert  currently the coach at Bayern Munich  will be asked to add to that collection. Its great to welcome Gordie back to our program, Barrett said. He knows what it means to represent Canada and brings the experience, leadership, and vision to guide this group through the next chapter of our journey. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/olympic-basketball-canada-gordie-herbert-b04113fb0222bf6d61a0a4fa82ceb163,sports
Reds option struggling closer Alexis Diaz to Triple-A,"CINCINNATI (AP)  The Cincinnati Reds optioned struggling closer Alexis Diaz to Triple-A on Thursday hoping he can regain the form that helped him earn 37 saves and an NL All-Star appearance in 2023. We decided to let him try to figure out, get right in Triple-A, manager Terry Francona said. The consistency just isnt there. Its difficult to hear that, Im sure. We dont want that to derail him either. Diaz has more home runs (four) and walks (five) allowed than strikeouts (three) in six innings pitched since coming off the injured list on April 15. His earned run average ballooned to 12.00 after he gave up three consecutive home runs in the ninth inning of a 6-0 loss to the Cardinals in the first game of Wednesdays doubleheader. Diaz began the season on the 15-day IL with a left hamstring strain. He had 28 saves last season, but also walked 31 and allowed six homers in 56 1/3 innings. We told him, Hey, were not giving up on you. Just want you to be more consistent, Francona said. We need him to help us win. The Reds recalled hard-throwing rookie right-hander Luis Mey from Triple-A on Thursday. With Diaz on the IL, Emilio Pagn assumed the closer role. Hes tied for fourth in the NL with eight saves. His 11 perfect relief outings are the most for a Reds reliever through 15 appearances since John Franco in 1987. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/reds-alexis-diaz-c4c5060fa0f639c845adc592c3c944ad,sports
Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garca emerges as one of Spains best. Now a move to a big club beckons,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  A lithe Joan Garca springs across the goalmouth and makes another save for Espanyol. It has become a regular sight in La Liga. But if you havent had the chance to see Garca do his thing, you probably will soon enough at a major European club. Espanyol is in need of cash, and it is very likely that Garca will be sold this summer despite having a contract through 2028.  Arsenal was reportedly close to triggering his 30-million-euro ($34 million) buyout clause last August after Garca helped Spain win Olympic gold. His stock has only risen since thanks to his standout debut season in the topflight. Media speculation now links him to interest from Real Madrid as well as Espanyols crosstown rival, Barcelona. Amid those rumors, Garca tells The Associated Press that he is focused on ensuring his boyhood club avoids relegation, while recognizing that the future is wide open. There was lots of interest last summer, above all from Arsenal, but I stayed here and from then on I have been 100% focused on this campaign, Garca said during a recent interview at Espanyols training center on the northern outskirts of Barcelona. We all know the situation, not just mine, but of the club, and anything can happen. But the future will tell and we will worry about it when the time comes. 
        
     The 23-year-old Garca has been on a stellar trajectory since he became Espanyols starter last season in the second division due to the injury of a teammate.  He helped the club win a promotion playoff before tasting Olympic success in Paris. And since then he has emerged as the breakout player in La Liga. Garca leads all goalkeepers in the Spanish league with 123 saves, making nearly four a game on average, and is a big reason why his modest club is not mired in a relegation battle. Espanyol is in 13th place and has conceded 41 goals; 11 teams in the 20-team league have conceded more. Garcas gloves have backstopped Espanyols strong run since the winter break, with just two losses in 14 games this year. That stretch included a massively celebrated 1-0 win over Real Madrid in February, which Garca says is the highlight of the campaign so far. Garcas strengths go beyond making saves. His ability to make long passes to launch counterattacks has been key to Espanyol bettering more talented opponents. Even though he says he still needs to work on his ability to punch away high crosses, he believes that his mental poise gives him an edge. I think I am goalkeeper that transmits confidence when it comes to making decisions, he said. And through the years I have learned to accept my mistakes and use them to improve. I think that is something that any football player needs, but especially a goalkeeper. Garcas favorite save was a dive to his right and left-handed parry to redirect a blistering strike by Sevillas Dodi Lukebakio onto the crossbar in a 1-1 draw. There were also the two penalties he saved against Mallorca, among other outstanding performances. His reflex swat to push a header onto his bar against Getafe last weekend moved Espanyol coach Manolo Gonzlez to single out Garca. We have a goalkeeper who decides matches, Gonzlez said after Garcas performance helped preserve a 1-0 win. This is like when Bara had Messi. (Garca) is going to be a player known around the world, and I am happy for him both as a professional and for the person he is. I thought he was crazy, Garca said, laughing, when asked about the Messi comparison. But I guess I see what he is getting at. There are moments when I have made plays to help the team, and I am very happy coach is supporting me. Garca started playing soccer when he was four years old in his village of Sallent de Llobregat, located an hour north of Barcelona, where he followed in his older brothers footsteps and became a goalkeeper. He joined Espanyol at age 15 and made his way up through the youth teams. He said he is proud to be a part of Espanyol, a small club living in the shadow of the globally popular Barcelona. The club with its blue-and-white colors whose fans are known as parakeets (pericos) has a long history of great goalkeepers, starting with Ricardo Zamora and including Thomas NKono and fellow Cameroon goalie Carlos Kameni. Garca credited former Real Madrid stopper Diego Lpez with showing him the ropes when he started training with the senior team. Garca expressed loyalty to his club whose motto is that its fans belong to a marvelous minority in a city and region where being a Barcelona supporter is the norm. From the outside, it may look like Espanyol is a small club, but there are lots of Espanyol fans in Barcelona and the rest of Catalonia, he said. It is always a source of pride to find another parakeet and exchange a greeting because you can feel the warmth. It was a mild surprise that Spain coach Luis de la Fuente did not name Garca in his March squad list, but Garca is a strong candidate to be in the European champions team for next years World Cup. To do so, he will need to displace either Alejandro Remiro, David Raya or starter Unai Simn. I am proud to be considered one of the goalkeepers who have a chance to go to the national team, Garca said. It is the highest honor to play for ones country at a World Cup. So if I have that chance, I will give it my all to make it happen. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/joan-garcia-goalkeeper-espanyol-arsenal-a87c9b5dc029f735c9b55fd81e6c78d4,sports
McBro: Scott McTominays new nickname at Napoli has some local flavor,"ROME (AP)  Scott McTominays new preferred nickname is a mix of his Scottish surname and some Neapolitan dialect. The attacking midfielder who has been the driving force behind Napolis surge into the Serie A lead revealed his choice after scoring a brace in a 2-0 win over Torino that raised his total to five goals in three games. Asked in an on-field post-match interview if he preferred MacGyver, McTerminator, McFratm or apribottiglie (which translates as bottle opener, because he tends to open the scoring for Napoli), McTominay selected McFratm  which incorporates the Neapolitan word for brother: fratm. Pasquale Mazzocchi would say Fratm, so McFratm, McTominay said, referring to Napolis homegrown defender, who created the nickname. Or, as Serie A said on X, its McBro for those who dont speak Napoletano. McTominay had been with Manchester United since the age of 5 before he joined Napoli in August and hes developed into just the type of midfielder that demanding coach Antonio Conte was seeking: A player able to impose himself physically with his 6-foot-4 (1.93-meter) frame while also producing goals, often through headers. But McTominay can also score with his feet, as seen against Torino on Sunday when he twice took advantage of open space created when Romelu Lukaku attracted defenders and redirected crosses for both goals.  With 11 league goals, McTominay set the record for a Scottish player in Serie A, overtaking Denis Law, who had 10 with Torino in 1961-62. Law, who also spent the bulk of his career at United and remains the only Scottish player to win the Ballon dOr, died in January at 84. 
        
     We dont have many players capable of scoring in the double digits, Conte said. Weve had to work hard and take advantage of all of our resources. The victory over Torino on Sunday moved Napoli three points clear of Inter Milan with four rounds remaining in the Italian league. The southern squad is therefore in position to claim its second Serie A title in three seasons. Thats a shorter span than the two championships in four seasons with Diego Maradona in 1987 and 1990  although Maradonas team also won the UEFA Cup in 1989. It would mean the world, McTominay said. But for us its not getting too high in this moment because obviously were now leading the race. Its been a complete turnaround for Napoli, which finished 10th last season during its title defense and went through three different coaches. For a team that lost Victor Osimhen in September and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in January, McTominay has filled some big gaps. You can see what type of player he is on the pitch, Napoli fullback Leonardo Spinazzola said. I can only say that he is a special guy, golden, always smiling and happy, an incredible worker. We are so lucky to have him. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/scott-mctominay-napoli-mcfratm-5783cca70cb664836b37346fb9ceef74,sports
Donnarummas weakness under the high ball could be exploited by Arsenal in CL semis,"PARIS (AP)  Gianluigi Donnarumma was hailed as the worlds best goalkeeper by Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique after his saves helped the French club reach the Champions League semifinal against Arsenal. However, for all of his shot-stopping ability, Donnarumma remains alarmingly vulnerable on set pieces and corners  areas which just happen to be Arsenals major strongpoint. The sides meet on Tuesday in London in the first leg of their semifinal, where Donnarumma will be in the spotlight. His blunders cost PSG when it lost 2-0 at Arsenal early into the league phase. Two weeks ago, the 26-year-old Italian made great saves with his team under pressure against Aston Villa in the quarterfinal return leg. PSG emerged 5-4 winners on aggregate thanks in large part to their goalkeeper. Donnarumma has proved to be outstanding on his line thanks to remarkable speed and agility. He starred in a penalty shootout when Italy won the European Championship in 2021 and did so again when PSG eliminated Liverpool on penalties in the last 16. It is a far different story on set pieces. 
        
     Donnarummas reluctance to come for corners and crosses dates back to last seasons competition. It could become a serious problem considering Arsenal is the best side in Europes top five leagues from set pieces and especially strong on corners. Set-piece coach Nicolas Jover has been Arsenals mastermind on dead-ball situations. Jover also worked with Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta when both were at Manchester City. Despite being 1.96 meters tall and stockily built, Donnarumma does not impose himself under the high ball. Accurately flighted balls sent toward the penalty spot often cause panic in PSGs defense, creating a kind of no mans land between the goalie and his defenders. PSG lost 3-1 at home to Nice on Friday for its first defeat in Ligue 1, with two of the goals coming from crosses. Sports daily LEquipe gave Donnarumma a 3-out-of-10 rating for his performance Donnarummas passing from the back is also erratic, leading to some blunders in Ligue 1 and almost causing a farcical-looking goal against Brest in their Champions League playoff match in February. Receiving a routine pass back from captain Marquinhos, he somehow kicked the ball straight at the head of striker Ludovic Ajorque a few meters away and the ball rolled narrowly wide of the goal. Donnarummas hesitancy under the high ball was exposed in Octobers defeat at Arsenal.  He was beaten by a dipping cross as Kai Havertz nodded in Arsenals first goal. Last season in the Champions League quarterfinal first leg against Barcelona, Donnarumma failed to claim a corner and defender Andreas Christensen headed in the winner.  Donnarumma stood rooted to his line and, earlier in that match, he had struggled with Lamine Yamals cross when Raphinha put Barcelona ahead. It was a repeat scenario in the semifinal return leg against Borussia Dortmund when central defender Mats Hummels rose unchallenged to head in Julian Brandts corner.  Again, Donnarumma seemed reluctant to commit himself and there appeared little communication between him and Marquinhos. Another key area in the game could be the contest on the wings. Left winger Gabriel Martinelli and right winger Bukayo Saka tormented Real Madrid in the quarterfinal return leg, with both scoring as Arsenal won 2-1 to advance 5-1 on aggregate. PSG right back Achraf Hakimi and left back Nuno Mendes both scored against Villa in the return leg. But their attacking intent may be reigned in as they deal with the forays of Martinelli and Saka, who likewise will be careful not to leave too much space behind them when they push up. Midfielder Declan Rices newfound free kick prowess is an added bonus for Arsenal.

Royals Noah Cameron takes a no-hitter into 7th in his big league debut as KC beats the Rays 3-0,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP)  Royals left-hander Noah Cameron took a no-hitter into the seventh inning in his major league debut and Vinnie Pasquantino homered as Kansas City blanked the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0 on Wednesday night. Cameron, who grew up in the Kansas City area, shut out the Rays over 6 1/3 innings until Curtis Mead ended an 0-for-16 slump with a one-out single down the left-field line. Recalled from Triple-A Omaha prior to the start, Cameron (1-0) allowed one hit and five walks while striking out three. He threw 79 pitches with 46 strikes. Carlos Estvez stranded two in the ninth for his ninth save. Kansas Citys Bobby Witt Jr. wasted no time extending his hitting streak to 21 games. He singled in the first inning, then scored on Pasquantinos fourth homer of the year. Playing in his 500th major league game, Witt also reached 1,000 total bases with his fifth-inning single that scored Cavan Biggio. Salvador Perez, Maikel Garcia and Kyle Isbel each had two hits for the Royals, whove won eight of nine. Drew Rasmussen (1-2) gave up three runs and six hits in five innings for the Rays, whove lost seven of their last eight at Steinbrenner Field, their temporary home.

"Frost win 3-0 to keep playoff hopes alive, putting Charges chances in jeopardy","OTTAWA (AP)  Lee Stecklein scored twice as the Minnesota Frost staved off elimination and put the Ottawa Charges playoff hopes on ice with a 3-0 win Wednesday night. The Charge needed just one point to secure their first playoff appearance. Ottawa earning the single point would have ended the defending champion Frosts playoff chances. It will come down to the final regular season games Saturday. Ottawa will need a regulation win or overtime win against the Toronto Sceptres on Saturday, or Minnesota to lose its final game against Boston on Saturday in order to clinch a playoff berth. The Charge hold the tiebreaker should the two teams be tied in points. Leading 1-0, the Frost extended their lead at 5:38 of the third period when Stecklein beat Gwyneth Philips with a wrister from the point. Stecklein added an empty-net goal with 34 seconds remaining for her second goal of the season. Philips, who stopped 30 shots, and Nicole Hensley, who had a 24-save shutout, were solid in the second with both making a number of big saves. The Charge got into penalty trouble late in the period, but Philips was able to hold the Frost off. With 1:17 remaining in the second Kendall Coyne Schofield beat Philips through the legs on a partial-screen to give Minnesota a 1-0 lead. Charge: Failed to capitalize on the power play going 0-for-3. Frost: Generated lots of chances and just kept putting pucks on net. Steckleins first goal on a point shot in the third provided the Frost some much-needed insurance. The regular season wraps up Saturday with the Frost at Boston and the Charge at Toronto. ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/charge-frost-score-5315de56a0ec0f1caf01e3eb95c9f60a,sports

Burnes gets 1st win for Arizona as Diamondbacks hold off Mets 4-3,"NEW YORK (AP)  Corbin Burnes earned his first win for Arizona and pinch-hitter Geraldo Perdomo delivered a two-run single in the seventh inning that sent the Diamondbacks past the New York Mets 4-3 on Wednesday night. New York scored twice in the ninth before Ryan Thompson retired Francisco Alvarez on a grounder with the bases loaded for his eighth major league save and first this season. Making his sixth start with his new team since signing a $210 million, six-year contract as a free agent last offseason, Burnes (1-1) pitched out of trouble for six innings. He allowed one run and four hits, overcoming five walks and a balk to help the Diamondbacks win for the second time in seven games. Mark Vientos homered off Burnes in the third, but then grounded into an inning-ending double play with two on in the fifth.  Mets opener Huascar Brazobn and left-hander Brandon Waddell combined for 6 1/3 shutout innings, but Lourdes Gurriel Jr. grounded a single off scuffling reliever Ryne Stanek (0-3) with two outs in the seventh. Jorge Barrosas bat splintered on a double, and Perdomo punched a soft single that fell just in front of diving left fielder Jeff McNeil to put Arizona ahead 2-1. Barrosa and Perdomo each added a sacrifice fly in the ninth to make it 4-1 after Gurriel doubled off Mets newcomer Chris Devenski. Justin Martinez gave up Taylors leadoff homer in the bottom half and walked the next two batters before giving way to Thompson.  Stanek has taken the loss in each of his past three outings. New York (21-10), which dropped to 13-2 at home, was trying to become the first team in National League history to win 20 games in April. 
        
     Burnes gave up a leadoff double in the first and walked Pete Alonso and Vientos on eight pitches to load the bases with one out. But the right-hander struck out Starling Marte and retired McNeil on an easy grounder to escape the jam. Arizona manager Torey Lovullo earned his 600th win as the Diamondbacks improved to 8-24 in their last 32 games against the Mets.

"Kirk hits winning single in 10th, Blue Jays rally past Red Sox 7-6 in Giolitos return","TORONTO (AP)  Alejandro Kirk hit a game-ending, bases-loaded single in the 10th inning and the Toronto Blue Jays overcame a six-run deficit to beat the Boston Red Sox 7-6 in Lucas Giolitos return on Wednesday night, stopping a three-game losing streak. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. started the 10th as the automatic runner on second, Justin Slaten (0-1) intentionally walked Daulton Varsho and George Springer with one out and Kirk singled to left. Jeff Hoffman (3-0) struck out three in two hitless innings. Anthony Santander tied the score in the seventh with his fourth home run this season, a three-run drive off Garrett Whitlock. Kirk and Varsho started the rebound from a 6-0 deficit with back-to-back homers in the sixth off Giolito, who made his Red Sox debut more than 15 months after signing a a $38.5 million. two-year contract, Giolito didnt pitch last season because of a partial tear in his right ulnar collateral ligament, then had been sidelined since spring training due to a strained left hamstring. Toronto began the night with 16 homers, 29th among the 30 teams, and hit three homers in a game for the first time this season. Yariel Rodrguezs run-scoring balk and Alex Bregmans seventh homer built a 2-0 lead in the first, and Jarren Duran hit an RBI single in the second and scored on Rafael Devers double. Carlos Narvez stretched the lead to 6-0 with a two-run homer off Chad Green in the sixth.

Cardinals hope doubleheader sweep at Cincinnati signals an end to their road woes,"CINCINNATI (AP)  After enduring the franchises second-worst start on the road, the St. Louis Cardinals broke out on Wednesday, belting six homers and outscoring the Cincinnati Reds 15-1 in a doubleheader sweep.  The Cardinals won the first game 6-0 and the second 9-1. They finished with 15 hits in the twinbill. It was the Cardinals first doubleheader sweep at Cincinnati since June 28, 1959 at Crosley Field.  Its hard to take two games from anybody, St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. This group has been playing the game the right way. It hasnt gone our way. Hopefully today sparks something. After dropping the first game of the series against the Reds, the Cardinals fell to 2-12 on the road, their worst start away from home since going 2-15 in 1960. Going into the doubleheader, the Cardinals were hitting .239 on the road compared to .289 at Busch Stadium. The team ERA in away games was 5.94. Nine of the road defeats were by three or fewer runs, and that gave the Cardinals hope things would turn around soon. Scheduled after a rainout on Tuesday, the doubleheader began with Masyn Winns solo homer into the upper deck in the first inning of Game 1. Winn homered again when St. Louis hit three consecutive homers in the ninth inning off Alexis Diaz in a 6-0 victory. It was the first time in the modern era that the Cardinals had hit back-to-back-to-back homers in the ninth. 
        
     Winn went 4 for 8 with two homers, four runs scored, a double and two RBIs in the two games after Marmol moved him to the No. 2 spot in the lineup. Just get on base and catch a barrel, Winn said. (Lars) Nootbaar is setting the tone at the leadoff spot. When I get going, I feel like the rest of the teams energy changes. Marmol downplayed the move, but it produced results. Masyn just brings a different element, lots of energy, the manager said. That first game with two homers. This game, a couple knocks. Just a lot of energy. The most impressive at-bat on Wednesday came from Pedro Pags, who worked the count to 2-2 against 22-year-old right-hander Case Petty  who was making his major league debut  and then fouled off six straight pitches before launching his third homer of the season. I just wanted to be aggressive with him, Pags said. I just kept fouling them off and fouling them off. I was taking deep breaths out there. Tried to stay as calm as I could and stay within myself.  Willson Contreras hit a three-run homer off Petty in the first inning of the nightcap.  Definitely a great long day, Game 2 starter Steven Matz said. To come out with two wins is huge for us. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/cardinals-road-doubleheader-sweep-reds-0fffe65692347850603475a0f0667cd5,sports
Royals lefty Noah Cameron takes a no-hitter into the 7th inning in his major league debut,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP)  Even though he was 1,300 miles from home, Kansas City left-hander Noah Cameron was able to celebrate his first major league start  and his first victory  with family and friends. And what a debut it was. Cameron, who grew up rooting for the Royals in St. Joseph, Missouri, took a no-hitter into the seventh inning Wednesday night at Tampa Bay as the Royals beat the Rays 3-0. His wife, young son, parents, siblings and a few friends made the trip to root him on. Curtis Meads one-out single down the left-field line ended his no-hit bid. Kansas City manager Matt Quatraro immediately removed Cameron for reliever John Schreiber. Cameron walked off the mound toward the third-base dugout, where a contingent of Royals fans  including his family  gave him a much-deserved standing ovation. Camerons final line: one hit over 6 1/3 innings, with five walks and three strikeouts. He threw 79 pitches, 46 for strikes. It was quite the MLB premiere for a 25-year-old who first decided he wanted to be a professional baseball player more than two decades ago. And even more special because Cameron grew up an hour from Kansas City. He was 4 years old when he walked the warning track at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City with his mom as part of a school field trip. Cameron got a wave from Royals starter Zack Greinke that day and hasnt forgotten it since. He experienced something similar against the Rays  and nearly something the club hasnt witnessed in more than three decades. 
        
     No Royals pitcher has thrown a no-hitter since Bret Saberhagen on Aug. 26, 1991, a span of 5,244 games that represents the third-longest active no-hit drought in the majors. Only Cleveland and Toronto have gone longer without one. Only two pitchers have thrown no-hitters in their major league debuts: Bumpus Jones did it for the Cincinnati Reds against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Oct. 15, 1892; and Tyler Gilbert accomplished the feat for the Arizona Diamondbacks on Aug. 14, 2021, against the San Diego Padres. Cameron was recalled from Triple-A Omaha prior to Wednesdays game, but he swore his family and friends to secrecy when he found out about the start three days earlier.  Cameron was filling in for Cole Ragans, who is dealing with a mild left groin strain. But it might be tough to send him back down after his dazzling debut. Kansas City delivered three defensive gems to help Cameron extend his no-hit bid. In the first inning, Hunter Renfroes leaping catch against the right-field wall robbed Yandy Diaz of extra bases. Cameron got out of the second after walking a pair when Maikel Garcia stabbed Meads hard-hit grounder and started an inning-ending, 5-4-3 double play. And in the third, Witt dived to snag Jose Caballeros grounder in the hole and threw him out at first. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/royals-noah-cameron-debut-no-hit-bid-27dfbde981c9d22cc809fde03ee5775e,sports

Jake Bauers hits 2-run double in the 8th inning to help the Brewers beat the White Sox 6-4,"CHICAGO (AP)  Jake Bauers hit a go-ahead two-run double in the eighth inning and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago White Sox 6-4 on Wednesday night for their third straight victory. Tied at 3 going into the eighth, Milwaukee loaded the bases on two walks and an infield single before Bauers ripped a shot into the gap in right-center field. Caleb Durbin drove in his eighth run of the season on a sacrifice fly to make it 6-3 in the eighth. The Brewers have gone 12-1 in their last 13 games against the White Sox, including eight straight wins. Milwaukee is also 8-1 in its last nine games at Rate Field, including seven straight victories. William Contreras went 2 for 3 with an RBI to extend his hitting streak to nine games. Contreras singled to right in the first for a 1-0 lead and scored when Gage Workman, making his first start for the White Sox, let a soft grounder go under his glove. It was the first of a season-high three errors for the White Sox, who have lost three straight games and fell to 7-23. Milwaukee used six pitchers after starter Tobias Myers allowed two earned runs in two innings. Jared Koenig pitched an inning of relief for his second win of the season. Trevor Megill struck out two in the ninth to earn his third save.  Cam Booser (0-2) allowed three earned runs in the eighth. Miguel Vargas was 3 for 4 for the White Sox, including an RBI single in the eighth. 
        
     Contreras threw out Luis Robert Jr. trying to steal second base to end the seventh, and the Brewers scored three in the eighth.

"Athletics bust out in 9th with 2-run homer by Rooker and grand slam by Butler, beat Rangers 7-1","ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  Brent Rooker hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the ninth inning and Lawrence Butler followed with his first career grand slam as the Athletics beat the Texas Rangers 7-1 on Wednesday night. Rooker was the first batter to face Luke Jackson after Tyler Soderstrom led off the inning with a single off Robert Garcia (1-1). Rooker launched a 1-1 fastball to left field, his eighth of the season. After the As loaded the bases with a single and two walks by Jackson, Butler took Shawn Armstrong deep to center for his fifth homer. Grant Holman (3-0) pitched a scoreless seventh and eighth. The Athletics have won six of eight, while the Rangers have lost eight of 12. Jacob Wilson gave the As a 1-0 lead in the third inning with a perfectly placed bunt single between the mound and first base to score JJ Bleday, who opened the inning with a double off the right-field wall. Adolis Garca singled home Marcus Semien in the fourth, tying it at 1-all. Texas starter Nathan Eovaldi allowed one run and six hits in six innings, striking out eight and walking none. He has 46 strikeouts and three walks, a 15.33 strikeout-to-walk ratio that leads the majors. Athletics starter Luis Severino allowed one run and eight hits in five innings, leaving after allowing back-to-back singles opening the sixth. Texas offense regressed after scoring a season-high 15 runs Tuesday following a stretch of scoring only 11 runs over six games. 
        
     Jackson, with eight saves in nine chances, struggled in a non-save situation after two of his three previous outings resulted in walk-off losses. The Rangers were 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position and left 11 men on base.

Cristiano Ronaldos Al-Nassr is chasing silverware in the Asian Champions League Elite,"Big-spending Saudi clubs including Cristiano Ronaldos Al-Nassr are dominating the Asian Champions League Elite, accounting for all but one of the semifinalists in action this week.  In three quarterfinals played on the weekend, the three Saudi Pro League teams won with a combined scoreline of 14-1. At least one is guaranteed a place in the final on May 3 as four-time champion Al-Hilal meets two-time finalist Al-Ahli in the first of the two semis at Jeddah.  On Wednesday, Al-Nassr takes on Japans Kawasaki Frontale, the only non-Saudi club still in contention for the continental title. Kawasaki edged 2011 champion Al Sadd of Qatar 3-2 after extra time on Sunday to advance to the semifinals for the first time. With all playoff games taking place in Jeddah, there is home advantage and big crowds supporting the three domestic clubs that are laden with high-profile international stars.  In the summer transfer window of 2023, Saudi clubs spent almost $1 billion and its making a difference in Asian competition. Al-Nassr thumped last seasons runnerup Yokohama F.Marinos of Japan 4-1 on Saturday, with goals coming from Ronaldo, former Liverpool star Sadio Mane and two from Jhon Duran, who signed from Premier League club Aston Villa in January in a deal reportedly worth more than $80 million. When you come here, the teams are playing Premier League-level football, Yokohamas interim coach Patrick Kisnorbo said. I dont think its a technical issue but sometimes these things happen. We have to move forward. 
        
     The journey to Jeddah was also a punishing one for teams in the middle of domestic seasons in East Asia.  Our local league is our priority, Buriram United coach Osmar Loss said after his Thai club lost 3-0 to Al-Ahli on Saturday. Its a long trip to Jeddah and back and I needed to protect our main players. In the most lopsided of the quarterfinals, South Korean club Gwangju FC, making its first appearance in the tournament, was thrashed 7-0 by Al-Hilal on Friday. Al-Hilal now faces Jeddah club Al-Ahli on Tuesday in a bid to reach its 10th title match in the Asian competition. Al-Ahli, fourth in the domestic league, had a 3-2 win over Al-Hilal in February with all three goals scored by England striker Ivan Toney. With other former Premier League stars such as Riyad Mahrez and Roberto Firmino on the scoresheet against Buriram United, coach Matthias Jaissle believes Al-Ahli is well placed to advance to a third final and then to capture a first title. I congratulated the players for making it to the semifinals but from now on, they have to focus on whats best  rehabilitate, rest, and get back to the best physical level to perform against Al Hilal, Jaissle said. Everyone knows its going to be an intense match and we need to be in top shape. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/ronaldo-asian-champions-league-semifinals-acl-4b3bf6a57f656a74a1536211b9207bee,sports
Champions League semifinals: Barcelona-Inter revives memories of 2010 epic and Arsenal hosts PSG,"The free-flowing attack of Barcelona comes up against the rugged, smothering defense of Inter Milan in the Champions League semifinals. Ring any bells? Go back to 2010  when Lamine Yamal was not even 3 years old and Lionel Messi was close to his prime  and Camp Nou was the scene of one of the most memorable matches in Champions League history, between the same teams going head-to-head there again on Wednesday. Protecting a 3-1 lead from the first leg, Inter  coached at the time by Jose Mourinho  delivered a defensive masterclass against Pep Guardiolas Barcelona to survive with 10 men for more than an hour and lose just 1-0 to progress to the title match. Memories will come flooding back ahead of the rematch this week, especially with the two protagonists owning the same traits as 15 years ago. Barcelona is back in the Champions League semifinals for the first time since the 2018-19 season, on the back of by far the best attack in the new-look, 36-team league stage. With Yamal, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski up front, Barca scored 28 goals in eight games  and has netted nine more goals in eliminating Benfica and Borussia Dortmund in the knockouts. Then theres Inter, the Italian champion, which conceded just once in eight games in the first stage and held on grimly to oust Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals. Inter won the 2010 final, against Bayern, for a third European Cup title so its run toward the final this season has echoes of that title-winning campaign. 
        
     While the Barcelona-Inter Milan semifinal is awash with history, this one seems relatively fresh. Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain have met just three times in the Champions League and never in the knockout stage. One of those occasions was this season, when Arsenal won 2-0 at Emirates Stadium. And its at home that the Gunners play on Tuesday in the first leg, hoping to reproduce the exploits that saw them beat defending champion Real Madrid in both legs in the quarterfinals. Their opponents, however, are aiming to eliminate an English opponent for the third straight round, after seeing off Liverpool and  less impressively  Aston Villa. With its galacticos  Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Messi  long gone, PSG is bidding to win a first Champions League title by going with talented up-and-coming players instead. Arsenal is also striving to become European champion for the first time, having not reached the semis since 2009. ___ Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80 ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-inter-milan-arsenal-psg-champions-league-37df112a926de11c3d9c11a3a28ae89a,sports
"Rockies end 8-game losing streak, beat Sale and Braves 2-1 behind Doyle homer to improve to 5-25","DENVER (AP)  The Colorado Rockies ended an eight-game losing streak as Brenton Doyle hit a tiebreaking home run off reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Chris Sale in the third inning of a 2-1 win over the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday. Colorado had lost 16 of its previous 17 games and had been outscored by 78 runs. At 5-25, the Rockies avoided joining the 1988 Baltimore Orioles as the only teams since 1901 to lose at least 26 of their first 30 games. Doyle homered on an inside fastball, ending an 0-for-20 skid with a 421-foot drive to left-center. He later doubled. Rookie Chase Dollander (2-3), the Rockies No. 9 overall pick in the 2023 amateur draft, allowed one run, two hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings with four strikeouts. Making his fifth big league start, he got his second win. Dollander came out after trying to pitch with a cracked fingernail. Jake Bird, Seth Halvorsen and Zach Agnos finished a three-hitter, with Agnos getting three outs for his first major league save. Bird struck out two in 1 1/3 innings and has 24 strikeouts in 17 2/3 innings. Colorado pitchers had allowed 14 hits in each of the first two games of the series. Ryan McMahon went 0 for 3 and extended his hitless streak to a team record 0 for 34, one more than Desi Relaford in 2005. McMahon has two hits in his last 58 at-bats. Doyles solo home run in the third inning ended a skid of 20 consecutive at-bats without a hit. 
        
     Sale (1-3) struck out a second-high 10 and walked none, allowing two runs and five hits. The Braves had won nine of their previous 11 games. Sean Bouchard put Colorado ahead with an RBI groundout in the second, but Michael Harris hit a run-scoring groundout in the third. After replacing Dollander with a 2-1 lead, Bird struck out Ozzie Albies with runners on first and second. Atlanta didnt put a runner in scoring position for the remainder of the game. Atlantas Eli White ended a streak of six consecutive games with at least one extra-base hit.

Angels star Mike Trout leaves game with left knee soreness after trying to leg out a grounder,"SEATTLE (AP)  Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout left Wednesdays game at Seattle with a sore left knee. Trout was taken out ahead of his at-bat in the fourth inning after he tried to leg out a ground ball to second base the inning before. He was replaced by pinch-hitter Jo Adell. When it happened, I knew it was like just a weird one, Trout said after the game. But now, after getting treatment and stuff, I should be a little better soon.  Trout said hes hopeful it was merely scar tissue breaking up and added that he plans to try to play Thursday.  Ill come and see how it feels, he said. Thats the plan right now. During Trouts at-bat in the third, he sprinted down the line and lunged toward first  and was barely out. He stayed in the game on defense but was pulled the next inning. Trout has not missed a game this season, appearing in all 29 games, 22 of them in right field.  Trout appeared in 29 games last season before tearing his meniscus and missing the remainder of the season. Hes hitting .173 this season, with nine home runs and 18 RBIs. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mike-trout-angels-59d33aebd17f02d99855627427d90d85,sports
Chris Flexen brought up to majors by Chicago Cubs after spending last season with White Sox,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  Chris Flexen was brought up to the major leagues by the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday after signing a minor league contract in February and making five minor league starts. Chicago selected the contract of the 30-year-old right-hander from Iowa, optioned left-handed reliever Tom Cosgrove to the Triple-A farm team and transferred right-hander Javier Assad, who has a strained left oblique, to the 60-day injured list. Flexen joined the NL Central leader after spending last season with the crosstown White Sox, who set a post-1900 record with 121 losses. He has a $1.5 million salary in the major leagues with the Cubs and can earn $1 million in performance bonuses for innings: $250,000 each for 50, 75, 100 and 125. I looked at it as an opportunity to pitch, Flexen said. We had our struggles. It was a tough season, but I made a lot of great relationships there. Now Im looking forward to being in Chicago again. Flexen likely be used in middle and long relief after going 3-0 with a 1.54 ERA in five starts with Iowa. He was 3-15 with a 4.95 ERA in 30 starts and three relief appearances last year for the White Sox, leading the team with 160 innings. Im really excited to be here, Flexen said.

Tony Gonsolin solid in first start since 2023 and Dodgers pound 17 hits in 12-7 win over Marlins,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Tony Gonsolin threw six strong innings in his return from Tommy John surgery, Mookie Betts drove in four runs and the Los Angeles Dodgers extended their win streak to five with a 12-7 victory over the Miami Marlins on Wednesday. Gonsolin, making his first start since Aug. 18, 2023, gave up three runs and six hits, struck out nine and walked none in a 77-pitch effort. The Dodgers, who banged out 17 hits, pushed a 4-3 lead to 8-3 in a span of four pitches in the sixth. Betts drove a two-run triple off the center-field wall and Freddie Freeman followed with a two-run homer. Betts also keyed a three-run third with a two-run single. Cal Quantrill (2-3) gave up four runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings to fall to 1-7 with an 8.22 ERA in nine appearances against Los Angeles. Kyle Stowers homered twice for Miami. Max Muncy, who averaged 32 homers a year in five full seasons from 2018-2023, drove a fastball from Quantrill 433 feet to center in the second for his first homer of the season. Muncy entered with a .180 average and four RBIs in 28 games. He also tripled in the seventh. In the ninth, Stowers hit his second homer and Liam Hicks hit a three-run double off Yoendrys Gomez, but Hernndez made a diving stop of Jesus Sanchezs grounder down the first-base line and beat Sanchez to the bag to end the game.

Daz and Tatis lead the Padres to a 5-3 win over the Giants for a 2-game sweep,"SAN DIEGO (AP)  Elias Daz homered and scored twice, and Fernando Tatis Jr. had three hits for the San Diego Padres, who beat the San Francisco Giants 5-3 Wednesday for a two-game sweep.  The Padres leapfrogged the Giants into second place behind the Los Angeles Dodgers in the ultra-competitive NL West. Daz homered on a line shot to left off Landen Roupp (2-2) leading off the third for a 2-0 lead. A fan in the front row wearing a Giants T-shirt reached his glove over the fence but the ball caromed off his wrist. After a lengthy crew chief review, it was determined it wasnt fan interference. It was the catchers second homer. Tatis had three singles and scored on Manny Machados single to right in the two-run fifth. Jose Iglesias beat out a dribbler for a two-out infield hit that scored Luis Arraez. Arraez, a three-time batting champion who returned from the seven-day concussion injured list on Tuesday night, had his first triple of the season to bring in Daz with two outs in the sixth. Michael King (4-1) held the Giants to one run and three hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out six and walked one. Robert Suarez pitched the ninth for his major league-leading 12th save. The Giants got late homers from Heliot Ramos and Mike Yastrzemski. With runners on first and second and one out in the sixth, Machado, the third baseman, dived to his left to field Willy Adames one-hopper and, while on his back, threw to second to force Mike Yastrzemski. 
        
     San Franciscos Matt Chapman struck out three times, marking the fifth time in his career hes had consecutive three-plus strikeouts in the same series.

"Rockies get to celebrate a win after losing 16 of 17, including 8 in a row","DENVER (AP)  The Colorado Rockies got to shake hands after a game for only the second time in three weeks, and they celebrated after a rookie outpitched the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner. You guys can probably hear it now. Were in pretty good spirits, Chase Dollander said after Wednesdays 2-1 win over the Atlanta Braves stopped an eight-game losing streak. I would never say we were down in the locker room. Obviously, losings not fun, but at the same time, we know that were capable of winning and we can put a winning product on the field, so thats exactly what we did today. Colorado had lost 16 of its previous 17 games. At 5-25, the Rockies avoided becoming just the second MLB team since 1901 to lose at least 26 of its first 30 games of the season.  Only the 1988 Baltimore Orioles, who went on to go 54-107, had a worse 30-game start. Theres frustration, sure. Guys are angry, Rockies manager Bud Black said. These guys are professional baseball players who want to win games and want to do well and it just hasnt happened as a group, right? We just dont have enough guys playing well. For us to get going, we have 26 players, they all have to do a little better, maybe not all 26, but we need a higher majority of the guys to perform and right now, we only have a few guys. Brenton Doyle hit a tiebreaking home run in the third inning. Ryan McMahon went 0 for 3 and extended his hitless streak to a team record 0 for 34, one more than Desi Relaford in 2005. McMahon has two hits in his past 58 at-bats. 
        
     We have to as a group and more players have to do a little bit more on the field, Black said. Doyles home run ended a skid of 20 consecutive at-bats without a hit. Everyone in here is a competitor, so losing definitely hurts, Doyle said. But we know we have to celebrate the wins. Thats what were going to do today. Dollander, the Rockies No. 9 overall pick in the 2023 amateur draft, got his second big league win in his fifth major league start by limiting the Braves to one run and two hits in 5 2/3 innings as part of a three-hitter. He left because of a cracked fingernail on the middle finger of his throwing hand. This is a great confidence-builder for him, going up against Chris Sale, a Cy Young Award winner, and he basically outdueled him, Black said. What a great feat today for him. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/colorado-rockies-losing-streak-stopped-2b2609a72b072d4e5571fa5573c64c40,sports
Mets put Young on injured list and bring up Waddell to make 1st MLB appearance in 4 years,"NEW YORK (AP)  Brandon Waddells first major league appearance in almost four years was a rousing success. After spending 2 1/2 seasons overseas, the left-hander was called up by the New York Mets from Triple-A Syracuse on Wednesday and pitched 4 1/3 shutout innings against Arizona in relief of opener Huascar Brazobn. Waddell exited with the Mets leading 1-0 in the seventh and was in line for his first career win until the Diamondbacks rallied for a 4-3 victory. It was awesome. Its good to be back, the 30-year-old Waddell said. Like I said in spring training, I think I can pitch here. That was one of the reasons I really wanted to come back. To be able to do that is pretty cool. Brazobn was used as an opener for the second time this season, with Waddell in waiting to soak up several innings. The first player in Mets history to wear No. 82, Waddell allowed three hits and struck out a career-high four without a walk in the longest of his 12 big league outings with five teams. Unbelievable, manager Carlos Mendoza said. I thought he was really, really good. After throwing 40 of his 60 pitches for strikes, Waddell walked off the mound to a standing ovation from the Citi Field crowd of 31,904. Its awesome. Its something I definitely didnt expect. But you could feel it, Waddell said. As a player, it means a lot to have that support. Its something we always really cherish. 
        
     Brazobn and Waddell were lined up to pitch so New York could give No. 1 starter Kodai Senga his customary fifth day of rest before he gets the ball in Thursdays series finale. Waddell more than did his part, providing the longest scoreless outing by a Mets reliever since Nelson Figueroa went 4 1/3 innings against St. Louis in August 2009. Its a lot of fun, really. This game is pretty cool. You never know where its going to take you and different things itll teach you, said Waddell, who graduated from the University of Virginia with an economics degree. To have that journey is pretty special. And to be back is a lot of fun. The first-place Mets also put lefty reliever Danny Young on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to Sunday, with a sprained pitching elbow. Its possible Young will need Tommy John surgery, Mendoza said. Hes been dealing with forearm (discomfort) for a few weeks now, and weve been trying to monitor him and things like that. But lately he was having a hard time recovering, Mendoza said. We did an imaging this morning and it showed the sprained ligament. New Yorks top left-handed reliever, A.J. Minter, is also on the IL with a significant left lat strain after getting hurt Saturday in Washington. He underwent another MRI on Wednesday and season-ending surgery is a possibility. A decision will probably be made within a couple of days, Mendoza said. A treatment program of rest and rehabilitation remains an option  but the 31-year-old pitcher will be unavailable for an extended period regardless. Thats about as bad timing as you can get, huh? Young said. Its unfortunate. Obviously, Mint, hes a big piece for us. And then Mint goes down and then I obviously want to pick up that slack and, you know, thats just the situation were in now.  Minter was in the clubhouse Wednesday with his left arm in a sling. Veteran right-hander Chris Devenski was selected from Triple-A, right-hander Kevin Herget was optioned to Syracuse and lefty Brooks Raley was transferred to the 60-day IL.  Raley, recovering from elbow surgery last May, was re-signed Tuesday to a one-year contract that guarantees $1.85 million. He is throwing bullpens but wont be ready to join the team for a while.  The roster shuffle left Waddell as the only left-hander in New Yorks reliable bullpen.  A guy that is more of a pitchability-type guy. You know, moves the ball around. Strike thrower. Been in professional baseball for a long time, Mendoza said before the game. Waddell, who turns 31 on June 3, was 1-1 with a 1.54 ERA in five starts at Syracuse, with 21 strikeouts and seven walks in 23 1/3 innings. His previous big league outing came with St. Louis against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on July 9, 2021.  He entered Wednesday with an 0-1 record and 5.68 ERA in 12 2/3 innings over 11 major league games, all in relief, for Pittsburgh, Minnesota, Baltimore and St. Louis from 2020-21. Waddell was released by the Cardinals in July 2022 and spent the next 2 1/2 years pitching in South Korea and China. He spent last season with the Doosan Bears of the KBO, going 7-4 with a 3.12 ERA in 14 starts before signing with the Mets in December. The 6-foot-3, 180-pound Waddell was selected by the Pirates in the fifth round of the 2015 amateur draft after winning a College World Series championship at Virginia. In other news, right-hander Paul Blackburn (right knee inflammation) threw a bullpen Tuesday and is scheduled to pitch Friday in a rehab outing for Class A Brooklyn.  Mendoza also said Brandon Nimmo was feeling better, but the left fielder was out of the starting lineup for the second consecutive night because of an illness thats been going around the Mets clubhouse. Nimmo grounded out as a pinch hitter to end the eighth. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-bullpen-waddell-young-nimmo-56a330f979dd5524d8cd75ab931f86ea,sports
Surging Mariners beat Angels 9-3; Trout leaves game early with sore knee,"SEATTLE (AP)  J.P. Crawford hit a tie-breaking two-run single in a six-run seventh inning and the Seattle Mariners won their seventh straight series with a 9-3 victory on Wednesday over the Los Angeles Angels and Mike Trout, who left the game with a sore left knee. The outfielder was lifted for Jo Adell in the fourth after running out a groundout in his previous at-bat. Trout has started all 29 games this season and is batting .179 with nine home runs. In four of the previous five seasons he has played fewer than 100 games, including just 29 last year.  Trout, who was 1 for 2 on Wednesday, said he hoped to play Thursday. While the Angels have lost five straight, the Mariners have won four in a row and are 15-3 in their last 18 games. Emerson Hancock pitched six innings, giving up nine hits and three runs. Casey Legumina (2-0) got the win with a scoreless seventh. Leo Rivas had three hits and three RBIs and Randy Arozarena hit his fifth homer for Seattle.  Reid Detmers (0-1) relieved Tyler Anderson in the seventh and was charged with five runs without getting an out. Jorge Soler hit his fifth homer. The Mariners placed outfielder Luke Raley on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Monday, with a right oblique strain.  After Crawford broke the tie, he scored from first on Julio Rodrguezs double off the wall. Cal Raleigh followed with a single to left with Rodrguez diving under the ball before regaining his feet and scoring. 
        
     Arozarenas homer extended his career-best on-base streak to 25, the third-longest active streak in the majors behind Kyle Schwarber (35) and Aaron Judge (26).  The Angels open a 10-game homestand Thursday with Yusei Kikuchi (0-4, 4.31 ERA) facing Detroits Casey Mize (4-1, 2.12). Bryan Woo (3-1, 3.09) pitches for the Mariners versus Jack Leiter (2-0, 2.03) at Texas on Friday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/angels-mariners-score-a9288808fe5e37b6bc22560eeea89697,sports

Tyler Collet sails to 10-shot victory and leads 20 club pros going to the PGA Championship,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP)  Tyler Collet never had an easier time getting to a major, closing with an even-par 72 on Wednesday to win the PGA Professional Championship by a record 10 shots to lead 20 club pros who qualified for the PGA Championship. Collet started the final round on the Wanamaker course at PGA Golf Club with a seven-shot lead and that was never challenged. His goal was not to have a round over par, and he achieved that by making an 18-foot bogey putt on the final hole. My mindset the whole week was not to move backward, said Collet, the assistant pro at Johns Island Club about 15 miles away in Vero Beach. He finished at 15-under 272 and will be playing for the fourth time in the PGA Championship, which starts May 15 at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. Michael Block, the California club pro and feel-good story from the 2023 PGA Championship at Oak Hill, made it to the PGA Championship for the third straight year. Collet, John Somers and Larkin Gross earned a spot for a second straight year. As usual, far more drama was toward the bottom of the leaderboard. Four players who finished at even par were in a sudden-death playoff for the 20th and final spot at Quail Hollow. Andrew Svoboda was eliminated on the first hole with a bogey, while Dakun Chang three-putted on the next hole to get bumped. It came down to 60-year-old Brad Lardon and Michael Kartrude, who made bogey on the 18th hole in regulation and thought that might cost him. 
        
     Lardon had a 7-foot birdie putt on the third extra hole that stopped one turn from dropping.  Lardon couldnt reach the green in two at the par-5 13th  the fourth playoff hole  and his wedge to a back pin trickled off the back. He used putter and began to celebrate when the putt hit the center of the flagstick and somehow banged out. Kartrude chipped to 4 feet and had that birdie left for the win, and Lardon removed his cap to congratulate him as soon as the ball left Kartrudes putter. But it missed, and they were on to the fifth playoff hole. Kartrude sent his tee shot far to the right and into the trees, dropping his driver at impact. But it hit a tree and came back into play, just barely. Still blocked by trees, he hit a power fade around the trees and onto the green, setting up a par. Lardon chipped to 7 feet and missed the par putt, allowing Kartrude to advance. The best moment of my golfing life, for sure, Kartrude said. Im going to play a major. That might not have been possible if not for a meltdown by Jesse Mueller, who won this tournament three years ago. He was among the top 20 and looked to be in good shape at 2 under for the tournament and playing the par-5 16th, the easiest on the course. He put his tee shot just into the hazard, with enough of the golf ball showing he decided to remove his socks and shoes to stand in the muddy creek. The shot came out clear  perhaps too clean  and sailed into a palmetto bush. Mueller couldnt find it and had to return to the spot of his previous shot. This time he took the penalty drop, hit that left of the green, took two chips to get on and made a quadruple-bogey 9. That ultimately allowed the four players at even par to have a chance, including Kartrude. Kartrude, an assistant at The Bears Club, is among 12 professionals who qualified for the PGA Championship for the first time. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/pga-club-pros-tyler-collet-quail-hollow-pga-championship-b25f2cba8b9a020df6dd2f1058797fc9,sports
"Dodgers hope struggling slugger Max Muncy and return of pitcher Tony Gonsolin boost lineup, rotation","LOS ANGELES (AP)  Max Muncy seemed to unleash a months worth of frustration with one swing on Wednesday, sending a 107.7 mph drive 433 feet over the center-field wall for his first home run of the season in the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-7 victory over the Miami Marlins. Its not easy, Muncy said, when asked how much of a grind the first month of the season has been. Its not easy on me or my family. Its a privilege to play in LA under this pressureits something Ive always thrived onbut it doesnt mean its been easy. Its been a rough month. Muncy, 34, entered the series finale with a .180 average, .531 OPS, no homers and four RBIs in his first 28 games, paltry power numbers for a slugger who had averaged 32 homers a year from 2018-2023. But he began to find his stroke in the batting cage over the weekend and got a little jolt of confidence with his third multi-hit game in Monday nights win. Then Muncy homered on a fastball from right-hander Cal Quantrill in the second inning on Wednesday and was rewarded with a massive sunflower-seed shower, courtesy of right fielder Teoscar Hernndez, as he returned to the dugout, and bear hugs and high-fives . That was huge for me  it was almost a little emotional, Muncy said. This clubhouse is very tight, very close, and everyone cares about each other. We all just want to win, and for us to win, everyone needs to be clicking. 
        
     The offense has been clicking this week. The Dodgers, who extended their win streak to five, had 17 hits, including three triples, one day after amassing 18 hits in a 15-2 victory. Mookie Betts hit a two-run single in the third inning and a two-run triple in the sixth, Freddie Freeman capped a four-run sixth with a two-run homer, and Hernndez and No. 9 hitter Austin Barnes each had three hits. The outburst backed a strong effort from right-hander Tony Gonsolin, who gave up three runs and six hits, struck out nine and walked none in six innings to earn the win in his first start since Tommy John surgery in August 2023. Gonsolin, who missed the first month of this season because of back tightness, induced 17 swinging strikes among his 77 pitches, effectively mixing a four-seam fastball that averaged 92.6 mph with his 87 mph slider, 84 mph split-fingered fastball and 80 mph curveball. It feels good to be back on the mound for sure, Gonsolin said. Just go out there and do my job and have funI think that was the ultimate goal. Gonsolin, an All-Star when he went 16-1 with a 2.14 ERA in 2022, said he did not feel nervous when he took the mound for the first time in 20 months. Tony has a different brain, manager Dave Roberts said. You can take that any way you want. I think hes just very confident in who he is now as a person, as a ballplayer, and the moment isnt gonna get too big for him. It wasnt like this was his first outing in however long. He just took it in stride and really looked good today. Gonsolin gave up a two-run homer to Kyle Stowers in the fourth inning and an RBI double to Stowers in the sixth, but he struck out Connor Norby looking at an 87 mph slider to end the sixth inning and preserve a 4-3 lead. Ive faced him a lot in my career, and its not a fun at-bat, especially when hes striking the (first-pitch) curveball, Freeman, the former Atlanta Braves star, said of Gonsolin. Its really hard as a hitter if hes doing that, because then youve got the heater up, foul it off, then the splitter down below. He had everything working for the first time in two years. To be on a big-league mound and do that was very impressive. With top-line starters Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow on the injured list because of shoulder inflammation, Gonsolins return gave a much-needed boost to the Dodgers rotation. And if Muncy can build on Wednesdays homer, it would provide a boost to the bottom of a lineup that has not been very productive. When youre a power hitter and you hit a lot of home runs every year, and its been, what, 28, 29 games, and he hasnt had one yet.  Subconsciously, he might press a little bit to try to get that first one, Freeman said of Muncy. I know hes been going through it, trying to get that first homer, to get his swing right. Hes been working so hard. So for him to see some results after all the hard work, hopefully the floodgates will open for Max. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-muncy-gonsolin-520ff2b1c168a1b8c5cea66212a49c06,sports
"Benches clear in Baltimore, but order is restored quickly as the Orioles top the Yankees 5-4","BALTIMORE (AP)  As bench-clearing situations go, this one felt like an overreaction. We got tangled up there, emotions from both sides kind of went off, said Baltimores Heston Kjerstad, who was right in the middle of it. I dont think it was too much. Benches and bullpens cleared in Baltimore in the fourth inning of the Orioles 5-4 win over the New York Yankees on Wednesday night. Kjerstad stole second base and second baseman Pablo Reyes had to leap over him to catch the throw. Reyes came down on top of Kjerstads head and neck area  it appeared the fielder had little choice  and then Kjerstad said something.  A couple words there that I felt like disrespected me in the heat of the moment, Reyes said through a translator. Later on, he kind of toned down a little bit. Whatever was said, it seemed excessive when the two were quickly joined by a much larger congregation of players around second base. But the situation de-escalated quickly enough. Maybe at the beginning he thought I did it on purpose, Reyes said. But obviously, he couldnt see the throw or how the play really developed. Kjerstad was hit on the head last July by a pitch from then-Yankees reliever Clay Holmes, causing benches to clear. Kjerstad ended up on the concussion list after that game, but he did not appear injured this time. The near-fight ended up being a mere footnote on a night the Orioles secured a much-needed series win over New York. Baltimore took the opener and the finale by a run each while losing the middle game 15-3. 
        
     The Orioles finished April in last place with a 12-18 record but winning their second series of the season gave them something they can try to build on. Good teams have bad months, Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. Were really focused on just one game at a time, one series at a time, trying to win as many series as possible. I loved how we came out, swung the bat well early. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-orioles-benches-clear-kjerstad-fc1106f4f42889e37e2b2eab275348ad,sports
"Bo Naylor hits 3-run homer, closer Emmanuel Clase gets save in Guardians 4-2 win over Twins","CLEVELAND (AP)  Bo Naylor hit a three-run homer and Luis Ortiz kept Minnesotas hitters off balance and off the scoreboard for 6 1/3 innings, leading the Cleveland Guardians to a 4-2 win over the Minnesota Twins on Wednesday night. Naylor connected in the seventh inning off reliever Brock Stewart after the Guardians finally scratched out a run against Minnesota starter Pablo Lpez (2-2), who held Cleveland scoreless over the first 6 1/3 innings. Cade Smith (1-0) struck out the only two batters he faced. Emmanuel Clase pitched the ninth  he gave up one run and two hits with a wild pitch  for his fifth save. It was the struggling All-Star closers first save since April 19. Brooks Lee homered for the Twins.  Ortiz and Lpez matched zeros over the first six innings before the Guardians got something going in the seventh with Jos Ramrez starting the rally with a single and stolen base. With one out, Carlos Santanas topper was fielded cleanly by Lpez, but he threw wildly to first allowing Ramrez to score. Stewart walked Gabriel Arias and struck out Daniel Schneemann before Naylor touched him for his fourth homer and second in two nights. After giving up a two-out double in the first inning, Lpez retired 14 straight hitters before Angel Martnez doubled in the sixth. Minnesota rookie left fielder DaShawn Keirsey Jr. kept the game scoreless in the seventh with a sensational diving catch to rob Clevelands Kyle Manzardo of extra bases. 
        
     With his next steal, Ramrez will become the first third baseman in history with 250 career homers and 250 steals. The six-time All-Star will also be the 24th major leaguer to accomplish the feat and just the second switch-hitter, joining Carlos Beltrn (435 homers, 312 steals).

Man who fell from 21-foot Clemente Wall at PNC Park during Pirates game in critical condition,"PITTSBURGH (AP)  A man who fell from the 21-foot-high Clemente Wall in right field at PNC Park during Wednesday nights game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs remained in critical condition on Thursday morning. Right after Andrew McCutchen hit a two-run double in the seventh inning to put the Pirates ahead 4-3, players began waving frantically for medical personnel and pointing to the man, who had fallen onto the warning track. The fan was tended to for approximately five minutes by members of both the Pirates and Cubs training staffs as well as PNC personnel before being removed from the field on a cart. The team issued a statement shortly after the game ended saying the man was transported to the trauma center at Allegheny General Hospital. Pittsburgh Public Safety, which includes Pittsburgh Police and EMS, posted on X Thursday that the incident is being treated as accidental in nature. Pirates manager Derek Shelton and Cubs manager Craig Counsell both alerted the umpire crew of the situation immediately after the play. Even though its 350 feet away or whatever it is, I mean the fact of how it went down and then laying motionless while the play is going on, I mean Craig saw it, I saw it. We both got out there, Shelton said. I think the umpires saw it because of the way it kicked. Its extremely unfortunate. Thats an understatement. Players from both teams could be seen praying and McCutchen held a cross that hung from his neck while the fan was taken off the field. 
        
     The five-time All-Star said Thursday that the team was devastated and that they prayed together after the game. Asked to describe his viewpoint of the sequence, McCutchen declined, saying that he is trying not to think about it and is more focused on the mans health. Were just hoping for the best for him, he said. I hope he pulls through because hes the reason why we are here. Hes the reason why we play the game. People that show their support so we can do something we love, partly because of him and because of fans. So, I just pray that hes alright. The game was paused for several minutes while the man was tended to but there was no official stoppage in play. I didnt see anything happen, but I saw (Counsells) face when he came out on the field, and I could tell that it was a very scary moment, Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson said. All we could do was just pray for a good, strong recovery for him and his family. I have never been part of something like that before and I hope I am never part of something like that again. Its a humble reminder of the gratitude we should all have to play this game. Folks obviously come out to support us, and they are a big reason why we are able to do what we do. Its obviously tough. At a time like that, you want (the fans) to know you love them. Fans have died from steep falls at baseball stadiums in the past. In 2015, Atlanta Braves season ticket holder Gregory K. Murrey flipped over guard rails from the upper deck at Turner Field. That was four years after Shannon Stone, a firefighter attending a game with his 6-year-old son, fell about 20 feet after reaching out for a foul ball tossed into the stands at the Texas Rangers former stadium. Both incidents prompted scrutiny over the height of guard rails at stadiums. The Rangers raised theirs, while the Braves settled a lawsuit with Murreys family. A spectator at a 2022 NFL game at Pittsburghs Acrisure Stadium died following a fall on an escalator. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/cubs-pirates-fan-falls-88128fb881551cf9fb343f2a64f60aa0,sports
"Schwarbers 3-run homer paces Phillies to 4th straight win, 7-2 over Nationals","PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Kyle Schwarber homered in the first inning for the second consecutive game, Max Kepler and J.T. Realmuto also went deep, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Washington Nationals 7-2 on Wednesday night. Schwarber launched a three-run homer off Washington starter Jake Irvin. It was his ninth of the season, and it extended his league-leading on-base streak to 36 games, dating to last season. Kepler hit his third homer of the season in the sixth inning against Irvin and Realmuto added a homer off Eduardo Salazar in the eighth. Bryson Stott and Nick Castellanos each had RBI singles for Philadelphia, which has won four straight. Cristopher Sanchez (3-1) allowed two runs in five innings in his first appearance since leaving a start after just two innings last Tuesday at the New York Mets with forearm tightness. Nathaniel Lowe had an RBI double for the Nationals. Irvin (2-1) allowed six runs on eight hits in six innings. Before the game, the Nationals cut their batting practice short when a member of their staff experienced a medical incident on the field. The person was attended to by the medical staff of both teams and paramedics at the ballpark before being taken away on a stretcher. The Nationals did not identify the individual, nor did they provide an update prior to the conclusion of the game. After yielding an RBI double to Lowe in his previous plate appearance, Sanchez struck him out with two men on base in the fifth inning to conclude his outing.

"Contreras hits 3-run homer in 1st inning of nightcap, Cardinals sweep Reds 6-0 and 9-1","CINCINNATI (AP)  Willson Contreras hit a three-run homer in the first inning of the second game, Pedro Pags added a solo shot and the St. Louis Cardinals swept a day-night doubleheader from the Cincinnati Reds 6-0 and 9-1 on Wednesday.  Contreras and Pags homered off 22-year-old right-hander Chase Petty, 22, who allowed nine runs, seven hits and two walks over 2 1/3 innings in his major league debut. Pags homered on the 11th pitch of his at-bat and Jordan Walker added a two-run double in the third. St. Louis entered 2-12 on the road and matched its season wins total away from home. Petty was selected 26th overall by Minnesota in the 2021 amateur draft and was acquired in the March 2022 trade that sent pitcher Sonny Gray to the Twins. Cardinals starter Steven Matz allowed five hits with no walks and six strikeouts in four scoreless innings, lowering his ERA to 1.50. Gordon Graceffo (1-0) got his first major league win, giving up one run and two hits in five innings with five strikeouts and no walks. He averaged 96.4 mph with his fastball.  St. Louis hit three consecutive homers in the ninth inning and beat the Reds 6-0 in the first game, a makeup of Tuesdays rainout. Cincinnati was 1 for 13 with runners in scoring position on the day.

"Orioles take 2 of 3 from the Yankees, winning the series finale 5-4 despite Judges homer","BALTIMORE (AP)  Ryan Mountcastle and Ramn Uras homered during Baltimores four-run second inning, and the Orioles held on for a 5-4 victory over the New York Yankees on Wednesday night despite three more hits by Aaron Judge. Judge hit a two-run homer in the first, then added two singles to finish April with a .427 batting average, but the last-place Orioles managed to take two of three in this series with the AL East leaders. Baltimore won the opener and finale by a run each while losing the middle game 15-3. Bryan Baker (2-0) won in relief, one of six bullen arms the Orioles used. Flix Bautista pitched a perfect ninth for his fifth save, striking out Trent Grisham on a 99.2 mph pitch to leave Judge in the on-deck circle when the game ended. Carlos Carrasco (2-2) allowed four runs and eight hits in 3 1/3 innings. Mountcastle ended an 0-for-18 slump with a two-run shot that tied the game at 2, and then Uras put the Orioles ahead with a solo drive one out later. Adley Rutschman added an RBI single in the inning. Paul Goldschmidt made it 4-3 with a fifth-inning homer off starter Cade Povich, but an error by shortstop Anthony Volpe helped the Orioles load the bases with nobody out in the bottom half and they restored the two-run lead. Benches and bullpens cleared in the fourth after Baltimores Heston Kjerstad stole second. Second baseman Pablo Reyes had to leap to catch the throw and came down around Kjerstads head and neck area. There was quickly a large congregation of players around second but order was restored. 
        
     With a man on second and one out in the seventh, Ramn Laureano made a sliding catch in deep left-center field. Judge followed with an RBI single, but New York only managed one run in the inning.

"More than half the SEC will have new QBs in 2025, though some changes come with continuity","More than half the teams in the powerhouse Southeastern Conference will have new starting quarterbacks this fall. Many of the changes were expected. Some were needed. All of them will be overly dissected before training camps open in August. Alabama ( Jalen Milroe ), Auburn (Payton Thorne) Missouri (Brady Cook), Ole Miss ( Jaxson Dart ) and Texas ( Quinn Ewers ) lost entrenched starters to the NFL. But those typical progressions were hardly the norm elsewhere. Georgias Carson Beck transferred to Miami. Tennessees Nico Iamaleava bailed on a $2.4 million name, image and likeness deal and ended up at UCLA. Oklahomas Jackson Arnold landed at Auburn. And Kentuckys Brock Vandagriff retired from football after getting benched. A new day and age in football, said current Florida backup quarterback Harrison Bailey, who previously played at Tennessee, UNLV and Louisville. Im glad Im getting out of it. The burgeoning transfer portal  the lure of more money or a better opportunity elsewhere, really  continues to create roster turnover in college football, and no school appears safe from the chaos. Not even the SEC, which has every head coaching returning for the first time since 2019 and for just the second time since 2005. Despite all the different faces under center, 10 SEC schools are poised to start the season with some level of continuity at the all-important QB position. Arkansas Taylen Green, Floridas DJ Lagway, LSUs Garrett Nussmeier, Mississippi States Blake Shapen, South Carolinas LaNorris Sellers, Texas A&Ms Marcel Reed and Vanderbilts Diego Pavia have significant experience in their current systems. Sellers, though, has a new offensive coordinator, former Alabama coach Mike Shula.  Green could make a jump in his second year under offensive coordinator Bobby Petrino. Lagway and Sellers, athletic big men with above-average arms, look like budding stars who could carry improving teams to the College Football Playoff. Nussmeier is entering his third year in coach Brian Kellys system. Shapen, a sixth-year senior, is healthy again. Reed flashed early last season before losing four of his final starts as a freshman. And Pavia was a bright spot for the Commodores, finishing with 20 touchdown passes and four interceptions. Georgias Gunner Stockton came up big in last years SEC championship game against Texas and should benefit from sitting behind Beck the last two seasons. Ole Miss is confident Austin Simmons will step in for Dart and keep the Rebels rolling. And the Longhorns have been waiting two years for Arch Manning to take the spotlight. I hope hes got a really hard decision to make around January 21, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian told the Houston Touchdown Club this week. That means we played a long time. That means he played a really good season. And that means hes trying to figure out do I want one more year in the burnt orange or is it time to go to the NFL? I hope its a really hard decision. I hope its not a no-brainer to come back to school. The six remaining schools  Alabama, Auburn, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee  have varying degrees of uncertainty about their QBs following spring football. Alabama is turning to Ty Simpson. Auburn is expected to go with transfer Jackson Arnold. Kentucky is taking a chance with transfer Zach Calzada, who is entering his seventh collegiate season. Missouri appears content with Penn State transfer Beau Pribula, who signed a $1.5 million NIL. Oklahoma believes its new duo from Washington State  quarterback John Mateer and offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle  will pay immediate dividends. Tennessee might have the most to figure out. The Volunteers ended up with UCLA transfer Joey Aguilar in a pseudo trade. But Aguilar still has to beat out Jake Merklinger and George MacIntyre for the job. Im looking forward to being a part of the traditions, the fans, and the legacy of winning at Tennessee, Aguilar wrote on social media. Im ready to get to work, compete at the highest level and building something special with my teammates and coaches.

Former Wisconsin forward Serah Williams transferring to UConn,"STORRS, Conn. (AP)  Former Wisconsin forward Serah Williams says she is transferring to UConn. Williams posted on social media Wednesday that she had committed to the reigning national champions. Williams had entered the transfer portal after Marisa Moseley stepped down as Wisconsins coach last month. Williams, who is 6-foot-4, averaged 19.2 points, 9.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.3 blocks this past season and was the 2023-2024 Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and a first-team all conference selection. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

"Alabamas Williams, LSUs Perkins and Texas Baxter top list of SEC players to watch in 25","Non-quarterback players from each of the SECs 16 schools who could be poised to help change his teams fortunes in 2025: WR Ryan Williams already had his breakout season with 48 receptions for 865 yards and eight touchdowns as a freshman in 2024. What will he do for an encore? A good start would mean more consistency after failing to crack 100 yards in the Tides last nine games. After three lackluster years at Georgia, LB Xavian Sorey Jr. came on strong in his debut season with the Razorbacks. He finished with 99 tackles, which ranked seventh in the league, and is expected to anchor Sam Pittmans defense as a senior. WR Cam Coleman was arguably the SECs best receiver in late November, notching a combined 23 catches for 306 yards and six touchdowns against Louisiana-Monroe, Texas A&M and Alabama. Like Williams at Alabama, he was only a freshman. Although RB Jaden Baugh took a backseat to teammate JaKobi Jackson (10 carries for 198 yards and 3 TDs) in the teams spring game, he is expected to be the lead ballcarrier when the Gators open the season. Baugh ran for 673 yards and seven TDs while sharing carries with Jackson and Montrell Johnson in 2024. DL Christen Miller should be a key piece as the Bulldogs attempt to revamp a front seven that lost Mykel Williams, Jalon Walker, Tyrion Ingram-Dawkins, Smael Mondon, Warren Brinson and Chaz Chambliss. The 6-foot-4, 305-pound Georgia native had five tackles against Notre Dame in the College Football Playoff semifinals. 
        
     WR Kendrick Law transferred to Lexington after three years at Alabama, where he totaled 33 catches for 343 yards and a score. With Dane Key (Nebraska) and Barion Brown (LSU) gone, he could emerge as the Wildcats top threat. LB Harold Harold Perkins was supposed to be in the NFL by now. At least thats how it looked after he totaled 27 tackles for loss, including 14 sacks, in his first two years with the Tigers. But he tore a ligament in his right knee against UCLA in late September and is back to prove hes healthy and worthy of a first-round draft pick. DE Princewell Umanmielen, the younger brother of Princely Umanmielen, transferred to Ole Miss after two years and seven tackles for loss at Nebraska. Princewell Umanmielen should help the Rebels rebuild a talented front that also included Walter Nolan and JJ Pegues. S Isaac Smith, a 6-foot, 205-pound Mississippi native, led the conference with 127 tackles as a sophomore last season. The hard-hitting safety was one of the bright spots for a Bulldogs defense that ranked last in the league in nearly every category. On his fourth college stop in as many years, WR Kevin Coleman Jr. is finally home. Now he gets tasked with helping the Tigers replace standouts Luther Burden III and Theo Wease. Coleman caught 74 passes for 932 yards and six scores at Mississippi State in 2024. He also played for Louisville (2023) and Jackson State (2022). Following a nine-sack campaign as a junior in 2024, DL R Mason Thomas already is gaining traction as a potential first-round draft pick in 2026 despite his 6-foot-2, 249-pound frame. In 13 games last season, edge rusher Dylan Stewart had 23 tackles, including 6  sacks, and was widely regarded as one of the best freshmen defenders in the country. There already are comparisons to Jadeveon Clowney and speculation that the 6-foot-5, 245-pounder has the potential to be a top pick in 2027. CB Jermod McCoy was a lockdown cornerback as a sophomore in 2024  a semifinalist for the Jim Thorpe Award  after transferring from Oregon State. Pro Football Focus gave the 6-foot, 193-pound Texan an 89.6 coverage grade and a near-perfect score (99.9) in its athleticism metric. RB CJ Baxter was projected to be the teams starter when he tore two ligaments in his right knee in August 2024. As a true freshman in 2023, Baxter ran for 659 yards and averaged 4.8 yards a carry. Hes fully healthy now and expected to share carries with Quintrevion Wisner. CB Will Lee III surprised some outsiders when he decided to stay in school for his senior season. It was a boon for second-year coach Mike Elkos defense. Lee finished last season with 42 tackles and two interceptions, including a 93-yarder for a score against rival Texas in late November. G Chase Mitchell anchors an offensive line tasked with keeping dynamic quarterback Diego Pavia upright. Mitchell is one of five transfers up front for the Commodores and the units only returning starter. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Andre Agassi wins his professional pickleball debut with partner Anna Leigh Waters,"NAPLES, Fla. (AP)  Andre Agassi won his professional pickleball debut a day after turning 55, teaming with 18-year-old Anna Leigh Waters to defeat a pair of even younger teens 11-8, 9-11, 11-7 in the mixed pro division at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships on Wednesday. Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam champion who retired from professional tennis in 2006. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame five years later. He has participated in made-for-TV pickleball exhibitions with other former tennis players and can be seen pitching pickleball equipment via social media. Agassi will be a studio analyst for TNT Sports during the semifinals and finals at the French Open this year. He won the title at Roland Garros in 1999 to complete a career Grand Slam.

Maine lawmaker appeals to Supreme Court over censure by state House for transgender athlete post,"WASHINGTON (AP)  A Republican state lawmaker from Maine appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday after she was censured by the state House for a social media post about a transgender athlete, a move that comes amid sparring over the issue between the Democratically controlled state and the Trump administration.  Rep. Laurel Libby argued that the censure by the House has blocked her from speaking and voting on the floor, leaving the residents she represents with no representation. Libby asked the Supreme Court for an order requiring her legislative votes be counted as her lawsuit plays out. Her censure came after she posted about a high school athlete who won a girls track competition. Libby included a photo of the student and identified them by first name, with the name in quotation marks and said the student had previously competed in boys track. Libbys post went viral, preceding a public disagreement over the issue between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills. The Trump administration later filed a lawsuit against the state for not complying with the governments push to ban transgender athletes.  Maines Democratic House Speaker, Ryan Fecteau, accused Libby of violating the states legislative ethics code and the Maine House of Representatives censured her in February. Libby said in a lawsuit that the censure violated her right to free speech. A federal judge, though, found that the sanction isnt severe enough to overcome legal blocks on courts intervening in legislative functions.",https://apnews.com/article/transgender-athlete-maine-lawmaker-trump-sports-8859162eb75b9bebae7540a91a5e207e,sports
"Alijah Arenas, USC recruit and son of former NBA player Gilbert Arenas, out of hospital after crash","LOS ANGELES (AP)  Alijah Arenas, a Southern California basketball recruit who is a son of former NBA player Gilbert Arenas, has been released from the hospital six days after he was involved in a fiery crash, his family announced Wednesday. We are grateful to share that Alijah Arenas has been released from the hospital and is now resting comfortably under close watch, the family said in a statement to ESPN. While his journey to full recovery is just beginning, his spirit remains strong, and he is surrounded by love and support. The Govan and Arenas family are preparing for the road ahead with faith and determination, committed to nurturing Alijah back to 100%. He remains blessed, resilient, and in high spirits. Josiah Johnson, a host of the elder Arenas podcast, said the younger Arenas did not suffer major injuries but initially was placed in an induced coma. Johnson said Alijah was returning from the gym when he lost control of the Tesla Cybertruck he was driving in the Reseda section of the San Fernando Valley. The Los Angeles Fire Department said the vehicle crashed into a tree and/or fire hydrant. No official cause of the crash has been announced. Arenas, who committed to the Trojans in January, attends Chatsworth High.

Chahal performs hat trick in Punjab win that ends Chennais hopes of IPL playoffs,"CHENNAI, India (AP)  Chennai Super Kings became the first team to fall out of contention for the Indian Premier League playoffs as Yuzvendra Chahal performed a hat trick in Punjab Kings four-wicket win on Wednesday. Half-centuries from captain Shreyas Iyer (72) and opening batter Prabhsimran Singh (54) anchored Punjab to 194-6 and propelled their team to No. 2 on the table with 13 points. Leg-spinner Chahal picked up all four of his wickets in the penultimate over to finish with 4-32 as Chennai stumbled to 190 all out in 19.2 overs. A dismal season for five-time champion Chennai saw them lose five home games and it is the third time in the last four seasons that they have missed the playoffs. Last-place Chennai started the season with win against Mumbai Indians at home before they lost five straight games. They ended their losing streak by beating Lucknow Super Giants but again lost three consecutive games and have just four points after 10 matches. Iyer smartly controlled Punjabs solid run-chase in the company of Singh with both batters hitting 10 fours and seven sixes in between them. Priyansh Arya (23) provided a brisk start of 44 off 28 balls before he was caught behind of a short ball from Khaleel Ahmed in the fifth over. Chennai struck back briefly in the middle overs when Singh slog swept spinner Noor Ahmad and was caught at mid-wicket and Maheesh Pathirana dismissed Nehal Wadhera in the 15th over. 
        
     But Iyer upped the ante by smacking 20 runs in Pathiranas next over that featured two straight sixes. Shashank Singh smashed two sixes in his 12-ball knock of 23 before he was spectacularly caught by Dewald Brevis at deep mid-wicket. With only three required for victory Punjab lost two more wickets before Marco Jansen raised the victory with a winning boundary. Iyer dragged Pathiranas full pitched delivery back onto his stumps which ended a scintillating 41-ball knock and Suryansh Shedge was caught at mid-wicket against Ahmed. Sam Curran had brought Chennai close to breaching the 200-run mark for the only second time this season, but once he got caught behind for 88 off 47 balls in the 18th over, Chennai folded quickly against Chahal. Iyer resorted to the experience of Chahal for the penultimate over after Punjab was penalized for slow over-rate and had to deliver the final two overs with five fielders inside the 30-yard circle. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni smacked Chahal for a straight six off the first ball before he holed out at long off of the next delivery. Chahal then dismissed Deepak Hooda, Anshul Kamboj and Khaleel Ahmed off successive balls to complete his hat trick. Chennais struggle at the top-order continued when they lost three wickets inside the batting powerplay that included the key wicket of Ravindra Jadeja (17) who feathered spinner Harpreet Brar behind the wickets. But Curran and Brevis (32) put on 78 runs and raised Chennai hopes of a strong total before Brevis was bowled by Afghanistan fast bowler Azmatullah Omarzai just before the death overs. Curran smacked Shedge for 26 runs in the 16th over that included two sixes and two fours before he got caught behind in the next over while trying to leave Jansens short ball and the lower order collapsed against Chahals brilliant over. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/chennai-punjab-ipl-bd442893735eb44d1372b15d4f8b1e27,sports
Marlins outfielder Griffin Conine has season-ending shoulder surgery,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Miami Marlins rookie outfielder Griffin Canning will miss the rest of the season following surgery on his left shoulder. Conine jammed his shoulder into the ground on a head-first slide into second in an 11-10 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies last Saturday. The 27-year left the game and was placed on the 60-day injured list the following day. An MRI Monday confirmed a dislocated shoulder, which was repaired Tuesday in Los Angeles by Dodgers head team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache. Through 20 games, Conine was batting .281 with a .790 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, one home run, seven doubles and seven RBIs. He made his big league debut last August and hit .268 with a .777 OPS, three homers and 12 RBIs in 30 games. Yeah, Griffin was playing so well, and a key cog for us, an important piece, Marlins manager Clayton McCullough said on Wednesday. Surgery was successful, and everything should be on track for Griffin to get through his rehab and be a full-go come spring training. Conines father, Jeff, played on the Marlins World Series champions in 1997 and 2003 and is known as Mr. Marlin.  Javier Sanoja, Kyle Stowers, Eric Wagaman and Ronny Simon have started in left field in Conines absence. I think well continue to rotate guys through there, McCullough said. Its nice to have some versatile pieces that can go out there and play. You can start the game in one setup, and depending how the game goes, guys can come in. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/conine-surgery-marlins-14e74d5f26d4ebb2891a129e87604842,sports
Ray Romano and Sebastian Maniscalco share banter while atop Italian Alps in Winter Olympics promo,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  NBC is continuing its strategy of infusing the Olympics with pop culture and celebrity appeal to generate momentum ahead of the Milan-Cortina Winter Games in Italy next year. This time, Italian American comedians Ray Romano and Sebastian Maniscalco will make their debut during a comical promotion, the network said on Wednesday. The commercial will air during NBCs Kentucky Derby coverage on Saturday. In the spot, Romano and Maniscalco stand atop the Italian Alps with snowboards in hand, attempting to discuss thrilling winter sports like skiing, snowboarding and luge. But their discussion is repeatedly sidetracked by their shared obsession with Italian food. Ray and I teamed up for the Olympics, two Italian guys trying to figure out winter sports, Maniscalco said in a statement. Lets just say, we thought luge was a type of pasta. Romano and Maniscalco filmed the commercial in Los Angeles, with the mountaintop backdrop brought to life by Industrial Light & Magic, the visual effects company founded by George Lucas and recently known for its work on The Mandalorian. The network said Romano and Maniscalco were an easy choice to start building anticipation for the Winter Games. Both are instantly recognizable, deeply beloved, and naturally funny, said Joseph Lee, senior vice president of creative marketing, sports and entertainment at NBC. He said the network is using the same playbook of enlisting entertainers and athletes. 
        
     Last year, popular figures who appeared in promo spots included Snoop Dogg, Megan Thee Stallion, Simone Biles, Peyton Manning, Cardi B, SZA and Lily Collins. Were running the same playbook across the campaign: pairing entertainment personalities with the Olympics (and often Olympians) in fun, unexpected ways, Lee said.

UNCs Belichick defends Hudson as doing her job after interjecting during CBS interview,"North Carolina football coach Bill Belichick defended girlfriend Jordon Hudson for interjecting during a CBS interviewers questions about their relationship and said she was simply doing her job. The six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach and first-time college coach at UNC issued a statement through the school Wednesday, which followed an appearance on CBS News Sunday Morning to promote his upcoming book on his coaching life. In the interview, Hudson objected to a question about how the two had met while Tony Dokoupil referred to her during the segment as being a constant presence in the interview. The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation which we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career, Belichick said in his statement. Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative  that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation  which is simply not true. Belichick also said he told his publicist with book publisher Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book. But CBS News pushed back in its own statement Wednesday. A six-time Super Bowl winning coach issued a statement Wednesday in support of his girlfriends actions during a recent TV interview. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports. When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview, the statement said. There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed. 
        
     The awkward interview added to the attention and curiosity that has followed the 73-year-old Belichick, hired as the Tar Heels head coach in December after his ultra-successful run with the New England Patriots, and the 24-year-old Hudson, who has frequently posted glimpses into their relationship with social media photos. That has included her role in Belichicks transition to college coaching, such as a March public records report by The Assembly about Belichicks request for an athletic official at UNC to copy in Hudson on emails sent to him. In his Wednesday statement, Belichick said he shares both a personal and professional relationship with Hudson and that he expected the interview would focus solely on the book release instead of his personal life. He said Hudson had stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion in an effort to ensure the interview stayed on track. He also said the couple has been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021. During the CBS interview, Belichick shrugged off attention on his relationship with Hudson, saying: Never been too worried about what everybody else thinks, just try to do what I feel like is best for me and whats right. When Dokoupil asked how they met, Hudson  sitting at a nearby table  said flatly: Were not talking about this. In a statement Tuesday, InkWell Management  a literary agency working with Belichick on his upcoming book  said the interview veered into a discussion of Belichicks personal life and resulted in a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life. Bill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment, the agency said. ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/unc-belichick-girlfriend-jordon-hudson-444939d933e4f92f280f62ba6b193de1,sports

Winn homered on the third pitch of the game from Brady Singer (4-1). Scott hit a three-run homer in the ninth against Alexis Daz, and Nootbaar and Winn followed as St. Louis hit three homers in a 14-pitch span.  Miles Mikolas (1-2) allowed three hits and no walks in 5 1/3 innings with four strikeouts. The Cardinals had been 0-5 in his previous starts. Kyle Leahy, JoJo Romero and Matt Svanson followed with hitless relief in the Cardinals third shutout. Cincinnati was blanked for the fourth time. Singer (4-1) gave up two hits and three walks in six innings. Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol was ejected by plate umpire Bruce Dreckman in the eighth after arguing a called strike to Winn, the 17th ejection of his managerial career and second this season. Winn hit his second and third homers this season, walked twice and stole a base. Nootbars homer was his fifth. Scott hit his second homer and stole his 10th base. Cincinnatis Elly De La Cruz extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games and stole two bases for a major league-leading 13. Gavin Lux went 0 for 3 with a walk, ending his 12-game hitting streak. 
        
     Reds outfielder Austin Hays (hamstring) is day to day.  Tyler Callihan, a 24-year-old selected on the third round of the 2019 amateur draft, went 0 for 2 and played left field in his major league debut. Cincinnati placed infielder Jeimer Candelario on the 10-day injured list with a lower-back injury. He is hitting .113. Daz has given up four home runs this season, matching his 2023 total and two shy of his 2024 total. Mikolas had an 11.25 ERA after two starts but has lowered in to 4.66. He hasnt allowed a homer in 29 innings this season.

"Kentucky changes its athletic department to an LLC, hoping to become more nimble in finding revenue","With college athletics bracing for the expected approval of a $2.8 billion NCAA antitrust settlement, the University of Kentucky is believed to be the first school to convert its athletic department to a limited-liability holding company. The creation of Champions Blue LLC, approved last week by the universitys Board of Trustees, is seen as a way for Kentucky to become more nimble in finding new revenue. The pending settlement in the House case will clear the way for schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with their athletes, but name, image and likeness deals on top of that are seen as a key asset in landing and keeping elite recruits  and that takes money. The plan calls for a board that will have wide experience in fundraising, and the school noted it hopes to unlock new revenue streams through public-private partnerships and potentially other transactions, such as real estate. There are so many benefits to creating Champions Blue, said Jacob Most, UKs director of strategic communications. It provides the flexibility needed to help us stay well-positioned during this period of continued evolution in college athletics. We will benefit from a new board of internal and outside experts with sports business experience  including in pro sports  that will help guide us in finding revenue streams to support our teams. The so-called House settlement and changing landscape were driving factors in the decision, and UK said in its announcement Friday that the changes will add millions more each year to the expenses of intercollegiate programs. 
        
     An LLC provides some legal protections against losses or risks, and experts said transitioning to one may be a wise choice for major institutions like Kentucky. Being able to make quicker choices in the current landscape could be a key benefit. It might not work across the board, however. Making the shift requires thoughtful consideration, said Jim Booz, a former deputy athletic director at Virginia and now the director of college athletics advisory services at the accounting firm James Moore & Co. Its important for every institution to really think about their strategic alignment and what it is that they want to accomplish in this new landscape of college athletics, Booz said. Certainly, a move like this one allows the University of Kentucky to be a little bit more agile and nimble in executing, in all likelihood, some strategies that they plan to implement post the House case. Helen Drew, a sports law professor at the University of Buffalo, said agility is increasingly valuable in college athletics. As the amateur model vanishes, athletic departments are more inclined to make changes. The traditional structure has never fit particularly well, and certainly now it does not fit well at all with the transactional nature of college sports, Drew said. This is the first institution to acknowledge that were in a different era and that the organizational structures that weve used up until this time dont work well with the new reality. UK officials said the structure is appealing to all parties, including athletes seeking NIL compensation.

Javy Bezs 9th career grand slam leads Tigers over Astros 7-4,"HOUSTON (AP)  Javy Bez capped a five-run third inning with his ninth career grand slam, Detroit Tigers avoided a series sweep by beating the Houston Astros 7-4 on Wednesday. Baezs two-out homer off AJ Blubaugh (0-1), a 24-year-old right-hander making his major league debut, put the Tigers ahead 7-1. All five runs were unearned due to shortstop Jeremy Pea throwing error on Kerry Carpenters grounder. Riley Greene tied his career high with four hits. Brenan Hanifee (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Jackson Jobe, who allowed three runs, four hits and four walks in three innings. Detroit has won five of seven and nine of 13. Blubaugh (0-1) struck out two in a 1-2-3 first and gave up seven runs  two earned  and five hits in four innings with six strikeouts and a walk. Pea hit the first career leadoff home run, the first of his three hits, but Colt Keith hit a two-run homer in the second to put Detroit ahead for good. Jose Altuve hit a two-run double in the fifth and Victor Caratini homered in the seventh against Tyler Holton.  Holton struck out Yainer Diaz to strand two runners in the seventh and Tommy Kahnle struck out Christian Walker to leave two runners on in the eighth. Houston went 2 for 10 with runners in scoring position and stranded 12 runners. Bez drove a high sweeper over the left-field scoreboard. Houston allowed five unearned runs in the third inning after giving up three in its first 29 games.

"Lucas Giolito looks sharp in his Red Sox debut, more than 15 months after he signed with Boston","TORONTO (AP)  More than 15 months after signing a free-agent deal with the Red Sox, right-hander Lucas Giolito looked sharp in his long-awaited Boston debut Wednesday night. Giolito allowed three runs and five hits in six innings at Toronto, exiting with a 6-3 lead. He walked two and struck out seven. Im happy with how I competed, Giolito said. Im just not pleased with how I finished. I can definitely finish stronger than that. Giolito threw 90 pitches, 61 for strikes. Good fastball, good changeup, moving the ball around, Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. He did an outstanding job. Obviously he was upset with the way it ended but if we get this version of Lucas, were going to be in good shape. Ernie Clement and Bo Bichette hit back-to-back singles to begin the third inning, but Giolito struck out Vladimir Guerrero Jr. looking, got Anthony Santander to fly out, then struck out George Springer looking to escape the jam. That was a good feeling, Giolito said. Those were the first three in a streak of 11 consecutive outs for Giolito, a run that ended when Springer walked in the sixth. Daulton Varsho and Alejandro Kirk followed with back-to-back homers. I thought I pitched well until the sixth, Giolito said. The sixth inning, some crucial, crucial mistakes. We were playing the changeup pretty well to the corners, and I just left them up there. So, something to learn from. Got to finish stronger. 
        
     Giolito was in line for the win before Santander tied the score 6-all with a three-run homer off right-hander Garrett Whitlock in the seventh. Really proud of him, Whitlock said of Giolito. Really happy that hes back with us. Toronto won 7-6 on Kirks game-ending hit in the 10th inning. The Red Sox activated Giolito off the injured list before the game and put left-hander Brennan Bernardino on the bereavement list. Giolito had been sidelined since spring training because of a strained left hamstring. It was Giolitos first major league appearance since Oct. 1, 2023, when he started for Cleveland at Detroit. Staked to a 2-0 lead before taking the mound Wednesday, Giolito allowed a leadoff single to Bichette in the first inning but struck out Varsho to strand a pair. In March, Giolito left his first spring start against Philadelphia after one inning when his hamstring tightened. The 30-year-old signed a $38.5 million. two-year contract with Boston before last season, but didnt pitch in 2024 because of a partial tear in his right ulnar collateral ligament. He went 0-2 with a 5.19 ERA in five minor league rehab starts. The rehab outings were completely different, Giolito said. I was going out there kind of treating them more like spring training. Theres no adrenaline, trying to work on some mechanical things. In 2023, Giolito went 8-15 with a 4.88 ERA in 33 starts with the Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Angels and Cleveland Guardians. He allowed 41 homers, second-most in the majors. After beginning his career with six games for Washington, Giolito went 59-52 with a 4.20 ERA in 162 starts with the White Sox before Chicago traded him to the Angels in July of 2023. After going 1-5 with a 6.89 ERA in six starts for Los Angeles, Giolito was claimed off waivers by Cleveland and went 1-4 with a 7.04 ERA in six starts. He entered Wednesday with a 61-62 record and a 4.43 ERA in 178 starts and two relief appearances. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/lucas-giolito-red-sox-debut-243903b755611196427d959767505be1,sports
Why Liverpools Premier League title could spark an era of openness in Englands top flight,"LIVERPOOL, England (AP)  By winning the Premier League title this season, Liverpool has done what no other top-flight English team has managed since 2017. That is to be a surprise champion. What we do know is that no one saw us as a title contender when we started at the beginning of the season, Liverpool coach Arne Slot said in February. Not since Antonio Contes debut year at Chelsea has the Premier League been won by an outsider. Not that Liverpools title triumph is anything like the historic upset achieved by Leicester in 2016. But priced at 13/2 by some bookmakers at the start of the campaign and having to navigate the departure of iconic manager Jurgen Klopp last season, this wasnt supposed to be Liverpools year. The main aim in what they told me is look at the players, give your opinion about it so we can go into this project in the second and the third year, Slot said recently. Instead, under the Dutchmans guidance, the Merseyside club has clinched a record-equaling 20th English league title ahead of schedule and potentially kicked off a new era in the Premier League where, for the first time in a long time, the race for future titles feels wide open. Manchester Citys dominance of the previous seven seasons under Pep Guardiola has been halted. And unlike after Liverpools title success of 2020, City does not look so certain to return to the top of the standings next year, with Guardiolas squad being overhauled. 
        
     Liverpool has capitalized on Citys sudden and unexpected fall in a manner none of its rivals could. Whereas back-to-back runner up Arsenal looked best-placed to dethrone the four-time defending champion, the London club is instead on course to finish second for the third year in a row after an injury-hampered and inconsistent season. Slot inherited a squad that had been rebuilt by Klopp and honed it into a serious title contender  spearheaded by Mohamed Salahs age-defying form, while players like Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch have been the heartbeat of midfield. Slot has been a steadying hand and his patient approach has paid off while City, in particular, and Arsenal have faltered. Yet  Liverpools 15-point lead at the top notwithstanding  it is not immediately evident that this represents the start of a period of dominance for Slots team. Slot has joined a select group of managers by winning the title in his first year in the Premier League  following Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte. Of those, only Mourinho successfully defended the title. Since 2009, only Guardiolas City  champion in six out of seven seasons between 2018 and 2024  has managed to retain the title. With the backing of Citys Abu Dhabi owners, Guardiola may build another great team, but he has a big job on his hands to replace Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker, while Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan are both in the latter stages of their careers. Will Rodri be the same player when he returns from ACL damage? And as lethal as Erling Haaland has been, Citys attacking play has become much more predictable with the Norwegian goal machine at the point of attack. Liverpool is also expected to spend big in the offseason, having only signed Federico Chiesa since Slot took charge. Salah and Virgil van Dijk have ended the months-long uncertainty over their futures by signing contract extensions, but by the start of next season they will be 33 and 34 respectively, placing an element of doubt about their ability to maintain their standards. Can Liverpool find another goalscorer to take the burden off Salah in the manner of his former strike partner Sadio Mane? And how much of a void would Trent Alexander-Arnolds departure leave if, as widely reported, he is due to join Real Madrid? What of Arsenal  on course to be back-to-back-to-back runner-up, but into the semifinals of the Champions League, having overwhelmed holder Madrid? Mikel Arteta has assembled a squad that has been in title contention for three years in a row and may still be yet to reach its peak. The long-awaited addition of an elite goalscorer could be the final ingredient required to get it over the line. Newcastle and Aston Villa are building impressive squads and the next step is to make a serious push for the title, while Chelsea has also improved. Liverpool is top of the tree again and has matched record held by its fierce rival Manchester United. The future, however, feels wide open. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/liverpool-premier-league-title-1a8e26df607d22f2ad1acd0b96d3fbfb,sports
Man City beats Forest 2-0 to reach FA Cup final and keep trophy hopes alive,"LONDON (AP)  Even Manchester Citys worst season under Pep Guardiola could still end with a trophy.  On the day it was officially deposed as Premier League champion, City reached the FA Cup final for the third year in a row by beating Nottingham Forest 2-0 at Wembley Stadium to maintain a chance of salvaging something from a dismal campaign.  City scored early Sunday in each half as Rico Lewis put his team ahead in just the second minute and defender Josko Gvardiol doubled the lead in the 51st with a header from a corner.  Forest hit the woodwork three times after that but couldnt get a consolation goal in its first FA Cup semifinal since 1991.  The win gives Pep Guardiolas team a chance to salvage something from a disappointing campaign where its hopes of a fifth straight Premier League title disappeared early and it failed to even reach the round of 16 in the Champions League.  City will play Crystal Palace in the final on May 17.  Unfortunately, the season has not been as we wanted, but we are still in another FA Cup final, said City midfielder Mateo Kovacic, who set up the opening goal. So its good that we want to finish it in a strong way.  Liverpool clinched the Premier League title at the same time as City was playing, and even an FA Cup title would be a mere consolation for a club that has dominated English soccer under Guardiola.  Even Guardiola made it clear that winning the cup would not make this a successful season. 
        
     Noooo, the Spaniard said emphatically. The season has not been good. We are a thousand million points behind Liverpool. ... But of course the damage will be (smaller). Thats currently 21 points behind Liverpool for the record, but City still has work to do just to secure a Champions League spot for next season. Forest is one of the teams trying to finish above City, meaning theres little time to dwell on this loss.  Tomorrow we will wake up and see that we have a lot to fight for, Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo said.  The jaded feeling among City fans was made evident by the 5,000 or so empty seats at Wembley in the sky blue half but the supporters who did make the trip had reason to celebrate early.  Lewis scored with his teams first chance when he was teed up by Kovacic just outside the area, turned to face the goal and hit a low show inside the left post.  Forest hardly had a whiff at goal in the first half but had a chance to get right back in the game just after the restart. Halftime substitute Anthony Elanga almost scored with his first touch when Callum Hudson-Odoi picked him out with a low cross into the area, but the Swede put his effort wide.  Instead, City made it 2-0 minutes later.  A chaotic sequence where Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels made three saves in quick succession ended in a corner after City had a strong appeal for handball waved away. Any debate about whether it should have been a penalty ended when Gvardiol rose unchallenged to head home the corner from close range.  Morgan Gibbs-White then hit the woodwork twice, first blasting a volley against the crossbar and later hitting the post from a tight angle after he pounced on a poor back pass and rounded goalkeeper Stefan Ortega.  Taiwo Awoniyi also hit the post in the 79th and Ortega kept out Gibbs-Whites effort from the rebound as Forest just couldnt find a breakthrough.  Its devastating.  I hold my hand up and apologize. I should have scored at least one of them, Gibbs-White said about his chances. As soon as I hit the crossbar I had a feeling it wasnt our day. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/fa-cup-semfinals-man-city-nottingham-forest-975e627403f322736de1800b4947bbcf,sports
Arsenal stuns 8-time champ Lyon with 4-1 away win to reach Womens Champions League final,"Arsenal stunned Lyon with a 4-1 away win to reach the Womens Champions League final at the eight-time champions expense on Sunday. Lyon, previously unbeaten across all competitions this season, won the first leg of their semifinal 2-1 in London last week. But goals from Mariona Caldentey, Alessio Russo and Caitlin Foord  after an own-goal from Lyon goalkeeper Christiane Endler  gave Arsenal a 5-3 win on aggregate and set up a showdown with defending champion Barcelona in the final. Barcelona had earlier routed Chelsea 4-1  after also winning 4-1 in the first leg of their semifinal match  to book its place in the final at Lisbons 50,000-capacity Estdio Jos Alvalade on May 24. But the Catalan side wont relish playing an Arsenal team that seems to relish adversity, with the London team coming from behind in both the quarterfinals and semifinals after losing first legs against Real Madrid and now Lyon. The French team was hoping to avenge its final defeat to Barcelona last year as it tried reaching the final for a record 12th time. It never looked likely as Arsenal attacked from the start and only conceded late when Melchie Dumornay pulled one back in the 81st minute. Endler made a brilliant early save to deny Kim Little, but the visitors scored from the resulting corner when Chloe Kellys delivery was headed by Lyon defender Damaris Egurrola off Endlers back from where it rebounded in. 
        
     Caldentey struck a brilliant shot from distance inside the top right corner before halftime, and it got worse for Lyon after the break with Russo surging through Lyons falling defenders to make it 3-0 within a minute of the restart. Foord capitalized on another slip in the Lyon defense to seal the win in the 63rd. It meant Lyon conceded more goals in one game than it had in the entire Champions League all season. For Arsenal, the only English team to win the competition, it will be a first final appearance since beating Ume for the trophy in 2007.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/lyon-arsenal-womens-champions-league-28e6ef7ab616f4adcf953322d5e1f40f,sports

"Mehidy uses bat, arm to lead Bangladesh to easy win over Zimbabwe in second test","CHATTOGRAM, Bangladesh (AP)  Mehidy Hasan hit a century and claimed five wickets in a stellar all-around display as Bangladesh crushed Zimbabwe by an innings and 106 runs in the second and final cricket test on Wednesday. Mehidy became the third Bangladeshi player after Shakib Al Hasan and Sohag Gazi, and 39th overall in world cricket, to score a century and a five-for in the same match. He struck 104 for his second century as Bangladesh finished its first inning on 444 for a 217-run lead. Mehidy then took 5-32, his third five-wicket haul in two tests, as Zimbabwe were were limited to 111 in 46.2 overs in an extended last session on day three. Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam ended 3-42, after taking 6-60 in the first innings. The victory earned Bangladesh a series draw after losing the first test by three wickets. We lost the first test and had to win here, the boys were excited to come back and win here, Mehidy said. The credit goes to our bowlers, Taijul supported me, the pacers showed a lot of character and helped me add vital runs (towards the end). On an increasingly deteriorating pitch, Bangladeshs two spinners tormented Zimbabwe batters, turning the ball viciously right from the start. Opener Ben Curran was the only one to offer some resistance, scoring 46 before being the eighth batter out. Skipper Craig Ervine (25) and Wellington Masakadza (10) were the only others to reach double digits, while three Zimbabwe batters were out for a duck. 
        
     The hard part of cricket is to get a start, the Bangladeshi spinners were extremely good and they kept the pressure on us all along, Ervine said. We will take a lot of learning (from this series), well get across to England (for a one-off Test), nice to get exposed to different conditions and then back home against South Africa and New Zealand. Earlier, Mehidy led the lower order astutely after Bangladesh resumed on 191-7 and a 64-run lead. Taijul Islam and debutant Tanzim Hasan gave Mehidy support as the host gained a lead that appeared to be match-winning. Taijul scored 20 and added a 63-run partnership with Mehidy before Vincent Masekesa got the better of him. Mehidy then shared a 96-run partnership with Tanzim for the ninth wicket, taking the lead past 200. Wessley Madhevere broke them up by dismissing Tanzim, who made 41 off 80 balls. Tanzims dismissal left Mehidy in limbo for his century as No. 11 batter Hasan Mahmud doesnt have a reputation as a batter. However he raised second his century by clipping Madhevere past short fine leg for a single. A tired shot against Vincent Masekesas slower delivery then cost his wicket as Bangladeshs innings came to an end. Masekesa finished 5-115 on his debut. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket ___ Note: This story has been updated to correct spelling of Mehidy in headline.",https://apnews.com/article/cricket-bangladesh-zimbabwe-test-650df025ab0b8b6fe8d63f71cb2fd98f,sports
Darts player Andy Jenkins gets 11-year ban for fixing matches,"LONDON (AP)  Andy Jenkins, a darts player who once reached the world championship semifinals, was banned from the sport for 11 years on Wednesday for match-fixing. The 54-year-old Jenkins was found guilty by a disciplinary committee of the Darts Regulation Authority of 24 charges of fixing relating to 12 matches in which he was involved at the Modus Super Series, a lower-tier competition, from August 2022 to July 2023. The majority of the suspicious betting patterns reported to betting operators related to Jenkins not scoring a 180  the maximum for three darts thrown. He had denied those charges, as well as those regarding providing information on the matches, but had accepted one charge of betting on darts. The suspension was backdated to start Nov. 15, 2023 and Jenkins can resume playing on Nov. 15, 2034. He was ordered to pay costs of 17,580 pounds ($23,500). Jenkins has won 15 career titles, the BBC reported, and got to the semifinals of the PDC world championship in 2007, losing to Raymond van Barneveld. John Pierce, director of enforcement for the Gambling Commission, said the case sent a strong and unequivocal message to all sportspeople. If you fix matches, you are likely to be caught and face serious consequences, Pierce said. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/darts-andy-jenkins-ban-fixing-07861e90e1955ec7e272bc7814f3461d,sports
"What makes a Kentucky Derby champion? Big hearts, immense lungs and powerful legs","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  On a crisp, clear morning, a chestnut thoroughbred thundered down the dirt strip at Churchill Downs, his exercise rider leaning forward above the saddle. Other horse-and-rider pairs followed. Dr. Will Farmer looked down from a viewing point, admiring the speed and agility of the 1,000-pound animals. The whole world will have the chance to see horses in action here Saturday, when the Kentucky Derby shines a global spotlight on equine athleticism. Its the subject of a growing body of research that cites a constellation of characteristics: big hearts, immense lung capacity, robust musculoskeletal systems and long, thin legs  all of which helped horses survive in the wild. Kentucky Derby entrant Citizen Bull works out at Churchill Downs Monday, April 28, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Kentucky Derby entrant Citizen Bull works out at Churchill Downs Monday, April 28, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) It goes back to the roots: They are an animal of prey, said Farmer, a veterinarian and equine medical director at Churchill Downs Inc. Thats how they got away from being eaten. APs Lisa Dwyer reports on what makes horse races such as the Kentucky Derby such a success. Horses honed skills such as running, jumping and pulling as humans bred and trained them for various purposes over millennia. And the 151st Derby  horse racings most-watched event  will draw attention not only to the animals skills, but also to concerns about their treatment and health. Advocates have long raised concerns about deaths and injuries  calls that were amplified two years ago, when 12 horses died at Churchill Downs.  Theres no doubt that war, agriculture and societies have been transformed by the human-horse relationship.  Horses allowed us to circumvent our own biological limitations as a species, said Timothy Winegard, a historian at Colorado Mesa University and author of a recent book, The Horse. We combined our brains with the horses size, strength, stamina and speed to form the most unstoppable animal coalition. A race horse works out at Churchill Downs Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) A race horse works out at Churchill Downs Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) A horses heart and lungs are the source of its extraordinary power. The heart averages 10 to 12 pounds (4.5-5.4 kg), or about 1% of the animals body weight, compared with half a percent for the typical human heart. Secretariat, the storied horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973, was found after his death to have a heart weighing more than 20 pounds (9.1 kg). Horse hearts are built for exertion. The average horse can go from a resting heart rate of about 34 beats per minute to 220 or 240 while racing  faster than a human heart during maximum exertion. One thing thats really unique about horses is that they have an incredible capacity to move blood around their bodies -- their heart rate can go really high and still be safe, said University of Connecticut researcher Sarah Reed, editor in chief of the journal Animal Frontiers. They also have a lung capacity of 60 liters  10 times that of humans. That massive lung field allows for oxygen to transfer from the air into their blood, which is vitally important for sustaining aerobic energy, Farmer said. Recent research in the journal Science found that a genetic mutation enables horses to avoid negative side effects of super high energy production. Horses are great athletes because they can deliver a lot of oxygen to their muscles  way more than an elite human can and by elite human, I mean Olympic athlete, said Gianni Castiglione, the studys co-author. They have a bigger tank of gas and they have a more efficient engine  and this mutation is contributing to both of those things. A race horse works out at Churchill Downs Tuesday, April 29, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) A race horse works out at Churchill Downs Tuesday, April 29, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Other aspects of a horses biology enhance its abilities. Horses store extra red blood cells in their spleens. These cells are released to carry even more oxygen around the body during intense exertion. Adrenaline when exercising causes the spleen to release extra red blood cells into circulation, veterinarian Hilary Clayton said. What horses are doing is essentially blood doping themselves. Meanwhile, horses brains allow them to process sensory information and react quickly. Thats despite having frontal lobes, parts of the brain used for thought and planning that are proportionally smaller than those in humans. Brainwise, theyre designed with a real desire to play and run independent of any fear, said Dr. Scott Bailey, a veterinarian at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, a thoroughbred breeding farm where Secretariat is buried. Horses are also able to focus intently, which is really important for an athlete. Bone structure and musculature also help. The ligaments and tendons in their hind legs act like springs, Farmer said, helping propel them forward. Like other large prey animals, he added, they have long, thin legs that are meant to run.  The adaptations that make horses faster also predispose them to injury, Reed said. Their skinny legs absorb the impact of each stride, she said, and over time the repetitive stress of racing and training can lead to deformation of tendons and ligaments. In 2023, deaths occurred not only at Churchill Downs, but other major racing venues, affecting public perceptions of the sport and sparking changes. Reviews found no single cause for the deaths. But for 2024, Churchill Downs upgraded equipment used on its dirt surface and added an equine safety and integrity veterinarian.  In its annual report, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority noted the steps being taken to reduce injuries and fatalities  expanded veterinary protocols, pre-race inspections and uniform medication oversight. And, it said, the rate of deaths at authority-accredited tracks dropped in 2024, by 27%.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Experts say a healthy, safe environment brings out the best in a horse  but they still dont know what makes certain horses standouts at the race track. Thats the million-dollar question, Bailey said. Every thoroughbred owner is trying to match the genetics of the parents in order to make the horse with the greatest chance of winning. Breeding is only part of the equation, experts said; nurture, training and the horse-rider relationship also factor in. Each time a horse emerges seemingly out of nowhere to win the Kentucky Derby, Farmer is reminded of this. You dont have to be this star-studded bred horse that cost a million dollars at sale to come and win and be a great runner, he said, raising his voice slightly above the din of galloping hooves. There are a lot of great horses. ___ Larson reported from Washington, D.C.

Pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan to be commissioner of Real American Freestyle,"Hulk Hogan felt sure he was onto something. After watching the NCAA Division I wrestling championships, he was absolutely certain. Hogan is one of the most popular professional wrestlers of all time, and he stayed in that lane until his teenage stepson pulled him into watching freestyle and folkstyle wrestling. After becoming more familiar, Hogan started to believe those traditional wrestling styles could become more popular and profitable with the right promotion. Then, it happened. Last month, Oklahoma States Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Minnesotas Gable Steveson  an Olympic gold medalist in Tokyo  with a late takedown to claim the national title at heavyweight in collegiate  or folkstyle  wrestling. Hendrickson saluted President Donald Trump after his victory last month in Philadelphia. Then, with a United States flag draped over his shoulders, the Air Force second lieutenant walked over and shook Trumps hand and hugged him. Hendricksons dramatic win and the moments that followed vaulted wrestling into the mainstream and made the timing perfect for Hogan to help launch Real American Freestyle. Hell be commissioner of a league that announced its plans on Wednesday. Hogan wants the league to provide more earnings opportunities for a sport that historically has lacked them. And after Hendricksons big moment, he feels the time is now. When I saw that happen and I saw our President hug him, I went, OK, we are on point, were ready to go and instincts have prevailed and I smell victory, Hogan said. I think were right on track, brother. 
        
     Hogan, who at 71 still has those massive arms and the charisma to match, initially was a bit worried that the freestyle wrestlers might not have the personality to sell tickets. He changed his mind as he began to connect with them. Dude, theyve all got that edge, he said. These kids are young, theyre smart. Theyre watching TV. They know about branding, they know what sells. And theyve all got that little Conor McGregor swag. Real American Freestyle events will feature single matches at eight mens and four womens weight classes. The first event is scheduled for Aug. 30 in Cleveland, with other sites to be named in the coming months. Wrestling has been hot in the United States in recent years. The womens U.S. Olympic freestyle team earned four medals in six weight classes in 2024, while the men claimed three medals. Folkstyle wrestling, which covers most of high school and college wrestling, has been popular, too. According to the National Federation of High Schools, wrestling set participation records for boys and girls in 2023 and 2024. Hogan said Kennedy Blades, an American who earned a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will be the face of his companys womens division. Zahid Valencia and Ben Askren have agreed to participate on the mens side. Hogan said Hendrickson and Steveson are possible additions, and his eyes lit up when the subject of a possible rematch came up. How much can we say, Hogan asked his advisors. Its on the radar. Hogans Real American Beer serves as the title sponsor, and he has plenty of support. Chad Bronstein is the co-founder and president. Left Lane Capital, which has backed Gerard Piqus Kings League, Shaun Whites Snow League and League One Volleyball, among other things, has added this to its list of ventures. Cassius is another sponsor. Hogan knows some fans will be shocked that his next step does not involve pro wrestling, but hes confident in his decision. The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them, he said. People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother. Because of name, image and likeness deals, college athletes will be able to participate, though Hogan said the league wont interfere with college, national and international competitions. Hogan did bring in one connection from his pro wrestling days. Eric Bischoff, who ran World Championship Wrestling in its heyday in the late 1990s and created the famous New World Order storyline, will be the chief media officer. Eric jumped in with both feet, and hes doing a lot to guide this ship right now, brother, Hogan said. Hes setting so much stuff up production wise  just moving us forward, light years ahead of where we could have been on our own. Israel Martinez is the chief operating officer. He is an accomplished wrestling coach who has helped build champions in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He was the wrestling coach for Jon Jones and he coached Holly Holm when she upset Ronda Rousey. Hogan said Martinez played a key role in getting USA Wrestlings blessing. Hogan considers the new league an alternative to pro wrestling. I see this as an opportunity for me to get involved, Hogan said, to get back, quit sitting on the couch, to get involved with a bunch of powerful athletes that I can relate to as far as championship material, guys that are on top of their game, and I just  I couldnt pass on it. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/hulk-hogan-real-american-wrestling-dfc93fa47d52f0882f4d902c0d1a0c78,sports
Bangladesh to play 5 T20 matches in Pakistan next month,"ISLAMABAD (AP)  Pakistan will host Bangladesh for five T20 matches next month with Faisalabad set to stage its first international match after a 17-year hiatus, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on Wednesday. The first two games of the series will be played at Faisalabad on May 25 and 27 with Lahore hosting the remaining three games between May 31-June 3. Bangladesh was the last team to play an ODI at Faisalabad in 2008. Bangladesh was due to play three T20s and three ODIs in Pakistan. However, both cricket boards agreed to replace the ODIs with two additional T20s as part of preparations for the T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka in 2026. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-bangladesh-t20-cricket-9d552c39cd25de6315f513a476fc22e3,sports
Swiatek recovers from 0-6 start to beat Keys and set up Madrid semifinal vs. Gauff,"MADRID (AP)  Iga Swiatek survived one of the weirdest matches after losing the first six games and recovering to defeat Madison Keys 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 and stay on track to defend her title at the Madrid Open on Wednesday. The second-ranked Swiatek will face Coco Gauff in the semifinals after the 21-year-old American beat teenager Mirra Andreeva in straight sets in the youngest WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 2009. Swiatek was overpowered by Keys early in their quarterfinal but eventually found a way to rally past the fifth-ranked American on center court. It was one of the weirdest matches I played, Swiatek said. Maddie was playing just perfectly at the beginning and I wasnt really proactive with anything. I let Maddie do more mistakes by just putting the ball back and the momentum changed. Swiatek said of going down 0-6 at the start of the match: At least it was fast, thats the only positive think. It was the first meeting between the two since Swiatek squandered a match point in the semifinals of the Australian Open that was won by Keys. Swiatek is trying to reach her third straight Madrid final. She beat Aryna Sabalenka last year after losing to her in 2023. Top-ranked Sabalenka needed two tiebreakers to advance, beating Marta Kostyuk 7-6 (4), 7-6 (7).  Sabalenka will face 17th-seeded Elina Svitolina for a spot in the final. Svitolina beat Moyuka Uchijima 6-2, 6-1. 
        
     Gauff, ranked No. 4, who got past seventh-ranked Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-1. Andreeva turned 18 on Tuesday. Since the introduction of the WTA 1000 tier, only the 2009 Indian Wells quarterfinal between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Agnieszka Radwanska had a younger combined age, the WTA said. Gauff recovered after being down a break at 5-4 in the first set. She faced two set points. Off the ground I think I was dictating most of the rallies, so happy with that, Gauff said. Overall happy with everything. Both Gauff and Andreeva had been able to finish their matches in the previous round just before play was paused because of the major blackout that brought Spain and Portugal to a standstill on Monday. More than 20 matches had to be postponed at the Caja Magica tennis complex. Matteo Arnaldi backed up his victory over Novak Djokovic in the second round of the mens draw by defeating Frances Tiafoe 6-3, 7-5 to reach the quarterfinals of an ATP 1000 tournament for the second time. Arnaldi now has three consecutive wins against top 20 opponents for the first time in his career. The Italian will next face Jack Draper, who advanced by beating Tommy Paul 6-2, 6-2 in 68 minutes. The sixth-ranked Draper clinched his maiden ATP 1000 title in Indian Wells this year. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/swiatek-sabalenka-keys-paul-tiafoe-gauff-madrid-622f336762df324035d72c29b1be1486,sports
Reds place struggling Jeimer Candelario on 10-day injured list with a back problem,"CINCINNATI (AP)  The Cincinnati Reds placed corner infielder Jeimer Candelario on the 10-day injured list with a lower-back injury retroactive to Monday, the team announced Wednesday. The 31-year-old Candelario has struggled at the plate the first month of the season and has been out of the lineup since Monday. Candelario, batting .113 with two home runs and 10 RBIs, was diagnosed with a lumbar spine strain after a medical evaluation. The Reds recalled Tyler Callihan from Triple-A Louisville and added right-handed pitcher Chase Petty to the taxi squad. Petty was scheduled to start the second game of a doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals on Wednesday. Candelario signed a three-year, $45 million contract last year that included a $3 million signing bonus.

"A legacy of hope and laughter for Gaudreau brothers as family, friends and hockey community grieve","WESTVILLE, N.J. (AP)  The family called him John. It wasnt until John Gaudreau played for Boston College that he picked up the Johnny Hockey nickname that followed him through 11 seasons in the NHL. His mother, Jane, gleefully recalled the Johnny Hockey T-shirts and sing-song chants BC fans bestowed on their beloved wizard on the ice. At home in New Jersey, younger brother Matthew, who also played hockey for Boston College, and sisters Kristen and Katie couldnt help but tease their brother with the nickname as his popularity and All-Star career grew through stops in Calgary and Columbus. Take one night during the NHL Awards in Las Vegas, just one family story out of thousands of favorites, when Gaudreau tried to keep a low public profile on a family outing. Katie wasnt having it out on the Strip, shouting for all to hear, Johnny! Johnny Hockey! I can see Johns face getting redder and redder and redder, Jane Gaudreau said with a laugh. You walk down the street and no one knows who you are until Katie started making this whole big thing. Everything was fine for the family when they gathered last August for Katies wedding. John and Matt were the groomsmen and Kristen the maid of honor. What happened next, the typhoon of shock and grief that rippled from New Jersey through the heart of the hockey community, has been well-documented over the last eight months. The night before the wedding, John, 31, and Matt, 29, died after they were hit by a suspected drunken driver while riding bicycles in the Delaware River country south of Philadelphia, leaving a family forever shattered, with not enough time to ever fully pick up all the pieces. They try. 
        
     From births to hockey tributes, through Instagram pages dotted with photos from the family scrapbook and a new foundation, to a playground fundraising effort at the familys beloved school, the Gaudreaus have pushed through dark days when even getting out of bed seemed impossible. They pull through, pull together, just as they did as a family of six in South Jersey, and try to focus on a simple mantra: Live their lives to the fullest in honor of Matt and John. There is more hardship ahead and dark days are going to come and go. The driver charged with killing the brothers, a man prosecutors described as having a history of alleged road rage and aggressive driving, still faces trial. But as Jane Gaudreau details her dream of a new, adaptive playground for the special education students at the school where she works, its the good times that stir the most memories. Like when John playfully threatened to stab Katie with a fork at a restaurant for not finishing a stack of pancakes and surprisingly  and gently  followed through. Its the stories that lift the spirits of Jane, husband Guy and countless friends and teammates who went through their first hockey season in decades without two men who gave so much to their growing families and to the game. Its great to keep their memories alive, said their sister, Kristen Venello, who rocks her Blue Jackets hoodie as a speech assistant at Archbishop Damiano School. It is sad. But you think about all the good things they did and thats all you can think about. And how much they can help us still.  Archbishop Damiano School was founded in 1968 for children with Down syndrome and now provides services for 125 students with special needs from ages 3 to 21. Jane Gaudreaus brother attended the school and their mother worked there for 44 years. Jane was hired in 1984 and is still a finance associate there. Kristen, the oldest daughter, has taught at the school for almost two decades. Katie used to assist with the kids when she could and the two Gaudreau boys volunteered at the school when they werent playing hockey. In death, they can perhaps leave a permanent legacy at Damiano outside family and hockey. Kelsie Snow lost her husband, Chris, a former assistant general manager with the Calgary Flames, in 2023 to Lou Gehrigs disease. She called Jane with a suggestion on how to navigate life through perpetual grief: Keep busy. Find a project. Jane and Guy embraced the idea and searched for the right one, until they realized the answer was right there at Archbishop Damiano.  The Gaudreaus and the staff at Archbishop Damiano threw themselves into fundraising for a modern playground that allows for everything from basic wheelchair accessibility to ramps and transfer platforms for the students. Students tacked their wish list for the playground -- wheelchair swings and even a sand box -- to the walls inside the school. The Gaudreau Family 5K set for May 31 is expected to bring needed cash to the initiative launched by principal Michele McCloskey in October 2020. Raising the necessary funds over the last five years had been a slow build. So many friends from the hockey world and others now inspired by the brothers and the cause have since rallied around the effort. I know the boys would be proud of us, Jane said. Both boys loved children, thats why we thought the playground would be perfect. The Gaudreaus have another, more enduring project ahead of them as doting grandparents. Both widows have given birth since their husbands died. Meredith, who revealed during her tearful eulogy for John in August that she was pregnant, gave birth in April to the couples third child, Carter Michael Gaudreau. Madeline delivered her and Mattys first baby, Tripp Matthew Gaudreau, in December. Jane laughs when she describes how much the new additions resemble their fathers. Tripp has light hair like his dad; Carter looks like big sister Noa, and they both look like John. My husband keeps saying this, Jane said, I think God sent us John and Matty back. Guy Gaudreu, a former hockey coach at Hollydell Ice Arena and Gloucester Catholic High School in New Jersey, had his sons on the ice at 2 years old and hes already making plans for Carter and Tripp. Matthew played for the junior ice hockey Omaha Lancers for two years, and when the family was invited back last month for a tribute night, Guy amused the family as he gave baby Tripp an introduction. He was like, smell the ice, this is the locker room, Jane said with a laugh. Were used to that. Hes just crazy like that. I was looking at (Madeline) and she was just laughing, shaking her head. The Gaudreaus have kept busy, with fundraising, teaching and various outings that celebrated their sons. Guy has perhaps been at the rink the most since losing the boys. He joined practices for the Blue Jackets and spent time as a guest instructor this season with the Flyers. He hit the ice in Montreal and helped out Team USA at the 4 Nations Face-Off. The Gaudreaus led the Blue Jackets out of the tunnel at Ohio Stadium in front of nearly 95,000 fans at the NHL Stadium Series. I know sometimes well hear people, oh, this poor family, they have to go through this again, Jane said. But its been quite healing. Through this, Ive had so many people tell stories of what Matthew or John has done for them, or a hospital, or other people. They appreciate everything the boys did. They were grieving, too. It was a way for us to get out there and talk to people, hear different stories. Jane needed a gentle nudge from some Blue Jackets to attend the teams annual Moms Trip to a February game at Detroit. Defenseman Erik Gudbranson surprised Jane with a persuasive call for her attend the annual bonding trip. The other Blue Jackets moms were so supportive of her on the trip, she said, they knew if I was going to get upset before I even knew. We needed her there, Gudbranson said. It wouldnt have felt right if she wasnt there. Sean Monahan and Gaudreau became tight when the stars played together in Calgary, one reason the Blue Jackets center was persuaded by his friend to sign with the team last summer. Monahan and his family settled near the Gaudreaus in the same Columbus suburb of New Albany, so close as neighbors Monahan counted just 25 steps between the two houses. After Gaudreaus death, Monahan couldnt even drive by his friends house on his commute to the rink. He and his family have tried to serve as a steady source of support for Meredith and her three children. Monahan even met Carter Gaudreau the day he was born (good looking little guy, just like John). The Blue Jackets dedicated the season to the Gaudreaus and raised Johns No. 13 to the rafters. Theres a patch on the jerseys and the Blue Jackets wore Avalon Surf Shop sweatshirts as part of their Johnny fit collection. The team never failed to hang Gaudreaus jersey in a locker stall for every game, home or away. Hes supposed to be here with us, Monahan said. Its just one other thing we can do to keep his name around, keep his legacy going for such a special person. Motivated by the memory of their friend, the Blue Jackets were in the hunt for a playoff spot until the final week of the season. They fell two points shy, leaving the team with a what if? feeling over missing the playoffs while hurting over Gaudreau. Its something that weighs on my mind and its something I think about every day, Monahan said. There are no easy days, for sure. I try and live the way he did and it benefited me. Gudbranson also held Carter in the hospital and wrestled with the conflicting feelings of the joy over the birth with the sadness Gaudreau was not alive to meet his son. Theres a part of you that says this feels wrong that Im holding my buddys son and he hasnt met him, Gudbranson said. Thats hard to wrap your head around. Those kids will probably be 30 years old and Ill be thinking the same thing. I dont think thats going anywhere. Gudbranson said that in large part because of Gaudreaus influence, the season was a a lot more joyous this year. Weve enjoyed being teammates. When the good times were rolling, the Blue Jackets tried to appreciate those moments just like Gaudreau did, the franchise player who was just one of the boys once the final horn sounded. Once the game was done, we were just buddies, Gudbranson said. He wasnt necessarily Johnny Hockey to us. The personal side matters to us the most. But yeah, weve had conversations like, can you imagine if this guy was on our team this year? How good would he have been with us this year? Holy smokes.  Guy and Jane, married 42 years, almost never go out to dinner, overwhelmed by feelings of guilt over enjoying themselves, and those emotions also run deep with Katie. She told her mom, yes, she wanted to marry her fianc, Devin Joyce, but wasnt sure a big wedding was the way to go. Jane said she simply told her there was no wrong decision, but to let the rage and sadness settle and take as much time as necessary make a decision.  The couple eventually rescheduled their wedding for July 11. Katie wrote on her Instagram post, I guess this year has taught me to celebrate our love everyday, every minute. You know the boys, theyll be there with us that day, Jane said. They would want you to have fun. Jane added with resolve, This guy already took two of the most important things away from us. Dont let him take away your wedding. Katie reflected on that fateful night on an Instagram post how she had texted her fianc we forgot to practice our dip, during rehearsal to how a phone call later, our lives would forever change.  The couple will get a second chance at a wedding, this one in memory of their brothers. I think well all be able to get through the day, Jane said. I think it will be hard at first. We want to be there for her, support her. The other three had big weddings, it was so fun for our family to be together. I think it will be OK.  The Gaudreaus want people to remember how the young men lived, not how they died. Sometimes that is difficult: In mid-April, there was a hearing for Sean Higgins, the man charged with reckless vehicular homicide in the Gaudreaus deaths, only a few hours before the Blue Jackets played the Flyers nearby. The family skipped the game for the Gloucester Catholic High School Hall of Fame banquet where Matthew was posthumously inducted. The Gaudreaus have kept their thoughts about the court proceedings private, though Jane did write a pair of inspirational quotes on Instagram later that day, including one that said, When you have a bad day  a really bad day  try and treat the world better than it treated you. The 5K has filled its allotment of 1,000 runners for race day at a New Jersey park but anyone can contribute from home as a virtual participant. More than 700 people have already signed up, from New Jersey to Canada to Ireland, eager to help the cause, which includes an online memorabilia auction that stretches beyond hockey, with all proceeds donated toward the playground effort and its $600,000 goal. Jane, 62, said its hard to remember much through the haze of heartbreak from the funeral and memorial reception, only that she figured more than 1,000 people stopped by the family home to pay their respects. With some distance, the family hoped it would be comforting to see everyone at the 5K and thank them for their love and comfort. The current playground doesnt meet the needs of its students in its current shape, there are gaping holes in the turf and the swings and slides were not designed for children with disabilities. If the goal is met, the school hopes to break ground this fall and complete the project next spring. As a school for serving people with multiple disabilities, we really dont get a lot of traction, said McCloskey, the school principal. I think through all the media attention, I think people see it, they see why this is important. It seems trite to call it a silver lining but the family has searched in vain to find some meaning, some good out of the senseless deaths. So theyll run. For John. For Matt. For a cause the boys so robustly supported in life. Its not the way Id want to build the playground, of course, Jane said. I tend to believe theyll be up there, being able to listen to the childrens laughter. Theyll just really love the fact that the children will have a playground to play in. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-johnny-hockey-matthew-guudreau-b9d9d6316c55bf955cd4f78b6eebc5dc,sports

"Lacrosse hazing included high schoolers staging armed abduction, prosecutor says","SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP)  Members of a high school lacrosse program in upstate New York are accused of staging an armed abduction of younger players in a stunt that went way beyond hazing, prosecutors said this week. All 11 people believed to be involved in the events linked to the team at Westhill High School in suburban Syracuse have turned themselves in to face charges, the Onondaga District Attorneys office said Wednesday. They were given appearance tickets for a later date. District Attorney William Fitzpatrick had given the students until Thursday to come forward voluntarily and face only misdemeanor charges of unlawful imprisonment. He warned Tuesday that those who did not would be charged with more serious felony kidnapping. Fitzpatrick said the group was part of a ruse that involved inviting younger players to watch a game and then go to McDonalds. But one player was tied up, blindfolded and put into the trunk of a car.  I cannot adequately express to this community the level of stupidity and lack of judgment involved in this case, Fitzpatrick said. This goes way, way beyond hazing. Fitzpatrick said a person driving the younger players on the team pretended to get lost and pulled over in a remote area where other participants in the prank lay in wait in the woods, armed with at least one knife and a weapon that appeared to be a gun.  Thats when the students launched the fake abduction.  
        
     There were at least five alleged victims set up in the stunt, but some managed to get away, Fitzpatrick said.  The one who didnt escape had his hands tied and some sort of hood placed over his head. He was led to believe he would be abandoned, but was eventually returned home. While the student wasnt hurt physically, emotionally, thats going to be long term, Fitzpatrick said. This is not lighting a bag on fire on Halloween and sticking it in your driveway, this is criminal activity, he said, adding that it could have led to a fatal shooting if police had come across the scene and saw a kid with a hood over his head being abducted at gunpoint. The events were captured on video, and Fitzpatrick said the local sheriffs office identified the 11 people  some of 18 years old  whom they believe participated either directly or indirectly. Asked if all were members of the boys lacrosse team, Fitzpatrick said it appears that way, but I dont know that. He noted reports that the districts superintendent had canceled the rest of the varsity teams season. Messages seeking comment were left for Westhill School District Superintendent Steve Dunham.  In a statement provided to Syracuse.com earlier this week, he said: Our top priority is always the physical safety, mental health and well-being of our students and that any behavior that negatively affects any of these aspects for other students will be addressed promptly and appropriately according to our Code of Conduct.",https://apnews.com/article/westhill-high-lacrosse-hazing-charges-syracuse-6a854c07fc9d27a5c6d5908f06a04a8e,sports
"Astros pitcher AJ Blubaugh to make debut against Detroit, Abreu placed on paternity list","HOUSTON (AP)  Houston Astros pitching prospect AJ Blubaugh will make his major league debut against the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday afternoon. A seventh-round pick in 2022 out of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Blubaugh joins the Astros after posting a 4.29 ERA in five outings, four of them starts, this season with 28 strikeouts over 21 innings. He is the first pitcher from that school to reach the majors. This young man has worked really hard to get to this spot, so I told him just to enjoy this moment, stay present, compete, Astros manager Joe Espada said. Its hard not to think about the people and the building, hes got to take it all in, but go out there and compete and trust the process. The 24-year-old Blubaugh is taking the rotation spot of Hayden Wesneski, whose next start has been pushed back after he showed diminished velocity during his April 25 outing in Kansas City. Wesneskis next start could come during the Astros series in Milwaukee on May 5. He is 1-2 with a 3.86 ERA through five starts this season. To make room for Blubaugh on the 26-man roster, the Astros placed reliever Bryan Abreu on the paternity list. Espada said Abreu is expected to return for the teams game in Chicago on Friday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/astros-aj-blubaugh-5c9a09b2c007f282b271f5c5f53b0b2a,sports

Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. to make long-awaited return to the mound on Sunday,"HOUSTON (AP)  Lance McCullers Jr is to start Sunday for the Houston Astros against the Chicago White Sox in his first major league appearance since Game 3 of the 2022 World Series in Philadelphia. Im really excited to have him on the mound on Sunday, Astros manager Joe Espada said Wednesday. Hes worked his tail off to get back to this point, and this whole entire team and this city should be excited to get Lance back. An All-Star in 2018, McCullers had surgery on June 13, 2023, to repair his right flexor tendon and to remove a bone spur. The 31-year-old right-hander threw a bullpen session last June but had a setback and was shut down for the year. He has made four minor league rehab starts this year, allowing four runs and 10 hits over 12 2/3 innings with 16 strikeouts and six walks. In his last appearance, he struck out seven in five shutout innings for Double-A Corpus Christi on Saturday. My last two outings Ive felt really good, my stuff has been pretty crisp, McCullers said. He is 49-32 with a 3.48 ERA in seven seasons, all with Houston. McCullers first injured his flexor tendon while pitching on short rest during the 2021 AL Division Series. He missed the first four months of the 2022 season. Been waiting for it for a long time, McCullers said. Almost feel like Im making my debut in some aspects, but its been a really long road for me. McCullers has missed three full seasons since making his major league debut in 2015.

Bochum stays bottom of the Bundesliga despite draw as rivals all win,"BERLIN (AP)  Bochum remained bottom of the Bundesliga on Sunday after a 1-1 draw with Union Berlin that brought relegation a step closer as its rivals all won. Matus Bero canceled Benedict Hollerbachs first-half strike for Union when he equalized on the rebound after Frederik Rnnow saved his penalty. But it wasnt enough to lift Bochum off the bottom, after relegation rivals Holstein Kiel and Heidenheim both won their 31st-round games. With three rounds remaining, Bochum had 21 points, below Kiel on 22 and Heidenheim on 25. Hoffenheim was the closest team in safety on 30 points.  Bochum next plays Heidenheim in a decisive game for both on Friday. The bottom two face automatic relegation to the second division, while the team that finishes third from bottom plays the third-place finisher in the second division in a two-leg playoff to determine which club plays in the Bundesliga next season. Union had already secured its Bundesliga survival for another season. The only concern from the Kpenick-based teams point of view was Diego Leite. The Portuguese defender had to be stretchered off the field after lengthy on-field treatment for apparent breathing problems after he was struck in the larynx by a shot from Bero. Werder Bremens four-game winning run was ended with a 0-0 draw at home to St. Pauli in the late match. Bremen stayed eighth, while St. Pauli moved a point above Hoffenheim.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/bochum-union-pauli-bremen-bundesliga-26d48dd8da815219b7387fb02ad31ed7,sports

Wrexham is one step from the Premier League. How will it make the biggest leap yet?,"The next step is the biggest one yet for Wrexham.  The Premier League is in sight for the Welsh soccer team transformed by Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney after successive promotions from non-league to playing in the second tier of English soccer next season.  But making a further leap from the Championship to the top flight will be another challenge entirely. I think everybody knows the jump is huge, Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said. I think that a lot of tough decisions will be made this summer, in terms of who we bring in and how we add to this fantastic squad of lads weve got. But lets see if we can build a squad to compete at that level. From next season Wrexham will face the likes of Leicester - a Premier League champion in 2016, Champions League quarterfinalist in 2017 and FA Cup winner in 2021. Leicester is just one of a clutch of teams with recent top-flight experience and finances, such as Southampton and Ipswich, which were both relegated this season.  
        
     Wrexhams transfer business in the off-season will likely be key to its chances of competing at such a high level. Its rise in double-quick time has been partly achieved by convincing players to drop one or two divisions to help the club progress.  Iconic striker Paul Mullin moved down from the fourth tier to non-league and fellow forward Ollie Palmer dropped down two divisions.  If Wrexham follows this same model that has proved so successful, it will need to attract players from the Premier League, where the top earners can command in excess of $400,000 per week.  Its interesting because the jump in salaries is incredible, mind-blowing, Parkinson said. That is a challenge, but what weve always tried to do is make sure the culture in the club is right and I think thats key. No superstars, no egos in the dressing room and weve got to try and get that balance right again where you always need extra quality. Parkinson may say no superstars, but there will be some big names available as free agents at the end of the season.  The likes of Kevin De Bruyne at Manchester City and Jamie Vardy from Leicester.  So just how realistic a prospect would it be to see players of that stature wear the Wrexham jersey? Parkinson was not prepared to write off anything as he basked in the afterglow of promotion on Saturday. Weve always got our eye on players who are free transfers and are going to be available and will continue to do that, he said when asked directly about De Bruyne and Vardy.  No team has ever risen from non-league to the top flight in successive seasons.  Swansea climbed from the fourth tier to the top flight in five seasons from 1977-1982. More recently Luton climbed from non-league to the top division over a 10-year spell.  It would be uncharted territory if Wrexham were to do it in consecutive years, but Reynolds and McElhenney are still dreaming big four years after they bought a once down-on-its-luck club for $2.5 million in 2021. I remember the first press conference, we were asked what our goals were... and I think Rob jumped in with, The Premier League, Deadpool star Reynolds posted on Instagram on Sunday. People laughed. They had every right to. It seemed insane... but we werent kidding. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/wrexham-premier-league-transfers-next-step-78b78a4cc8843e175b414b5011b8903e,sports
Katherine Legge to be the 1st woman in 7 years to compete in NASCAR Cup Series race,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Katherine Legge will become the first woman in a NASCAR Cup Series race since Danica Patrick in 2018 when the veteran makes her debut Sunday at Phoenix Raceway.  Legge will drive the No. 78 Chevrolet for Live Fast Motorsports. She becomes the first woman since Patrick made her final Cup Series start in the Daytona 500 seven years ago. Legge, who is a 44-year-old native of England, has five career starts in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. She most recently raced in NASCAR at Road America in 2023. She ran the ARCA race last month at Daytona International Speedway. Legge has raced in multiple series over the years, including seven IndyCar Series starts last season. She has four career starts in the Indianapolis 500 and in 2023 set a record for fastest qualifying time by a woman. Legge will be sponsored at Phoenix by venture studio DROPLight and Sherfick Companies, a real estate and construction development business.  Entering the NASCAR Cup Series is a dream come true, said Legge. Racing stock cars has been an incredibly fun and new challenge thats given me a renewed sense of vigor for this sport. As always, Im grateful for the opportunity to do what I love and am inspired by all of the effort, preparation and behind the scenes work it takes to get here.  Legge is one of nine women to have raced in the Indy 500. She has four career victories in sports car racing and has participated in the Rolex 24 at Daytona.

Fox Sports draws big numbers for IndyCar season debut. Most watched non-Indy 500 since 2011,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Fox Sports debut IndyCar race drew 1.417 million viewers and was the most watched series event aside from the Indianapolis 500 on any network since 2011. The mark for Sundays opener on the downtown streets of St. Petersburg was a 45% increase over last years event, which drew 974,700 combined viewers on NBC. The Fox Sports viewership peaked with 1,820,000 viewers from 2:15-2:26 p.m. Local market ratings will not be available until later this week. IndyCar this season ended its 16-year relationship with NBC Sports for a multi-year deal with Fox Sports, which has promised high-quality production and promotion that began in January with glossy commercials featuring three of the series stars that aired during NFL playoffs and the Super Bowl. IndyCar has a close relationship with Fox Sports CEO Eric Shanks, an Indiana native with a passion for both the series and the Indianapolis 500. He has vowed to push IndyCar back to the top levels of motorsports. Despite the heavy promotion  which was also done during NASCARs Daytona 500 and other Fox Sports programming  Shanks acknowledged to The Associated Press there will still be people Googling on Sunday What network is todays IndyCar race on,  something he hopes to eliminate. All 17 races and both of the Indianapolis 500 qualifying sessions will be aired on Fox Sports this year, making IndyCar the only major motorsports series to air its entire schedule on network television. The opener on Sunday, which was a 1-2 finish for Chip Ganassi Racing with Alex Palou and Scott Dixon, was even more impressive in that NBC Sports uses the TAD (total audience delivery) metric that includes live streaming. FOX does not use TAD because it is not recognized by Nielsen Media Research data. 
        
     The race netted an audience increase of 425,300 viewers over NBC Sports and Fox Sports said it ranks as the most-watched IndyCar race on network television in 14 years not including the Indy 500. That race, in 2011 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway where Dan Wheldon was killed in a fatal accident, drew 2,448,000 viewers on ABC. Fox Sports also said Fridays airing of the opening practice on its Fox Sports 1 cable channel drew 95,000 viewers. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/indycar-fox-sports-st-pete-television-rating-7948d11f95118234587c08ec06e1026a,sports
Worlds oldest llama enjoys comforting chronically ill children in North Carolina,"A bucktoothed llama that spends his days comforting chronically ill children at a North Carolina camp founded by NASCAR royalty has been crowned the worlds oldest llama in captivity. At 27 years and more than 250 days, the selfie- and snuggle-loving llama called Whitetop dethroned Dalai Llama, the Guinness World Records announced last week. Dalai lived on a ranch in Albuquerque and was announced as the oldest in 2023 shortly after his 27th birthday. Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty  the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty  and his family founded the camp in honor of Pettys own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race. The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. Its designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities. Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camps barn director. He really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him, she said. He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is. 
        
     One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies. If you try to take a picture of him from the side, hes not into it, Davis said. He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that its like hes cheesing.  Davis attributes Whitetops long life to great veterinary care and exercise, as well as it simply loving his job. The average life span for a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.  Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone. Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camps family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.  When I started stroking him more and more and more, I got more relaxed, said Wilkerson, who lives in Thomasville, North Carolina.  With Whitetops newfound fame in longevity, the camp has started selling limited edition T-shirts displaying Whitetop with sunglasses and the words, Still Spitn. The proceeds go to the camp. Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.  Typically llamas only spit when they are scared, uncomfortable or territorial over something, she said. And he just loves his job so much that he doesnt do it.",https://apnews.com/article/oldest-llama-guiness-north-carolina-camp-children-1a2e9fd6a0802dd5368db9d761d0b91f,sports

"Polanco has 2 homers, 5 RBIs as Mariners beat Angels 5-3","SEATTLE (AP)  Jorge Polanco hit two home runs and drove in five runs as the Seattle Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels 5-3 on Tuesday night. The first blast from Polanco was a three-run shot in the second to give the Mariners a 3-0 lead. Polanco then had a two-run shot off reliever Jose Fermin  his ninth homer of the season  to make it 5-1 in the seventh. Polanco  the American Leagues reigning player of the week  was already on a tear, going 8 for 17 with two doubles, four home runs and eight RBIs in five games last week. It was enough for Seattle starter Bryce Miller, who gave up two hits in five scoreless innings and struck out six. Miller needed to be sharp, too, considering Angels starter Jack Kochanowicz was solid over six innings outside of yielding Polancos first homer. Logan OHoppe had a solo homer in the top of the seventh for the Angels, and they scored two in the eighth on run-scoring doubles by Nolan Schanuel and Jorge Soler.  Andrs Muoz got the last three outs for his 11th save to give the Mariners their 17th win of the season and fifth victory in six games.

Everything comes together in one big game for Jacob deGrom and the Texas Rangers offense,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  Everything came together in the same game for two-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom and the Texas Rangers batters.  Texas had a much-needed offensive breakout while deGrom struck out seven over six scoreless innings for his first win in more than two years, though he had pitched well enough to win in several other starts this season.  When was the last one, 23? Yeah, its been a while, deGrom said after the Rangers 15-2 win over the Athletics on Tuesday night.  He earned it. He had great stuff tonight, he kept us on our toes, second baseman Marcus Semien said. We were just talking about how the time of possession was. You know, we were hitting for a long time and hes getting quick outs. So usually thats a good recipe. The 36-year-old deGrom (1-1) had gone 737 days since also beating the As on April 23, 2023, then made only one more start in his debut season with Texas before Tommy John surgery.  He scattered four singles and didnt walk a batter in a 65-pitch outing (47 strikes). It was only that short since the right-hander didnt return after an eight-run outburst in the Rangers sixth that matched their previous season high for runs in an entire game and put them up 12-0.  So just how efficient was deGrom? The right-hander honestly thought he was probably in the 70s or something to 80, as did catcher Jonah Heim.  A lot a strikeouts that I feel like he just overpowered a lot of hitters, which is who he is. Hes got that electric fastball, Heim said.  
        
     My mechanics were pretty good, said deGrom, a meticulous worker who was feeling good after a side session the day before the game. Im constantly trying to perfect it and get in the best positions that I can get based on performance and health. Texas entered the night last in the majors with 91 runs scored, and only 12 combined the previous six games. DeGrom had gotten only nine runs of support in his first five starts.  The Rangers snapped a three-game losing streak while setting season highs for runs, hits (18) and walks (nine). They had three bases-clearing doubles in the same game for the first time in team history  Adolis Garca and Wyatt Langford each had one during a four-batter stretch in that big sixth, and Kyle Higashioka added his three-run double in the eighth.  Their offensive outburst came after the full squad was required to be on the field for batting practice before the game. Good to see you guys break out and have a good game. ... Some success, its contagious, manager Bruce Bochy said. Youre hoping this is something these guys can build on, build some confidence. For deGrom, he improved to 3-1 with a 2.55 ERA in his 15 starts for the Rangers since signing a $185 million, five-year contract in December 2022. He is 85-58 in 224 career starts, the first 209 with the New York Mets from 2014-2022.  He was really good tonight. You know, I said when season started, its just going to get better with him as he builds up his strength and stamina, Bochy said. Really good command tonight, really good stuff. And its just getting better with him. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-degrom-athletics-8889dadb6fc1a1bca9952baff6ac1a7f,sports

"Teoscar Hernandez, Andy Pages lead 18-hit attack as Dodgers beat Marlins 15-2","LOS ANGELES (AP)  Teoscar Hernndez had two RBI doubles and two RBI singles to take over the major league lead with 31 RBIs, Andy Pages homered among his three hits, and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Miami Marlins 15-2 on Tuesday night. The Dodgers finished with 18 hits while winning their fourth straight game.  Los Angeles turned a 3-1 game into a blowout with three runs in the third, a rally Mookie Betts capped with a two-run single, and four in the sixth on two-run doubles by Will Smith and Tommy Edman. Dodgers right-hander Matt Sauer, recalled from triple-A earlier Tuesday, gave up one run and five hits, in five innings in relief. He struck out four and walked none to earn his first big-league win and give a bullpen that leads the major leagues with 133 innings a much-needed breather. Marlins right-hander Sandy Alcantara, making his sixth start in his return from Tommy John surgery, was rocked for seven runs and seven hits in 2 2/3 innings. He walked five and struck out two to fall to 2-3 with an 8.31 ERA. Shohei Ohtani sent Alcantaras first pitch of the game over the right-field wall for his seventh homer this season and 14th leadoff homer of his career. Alcantara struck out Ohtani for the second out of the third inning and was one strike away from escaping a second-and-third, two-out jam when Betts lofted a two-run single to left-center to push a 5-1 Dodgers lead to 7-1.

Sizzling-hot Jorge Polanco is propelling the resurgent Mariners offense,"SEATTLE (AP)  Had the weather been a bit more cooperative and the winds a tad friendlier, Jorge Polancos excellent evening would have turned into arguably the greatest game of his major league career. Instead of his first three-home run game, Polanco had to settle for just a couple in the Mariners 5-3 win against the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday night.  It was the second time in three games Polanco hit a pair of home runs in a contest, and he came within feet of making it a trio if not for Angels center fielder Jo Adell robbing him of another. I thought it was a homer, too, Polanco said. But, it is what it is. Adells robbery aside, Polanco has been the catalyst for a surprising Mariners offense. Just a few months ago, such a reality seemed improbable. Polanco underwent surgery in October to repair the left patellar tendon. Then in November, the Mariners declined his $12 million option for the 2025 season, only to bring him back for the discounted rate of $7 million. All Polanco has proven to be is one of the best bargains in baseball through the early stages of the season. Following Tuesday nights contest, Polanco leads all MLB hitters with a minimum of 70 plate appearances with a 260 weighted runs created plus. Polanco is also the American Leagues reigning player of the week after going 8 for 17 with two doubles, four home runs and eight RBIs in five games. Polanco is in the greatest groove of his big league career. 
        
     Its been a really good stretch, really fun. I think this is the best Ive felt, Polanco said. I feel really good right now with the approach and everything. Polancos sizzling start isnt likely to be sustainable considering he has an 1.242 OPS to complement a .389 batting average. But, he is just the most prominent example from a Mariners lineup that even with star Julio Rodrguez scuffling is more than holding its own. Catcher Cal Raleigh is tied for the MLB lead in home runs with 10. The Mariners are pacing the majors in walks and stolen bases. Not bad for a club expected to be carried by its starting pitching. There have been other solid individual performers, too, such as utilityman Dylan Moore  who was placed on the 10-day injured list on Tuesday  and shortstop J.P. Crawford. Theres no debate, though, about who has been leading the charge for the Mariners. Its Polanco by a wide margin. Just the consistency I think is the thing thats amazing to me, manager Dan Wilson said of Polanco. Balls going out of the ballpark are great, but hes just finding a barrel almost all the time. Just tells you a lot, that his timing is really good, as well as fastballs on the barrel. Hes just in a place where hes seeing the ball really well. And in the process, the Mariners find themselves in the midst a surge. With their fifth win in six games, the Mariners now have a 17-12 record while sitting atop the American League West. The Mariners will only increase their division lead should Polanco  who credited his success in part to some mechanical adjustments he made to his swing after being acquired from the Twins last January  keep turning in these kinds of performances. Its a big ask, no doubt. But Polanco isnt letting all the success impact his process, nor does he intend to alter it. I think the approach to stay in the middle just helps you let the ball get a little bit deeper, Polanco said. Im reacting with the pitches. Just kind of take that approach. Im trying to go to the middle. ___ AP MLB: https://www.apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/mariners-polanco-home-runs-48fb99e67ce98e69783bfd5addcf1ed7,sports
Shohei Ohtanis first home run since the birth of his daughter jump-starts Dodgers 15-2 win,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Shohei Ohtanis Dad Strength is finally beginning to kick in as the Los Angeles Dodgers slugger hit his first home run since the birth of his daughter to jump-start a 15-2 victory over the Miami Marlins on Tuesday night. It was a good home run to get back on the board for this game, Ohtani said through an interpreter. I havent hit one since being a father, so its a really nice one to be able to do that. Whether its myth or statistically proven fact, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts is a firm believer in Dad Strength, the theory that some players gain physical strength and stamina upon entering fatherhood. MLB.coms research department even found that among the more than 200 instances of hitters returning to action from the paternity list from 2011-2024, 28 hit a home run in their first game back. Now that hes a father, Roberts said last week, we might see some 120-mph exit velocities off the bat. Ohtani, the 2024 National League most valuable player, hit .125 (2 for 16) with no RBIs and six strikeouts in his first four games back from paternity leave. But in his last four games, Ohtani is batting .467 (7 for 15) with one homer, three doubles, a triple and two RBIs, and the home run he hit Tuesday night on Sandy Alcantaras first pitch of the game left his bat at 114 mph and traveled 394 feet. That was a big tone-setter, Roberts said of Ohtanis 14th career leadoff homer. I think we feed off of Shohei, certainly at the top of the order. For him to make it a 1-1 game after the first pitch their starter throws certainly gets some life into our offense, and we just took it from there. When hes going, you can see our offense sort of follows suit. 
        
     Ohtanis homer sparked a three-run first-inning rally, and the Dodgers went on to rack up 18 hits, including four by Teoscar Hernndez, who drove in four runs to become the major league leader with 31 RBIs, and three, including a home run, by Andy Pages. The game was such a blowout, the Dodgers scoring three in the third, four in the sixth and three in the eighth, that both teams finished with position players on the mound  outfielder Javier Sanoja for the Marlins and utility man Kik Hernndez for the Dodgers. Ohtani, meanwhile, is still trying to adjust to fatherhood since the birth of his daughter on April 19, especially the disruption of his sleep schedule. Ohtani likes to get at least 10 hours of sleep a night and take lengthy naps before games. A little change in the routine in terms of, for example today I went to the hospital and came straight to the field, Ohtani said, later telling Japanese writers that it is customary for some Japanese women to spend a week or two in the hospital after giving birth. Just being here at home is nice to be able to spend time, but on the road, its going to be a little bit of a challenge since I wont be here.  But Im just grateful for the safe delivery. Im glad that even though I couldnt sleep as much as I wanted to, its a good kind of not-getting-enough-sleep situation. ___ AP MLB: https://www.apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-fc74723e698b152fe3db501251a2013c,sports

Mets have a field day with 3 straight defensive gems against Arizona,"NEW YORK (AP)  Pete Alonso and the major league-leading New York Mets were at their finest in the field Tuesday night. Never known for slick defense, Alonso made a trio of sprawling stops at first base and the Mets put on a dazzling display with their gloves during an 8-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. At the center of it all was a breathtaking fourth inning, when New York turned in three consecutive gems behind starting pitcher David Peterson to set down the Diamondbacks 1-2-3. That inning was  Ive never seen something like that. And Ive heard multiple guys say that, Peterson said. The defense was spectacular. Said manager Carlos Mendoza: Pretty unbelievable. That inning right there is what you call a big league defensive inning. Randal Grichuk led off with a hot shot wide of third base. Mark Vientos dove to his left and the ball glanced off his mitt right to shortstop Francisco Lindor, who grabbed the deflection in the hole and fired to first for a snazzy 5-6-3 putout. Peterson watched it unfold and let out a little laugh on the mound. I was trying to decide whether or not that just kind of happened or somehow those two cooked that up over there, he said. It was an unbelievable play. And still, the best was yet to come. Cleanup hitter Lourdes Gurriel Jr. then launched a long drive to left-center that looked like a sure double. But speedy center fielder Tyrone Taylor ran it down and made a fully extended diving catch at the edge of the warning track, bringing the Citi Field crowd to its feet chanting Lets go Mets! 
        
     Peterson and catcher Francisco Alvarez both raised their arms, and a grateful Peterson tipped his cap in Taylors direction. Superman catch, Alonso said. Those two plays back-to-back like that, I mean, unbelievable sequence of events right there. I dont think you find two better plays. Taylor sprinted 86 feet at an average speed of 29.4 feet per second to make a play with a 45% catch probability, according to Statcast. About halfway to it, I thought I had a chance, he said. As he tossed the ball back in, cameras caught a smiling Taylor mouthing wow. I shocked myself a little bit, he explained after the game, before wishing his mom a happy birthday. Eugenio Surez then smoked a sharp one-hopper to shortstop, where Lindor went to a knee and smoothly corraled a difficult in-between hop on his backhand before throwing to first to end the inning. It was three circus plays. But when you see it three times, its something they expect to do, Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. And thats who they are, thats why theyre a good team and in first place in their division. But when were watching that happen, I think it should inspire our guys. Its very inspiring to see that type of baseball. With the entire ballpark buzzing, fans gave the Mets a standing ovation as they trotted off the field still up 7-0.  Its pretty special. Youve got the lead and you feel like youre putting pressure on them and they come back and try to put something together  and we were ready today, Mendoza said.  Guys first steps on every pitch, and then you get the reaction from the fans, you know? Its kind of like a standing ovation when someone comes up to the plate, or when someone hits a homer. You dont see that too often, and it happened back-to-back-to-back plays. So yeah, its really good to see that. Before the night was over, Peterson gave Taylor three hugs.  I love it, man. Its just part of the game, you know? Taylor said. Were all out there playing for each other, so its awesome. Taylor said he was just going all out to make the catch and acknowledged he would probably watch the replay a few times Tuesday night.  When that ball went up, Im looking at Taylor, where he started, I was like, `No way hes going to get there. And before you know it, hes diving for it and makes a ridiculous play, Mendoza said. And then another guy hits a bullet and Lindor makes it look like a routine play. I thought Pete had a really good day defensively, too. Couple of nice diving plays, so overall I thought we played really well. Lindor and Alonso also homered in the game. Taylor had an RBI double and a run-scoring single. Backed by his flashy teammates in the field, Peterson (2-1) allowed one run and five hits over five innings to earn the win. I feel like anybody on our defense can make any kind of play like that. It was crazy to have three of em in an inning, and I just wanted to get off the field and give those guys hugs because that was unbelievable, he said. It gives you a ton of confidence, Peterson added. I think when you string plays like that together, its great momentum for the team. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-defense-taylor-lindor-alonso-733907dde8288feaaff16cbedbff7441,sports
"PWHL announces Seattle for 2nd expansion franchise, plans to add 2 more by 2026-27, AP source says","The PWHL is expanding to eight teams next season by adding Seattle as its second new franchise alongside Vancouver, and The Associated Press has learned that plans already are in the works to add two more in a years time. Seattles addition, announced Wednesday, gives the PWHL a strong foothold in the Pacific Northwest and comes a week after the unveiling of the new team in Vancouver for the 2025-26 season. The westward move broadens the leagues reach across North America, pairs two markets separated by a three-hour drive and captures Seattles history of supporting womens sports. Seattle will now be home to three womens pro sports leagues, with the PWHL team joining the WNBAs Storm and NWSLs Reign. And it was fitting for Storm star Skylar Diggins to open the news conference and formally welcome womens hockey. This city takes incredible pride in its womens sports teams. We show up for one another. We support each other and we help build this community together, Diggins said. I know Seattle fans will embrace you guys with the same passion and pride as theyve done for us. So welcome to the family, PWHL. Lets get it. Amy Scheer, the PWHLs executive vice president of business operations, referred to Seattle as the capital of womens sports, and recognized the numerous female owners and executives of the Storm, Reign and NHLs Kraken in attendance. Were here because of you, and youve made this possible for us, so thank you for paving the way, Scheer said. 
        
     As for pairing Seattle and Vancouver, Scheer told the AP earlier that the geography made a ton of sense, and the league hoped the two would establish a natural rivalry. But most importantly is they met all the criteria in terms of what we were looking for, she added. The two-team expansion for Season 3 is only the beginning for a league that launched in January 2024 with five Eastern franchises  Boston, New York, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto  and one in St. Paul, Minnesota. The PWHL plans to grow to 10 teams for its 2026-27 season, a person with knowledge of discussions told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks were to remain private. The person said the league is accelerating its plans based on the strength of responses and feedback received during its eight-month expansion search in which the PWHL considered more than 20 markets. Scheer didnt entirely dispute the plan, without providing an exact timetable. I think weve been pretty clear from the outset that this is the first year of a multiyear process, Scheer said as the PWHL closes the final week of the regular season. It could come in Year 4. It could come Year 5. I think that those conversations are still being had. Neutral-site stops this season in Denver, Detroit, Quebec City and Edmonton each topped 14,000 fans. The new team initially will go by PWHL Seattle and its colors will be emerald green and cream. The team will play in the Krakens Climate Pledge Arena and practice at the Kraken Community Iceplex. Though all PWHL teams are centrally controlled by the league, Seattles expansion bid was led by the Kraken and the Oak View Group, which developed and operates Climate Pledge Arena. Oak View has longtime ties to womens hockey and expressed interest in landing an original six franchise when the league was established in June 2023 by Los Angeles Dodgers owner Mark Walter, his wife, Kimbra, and tennis icon Billie Jean King. Seattle features a growing youth hockey program and previously showed support for womens hockey. In November 2022, Seattle drew a U.S.-Canada Rivalry Series record crowd of 14,551. In January, the PWHL drew a crowd of 12,608 in Seattle when kicking off its nine-game Takeover Tour of neutral-site games. Seattle is an incredible sports city and weve seen firsthand the passion for the womens game, Kraken owner Samantha Holloway said. Were also proud to grow the game of hockey ... and together well continue to inspire the next generation of hockey players and fans alike. Jayna Hefford, the PWHLs executive vice president of hockey operations, noted womens hockey in the region dates to 1921, when the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons competed in whats believed to be womens hockeys first international tournament. A new chapter of this Pacific Northwest rivalry begins now, Hefford said. Were not just honoring that history. We are reigniting it. The PWHL plans to announce later the date of an expansion draft and how Vancouver and Seattle will be integrated into its entry draft on June 24. The league also has yet to determine if it will expand its playoff field from four and whether to adopt a divisional format of four teams each. The PWHLs accelerated expansion plans coincide with a deep pool of college talent anticipated to enter the league over the next two years. The leagues growth also is expected to lure more Europeans to North America. Upon launch, youve got six teams and maybe if youre not North American, you dont know really what to expect, Hefford said. Now I think these players are seeing that this league is here, its thriving, its growing, and they are going to want to be a part of it. Scheer was impressed by the response when overseeing the expansion search.  I feel more encouraged than ever about what our business looks like and what our business can be, she said. As we look to expand and move beyond Year 3, well have plenty of suitors along the way as we look to grow. ___ AP Sports Writer Andrew Destin in Seattle contributed to this report.  ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/womens-hockey-pwhl-expansion-seattle-6e93a32a6c8419385a0a5342f0836b61,sports
Sinner considered taking a break from tennis before he accepted 3-month ban in doping case,"ROME (AP)  Jannik Sinner considered taking an extended break from tennis earlier this year before he accepted a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency. Asked during an interview with Italian state TV RAI if he ever thought about dropping everything, the top-ranked Sinner replied, Yes. I remember before the Australian Open this year, it wasnt a very happy time, Sinner added. I didnt really feel comfortable in the locker room, where we were eating. Players were looking at me differently. I said to myself, Maybe I need to take some time off after Australia. I didnt want (the ban) though. Sinner won his second straight Australian Open title in January. It wasnt until February that the settlement was made in the doping case, after WADA appealed a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency to fully exonerate Sinner for what it deemed to be an accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid in March, 2024. I had a tough time accepting these three months. Because I knew that I didnt do anything wrong. So why do I have to pay this price? Sinner said. But then we discussed it with my lawyer and about what could have happened in the worst-case scenario and so we decided to accept it. The handling of Sinners case had raised questions about double standards. The positive tests werent publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September. 
        
     The settlement also raised questions, since it conveniently allows Sinner to return next week at the Italian Open  his home tournament  and not miss any Grand Slams. The last year was definitely very stressful, Sinner said in the interview, which was broadcast late Tuesday. But we were still able to obtain incredible results. We started this year really well, too. Then what happened happened. At the start it was a bit strange to find myself in that situation. Also, a lot of things happened off the court that I didnt expect. Several top players suggested that Sinner was treated too lightly. I dont even want to respond. Everyone is free to say what they want. For me, the important thing is that I know what happened, Sinner said. I dont wish it upon anyone who is innocent to go through what I went through. Despite having played just one tournament this year, Sinner held on to his top ranking during his ban because No. 2 Alexander Zverev and No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz didnt win enough when he was out to overtake him. I miss the competition, Sinner said. Im very happy that this period is done and Im ready to play again. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/jannik-sinner-doping-eac417e27c3e50882baf9d753527cbfd,sports
McTominays brace lifts Napoli atop Serie A after Roma beats Inter,"ROME (AP)  There are still streamers and banners hanging over the citys streets and piazzas celebrating Napolis Serie A title two seasons ago. Now there might be another championship to celebrate. Scott McTominay scored two first-half goals and Napoli beat Torino 2-0 on Sunday to move three points clear of Inter Milan with four rounds remaining in the Italian league. Inter lost 1-0 at home to Roma earlier for its third consecutive defeat. Despite losing Victor Osimhen in September and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in January, Napoli is in position to claim its second title in three seasons. Thats a shorter span than the two championships in four seasons with Diego Maradona in 1987 and 1990. McTominay has scored five goals in three matches. Obviously were now leading the race. But for us its keep calm, keep everything relaxed and go game by game, because this games not important unless we win the next one and the next one after that, McTominay said. So for us its calm and see where that gets us. The Scotland international put Napoli ahead seven minutes in at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona after redirecting a pass from Andre-Frank Anguissa. Then he doubled the advantage shortly before halftime with a similar goal, redirecting a cross amid four defenders. With 11 league goals, McTominay set the record for a Scottish player in Serie A, overtaking Denis Law, who had 10 with Torino in 1961-62. 
        
     Philip Billing nearly made it 3-0 for Napoli when his header hit the crossbar in the second half. Napoli hadnt had sole possession of the lead since February. Marcus Thuram has missed three matches and Inter has lost all three without scoring a single goal. Romas attacking midfielder Matias Soul scored midway through the first half in Milan by redirecting a deflection as the Giallorossi produced one chance after another. For Inter, the defeat followed a 1-0 loss at Bologna in the league a week ago and a 3-0 midweek loss to AC Milan in an Italian Cup semifinal derby. These are three tough defeats and were not used to that, Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said. Thuram, who has been out with a left thigh issue, could return for the first leg of the Champions League semifinals at Barcelona on Wednesday. The France forward has scored 14 goals and provided seven assists across all competitions for Inter this season. Without Thuram, Lautaro Martinez has appeared fatigued attempting to carry Inters attack. And Marko Arnautovic, Thurams replacement, has been ineffective. Roma is sixth, level on points with fifth-placed Bologna, and two points behind fourth-placed Juventus, which beat Monza 2-0. Romas unbeaten run reached 18 matches, stretching back to December. It was the final game at the San Siro for Giallorossi coach Claudio Ranieri, who plans to retire at the end of the season. Ive already handed in my coaching license, Ranieri said with a smile. Third-placed Atalanta was held 1-1 by relegation-threatened Lecce in a match that was postponed from Friday due to the death of Lecces physical therapist. Jesper Karlsson put Lecce ahead in the first half with a penalty and Mateo Retegui equalized in the second half with a penalty for his league-leading 24th goal. Retegui matched the Atalanta record established by Filippo Inzaghi, who also scored 24 goals in 1996-97. Christian Pulisic scored for the first time in more than a month and AC Milan won 2-0 at relegation-threatened Venezia . It was another solid performance for the Rossoneri after the Cup win over Inter. Still, Milan remained in ninth place. Pulisics 10th league goal of the season came five minutes in when Venezia gifted the ball to Milan and Youssouf Fofana set up the United States international in the middle of the area. Pulisics previous goal came in a 2-1 win over Como on March 15. Milan produced several more chances but couldnt quite find the target until Santiago Gimenez lobbed over the goalkeeper to finish off a counterattack in second-half stoppage time. Nico Gonzalez and Randal Kolo Muani scored first-half goals for Juventus against last-placed Monza. Juventus played the entire second half with 10 men after Kenan Yildiz was sent off for elbowing an opponent in the face. Yildiz will likely receive a two-match ban for the offense against Monza midfielder Alessandro Bianco, which could rule him out of key upcoming matches against Bologna and Lazio. Como beat Genoa 1-0 for its fourth straight win and secured a second consecutive season in the top flight for the first time since the 1980s. Como coach Cesc Fabregas got the best of Genoa counterpart Patrick Vieira, who he replaced in Arsenals lineup two decades ago. Gabriel Strefezza scored near the hour mark for Como by finishing off a counterattack. Also, Fiorentina beat Empoli 2-1 in a Tuscan derby with goals from Yacine Adli and Rolando Mandragora. The Viola face Real Betis in the first leg of the Conference League semifinals on Thursday. Several of Sundays matches were postponed from Saturday due to the funeral of Pope Francis. All of the games were preceded by a moment of silence to mourn Francis, who died last Monday at 88. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/inter-roma-napoli-torino-serie-a-3996b330df173f7b7a2af30f250e7fa4,sports
German federation defends yellow card that rules Harry Kane out of potential Bundesliga clincher,"BERLIN (AP)  The German soccer federation has defended the yellow card that rules Harry Kane out of Bayern Munichs likely Bundesliga title-clinching game at Leipzig next weekend. The Bayern star was booked in the first half of Bayerns 3-0 win over Mainz on Saturday for holding onto the ball after he was penalized for a foul. It was his fifth yellow card of the season, triggering an automatic suspension for the next game. Kane reportedly criticized a crazy, crazy decision by referee Bastian Dankert in the mixed zone after the match. But Marco Fritz, who evaluates referees performances for the federation, said Sunday the booking was technically correct. The yellow card is 100% covered by the rules, Fritz told broadcaster Sport1. A referee has to assess the match of that day, he added, saying it shouldnt matter if its the players fifth or 10th yellow card of the season. A win in Leipzig would clinch the title for Bayern. The Bavarian powerhouse leads defending champion Bayer Leverkusen by eight points with three rounds remaining. The 31-year-old Kane, who is yet to celebrate a major title after a career of runner-up medals and individual awards, looks set to win his first while watching from the stands. However, if Bayern fails to win in Leipzig and Leverkusen wins at Freiburg the next day, Kane will get another chance to contribute directly when Bayern hosts Borussia Mnchengladbach in the penultimate round. The England forward has a league-leading 24 goals so far this season. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/harry-kane-suspension-yellow-card-bayern-d46935dc09d0754e007014931118bf75,sports
Defending champ Barcelona routs Chelsea 4-1 to reach womens Champions League final,"Defending champion Barcelona reached the womens Champions League final in dominant fashion on Sunday after winning 4-1 at Chelsea in their semifinal return leg to advance 8-2 on aggregate. Slick Barcelona stayed on course for a third straight Champions League title and fourth overall, and will meet either record eight-time winner Lyon or Arsenal in the final.  They played their semifinal return leg in France later Sunday, with Lyon 2-1 up from the first leg. Lyon and Barcelona have met in the final in three of the past six seasons. The final takes place on May 24 at Lisbons 50,000-capacity Estdio Jos Alvalade. Barcelona took its goal tally in this seasons competition to a whopping 44 and also recorded a ninth straight win. Chelsea was overwhelmed 4-1 in the first leg and fell behind midway through the first half when Aitana Bonmat scored a brilliant solo goal. She picked up the ball inside her own half and broke down the right at pace before rifling a shot into the top right corner from just inside the penalty area. Moments earlier, Chelsea midfielder Sjoeke Nsken shot straight at goalkeeper Cata Coll from close range. Barcelona went 2-0 up in the 41st minute when Caroline Graham Hansen found space down the right and picked out Poland captain Ewa Pajor with a fine cross. Two minutes later, Cludia Pina curled in a superb third from the left of the penalty area into the top right corner. 
        
     Tired defending allowed Salma Paralluelo to poke in the fourth goal in the last minute following a ball over the top. Dutch midfielder Wieke Kaptein rifled in a stoppage-time consolation goal for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Barcas success came the day after the mens team beat bitter rival Real Madrid to win the Copa del Rey. The womens side is led by the flair and drive of two-time Ballon dOr winners Alexia Putellas and Bonmat. They have shared the last four awards and both scored in last years final against Lyon in front of a record crowd of 51,000. Chelsea reached the final once, in 2021, but was routed 4-0 that day as Barca won its first title.  This time it was another one-sided affair as coach Sonia Bompastors side fell well short. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/chelsea-barcelona-women-champions-league-132c5607c8a4885eeb38b545863d163f,sports
Party time at Anfield as Liverpool wins Premier League for record-equaling 20th top-flight title,"LIVERPOOL, England (AP)  A selfie with Mohamed Salah. An impromptu sing-along with Arne Slot. Fireworks and flares.  It was party time at Anfield as Liverpool sealed the Premier League title in style.  The 5-1 rout of Tottenham was almost a side issue as a record-equaling 20th English league championship was confirmed Sunday  matching the achievement of Liverpools great rival Manchester United.  Everyone was sitting on the bus saying there is no way we are going to lose the game, said Slot, standing in the middle of the field after being dowsed in champagne by his players.  Fans had turned up long before kickoff, lining the streets around the stadium in anticipation of a title celebration. And despite going behind to an early goal from Dominic Solanke, Liverpool didnt let them down  racing to a 3-1 lead by halftime to effectively ensure there would be no further delay to a title victory that has looked likely for much of the season. You see so many fans already outside in red early on and you just want to get the job done, captain Virgil van Dijk said, adding it was incredible to be part of. 
        
     
        
     The smell of sulfur filled the air early in the day as red smoke canisters were let off outside the famous stadium that has been home to so many championship-winning Liverpool teams. Flags were hung from nearby houses. Inside the ground, giant banners floated across the stands, celebrating icons past and present. Slot has joined that list of club greats in only his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp. He also joins a select group of managers by winning the title in his first year in the Premier League  following Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte. He has managed it with plenty to spare, with Liverpool 15 points ahead of second-placed Arsenal with four rounds of the season to go. Its a big job and the manager did it in his own way together with his staff, Van Dijk said. He definitely deserves a lot of credit for that. Slot is also the first Dutch coach to win the Premier League, which is some feat considering serial trophy winners like Louis van Gaal, Guus Hiddink and Erik ten Hag have all managed in English soccers top flight.  Its always special to win something. Its even more special if youre the first one, and even more special at a club where its not common that you win the league every year, said Slot, who paid tribute to his predecessor by singing Klopps name to fans after the final whistle. Klopp had led Liverpool to a full set of trophies in more than eight years in charge, including the Champions League and that long-awaited Premier League. Few could have expected Slot to have such an instant impact in his first year in a new country  halting Manchester Citys dominance of English soccer at the first attempt.  Slot thanked Liverpools owners for their faith in hiring him from Dutch team Feyenoord last year. For them to trust me to be in this position, maybe now everybody says That makes complete sense, he said. But the moment they signed me, maybe not everyone was as convinced as everyone is now. So, that tells you also what a special club this is that they dont always go for the maybe the most simple or obvious choice  they make the choice that they think is best for the club. City manager Pep Guardiola was quick to congratulate Slot on a well deserved victory. This was Liverpools second title in five years, having ended a 30-year wait to be champion in 2020. But this time there was a crucial difference as the triumph was shared with supporters.  Five years ago Liverpool had to finish off the season behind closed doors as the U.K. faced lockdown restrictions because of the COVID pandemic. Now there was a packed stadium to erupt at the final whistle and watch as the players danced and embraced on field.  This is way better, 100%, Salah said. It feels more special with the fans. You have a different group now, a different manager. To show you are able to do it again is something special. Throughout the match a packed Anfield crowd had been in rapturous voice, singing the clubs anthem Youll Never Walk Alone in the final moments. It was reprised later as Slot and his players stood facing the famed Kop stand to be serenaded by fans.  Having spent 206 days at the top of the standings, Liverpool only needed one more point to be confirmed champion.  For a brief moment Solankes 12th-minute header had threatened to spoil the party, but the home team powered back with strikes from Luis Diaz, Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gapko before halftime. Salah added another after the break and Destiny Udogies own-goal rounded off the rout.  In the end, the victory was so comfortable that Salah even had time to pose for a selfie in front of the crowd after scoring his 33rd goal of the season in all competitions.  Rasmus Hojlund scored in added time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Manchester United at Bournemouth in the other Premier League game on Sunday. United was on course to lose for a 16th time in the league this season after Antoine Semenyos first-half strike. But a late flurry of pressure paid off for United after Bournemouth went down to 10 men and Hojlund converted from close range for his ninth goal of the season. The point moved United up to 14th in the standings. Semenyo fired a low shot from inside the box to beat United goalkeeper Andre Onana in the 23rd minute. Bournemouth had chances to extend its lead with Dango Ouattara hitting the post with a free kick after the break. But when Evanilson was sent off for a lunge on Noussair Mazraoui following a VAR review in the 70th, United began to increase the pressure. The visitors still had to wait until the sixth minute of added time for Hojlund to divert Manuel Ugartes effort past Kepa Arrizabalaga.  Manchester City reached the FA Cup final for the third year in a row by beating Nottingham Forest 2-0 at Wembley Stadium to maintain a chance of ending a dismal season with a trophy.  City scored early in each half of the semifinal as Rico Lewis put his team ahead in just the second minute and defender Josko Gvardiol doubled the lead in the 51st with a header from a corner.  City will play Crystal Palace in the final on May 17.  ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/liverpool-premier-league-title-man-united-3c0e9f1bdb8241a0440b4e01e01eee49,sports
Bell makes late charge for lead and holds off Byron at COTA for 2nd straight NASCAR victory,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Christopher Bell is making the most of his late-race chances to seize victories. Bell passed Kyle Busch with five laps to go, then held off Daytona 500 winner William Byron to win NASCARs first road course race of the season Sunday at the Circuit of the Americas. The late-race drama produced his second consecutive victory after his overtime win in Atlanta a week earlier. Once Bell cleared Busch, the Oklahoma driver had to make a desperate bid to keep his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota in front of the hard-charging Byron in his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet, and the Toyota of 2023 race winner Tyler Reddick of 23X1 Racing.  Bell raced to his 11th career victory and is a multiple race winner for the fourth consecutive season. Busch, who led 43 of 95 laps in his Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet, faded to fifth as his winless streak stretched to 60 races dating to 2023. These road courses races are just so much fun, Bell said. (Busch) was doing such a good job running his race. He bobbled and allowed me to get out front. When he did, I just said, Dont beat yourself. The furious nip-and-tuck finish could have ended in a crash that ruined someones race and jumbled the field with a late caution flag. Busch and Bell have a heated history of collisions in Austin, notably last year when Busch confronted the younger driver over contact in a race where Bell finished second. This time, everyone kept it clean all the way to the end. 
        
     Amazing to have such respectful clean, hard racing. It was a beautiful way to end a race, Bell said.  That didnt mean Byron wasnt pushing him hard. And Byron had his own battle with Reddick, who was looking for an opening to attack the front. I couldnt never get beside (Bell). Weve always raced well together, I didnt want to move him blatantly, Byron said. Even Busch complimented Bells driving. Ill give Christopher credit, Busch said. He ran me really hard. Bells crew chief, Adam Stevens, said the consecutive wins on a superspeedway oval and a road course show the team can fight for wins every week, starting with the next two races in Phoenix and Las Vegas. We dont think theres a track that we go to that we dont have a a chance to win, Stevens said. We have everything we need to win every single weekend.  Hendrick Motorsports Chase Elliott, started third and quickly dropped to the back when he spun by Trackhouse Racings Ross Chastain in the first turn, but fought his way back through the field to fourth.  Connor Zilisch had a wild day in his Cup Series debut for Trackhouse. The 18-year-old started 14th and dropped back with contact in the first lap. He recovered to get back within in the top 15 by the start of the third stage. Thats when his day ended. Zilisch couldnt avoid a spin by teammate Daniel Suarez in lap 50, smashed into the wall, and had to scramble out of his car when it caught fire. Elliott leads active drivers with seven road course victories, but hasnt snared one since 2021 when he won twice He also has never won a road course or street race with a Next Gen car. Elliott made up 17 positions in the final stage but was still upset about possible race win snuffed out by the bump from Chastain. It was the first lap of the dang race, Elliott said. Who knows. I would have loved to have been in the mix. Easy to say when youve had a bad day. NASCAR has to decide if it will return to Austin in 2026. The track has proven popular over the years with drivers, and has hosted F1 since 2012 and MotoGP since 2013. Speedway Motorsports rents the facility for race week, and track President Bobby Epstein has said hed like to continue the partnership.  Well take a look at ticket renewals, feedback from the fans who attended the race and the overall results before we talk with NASCAR about next years schedule, said Mike Burch, chief operating officer for Speedway Motorsports. One of the biggest factors will be how the drivers compete on the new National Course, a move we made to put more action and laps in front of the fans.

Zilisch made Cup Series debut with impressive and fiery weekend at COTA,"Connor Zilisch had a fiery NASCAR Cup Series debut. Literally. The 18-year-olds impressive weekend at the Circuit of the Americas ended early when he couldnt avoid a spin by Trackhouse Racing teammate Daniel Suarez early in the final stage Sunday. The collision sent Zilisch hard into the tire barrier and the car caught fire as he climbed out. It was a frustrating end to an otherwise impressive race for a youngster who hopes to become the youngest winner in Cup Series history. He started 14th, dropped back after early contact with another car, and had worked his way back to the top 15 before the wipeout. You did amazing buddy, crew chief Darian Grubb told Zilisch on the team radio. You did nothing wrong today. You did an incredible job driving way up through there. The crash spoiled his race, but Zilisch wasnt about to let it spoil the overall experience of his race weekend. Zilisch won the Xfinity race Saturday and was among the Cup Series practice leaders. His race craft is really good for his age, Trackhouses Shane van Gisbergen said before the race. Had Zilisch stayed in Sundays race, he might have had a chance to push for the win. We had a really fast Red Bull Chevrolet, Zilisch said. I had so much fun preparing for this event. It was a lot of fun passing a lot of guys I used to watch on TV growing up. Zilisch has been pegged as a future star. He has won 16 races across seven different series since 2024, including a class victory at Rolex 24 at Daytona last year. 
        
     His Xfinity series win Saturday was his second in that series. He started on pole and was forced to the back because of a pit lane penalty. Then he dominated the field in getting back to the front for the win.  Zilisch is a development driver for Trackhouse. The team has not announced when he will race in the Cup Series again. Hopefully, Ill get another chance to do this again, Zilisch said. I had an absolute blast driving through the field.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-austin-zilisch-debut-6413da830704a8649594dbb5992babe1,sports
Joe Gibbs senses Cup championship chemistry brewing in Bell and team after 2nd consecutive victory,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Joe Gibbs knows quite a lot about what it takes to win a championship. As an NFL coach, he won three Super Bowls. As a NASCAR team owner, his drivers have won five Cup Series titles. And he certainly likes what he sees in Christopher Bells consecutive victories, first in Atlanta, and then in Austin on Sunday. In both races, Bell hung around late and made the right moves to snatch victory. From the race shop to the garage to the cockpit, Gibbs senses a championship chemistry brewing. I think in football every now and then you have a team that really had a great feeling about themselves, were really confident, and a great chemistry, the 84-year-old Gibbs said after Bells latest victory. It doesnt happen very often, and it doesnt carry over from one year to the other. But when you kind of get that, I think its a great feeling when you see it as a coach or an owner. I think thats what we have with the 20 team, Gibbs said. Bell has shown he can win in a variety of ways on very different tracks. Bell won in Atlanta when he snatched the win in overtime on the oval superspeedway. On the road course at the Circuit of the Americas, he led just eight of 95 laps but won a four-car duel over the final 13. He first chased down Kyle Busch for the lead, then held off Daytona 500 winner William Byron and Tyler Reddick for the victory. And it took clean racing to get everyone to the finish line. Bell and Busch had a confrontation after last years race in Austin, but the pair avoided the kind of bumper banging that would have started another one. 
        
     The Austin victory was Bells 11th career win and his third on a road course. He now has four consecutive seasons with multiple victories. He is also the first driver since Kevin Harvick in 2018 to win two of the first three races of the season. The last two weeks at Atlanta and here, I kind of won without the fastest car, so its really nice to get those back that I lost last year, Bell said. Im excited about whats to come. We have high expectations and high hopes and goals for this year. The series next heads to Phoenix, where Bell is the defending champion, and then Las Vegas. Crew chief Adam Stevens has already put down a marker on both races. Theres no reason we cant go win the next two weeks, Stevens said. (Austin) has no bearing on next week whatsoever, and everybody is going to bring their best stuff and do their best job. But I really have so much faith in this team and Joe Gibbs Racing as a whole, and especially my driver, that I know well be a factor. And thats the confidence Gibbs has seen and heard in championship teams in the past, from the gridiron to pit lane. Adam, a great leader I think. Hes got a young guy there (Bell) thats gaining confidence, and I think the whole team ... I do think its hard to put everything together in Cup, Gibbs said. But I do think, like Adam said, we have it all together. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-joe-gibbs-christopher-bell-5e809e7266c733dceb7c34bc0b577f19,sports

Austin Wells hit New Yorks final home run  all six came with nobody on  with two outs in the ninth. Gunnar Henderson hit a solo shot for Baltimore. Rodn took a perfect game into the sixth before Emmanuel Rivera led off with a walk. Jorge Mateo followed with a double.

Mets hit 3 homers off E-Rod and play dazzling defense in 8-3 win over Diamondbacks,"NEW YORK (AP)  Francisco Lindor and Starling Marte each hit an early two-run homer, and the New York Mets put on a dazzling display of sparkling defense Tuesday night in their 8-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Pete Alonso also went deep off an ineffective Eduardo Rodriguez (1-3) as the Mets improved to 21-9, the top record in the majors. They are 13-1 at Citi Field, the best home start in franchise history. Handed a 7-0 cushion after the third, David Peterson (2-1) yielded one run over five innings to help deal the Diamondbacks their fifth loss in six games. He was boosted by highlight-worthy fielding plays from Tyrone Taylor in center field, Lindor at shortstop and Alonso at first base. Taylor had an RBI double in a four-run second and an RBI single in a three-run third. Luisangel Acua singled twice, stole a base and scored two runs. Mets outfielder Juan Soto was shaken up after landing hard on his right shoulder while trying for a diving catch of Jorge Barrosas run-scoring double in the fifth. The $765 million slugger was checked quickly by an athletic trainer and finished the game. Rodriguez was tagged for eight runs and nine hits in four innings, the most runs hed allowed since giving up nine in 2 2/3 innings with Boston against Tampa Bay on June 27, 2016. The left-hander served up three homers after not permitting any in his previous five road starts. 
        
     Arizona newcomer Corbin Burnes (0-1, 4.05 ERA) starts the middle game of the series Wednesday night, seeking his first win since signing a $210 million contract as a coveted free agent.

"Wilyer Abreu hits 3-run homer as Red Sox go deep 5 times, beat struggling Blue Jays 10-2","TORONTO (AP)  Wilyer Abreu hit a three-run homer, one of five longballs for the Boston Red Sox in a 10-2 win over the struggling Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night. Alex Bregman, Rafael Devers, Jarren Duran and Kristian Campbell all had solo homers as the Red Sox won their third straight. Boston homered three times in Sundays 13-3 win at Cleveland. The Red Sox lead the majors with 142 runs scored in April. Garrett Crochet (3-2) struck out six in seven innings to win for the first time in three starts.

"Seiya Suzuki falls a single short of the cycle, Cubs go deep four times in 9-0 rout of Pirates","PITTSBURGH (AP)  Seiya Suzuki hit a two-run homer and fell a single short of the cycle as the Chicago Cubs went deep four times in a 9-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night. Shota Imanaga (3-1) gave up six hits with three strikeouts in five scoreless innings before leaving with leg cramps after a leadoff double from Andrew McCutchen in the sixth. Imanaga said he felt fine after the game and expects to make his next start. Suzuki followed an RBI single from Kyle Tucker with his seventh homer of the season, pushing the lead to 7-0 in the seventh inning. His double with two outs in the fourth was the first hit off Pirates starter Andrew Heaney (2-2). He led off the ninth with a triple and scored on a single from Carson Kelly. Kelly followed Suzukis double in the fourth with a 418-foot drive into the left-field bleachers and Pete Crow-Armstrong doubled the lead in the fifth on another two-run homer. Dansby Swanson added a solo shot in the eighth. Heaney extended his career-long scoreless streak to 20 innings before Kellys homer. He allowed four runs on five hits in 4 2/3 innings. Oneil Cruz walked to load the bases for Pittsburgh with two outs in the fifth but Imanaga struck out Bryan Reynolds on three pitches. Cruz made a leaping backhand grab in center for the second out in the fourth to rob Tucker and keep Heaney perfect. That ended when Suzuki doubled and Kelly homered.

Natalie Spooners shootout winner lifts Sceptres to 2-1 victory over Sirens,"TORONTO (AP)  Natalie Spooner scored the shootout winner to help the Toronto Sceptres snap a two-game skid with a 2-1 victory over the New York Sirens on Tuesday night. Daryl Watts scored in regulation for Toronto, which now sits three points ahead of the Boston Fleet for second place in the PWHL with one regular-season game remaining. Carly Jackson made 25 saves in her first start in the PWHL in two seasons as the Sceptres backup. Toronto entered Tuesdays game having already clinched a playoff berth thanks to the Sirens 2-0 win over the Minnesota Frost on Sunday. Ella Shelton scored in regulation for New York, which had its three-game winning streak halted. Kayle Osborne stopped 34 shots. The Sirens were eliminated from playoff contention on Saturday due to the Ottawa Charges 3-2 win over Montreal. With that, New York also locked up the first overall pick in the upcoming draft. Sceptres: Sarah Nurse and Watts both missed prime scoring chances in overtime, which was a sore spot for Toronto. The Sceptres missed several scoring opportunities, including on the power play, late in regulation and were unable to avoid extra time. Sirens: New York showed it can play with second-place Toronto, with Osborne playing a big factor in the Sirens defensive effort. New Yorks penalty kill was also a strong point on the night. Spooner beat Osborne for a second time in the shootout to seal Torontos win after also scoring on her first attempt. 
        
     The Sirens just missed on a chance to better a record they set on Sunday. New York became the first team in PWHL history to record consecutive shutout victories in the regular season, backstopped by Corinne Schroeder in both games. The Sceptres host the Ottawa Charge on Saturday in the regular-season finale, while the Sirens close the year hosting the league-leading Montreal Victoire. ___ AP Womens Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey",https://apnews.com/article/sceptres-sirens-score-e4ec156ca526b8a5391857b3d61a4512,sports

Lorenzen (3-3) halted the Rays five-game winning streak, his only blemish a solo homer to Junior Caminero in the fourth. After the homer, Lorenzen retired nine of his final 11 before three Kansas City relievers combined to shut out the Rays over the final three innings. Carlos Estvez earned his eighth save.

Jake Burger and Leody Taveras had back-to-back RBI singles with two outs in the third to make it 3-0 and chase the As starter.  Adolis Garca and Wyatt Langford both had bases-clearing doubles in an eight-run sixth to make it 12-0, and deGrom didnt return after 65 pitches (47 strikes).  The right-hander, who gave up only four singles without a walk, had gotten only nine runs of support his first five starts this season. He made three shortened starts in his return from surgery at the end of last season.

Kyle Manzardos homer in the 9th inning propels Guardians to 2-1 victory over Twins,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Kyle Manzardo homered to right field to lead off the ninth inning as the Cleveland Guardians snapped a three-game losing streak with a 2-1 win over the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night. Manzardo connected on a changeup down the middle by Louis Varland (1-2) for his eighth homer of the season and the first walk-off hit of his career. It was the second walk-off win for the Guardians this season. They won their home opener on April 8 over the Chicago White Sox 1-0 on a bases-loaded walk. Emmanuel Clase (4-0) got the win after pitching a scoreless ninth inning. Bo Naylor also went deep for the Guardians. Ty France had three hits for Minnesota, which had its four-game winning streak snapped. Naylor, who came in 2 for 20 in his last six games, drove a fastball by Twins starter Chris Paddack into the right-field stands on the ninth pitch of the at-bat to give Cleveland a 1-0 lead in the third inning. France evened it in the fifth with a solo shot to right-center off Cleveland starter Tanner Bibee. France has an RBI in four straight games. France lined a base hit to center off Clase with one out in the ninth inning. DaShawn Keirsay Jr. came on as a pinch runner, but was caught stealing at second to clear the bases. The game started after a 3-hour, 10-minute weather delay due to the threat of thunderstorms in the area.

Les Kiss set to take over as Wallabies coach from Joe Schmidt in 2026,"SYDNEY (AP)  Les Kiss will take over as Wallabies head coach from Joe Schmidt next year as Australia finetunes for the 2027 Rugby World Cup it is hosting. Rugby Australia announced the appointment Wednesday, saying it provides an orderly transfer from Schmidt to Kiss between the British and Irish Lions tour this year and the next World Cup. Schmidt and Kiss have worked together before, including a successful stint with Ireland that included three Six Nations titles. Schmidt had initially planned to leave  the role in October but now says hes looking forward to extending his tenure with the Wallabies. Kiss will continue as head coach of the Brisbane-based Queensland Reds in Super Rugby until mid-2026 before starting a two-year contract with Australia. My intention to finish at the end of this years Rugby Championship has been adjusted to fit with Less availability, Schmidt said. I think hes doing a great job with the Reds, so it was important to dovetail with his responsibilities there. Kiss was a rugby league international before moving into rugby union coaching, a career that has spanned more than 20 years and included senior roles in Australia, Ireland, England and South Africa. At an international level, Kiss has served as an assistant coach with the Springboks and was part of a successful period with Ireland which included a Grand Slam in 2009, other Six Nations titles in 2014 and 2015 and Rugby World Cup quarterfinals in 2011 and 2015. 
        
     Joe and I have a strong relationship and a long history of working together, and I am looking forward to building upon the excellent foundations he has laid with the Wallabies, Kiss said in a statement. To coach our national team through such an important period, highlighted by a home Rugby World Cup in 2027, is the honor of a lifetime. ___ AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby",https://apnews.com/article/wallabies-coach-les-kiss-072c3d334cec88f15b5a89dfe5d8485a,sports
Players to watch in the Atlantic Coast Conference next season,"A look at football players in the Atlantic Coast Conference this spring who are poised to have breakout seasons this fall:  OL Dwayne Allick should see a bigger role in the second season under coach Bill OBrien. Allick, at 6-foot-2, 309 pounds, started three games last season, but is expected to compete for a starting job, likely at right guard, in his sixth season with the program.  QB Devin Brown transferred from Ohio State and was thrown in the mix to see time behind center at spring practice. Brown played in mop up duty the past two years with the Buckeyes, throwing for 331 yards and three touchdowns.  WR Tristan Smith was a portal find for coach Dabo Swinney for a deep and talented wideout room for the defending ACC champions. Smith had five catches for 137 yards in the Tigers spring game. He had 76 catches for 934 yards and six TDs last year at Southeast Missouri State.  QB Darian Mensah arrives from Tulane as the projected starter for Year 2 of Manny Diazs tenure. He led the Green Wave to the American Athletic Conference championship game last season by throwing for 2,723 yards with 22 touchdowns and six interceptions.  WR Duce Robinson joins the Seminoles after two seasons at Southern Cal. Robinson, at 6-6, should be a tall target for new transfer passer Thomas Castellanos as Florida State plans on rebounding from a 2-10 season.  DB Kelvin Hill started all 12 games at cornerback for UAB last season and has kept making plays since joining the Yellow Jackets. He led all defensive players with six tackles in the programs spring scrimmage and has gotten praise throughout the workouts from coach Brent Key.  
        
     QB Miller Moss is expected to start for the Cardinals after coming over from Southern Cal. Moss started 10 games in three seasons with the Trojans. He played well in Louisvilles spring contest, throwing for 208 yards and a TD.  WR Malachi Toney had a strong spring and caught a 22-yard touchdown in the teams final scrimmage. The four-star freshman could make an intriguing target for expected QB Carson Beck, the Georgia transfer who sat out the spring as he rehabbed an injury.  QB Gio Lopez has gotten the keys from new coach Bill Belichick to run the offense next season. Lopez started 11 games as a sophomore at South Alabama last season, passing for 2,559 yards and 18 touchdowns.  DB Jaren Sensabaugh transferred as a redshirt freshman after seeing six snaps in one game at Missouri last season. The son of former NFL defensive back Gerald Sensabaugh joins a unit working under new defensive coordinator D.J. Eliot.  RB JaKyrian Turner was a versatile performer on offense all spring and capped it by rushing for 44 yards and catching three passes in the closing scrimmage. Turner should give QB Eli Holstein a strong option on offense this fall.  TE Matthew Hibner is going through his first spring with the Mustangs and the Michigan transfer hopes to build on his steady progression last year when he had 24 catches for 368 yards and four touchdowns.  QB Elijah Brown will try and take the troubled Cardinal forward after a turbulent spring. Brown was a four-star passer who played in three games last season, throwing for 274 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions. He will get every chance under new coach Frank Reich to lead a turnaround.  WR-DB Demetress Samuel Jr., at just 17, has been a highlight of the Oranges spring and could be their version of Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter. Samuel worked on both sides of the ball throughout practice and played both ways in the spring game.  DE Billy Koudelka was a freshman walk-on who came on late last year and appears to be a reason for optimism that the Cavaliers will have an improved pass rush. Kouldelka forced a fumble and had a sack last season against SMU and was credited with four sacks in Virginias spring game.  CB Dante Lovett is a rising junior who started two games a year ago and should see much more playing time this season. He picked off a juggled pass and took it 38 yards for a touchdown in the Hokies spring game.  RB Demond Claiborne was one of eight 1,000-yard rushers in the ACC last year, finishing with 1,049 yards and 11 touchdowns. He is positioned to hold a central role in the first year of coach Jake Dickerts tenure.  ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/acc-spring-football-players-0fbcdf7799c6124c6642410eed0d4293,sports

"Madrid Open players took blackout in stride, enjoyed time away from cellphones","MADRID (AP)  Many of the tennis players who endured the power outage that brought Spain and Portugal to a standstill and disrupted the Madrid Open tournament on Monday said they actually enjoyed some of their time off the grid. A total of 22 matches had to be postponed because of the several-hours-long blackout that affected most of Spain and Portugal. Play resumed Tuesday with a packed scheduled and players talking about how they coped without power and cellphone connection. It was fine, 10th-ranked Daniil Medvedev said. I tried a couple of times in my life to use my phone less, but you cant because you have to do a bank transfer, you have your coach calling you, your wife, your kids. You are going to lose the connection. When I am not with my wife, she calls me so I can talk to the kids. The power went off at about noon and was only restored late at night in most parts of Madrid. Players and fans were told to leave the Caja Magica tennis complex after organizers postponed all remaining matches for the day. Its not really possible, but once you dont have the opportunity (to use your phone), I loved it, Medvedev said. We had a great sandwich dinner, because there was no hot food ... We were just enjoying and in the end, it was perfect timing. Around 10:30 p.m. the power was on, a small time on the phone, and then go to bed. It was perfect. World No. 6 Jack Draper said he was actually enjoying the time to focus on what is important. 
        
     Im a bit of a minimalist, he said. Everyone was panicking, but it was so nice to actually have no phone and none of the other (stuff) going on in the world, and just try and focus on what is important. I ended up reading 10 pages of a book. Usually I dont read at all, so it was interesting. Womens second-ranked Iga Swiatek said she just chilled and used that time to not think about what I should do. There was no signal, so basically no one used their phones, she said. It was nice, I liked it. Swiatek said tournament organizers handled the situation adequately, helping players in a difficult situation. Honestly, who would have predicted that, you know? Im sure no one, she said. World No. 4 Taylor Fritz jokingly offered some advice to solve the problem. Have they tried unplugging and plugging it back in? the American player said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Dont mind this off the grid thing, Australian player Alex de Minaur, No. 7 in the world, wrote on X, along with a series of emojis. On the 3rd walk (of) the day and finally got some service to check on the rest of the world. His fiance, world No. 40 Katie Boulter, quickly responded: Imagine blaming a country blackout for not texting me back all day. Elite behavior, she wrote, also along with emojis. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/madrid-open-blackout-power-outage-36b75ba6005d6d6fa1b6c24eead9603a,sports

"Maradona allowed to order hamburgers in days after surgery, ICU director testifies","BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  Diego Maradona was allowed to order unhealthy food including hamburgers during recovery from surgery, the director of the clinics intensive care unit testified Tuesday at the the trial of seven health professionals charged with negligence in the soccer stars death. Fernando Villarejo, who worked at the Olivos Clinic on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, told the court he felt like a pawn between the king and the queen, referring to neurosurgeon Leopoldo Luque and psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov, as they determined Maradonas post-surgery care in November 2020. Anything was allowed inside the room, Villarejo testified. It was embarrassing what happened there. I take responsibility. Maradona had surgery for a hematoma that formed between his skull and brain and stayed in intensive care at the Olivos Clinic between Nov. 4-11. Luque and Cosachov proposed that Maradonas care continue in a private home in the town of Tigre, almost 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the capital. Maradona, who led Argentina to the World Cup title in 1986, died on Nov. 25, 2020 while in home care. He was 60. Villarejo said that Maradona underwent surgery without any preoperative examinations and that a few days after the surgery, Luque ordered him to sedate Maradona to try to detoxify him from his drinking habits and because he was an unmanageable patient. 
        
     I didnt agree  it wasnt the right place. I told Luque all this, said the director of the clinics intensive care unit, who said that he recorded all of it in the medical records. He added that Maradonas family agreed to the sedation out of ignorance or because they trusted (his fathers people). Villarejo said that he agreed with the cardiologist who testified last week that the former national team captain should have recovered in a rehabilitation clinic rather than in a private home. Luque was Maradonas personal physician for the last four years of his life, while Cosachov prescribed medication that Maradona took until the time of his death.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/maradona-argentina-trial-hamburgers-daef6cd39df782cbc8d8076ec094f112,sports
"Toronto Gold Glove OF Varsho makes stunning, backhanded catch in season debut against Boston","TORONTO (AP)  Daulton Varsho and his Gold Glove defense are back in the Toronto Blue Jays outfield. Hours after being activated off the injured list, Varsho turned in a highlight-reel catch at the base of the wall in center field in his season debut. Varsho was retreating to the wall in center on a one-out drive by Bostons Jarren Duran in the fourth inning of Tuesdays night 10-2 loss to Boston when he lost his balance as he reached the warning track, falling and rolling over. Able to get back up on one knee  and with his back turned to home plate  Varsho had the presence of mind to stick out his glove and make a remarkable catch. When I fell I was like, Oh boy, its going to be somewhat near me, Varsho said. I saw it kind of really quick and kind of stuck my glove out. Blue Jays manager John Schneider was initially worried the tumble might damage Varshos right shoulder, which he had surgery on last September. Varsho said he was fine. Bostons Alex Bregman called it one of the best catches Ive ever seen in my life. I wish he wouldnt have (caught it) because it would have been a nice triple for Jarren, but youve got to tip your hat to him there, Bregman said. That was an unbelievable play. Varsho won his first Gold Glove award with Toronto last season, when he hit .214 with 18 homers and 58 RBIs. The 28-year-old missed the start of this season while recovering from surgery. Hes a career .225 hitter with a .414 slugging percentage and 79 homers over five seasons in Arizona and Toronto. 
        
     Also Tuesday, the Blue Jays activated right-hander Casey Lawrence a day after claiming him off waivers from Seattle. Right-hander Paxton Schultz and infielder Will Wagner were optioned to Triple-A Buffalo. Three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer threw off the mound Tuesday for the second time as he works toward a return from thumb inflammation. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/blue-jays-daulton-varsho-368601b7d4ca0dbb3e51dd73ac5fb1b9,sports
Yankees hit 3 straight homers to start game against Orioles -- a month after doing it vs. Brewers,"BALTIMORE (AP)  If your starting pitcher isnt sharp, the New York Yankees can make him look very bad, very quickly. And the Baltimore Orioles have a lot of starters who havent been sharp lately. The Yankees greeted Kyle Gibson in his return to the major leagues by homering on three of his first five pitches Tuesday night. When Trent Grisham, Aaron Judge and Ben Rice went deep, it marked the second time this year that New York began a game with three consecutive home runs. The Yankees are the first team to do that more than once in a season  and April hasnt even ended yet. Grish got it going for us and set the tone for us early on, Judge said. When he goes up there and ... sends one to Eutaw Street, its pretty impressive and gets you going. Cody Bellinger  the games fifth batter  also hit a solo homer, and Gibson allowed another one to Rice in the second. The Yankees ultimately went deep six times and thrashed the Orioles 15-3. New York started the bottom of the first of its March 29 game against Milwaukee with three homers in a row. In that game, Paul Goldschmidt, Bellinger and Judge needed only three pitches to hit three homers. It just shows that weve got a lot of depth in the lineup, Rice said. I know Judgie was part of the first one, right? But it was three different guys this time? Or two different guys? It was an ugly return to the majors for the 37-year-old Gibson, who made 30 starts for the St. Louis Cardinals last season before Baltimore signed him to a $5.25 million, one-year contract in late March. Hed been working in the minors before being called up before Tuesdays game. 
        
     He gave up four homers in the first inning. Thats kind of a telling sign, Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. At that point Im just trying to figure out how were going to get through the game. Gibson ended up allowing nine runs and 11 hits in 3 2/3 innings. The Orioles lost ace Corbin Burnes to free agency and tried to bolster their staff by signing three starting pitchers to one-year deals, all of whom were at least 35 years old. Tomoyuki Sugano has been a positive, but Charlie Morton is off to a horrendous start and Gibson provided no help in his first opportunity. After Rices home run made it 3-0, Gibson retired Goldschmidt on a grounder before Bellinger homered. Anthony Volpes RBI double made it 5-0 before the top of the first was over. Rice homered again in the second to make it 6-0. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-three-homers-808aa52435a8129af4266129ca4bf064,sports
White Sox supporting 1B Andrew Vaughn through tough start to the season,"CHICAGO (AP)  The Chicago White Sox are sticking with Andrew Vaughn  for now. Vaughn is batting .160 after he went 1 for 4 with a first-inning single and two strikeouts in Tuesday nights 7-2 loss to Milwaukee. The struggling first baseman has just two extra-base hits in his last 12 games. While Vaughn is looking for a turnaround in the majors, Tim Elko is off to a strong start with Triple-A Charlotte. The 26-year-old first baseman is batting .356 with nine homers and 20 RBIs in 24 games. Were more focused on supporting Andrew right now, general manager Chris Getz said before the loss to the Brewers. Hes been one of the more unlucky hitters in baseball. I know he wants greater results for the White Sox and for himself. And we expect more out of him. The 27-year-old Vaughn was selected by Chicago with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2019 amateur draft. He hit .246 with 19 homers and 70 RBIs in 149 games last year. Going into the series opener against the Brewers, Vaughn had a .243 expected batting average and an average exit velocity of 91.6 mph  indicating he had been hurt by some tough luck. Theres some areas in which mechanically, that adjustments that need to be made, Getz said. But the results that hes gotten at the surface level, we know that its a little deceptive. Vaughns slow start comes with the White Sox dealing with a handful of injuries, especially with their position players. 
        
     Josh Rojas went 0 for 3 with a walk in a rehab appearance with Charlotte on Tuesday night, and Chase Meidroth could return to the lineup by the end of Chicagos six-game homestand. Rojas was sidelined by a right toe injury, and Meidroth is coming back from right thumb inflammation. Catcher Korey Lee (left ankle) and outfielders Mike Tauchman (right hamstring) and Austin Slater (right knee) are another two to three weeks away, according to Getz. Korey has stacked up some quality days, feels pretty good, Getz said. Hes still in a running progression, but the swellings down.

They were 6-23 after 29 games in 2024, when they went 41-121 to break the post-1900 major league record for losses in a season. Getz is counting on a rich farm system to help the team emerge from its rebuild, but Colson Montgomery  one of Chicagos top prospects  is off to a troubling start. The 23-year-old Montgomery, a first-round pick in the 2021 draft, is batting .149 (14 for 94) with Charlotte. Getz said Montgomery is going to go to Arizona to work with Ryan Fuller, who was hired in November as the organizations director of hitting. We are going to get some one-on-one work with him outside of kind of the Charlotte day to day and work on his swing, Getz said. We anticipate that to be a fairly short period of time but felt like it was appropriate.

Yankees 2B Jazz Chisholm Jr. leaves in 1st inning with right oblique discomfort,"BALTIMORE (AP)  New York Yankees second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. left Tuesday nights game against Baltimore in the top of the first inning with right oblique discomfort. The injury was initially announced as a flank injury, an unusual description that caused Chisholm to chuckle after the game. He said it could also be described as an oblique issue. Chisholm said he wasnt worried about needing to go on the injured list. Im really not as concerned as everybody else, Chisholm said. I tore my oblique before. I know its not torn or anything. Manager Aaron Boone, however, said Chisholm will have testing on the teams off day Thursday. Chisholm hurt himself while swinging. After being checked on, he stayed at the plate and hit a double, advancing to third on an error by right fielder Ramn Laureano. After that, he was replaced by pinch-runner Oswald Peraza. The hit Tuesday improved Chisholms average to .181. He does have seven homers on the year. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/yankees-jazz-chisholm-jr-injury-c75ae1b39b5838049ae743c8409fdbd3,sports
Dodgers trying to wrap their heads around another rash of pitching injuries,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  The Los Angeles Dodgers added nearly $2 billion in guaranteed contracts over the past two winters, half of that to sign two-way star Shohei Ohtani and pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. But there is one thing they cant buy with their deep financial resources: A healthy pitching staff. Five months after injuries forced them to win a World Series with a three-man rotation, the Dodgers are closing April with three starters  Blake Snell (shoulder inflammation), Tyler Glasnow (shoulder inflammation) and Clayton Kershaw (recovery from toe and knee surgery)  on the injured list. Ohtani, who is still recovering from 2023 surgery, remains months away from returning to the mound, manager Dave Roberts said Tuesday, and backend relievers Blake Treinen (forearm tightness) and Michael Kopech (shoulder impingement) are sidelined. The latest rash of injuries prompted the Dodgers to employ a bullpen game against the Miami Marlins on Tuesday night, their second of the season. Its something as an organization that weve been trying to wrap our heads around, because its not a good quality of life for anybody, Dodgers pitching coach Mark Prior said. Its not for the players who suffer the injuries. It doesnt help us operate at an optimal level as a ballclub. Andrew Friedman, the teams president of baseball operations, said the Dodgers conducted a deep dive into pitching injuries during the offseason, canvassing club executives, pitching coaches and medical experts. 
        
     Friedman thought the additions two-time Cy Young Award winner Snell and Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki this past winter to a rotation that was returning Dustin May and Tony Gonsolin from Tommy John surgeries would insulate the Dodgers from rotation setbacks. But the team seems no closer to solving its pitching injury woes than it was going into last winter. It was bucketed into two different situations, the first being guys we call up from the minor leagues and what theyre prepared for, what theyve been doing in their personal buildup over the years  to get accustomed to different roles, like a guy who has started for his whole career and all of a sudden hes in the bullpen, Prior said. The other thing is just pitching in big league games these days is extremely taxing and grinding. It used to be that you worried about the one through six hitters, especially in the National League, having pitchers (hit), you could kind of throttle back a little bit. Now, youve got to bring your A game to almost every single batter, so theres probably some unquantifiable stress there that, as an industry, we just havent quite grasped yet. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-pitching-injuries-b78fe51d88a5b14266564ad63538cd48,sports

Mbapp scores a goal but cant lead Madrid to the Copa title against Barcelona,"SEVILLE, Spain (AP)  Kylian Mbapp did the best he could to try and win a title with Real Madrid but fell short again in a 3-2 extra-time loss to archrival Barcelona in Saturdays Copa del Rey final. Mbapp, who started on the bench after being sidelined with an ankle injury, sparked Madrid as a half-time substitute. The France striker earned and scored a free kick in the 70th minute to equalize. Madrid went ahead 2-1 soon after, only to see Barcelona rally for a third clasico victory this season. Mbapp hasnt played a full match since hurting his right ankle in a second-leg loss to Arsenal in the Champions League quarterfinals 10 days ago. He missed a La Liga game due to suspension and then was rested over the weekend, but it was still a mild surprise when he wasnt included in the starting 11 for the clasico with a trophy at stake. Coach Carlo Ancelotti said the selection was a matter of fitness for Mbapp. He wasnt up to playing 90 minutes, and I preferred to have him in the second half when the rhythm of the game drops a bit, Ancelotti said. He played well and scored a goal. Barcelona was also without its top scorer after Robert Lewandowski sustained a left thigh injury last weekend. Ferran Torres started in his place and the equalizer that forced extra time. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/mbappe-real-madrid-copa-del-rey-bench-89280a688b70aaf42f79ef5e3bf13793,sports

Argentinas San Lorenzo club pays tribute to Pope Francis during match,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  Argentine soccer club San Lorenzo paid tributes to its fan Pope Francis during a national league home match on Saturday. The pontiff, who died last Monday at age 88, was buried in Rome before the game.  San Lorenzo players wore a patch on their shirts with an image of Jorge Mario Bergoglio smiling and wearing his papal robes, accompanied by the phrase Together for Eternity. Visiting side Rosario Central won 1-0 thanks to an injury time goal. Before the match, children from an initiative promoted by Bergoglio paraded with San Lorenzos youth team at Nuevo Gasmetro Stadium. The clubs blue and red colors were mixed in the stands with the yellow and white of the Vatican flag in the form of smoke, ribbons and flags, some of them featuring the popes face. Fans gave Francis a standing ovation only hours after he was buried in Rome. San Lorenzos stadium is in the Bajo Flores neighborhood, close to Bergoglios birthplace.

US Figure Skating hires sports executive Matt Farrell as CEO amid the run-up to the 2026 Olympics,"U.S. Figure Skating has hired Matt Farrell as its CEO, tasking the longtime sports executive with leading the governing body into an Olympic year in which the American team will be favored to win gold in multiple disciplines at the Milan-Cortina Games. The organization announced his hiring on Tuesday. The 56-year-old Farrell spent 13 years as the chief marketing officer for USA Swimming, along with two stints working for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. He more recently served as the executive director of World Long Drive and started his own marketing firm, Farrell Sports, with several clients involved in the Olympic movement. Im incredibly honored to step into this role at such an exciting time, Farrell said. Theres a fresh sense of momentum and possibility across the sport. In the months to come, Im eager to collaborate with our amazing athletes, passionate fans and dedicated partners to keep growing the community we all care so deeply about. Earlier this year, the U.S. took gold at the world championships in Boston in three of the four disciplines for the first time in its history. Ilia Malinin won his second consecutive mens title and is the prohibitive favorite for the 2026 Olympics, while the ice dance duo of Madison Chock and Evan Bates also will be favored after winning their third straight world title. The big surprise was Alysa Liu, a member of its 2022 Olympic team who returned from a nearly two-year retirement to become the first American woman in nearly two decades to stand atop the podium at the world championships. 
        
     Then, earlier this month, Liu delivered a flawless free skate to help the U.S. win its sixth gold medal at the World Team Trophy in Tokyo, making the Americans the favorites to defend their gold medal in the team event at the Winter Games. The Americans won two gold medals and a bronze at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, but they havent won more than three figure skating medals at any Winter Games since taking four when they hosted in Squaw Valley in 1960. Its clear that Matt brings the expertise and vision needed to lead U.S. Figure Skating through the lead-up to the 2026 Olympics and beyond, said Sam Auxier, who had been serving as the interim CEO ever since Tracy Marek resigned last October, and who will resume his role as board president. His proven leadership within the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic movement, combined with his deep knowledge of the sports industry and bold, strategic thinking will help accelerate the sport and the organization into a new era of growth and success. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports",https://apnews.com/article/us-figure-skating-milan-cortina-olympics-winter-games-559294dba3c45c6e3b162ca00b6027c6,sports
USA Volleyball tabs 3-time Olympic medalist April Ross to head beach coach with LA Games looming,"USA Volleyball has named three-time Olympic medalist April Ross as head of coaching for the beach national teams, turning to one of the countrys most successful beach volleyball players after the Americans had their first-ever medal shutout in Paris. The national governing body said the southern California native will work to improve the performance of our top American athletes on the international stage as it looks ahead to hosting the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Im honored to join USA Volleyball in this new role and look forward to working with our coaches and athletes to continue the legacy of success on the international stage, Ross said. Ive always believed in the power of collaboration, and Im excited to be part of a team that shares that vision. Ross, 42, won a silver medal in London, a bronze in Rio de Janeiro and a gold medal in Tokyo  with three different partners; she also won back-to-back NCAA indoor volleyball titles at Southern California. April brings a unique combination of elite-level experience, deep technical knowledge, and a passion for mentoring, said Sean Scott, director of beach national teams. Shes competed at the highest levels and understands what it takes to succeed. Im excited to work alongside her as we continue to build a world-class coaching culture that supports our athletes growth and prepares them to win at the highest level. The Americans dominated beach volleyball after the sport that was conceived on the coasts of Hawaii and California was added to the Olympic program in 1996, winning seven of the first 14 Olympic gold medals. But the haul has sputtered as the generation that included Ross and three-time gold medalists Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings aged out. 
        
     The U.S. women failed to medal in Paris for the first time since 2000; the American men have not medaled at all since 2008. USA Volleyball said Ross will be based at the beach volleyball training center in Torrance, California, and work to improve the quality of coaching and training at all levels of the national team program. Aprils leadership and dedication to the sport are unmatched, and we are thrilled to have her in this new role, USA Volleyball President and CEO John Speraw said. She is a true champion and a mentor who understands the value of collaboration and developing the next generation of elite athletes. We are confident that her expertise will continue to elevate U.S. Beach Volleyball on the global stage, especially as we look ahead to LA 2028. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/beach-volleyball-april-ross-184782f5fedef94581c0c0e5c92b8070,sports
"Ahead of rematch, Dubois camp says Usyk conned the referee in first bout","LONDON (AP)  Daniel Dubois trainer has accused Oleksandr Usyk of conning the referee the first time the two heavyweights squared off. Usyk and Dubois will fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship on July 19 at Wembley Stadium in a rematch of their August 2023 bout  won by Usyk in a ninth-round stoppage  that included a controversial low blow. It was halted in the fifth round for what the referee ruled a low blow by Dubois that sent Usyk to the canvas, with replays showing the punch hitting around the Ukrainians belt. It was not given as a knockdown, no points were deducted from Dubois, and Usyk was given time to recover. You should be given an Oscar for the performance, Don Charles, Dubois trainer, said at a news conference Tuesday. You conned the referee, you conned us, you conned the boxing world. The 38-year-old Usyk holds the WBA, WBC and WBO belts and is undefeated as a pro. Dubois, a 27-year-old London native, is the IBF champion. The low blow remained the talking point Tuesday, when Usyk got up and asked Dubois to sign photos that allegedly showed punches below the belt from their first fight. Dubois smiled and complied. Why dont you print one of those .. of the actual shot that had you trembling, Charles said. Usyk was unfazed by the criticism. You must teach your fighter to punch clean. But I win this fight, he said. Usyk relinquished the IBF title when he chose to fight in a rematch against Tyson Fury in December. He won that bout in Saudi Arabia, like he did their first fight last May, the first fight for the undisputed championship since 2000. 
        
     Dubois knocked out Anthony Joshua in his first bout as IBF champ last September in front of 96,000 fans at Wembley. Im on fire now, Dubois said Tuesday. Its going to be a bloodbath.

He has spent more weeks ranked No. 1 than any other tennis player but is currently No. 5. His only title in 2024 or 2025 was the gold medal he claimed by beating Carlos Alcaraz in the final of the Paris Olympics in August. Djokovic has repeatedly said that what now matters to him is adding to his major championships. The next such event begins in Paris on May 25.

All-rounder Sunil Narine leads Kolkata to 14-run victory over Delhi in IPL,"NEW DELHI (AP)  Sunil Narines all-round performance kept defending champion Kolkata Knight Riders alive in the Indian Premier League with a 14-run victory over Delhi Capitals on Tuesday. Narine made a brisk 27 up front to set up a platform for Kolkatas total of 204-9 after Delhi captain Axar Patel won the toss and elected to field. Narine, an experienced West Indies all-rounder, then grabbed 3-29 and ran out Lokesh Rahul to restrict Delhi to 190-9  its third defeat in four home games this season. Delhi stayed at No. 4 with 12 points while Kolkata remained in contention for playoffs with nine points after 10 league games. Faf du Plessis top-scored with 62 off 45 and had pushed Delhi to 136-3 when he combined in a 76-run partnership with Patel, who made a quickfire 43 off 23 balls. Patel batted with lot of aggression despite sustaining a hand injury during Kolkatas innings as he smashed Narine for three sixes and kept Delhi in the driving seat. But Narine first had the wickets of Patel and Tristan Stubbs in the 14th over and then du Plessis lofted the spinner to deep mid-wicket in the 16th over which brought Kolkata back into the game. Impact player Ashutosh Sharma could score only seven as he tried to accelerate against Varun Chakravarthy, but his reverse sweep went straight into the hands of Narine at backward point and Mitchell Starc fell of the next delivery when he skied a simple catch to wicketkeeper Rahmanullah Gurbaz. Vipraj Nigams late countercharge gave Delhi a glimmer of hope before Andre Russell clean bowled him in the final over for 38 off 19 balls as Kolkata squeezed the home team in the final five overs. Narine and Gurbaz featured in Kolkatas highest opening partnership of the season when they smacked 48 runs of the first three overs with Sri Lankan fast bowler Dushmanta Chameera conceding 25 runs in one over. Starc had Gurbaz (26 off 12 balls) caught behind off a fullish delivery outside the off stump and Narine was out plumb leg before wicket when he tried to slog sweep leg-spinner Nigams quickish leg-break soon after the power play. Patel then dried up the runs and got the wickets of captain Ajinkya Rahane (26) and Venkatesh Iyer (7) as Kolkata slipped to 113-4 in the 10th over. Top-scorer Angkrish Raghuvanshi (44) and Rinku Singh (36) then rebuilt the innings with a 61-run partnership before both fell in the death overs. Kolkata lost three wickets in Starcs final over of the innings when the Australian (3-43) claimed two wickets and Russell was run out after he tried to regain the strike. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/delhi-kolkata-ipl-9d9f775df24e0db6e0fe9f986d320d86,sports
"Marshall wont renew contract of AD Christian Spears, will start search for replacement","HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP)  Marshall will not renew the contract of athletic director Christian Spears when it expires next year, the school announced Tuesday. Marshall said the decision was mutual and it will begin an immediate search for a replacement for Spears, who was hired in February 2022. It has been my honor to serve this incredible university, Spears said in a statement. Spears guided Marshalls transition from Conference USA to the Sun Belt Conference in 2022. We are grateful for Christians passionate leadership and substantial contributions to Marshall Athletics, Marshall President Brad Smith said in a statement. From championship seasons to key facility upgrades, Christian is leaving the athletic department in a strong position. We wish him continued success in his next venture. The Thundering Herd won the Sun Belt football championship last December. The next day, football coach Charles Huff departed for Sun Belt rival Southern Miss. Dozens of players then entered the transfer portal, prompting Marshall to opt out of playing in the Independence Bowl. The Sun Belt fined Marshall $100,000 for the decision, which Spears had said was done for all the right reasons. Huffs four-year contract at Marshall was up after the 2024 season and there had been no agreement on a new deal. Spears has said Huff entertained coaching offers at other schools while at Marshall and that Spears wanted someone who truly wants to be at Marshall. Less than an hour after Huffs hiring at Southern Miss was announced, Marshall named Tony Gibson as its football coach. Gibson had signed a memorandum of understanding at Marshall five days before Huffs departure.

He is one of the few Kentucky Derby trainers atop a stable pony, escorting his horses to and from the track for their workouts. At 89, he is the sports elder statesman, a Hall of Famer with four Derby victories on a very lengthy resume. On Saturday, he will be chasing another with 30-1 shot American Promise.  Like the former basketball coach he is, Lukas isnt afraid to flip the playbook. American Promise went off the beaten path to earn his way to Kentucky with a win in the Virginia Derby. Hes a son of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify. He looks exactly like him, Lukas said. Hes developing very good at the right time. Lukas last Derby win was in 1999 with Charismatic. He has entered 16 horses since and finished second in 2002 with Proud Citizen. He won the 2022 Kentucky Oaks for fillies. Last year, he won the Preakness and the $1 million Pennsylvania Derby. Since his first Derby try in 1981, Lukas has saddled the second-most entries at 50, exceeded only by his protg, Todd Pletcher, who has 65. Pletcher also has a long-shot entry on Saturday with Grande at 20-1. A promising 3-year-old in the barn come the first Saturday in May can put a spring in any trainers step. Also invigorating Lukas are the deep-pocketed owners he has after his stock of good horses had gone way down. Our business the last six months has just taken off, he said. 
        
     He reminded his clientele that he will be 92 when the young horses they bought are ready to be trained at the racetrack. He suggested they might want to limit their purchases or send some to younger conditioners. They ignored him and bought 18 instead. Lukas isnt a complainer but he told John Bellinger, co-owner of American Promise, that his legs were tired. Thats fine, dont worry about that, Bellinger responded. Just dont lose your mind. Far from it, according to Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens. He and Lukas teamed to win the Derby in 1988 with filly Winning Colors. Wayne is known for how meticulous he is with everything that he does. That hasnt changed and it wont change, Stevens said. He still rides out every morning. He can still tell a good horse. Hes got a great eye. He picks all these horses out at the sales, their angles, their looks. Hes still got it at 89. That was evident at the auction where Lukas spotted American Promise. His old friend and rival Bob Baffert also had his eye on the colt since he had trained the sire, Justify. Noticing a contusion above one of the colts knees, Baffert figured he could get him for a steal at $400,000. Not so fast. American Promise sold for $750,000. I went to see who bought this horse, Baffert said. There he was  The Coach. While others were thinking the colt had a bad knee, Lukas gut told him otherwise. That was just a bump, he said. It went down in a week. One of Lukas few concessions to age is a desire to limit his stable to 40 horses, the same number of stalls he has at Churchill Downs in the spring and at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas in the winter. Weve run the red light on that, he said. Were up to about 52 or 53 now. Lukas told his fifth wife, Laurie, that given his age the couple might want to buy a few horses of their own for fun and send them to someone else to train. That plan also went awry. I bought four or five and we now have 11 racehorses, he said. We got some really nice colts. In other words, dont expect Lukas to ride off into retirement anytime soon. I always thought he would have been a great commissioner of racing, a great spokesperson, because hes so smart, speaks well, Baffert said. He knows the ins and outs and he still plays at that high level. Lukas and Baffert  who owns a record-tying six  have the most victories of any trainer in this years race. Nine of the trainers are in the Derby for the first or second time. Theres no how-to book, Lukas said. Those younger guys are going to make mistakes just like we all did. Theyll all learn, especially in this race. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing and Derby coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/kentucky-derby",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-derby-wayne-lukas-13f090975dc436e4093aed4272fa8828,sports
Ohio State and 6 other Big Ten teams will carry their quarterback competitions into the fall,"Eleven Big Ten teams have settled on their starting quarterbacks. The other seven, including defending national champion Ohio State, will carry competitions into preseason practice. Illinois Luke Altmyer, Michigan States Aidan Chiles, Nebraskas Dylan Raiola, Penn States Drew Allar, Rutgers Athan Kaliakmanis, Southern Californias Jayden Maiava and Washingtons Demond Williams Jr. are returning starters. Indiana, Iowa, UCLA and Wisconsin brought in transfers who will go into the fall as No. 1s  the Hoosiers Fernando Mendoza (California), the Hawkeyes Mark Gronowski (South Dakota State), the Bruins Nico Iamaleava (Tennessee) and the Badgers Billy Edwards Jr. (Maryland). Julian Sayin appears to have an edge over Lincoln Kienholz at Ohio State, where coach Ryan Day is waiting until August to name his starter. Sayin, a dual-threat rated as a five-star prospect out of high school, has been the presumed 2025 starter since he left Alabama when Nick Saban announced his retirement in January 2024. Dante Moore is favored to beat out Austin Novosad for the Oregon job. Moore was a five-star who transferred from UCLA after the 2023 season and played 29 snaps over five games last year. Novosad played a total of 16 snaps over three games. Heralded freshman Bryce Underwood has the inside track at Michigan against Mikey Keene and Jadyn Davis. Keene, who started 23 games at Fresno State the past two years, missed the spring game because of injury. The Wolverines hope to have more of a vertical passing game with new offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey. 
        
     No starter has been named at Minnesota, but it would be a surprise if it werent Drake Lindsey following the transfer of Zach Pyron two weeks ago. Max Shikenjanski and Dylan Wittke also are in the mix. Northwestern has a three-man race between SMU transfer Preston Stone and holdovers Jack Lausch and Ryan Boe. Malachi Singleton looked like the guy at Purdue until Ryan Browne, who started two games last season, transferred back after going through spring practice at North Carolina. Singleton, Browne and Washington State transfer Evans Chuba will compete for the job. Freshman Malik Washington appears to be the front-runner at Maryland, where UCLA transfer Justyn Martin also is competing. Barry Odom takes the momentum of leading UNLV to its best back-to-back seasons in its Division I history into his new job at Purdue, which was 5-19 overall and 3-15 in Big Ten play in two years under Ryan Walters. Odom has signed 44 players out of the transfer portal to help replace the 56 who left. Leading rusher Devin Mockobee and defensive lineman Jamarius Dinkins are the only returning starters. Walters, fired on Dec. 1, is now defensive coordinator at Washington. Purdue visits the Huskies on Nov. 15. Oregon brought in the top-ranked group of transfers in the Big Ten, according to 247Sports. Among the incoming players were OL Isaiah World (Nevada), S Dillon Thieneman (Purdue) and OL Emmanuel Pregnon (USC). UCLA landed the No. 1 transfer in Iamaleava. Other notable transfers: TE Max Klare (Purdue) to Ohio State, CB Tacario Davis (Arizona) to Washington, WR Dane Key (Kentucky) to Nebraska, DL Williams Nwaneri (Missouri) to Nebraska, DL Keeshawn Silver (Kentucky) to USC, RB Justice Haynes (Alabama) to Michigan, OL Phillip Daniels (Minnesota) to Ohio State and OL Elijah Pritchett (Alabama) to Nebraska. Aug. 28: Nebraska vs. Cincinnati, at Kansas City, Missouri; Miami (Ohio) at Wisconsin; Ohio at Rutgers; Buffalo at Minnesota. Aug. 30: Texas at Ohio State; Montana State at Oregon; Old Dominion at Indiana; Nevada at Penn State; Western Illinois at Illinois; Albany at Iowa; New Mexico at Michigan; Missouri State at Southern California; Colorado State at Washington; Western Michigan at Michigan State; Utah at UCLA; Northwestern at Tulane; FAU at Maryland; Ball State at Purdue. ___ AP Sports Writers Dave Campbell in Minneapolis, Andrew Destin in Seattle, Larry Lage in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Steve Megargee in Madison, Wisconsin, Anne M.

Here are 18 football players to watch next season in the Big Ten Conference,"A look at football players in the Big Ten this spring who are poised to have breakout seasons this fall: TE Cole Rusk was expected to be a starter last year, but a major knee injury ended his season before it began. He could make an immediate impact at a position that needs to be more productive. The 6-foot-5, 250-pounder was one of the top tight ends in the FCS at Murray State in 2023, catching 39 balls for 507 yards and six touchdowns.  WR Omar Cooper Jr. was mostly a backup to Myles Price last season and averaged 21.2 yards on his 28 catches. His seven touchdowns were second among receivers behind star Elijah Sarratts eight. Indiana brought in the productive Makai Jackson from Appalachian State, but Price and KeShawn Williams are gone and that should give Cooper an opportunity to increase his numbers. WR Jacob Gill stands to benefit greatly from the addition of South Dakota State transfer QB Mark Gronowski, easily the best pure passer at Iowa since three-year starter Nate Stanley (2017-19). Gill had 35 catches for 411 yards last season, modest numbers but still the best among Iowa receivers. Now the ball will be delivered by one of the most prolific quarterbacks in FCS history. S Lavain Scruggs has appeared in 23 games mostly as a backup the last two seasons and entered spring as the leading contender to take over for three-year starter Dante Turner at strong safety. Scruggs started in place of an injured Turner against Southern California and had six tackles and a 51-yard interception return to set up a touchdown in a 29-28 win. TE Jalen Hoffman did not catch a pass in his first two seasons behind Colston Loveland, but he looks like a potential security blanket for Bryce Underwood. The 6-foot-3, 245-pound Hoffman had several catches in the spring game, including a scrimmage-ending, 88-yard touchdown reception from Underwood on a reverse flea flicker. 
        
     CB Joshua Eaton transferred from Texas State for his sixth season, and hell be given an opportunity to win one of the two open cornerback spots. Eaton was a four-star recruit coming out of high school but played sparingly in three years at Oklahoma. He started 20 of 25 games at Texas State and, at 6-1 and 187 pounds, gives the Spartans some size at the position. Listing Koi Perich as a safety is a limiting exercise the Gophers arent engaging in, with plans to expand on his Swiss Army knife role spawned during an impressive debut that earned him a first team All-Big Ten selection by the AP. Perich will return kicks and take turns on offense, too, as the Gophers look to get the ball in his capable hands. RB Emmett Johnson is in line to be a workhorse. Hes by far the most experienced player in a running back room that lost more than 60% of its production. Johnson averaged 5.1 yards per carry and 46 yards per game as the backup to Dante Dowdell. Matt Rhule demands a physical run game, and the 5-foot-11, 200-pound Johnson is built to thrive in it. CB Ore Adeyi was on track to be a starter last year before sustaining a season-ending injury late in fall camp. He is in line to get the job back if he can beat out Jacksonville State transfer Fred Davis II and Braden Turner in the fall. In 2023, Adeyi played in all 13 games with one start and made 20 tackles, including a career-high four against Penn State. DE Logan George transferred from Idaho State in January and has made a big impression in a short amount of time. He saw time on the second team during the spring, but with the defensive lines struggles, could compete for a starting spot. Hes got strong hands. Hes got physicality, coach Ryan Day said after the spring game. WR Dillon Gresham is considered one of the Ducks top young players and he showed this spring hes ready to compete for significant playing time come fall. Gresham was a four-star recruit who did not appear in a game last season while redshirting. He caught three balls for 96 yards in the spring game, including a 56-yard touchdown.  WR Devonte Ross is among the newcomers to a group of wideouts that made no catches in the College Football Playoff semifinal loss to Notre Dame. Ross was an All-Sun Belt Conference first-team pick after leading the league with 11 touchdown catches to go with 1,043 yards on 76 receptions. He has 116 catches over the past two seasons. He also is an accomplished kick and punt returner. OL Bradyn Joiner was named to the SECs all-freshman team after taking over as Auburns starting left guard the second half of the season. The 6-foot-2, 328-pound Joiner is a key addition as the Boilermakers try to upgrade their offensive line, which allowed 32 sacks to rank 14th in the Big Ten. Joiner allowed two sacks on 192 pass-blocking plays over the last five games, according to Pro Football Focus. RB Jashon Benjamin, under the radar the last two seasons, is up for a more prominent role now that star Kyle Monangai has moved on. Benjamin has appeared in 13 games over two seasons and has run for 272 yards and two touchdowns. Antwan Raymond, whose 457 rushing yards led Big Ten freshmen, went into the spring as the projected starter, but coach Greg Schiano told reporters dont sleep on Benjamin. TE Walter Matthews, at 6-6 and 272 pounds, is in the mix for significant playing time after redshirting his first season. He was the No. 2-ranked tight end prospect by ESPN in 2023 and could easily be confused for an offensive tackle. He is advanced as a pass-catcher and route-runner, and hes hard to bring down. The Trojans also might use him as a sixth offensive lineman in the red zone. DB Jadyn Marshall enters his fourth season yet to find his niche. He was a top-30 receiver as a four-star recruit but moved to defensive back in 2023. He played mostly on special teams last year. Coach DeShaun Foster said Marshall could see action on both sides of the ball as a receiver and defensive back, and he also could return kicks. LB Jacob Manu transferred from Arizona, where he played two seasons for current Huskies coach Jedd Fisch. Manu was an All-Pac-12 first-team pick in 2023 when he led the conference in tackles with 116, including 6.5 sacks. Injuries cut short his 2024 season. A healthy Manu could significantly benefit a defense that ranked 98th nationally with 20 sacks and recorded none in five of the last six games. RB Dilin Jones was a revelation this spring and will compete with Darrion Dupree for carries now that 2024 rushing leader Tawee Walker has transferred. Jones had just 16 carries last season, all against South Dakota, Purdue and Rutgers. He got more exposure after Dupree injured his ankle April 10 and impressed coach Luke Fickell with his effort and attitude. ___ AP Sports Writers Dave Campbell in Minneapolis, Andrew Destin in Seattle, Larry Lage in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Steve Megargee in Madison, Wisconsin, Anne M.

Rodriguez and Frost new to Big 12 in reunions with schools they won with in different leagues,"Rich Rodriguez and Scott Frost are new to the Big 12 Conference, but not to the schools that have welcomed them back. Rodriguez at West Virginia and Frost at UCF are the only new coaches in the 16-team Big 12, and now have been through their first spring since getting back to their old schools. West Virginia has gone through 13 seasons in the Big 12, but were still in the Big East when Rodriguez led the Mountaineers to three consecutive 11-win seasons from 2005-07 before his departure for Michigan.  Frost was the coach for UCFs undefeated season out of the American Athletic Conference in 2017, when the Knights declared themselves national champions before he left for Nebraska.  Things did feel different for Frost than his first spring with the Knights in 2016, when they were coming off an 0-12 season. Our first scrimmage out here in the spring, I was discouraged coming off that field. ... We didnt do anything good, or at least it felt that way, Frost said, recalling 2016 before turning to this spring. Were doing some good things. Theres just a level of speed and precision to execution that has to happen on every single play to make it work, and were not there yet. The Knights were 10-15 in their first two Big 12 seasons under Gus Malzahn, the former national champion who left UCF after four seasons to become offensive coordinator at Florida State. The back-to-back losing records to open their Big 12 era followed a school-record six winning seasons in a row, which began with the 13-0 season after Frosts 6-7 debut. The second stint for Rodriguez at West Virginia comes 18 years after his first one ended. He will have to make wholesale changes in the name, image and likeness era  along with the transfer portal and pending roster limits  if the Mountaineers are going to compete for a Big 12 title. 
        
     The offense lost its entire line and top three receivers. Four receivers return who combined for 524 yards last season.  We just dont have enough for our system ... We just dont have enough bodies, Rodriguez said. We want somebody obviously who can be that 1-on-1 guy that you can rely on. And our guys are getting better, getting some confidence in them. But we literally dont have enough bodies to run the way we want to run it. All five Big 12 running backs who averaged at least 100 yards per game last season were selected in last weeks NFL draft.  Only two of the top 10 rushers from last season are still in the league: Baylors Bryson Washington (1,028 yards, 12 touchdowns) and BYUs LJ Martin (723 yards, 7 TDs).  West Virginias offense could revolve around running back Jahiem White, who had 845 yards rushing and averaged 6.5 yards per carry last season in a two-back system for the Mountaineers.  Dylan Edwards, now a junior at Kansas State, averaged 7.4 yards on his 74 carries last year behind drafted JD Giddens. Carson Hansen had 13 rushing TDs for Iowa State, the most for any Big 12 returning back.  All-everything running back Cam Skattebo is gone from reigning Big 12 champion Arizona State, which just added Kanye Udoh from the transfer portal after he ran for 1,117 yards and 10 TDs last season for Army.  There are a lot of experienced quarterbacks in the Big 12, but it was a tumultuous spring at that position for Oklahoma State.  Maealiuaki Smith and Garrett Rangel, the only Oklahoma State quarterbacks with significant experience, entered the transfer portal. That left the Cowboys with Zane Flores and Hauss Hejny. Flores played only sparingly last season. Hejny, a redshirt freshman, is a transfer from TCU. Colorado has to replace quarterback Shedeur Sanders, and has a two-QB race between Liberty transfer Kaidon Salter and Julian Lewis, the highly touted five-star recruit who enrolled early to go through spring drills. The Buffaloes plan to find a little more balance between the run and the pass more this season, which is why coach Deion Sanders hired Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk as the running backs coach. Among the Big 12 returners is Sam Leavitt, who passed for 2,885 yard and 24 TDs to help Arizona State win the Big 12 after transferring from Michigan State. Sawyer Robertson is back at Baylor after his 3,071 yards and 28 TDs, one more passing score than TCUs Josh Hoover (3,949 yards) and Texas Techs Behren Morton (3,335 yards). BYU, coming off a 5-7 debut in the Big 12 in 2023, was arguably the biggest surprise team in the league last season, rising as high as No. 6 in the CFP rankings in November before finishing 11-2 with an Alamo Bowl victory over Colorado. BYU has tons of returning experience on both sides of the ball. But the Cougars also face questions along the defensive line where they graduated every starter from last season. Utah collapsed in its Big 12 debut last year, going from preseason title favorites to a seven-game losing streak. The Utes brought in former New Mexico offensive coordinator Jason Beck to overhaul an offense that ranked near the bottom of the Big 12 in virtually every major statistical category last season. ___ AP College Football Writer Eric Olson, AP sports writers Cliff Brunt, Pat Graham, John Marshall, John Raby and Dave Skretta, and AP freelance writer John Coon contributed to this report. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

NHL draft lottery will be held Monday with the Sharks having the best odds at getting the No. 1 pick,"NEW YORK (AP)  The NHL will hold its draft lottery next Monday with the San Jose Sharks holding the best chance of getting the top pick for the second straight season. The lottery to determine the top 16 picks in the June draft will be held at the NHL Networks studio in New Jersey and broadcast on ESPN. The lottery is conducted in two phases with the first to determine the No. 1 pick and the second to determine the No. 2 pick. Teams can only move up 10 spots in the order, meaning only the bottom 11 teams have a chance at the first pick. This draft is not considered to be one of the stronger ones in recent years at the top with defenseman Matthew Schaefer and center Michael Misa of the Ontario Hockey League ranked by the leagues central scouting bureau as the top two North American skaters available. The Sharks won the lottery last year and picked Macklin Celebrini first overall. Celebrini had 25 goals and 38 assists in an impressive rookie season but San Jose still finished with the worst record in the NHL. That gives the Sharks a 25.5% chance of getting the No. 1 pick again, either by winning the lottery or if the teams in the 12th through 16th spots win and cant move up to No. 1. Chicago has the second-best odds at 13.5%, followed by Nashville at 11.5%, Philadelphia at 9.5% and Boston at 8.5%. The Blackhawks won the lottery in 2023 and picked Connor Bedard with the first pick.  ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-draft-lottery-9ec966ae6f6eb85c9404b708e625b6a8,sports
Players to watch next season in the Big 12 Conference,"Players in the Big 12 Conference this spring who could have big impacts for their teams in the fall: QB Noah Fifita had a superb first season after becoming the starting quarterback in 2023, throwing for 2,869 yards and 25 touchdowns with six interceptions while setting a school record with a 72.4% completion rate. He threw for 2,958 yards with 18 TDs last season, but his interception total doubled and he completed only 60.5% of his passes.  WR Jordyn Tyson was one of the Big 12s best wideouts last season, but missed the conference championship game and CFP quarterfinal game after a left shoulder injury in the regular-season finale. He had 29 catches for 444 yards the last three games, finishing with 75 catches for 1,101 yards and 10 TDs overall. He went through spring practice after surgery.  LB Keaton Thomas played one game at West Virginia in 2022, then went to junior college for one season before having 114 tackles last year for the Bears. The linebacker had four games with at least 10 tackles while teaming up with Matt Jones to give the Bears their first duo of 100-tackle players since 2012. Jones is now gone after six seasons in Waco. QB Jake Retzlaff made major strides at quarterback last season, throwing for 2,947 yards with 20 touchdowns and showing a knack for putting together late game-winning drives on multiple occasions. BYU can challenge for a Big 12 title if Retzlaff can improve on his accuracy. He had 12 interceptions last season while only completing 57.9% of his pass attempts. Nose tackle Dontay Corleone has 110 tackles (55 solo) and 9 1/2 sacks in his 34 games the past three seasons, and played last year after dealing with a blood clots in his lungs that forced him to miss the opener. The 6-foot-1, 325-pounder known as The Godfather opted to return for his senior year with Cincinnati, part of the four-team College Football Playoff in 2021 but 8-16 in its two Big 12 seasons.  
        
     Kaidon Salter and Julian Lewis are believed to be the frontrunners at QB from the departed Shedeur Sanders. The Buffaloes will need multiple players to replace Heisman Trophy winner and two-way standout Travis Hunter, the second overall pick in the NFL draft. RJ Johnson, who played mostly on special teams last year after transferring from Arkansas, appears to be in line to be Hunters replacement at cornerback. Among the receivers who could try to fill Hunters void on offense are Omarion Miller, who missed the last seven games in 2024 due to injury, and Drelon Miller, who as a true freshman last season started the opener. Former five-star QB recruit Conner Weigman is getting a fresh start while being among a dozen players added to Houstons offense. He passed for 2,694 yards with 19 TDs and seven interceptions in 15 games with Texas A&M the past three seasons, but had a season-ending foot injury two years ago and sustained a shoulder injury in the opener last year. He has two seasons of eligibility remaining. East Carolina transfer WR Chase Sowell is a major addition to an Iowa State offense that lost a pair of 1,000-yard receivers: Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel were both drafted by the Houston Texans. The 6-foot-4, 195-pound Sowell is out of the Higgins mold. The redshirt junior had 81 catches for 1,300 yards and four TDs the past two seasons with the Pirates after starting his career at Colorado.  QB Jalon Daniels has had a history of meteoric success and injury-filled low points while starting 33 games for the Jayhawks the past five seasons. He did start all 12 games last season and struggled before leading the Jayhawks to three consecutive wins over ranked opponents, but also was limited in spring practice after what was called a minor knee surgery. He threw for 2,454 yards and 14 TDs, but also had 12 interceptions last season. He will be behind an offensive line that lost a lot of experience.  Avery Johnson showed flashes of brilliance in his first season as K-States starting quarterback, throwing for 2,712 yards with 25 TDs, and also running for 605 yards and seven scores. But he struggled with inconsistency. Can he thrive with Matt Wells taking over as offensive coordinator? Johnson will be relying on a new group of wide receivers this season with transfers Jaron Tibbs, Jerand Bradley and Caleb Medford. Rodney Fields had a 74-yard touchdown run in Oklahoma States spring game. The running back had 21 carries for 99 yards, and two catches for 23 yards in four games last year, maintaining his freshman status while Ollie Gordon II played his final season. Fields quickness and versatility should be a good fit in new offensive coordinator Doug Meachams system, and a boost for a team with only one returning offensive starter. Idaho transfer Jordan Dwyer could fill a big hole for the Horned Frogs, who had receivers Jack Bech and Savion Williams both taken in the first three rounds of the NFL draft. Dwyer had 78 catches for 1,192 yards and 12 TDs for the Vandals last season, with at least 100 yards receiving in four of the last five games. He had 11 catches for 189 yards and two TDs in an FCS playoff game last fall. Terrance Carter Jr. was the top tight end in the Sun Belt last season before transferring to Texas Tech, where he has two seasons of eligibility. Carter had 76 catches for 944 yards and seven TDs the past two seasons for the Ragin Cajuns at Louisiana-Lafayette. The Red Raiders top two tight ends last season exhausted their eligibility.  Myles Montgomery, now in his fifth college season, gets his shot at being the top running back. He first backed up 1,000-yard rusher Corey Kiner at Cincinnati before transferring to UCF last season behind 1,577-yard rusher R.J. Harvey, who also ran for 22 TDs. Montgomery had 293 yards and three TDs while averaging 5.7 yards on his 51 carries last season for the Knights. He also had three catches for 66 yards and a score. Dual-threat QB Devon Dampier followed offensive coordinator Jason Beck from New Mexico, and beat out Isaac Wilson for the Utes starting job in spring practice. Dampier had a breakout season with the Lobos last year, throwing for 2,768 yards and 12 touchdowns while rushing for 1,166 yards with 19 TDs. Dampier will need to improve his accuracy to give Utahs offense a similar boost this fall. He completed just 58% of his passes last season while also throwing 12 interceptions. DL Jimmori Robinson. The 6-5 Robinson amassed 10 1/2 sacks and 17 tackles for loss as a linebacker at UTSA last season, and was named the American Athletic Conferences defensive player of the year. He had 15 sacks and 30 TFLS in 42 games over the past four seasons in San Antonio. ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/big-12-spring-players-to-watch-ecb6b74692d7c56fb498c2fbec8fb88d,sports
Guardians place right-hander Paul Sewald on 15-day injured list with a right shoulder strain,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Guardians reliever Paul Sewald was placed on the 15-day injured list before Tuesdays game against the Minnesota Twins with a right shoulder stain.

"With lefty A.J. Minter mulling season-ending surgery, Mets re-sign Brooks Raley to $1.85M deal","NEW YORK (AP)  With reliever A.J. Minter sidelined long term, the New York Mets re-signed fellow left-hander Brooks Raley to a one-year contract Tuesday that guarantees $1.85 million. Raley is throwing bullpens as he recovers from elbow surgery last May, but its unclear when he could be ready to join the bullpen. He was placed on the 15-day injured list. Minter is on the IL with a left lat strain after getting hurt Saturday in Washington. He underwent an MRI on Sunday, and season-ending surgery is a possibility.  What we know right now is were dealing with a pretty significant injury here, manager Carlos Mendoza said. Thats why were providing him with all the information, so he makes the right decision.  Mendoza said Minter has received multiple opinions and was mulling a course of action, with a decision expected in probably another day or two. A treatment program of rest and rehabilitation, rather than surgery, remains an option  but the 31-year-old pitcher will be unavailable for an extended period regardless. Its a significant setback for New Yorks bullpen, a huge reason the Mets entered Tuesday nights series opener against Arizona with the best record in the majors at 20-9. Minter joined the Mets as a free agent in January, leaving the NL East rival Atlanta Braves for a $22 million, two-year contract that includes an $11 million player option for 2026.  
        
     He has a 1.64 ERA and seven holds in 13 appearances as the top left-handed setup man for closer Edwin Daz. Minter has struck out 14 and walked five in 11 innings. Its a big blow, Im not going to lie. Not only because of his ability to throw high leverage, but his ability to get lefties and righties, Mendoza said. But guys will step up. Guys will continue to get opportunities, and weve got to keep going. It sucks for him, especially going down this early. A seven-year veteran, Raley made eight appearances for the Mets last season before getting hurt, the last on April 19, and then became a free agent in November. He was 1-2 with a 2.80 ERA and three saves in 66 outings for New York in 2023. Raley, who turns 37 in late June, is 6-10 with a 4.04 ERA and 12 saves with the Chicago Cubs (2012-13), Cincinnati (2020), Houston (2020-21), Tampa Bay (2022) and the Mets (2023-24). He pitched in South Korea from 2015-19. Hes going to go down to Florida and continue to throw his bullpens, so hopefully in the next couple of weeks he starts facing batters, and then well go from there, Mendoza said.  Raley gets a $1.5 million salary this year. His deal includes a $4.75 million team option for 2026 with a $350,000 buyout. He would get a $250,000 bonus if added to the active major league roster this year and could earn $900,000 more in performance bonuses for games as a pitcher: $125,000 each for 10, 15 and 20, and $175,000 apiece for 25, 30 and 35. Raley could earn $1.75 million in performance bonuses in 2026 for games as a pitcher: $250,000 each for 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65. New York also transferred left-hander Sean Manaea to the 60-day IL, recalled right-hander Kevin Herget from Triple-A Syracuse and designated right-hander Jose Urea for assignment. Urea threw 68 pitches over the final three innings Monday at Washington to get the save in a 19-5 victory. He allowed five runs and seven hits with one walks and three strikeouts. Mendoza said left-hander Brandon Waddell will be called up from Triple-A Syracuse to pitch some part of Wednesday nights game against the Diamondbacks as the Mets give Kodai Senga his customary fifth day of rest. Left fielder Brandon Nimmo was out of the starting lineup Tuesday night because he was feeling ill after catching a bug thats been going around the Mets clubhouse. I think last night and this morning, thats when it got him pretty good, Mendoza said. Nimmo matched a franchise record Monday with nine RBIs, including a grand slam and a three-run homer against the Nationals.  Im not resting Brandon  especially after that game last night, Mendoza said with a smile. Hes just sick today. Hes in rough shape right now. Weve got a lot of guys dealing with this flu, whatever you want to call it, and fever, pretty weak. So hes getting an IV right now and hopefully hes a player for us at some point today. But weve got to give him a couple hours.  ___ AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/brooks-raley-mets-233f229cae3a25fdc2f91fe7b9c4be5d,sports
ACC and new North Carolina coach Bill Belichick head toward season after spring full of changes,"Its on to fall camp for the Atlantic Coast Conference and new North Carolina coach Bill Belichick.  Belichick was the buzziest offseason addition for the ACC when the six-time Super Bowl championship-winning head coach agreed to take over the Tar Heels  his first time as a college head coach.  Belichick has had plenty of personnel issues to handle. Two of North Carolinas best pass rushing threats in defensive end Beau Atkinson and linebacker Amare Campbell entered the transfer portal. But Belichick landed South Alabama quarterback Gio Lopez, who threw for 2,599 yards and 18 touchdowns as a sophomore last season.  UNC hired Belichick in December in a sign of a stepped-up investment in football. The Tar Heels opened spring drills in early March and had a practice that media was permitted to observe for about 20 minutes, then closed last weekend with a public workout in Kenan Stadium. It was hard to pick up many specifics with players working out with no jersey numbers. North Carolina general manager Michael Lombardi said long before spring practices that the goal was for Belichick to create an NFL team.  We want to play to the strengths of our players and thats what well do, Belichick said in March. That part takes a little while to figure that out, but nevertheless well run a pro system on both sides of the ball and the kicking game. Thats where the foundation of it is. 
        
     And all the training videos that weve shown them on how to do things, how to do certain techniques, how to run certain things are really from NFL players  the guys who are great at it, the guys who did it better than anybody. I think thats still a great way to teach, because our players are seeing some of the best guys who have played do what they do. UNCs opener is a Monday night affair, with the Tar Heels hosting TCU on Labor Day to open Belichicks tenure. Stanford went through spring drills after coach Troy Taylor was fired in late March amid a report by ESPN he had been investigated twice since taking over before the 2023 season after allegations of inappropriate behavior. Cardinal general manager Andrew Luck, the schools former star quarterback, hired Frank Reich as interim coach this season to take over for Taylor. Reich and his staff have done as much listening as teaching with players still processing the abrupt changes.  The key for us is dont overwhelm the players, Reich said. Find the small pockets where we can make a significant difference.  Both ACC teams that made the College Football Playoff (league champion Clemson and runner-up SMU) believe they took steps forward after losing first-round playoff games.  The Tigers and Mustangs will have two of the leading quarterbacks in the ACC and perhaps the country in Cade Klubnik of Clemson and Kevin Jennings of SMU.  Klubnik threw for 3,639 yards and 36 touchdowns in leading the Tigers to their eighth league title in 10 seasons and his second in three years. Jennings led SMU to an 8-0 regular season and engineered a fourth-quarter comeback in the title game against the Tigers before Clemsons dramatic, walk-off, 56-yard field goal gave them a 34-31 victory.  Clemson added former Indiana head coach and Penn State defensive coordinator in Tom Allen to lead the Tigers defense. Swinney liked how his defense did better in the red zone spring under Allens direction.  Thats an area that we have to be better at this year is red zone defense. When you win on red zone defense, you hold them to a field goal, he said.  Florida State is looking to get back on top after a disastrous 2-10 season that followed its first ACC title in nearly a decade in 2023. Seminoles coach Mike Norvell liked the fire he saw from his group, working to blend newcomers with returnees hopeful to make a mark this season.  You felt the players trying to make that positive impact on each other and hold themselves to that standard thats necessary for us to continue to grow for what we all desire here this fall, Norvell said.  - AP Sports Writer Aaron Beard contributed to this report.  ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/acc-belichick-north-carolina-stanford-1bc631e8a54590157a46fa4eb8728a09,sports
Leverkusen delays Bayerns Bundesliga title celebrations and Kane set to miss the party,"BERLIN (AP)  Bayer Leverkusen postponed Bayern Munichs Bundesliga title celebrations on Saturday, leaving the Bavarian powerhouse on the verge of winning the trophy without top-scorer Harry Kane. Kane was shown his fifth yellow card of the season during Bayerns 3-0 win at home over Mainz, meaning the England captain will be suspended for Bayerns next match at Leipzig  where Bayern will likely win its 34th German league title. Kane has famously failed to win any major trophy in a career of individual awards and runner-up medals. The first looks set to come while hes watching from the stands. Bayern needed a win over Mainz and favor from Augsburg against Leverkusen to be crowned champion on Saturday, but goals from Patrik Schick and Emiliano Buendia gave Leverkusen a 2-0 win and kept the defending champion eight points behind Bayern with three rounds remaining. Leverkusen can still theoretically defend its first ever Bundesliga title by winning its last three games if Bayern loses its final three, but even a draw against Leipzig next weekend should be enough for Bayern, which has a far superior goal difference. Bayern needed patience against Mainz, with Leroy San opening the scoring in the 27th followed by Michael Elise in the 40th. There was still time before the break for Kane to get booked for failing to release the ball after committing a foul.  Goalkeeper Jonas Urbig denied Nadiem Amiri a Mainz response before San hit the post at the other end. Eric Dier sealed the result late with a header to Olises corner, seconds after Thomas Mller went on for his 500th Bundesliga appearance.  
        
     Eintracht Frankfurt closed in on Champions League qualification with a 4-0 win over Leipzig, for which last defender El Chadaille Bitshiabu was sent off early in the second half for denying Ansgar Knauff a clear goal chance. Knauff scored before the sending off  and again after it, with Hugo Ekitik and Robin Koch completing the rout as third-placed Frankfurt stretched its advantage over fifth-placed Leipzig to six points. Only the top four qualify for Europes premier competition.  Waldemar Anton scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to give Borussia Dortmund a 3-2 win at Hoffenheim, but the result was marred by arguments because Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann was struck in the head by Carney Chukwuemekas knee before Anton scored. Referee Benjamin Brand allowed the goal after a VAR check found it was an accidental clash. The win lifted Dortmund to sixth, three points behind Freiburg in fourth. Freiburg moved into the last place for Champions League qualification with a 1-0 win at Wolfsburg, for which captain Maximilian Arnold was sent off for a bad foul in the first half. There was also stoppage time drama in Kiel, where Japanese forward Shto Machino scored his second goal in stoppage time to give Holstein Kiel a 4-3 win over Borussia Mnchengladbach. Gladbach came from 2-0 down and again to level the score 3-3 before Machinos late winner. It lifted Kiel off the bottom, three points behind Heidenheim in the relegation playoff place. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/bayern-leverkusen-bundesliga-title-harry-kane-48dddc2fa1fe3d5f0be73b4a50c8faa4,sports
Rain ends Kolkatas chase against Punjab in IPL,"KOLKATA, India (AP)  Half-centuries from openers Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya went in vain as Punjab Kings Indian Premier League game against Kolkata Knight Riders was abandoned because of rain on Saturday. Both teams shared one point each. Punjab rose to fourth while defending champion Kolkata stayed seventh. Punjab made 201-4 and Kolkata was 7 without loss when play was stopped and never restarted. A thunderstorm blew debris all over the stadium and the ground staff had to hold down the covers with the help of rocks. Match officials finally called off play at 11 p.m. local time as it rained steadily. Prabhsimran made 83 off 49 balls and Priyansh blazed four sixes and eight boundaries in his 35-ball 69. The pair shared a 120-run stand off 72 balls. Priyansh reached his half-century off 27 balls, showing plenty of aggression against the pacers while carefully negotiating spinners Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy. Andre Russell broke the threatening stand with a slow off-cutter that deceived Priyansh, who miscued a pull shot to deep mid-wicket in the 12th over. Prabhsimran, who started slowly, accelerated when Priyansh was dismissed as Punjab motored to 160-1 in the 15th over before Vaibhav Arora struck in his return spell. Prabhsimran hit Aroras shin-high full toss but Russell grabbed a good running catch at long-on. Kolkata pulled Punjab back in the death overs and conceded only 40 runs in the last five overs. Both spinners gave away only 13 runs in two overs. Arora finished with 2-34. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/kolkata-punjab-ipl-42dad39ad3a096fdc3c9352c65661232,sports
How Wrexham surged from obscurity to within sight of the Premier League,"A dream of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney as they finalized their out-of-the-blue takeover of Wrexham in 2021 was to lead the long-suffering club to the Premier League. It seemed pie-in-the-sky thinking, but they are almost there. Make that three straight promotions for the Welsh team with a cult following after a 3-0 win over Charlton on Saturday secured a place in the second-tier Championship. Heres a look at the rise of Wrexham, once a down-on-its-luck, financially ravaged, fan-owned club that has been thrust into the limelight in remarkable fashion: It seemed like a joke. Did two Hollywood celebrities really want to buy a soccer club from a long-overlooked Welsh city of 45,000 people that was languishing in the fifth tier of the English game? Well, Reynolds  the star of the Deadpool movies  and McElhenney  an American actor, director and creator of TV show Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia  were deadly serious. After convincing supporters of their motives on a Zoom call by outlining their vision to make the team a global force, they went and bought Wrexham for $2.5 million. A remarkable journey began. The first task for Wrexham was getting out of the National League  the level below Englands four professional divisions and where the club had been residing since 2008. It didnt come easy. For the first full season under the celebrity owners, Wrexham hired a new manager  Phil Parkinson, who had good experience in the lower leagues  and was soon spending much more than its rivals, on players such as prolific striker Paul Mullin. Wrexham finished in second place in the National League, missing out on the one automatic promotion spot, and lost in the playoff semifinals to Grimsby. 
        
     That wasnt the end of the late-season heartache. Wrexham also lost in the final of the FA Trophy  a competition for non-league teams  at Wembley Stadium, in front of Reynolds and McElhenney. However, the following season and after a to-and-fro battle with Notts County, Wrexham got the job done and was promoted as fifth-tier champion with a record points total. The path to promotion was cleared by a 3-2 win over Notts County featuring a last-minute penalty save by Ben Foster, a former Manchester United goalkeeper who came out of retirement at age 40 on a short-term basis. I will never be the same again, a breathless Reynolds said  Welcome to Wrexham  the Emmy award-winning TV series created to chronicle the A-list owners first foray into soccer ownership  was up to Season 2 and would get the Hollywood ending the first season failed to deliver. How would Wrexham cope, then, back in the English Football League after a 15-year absence? Pretty well, it turned out. After a postseason trip to Las Vegas, the squad was enhanced by former Premier League players like Steven Fletcher, the attendance at the rocking Racecourse Ground was boosted to more than 12,000  with the promise of a higher capacity before too long  and more sponsors were brought in. Big ones, too, like United Airlines, Betty Buzz and Aviation American Gin. Parkinson delivered again as Wrexham took League Two by storm, achieving promotion at the first attempt. A 6-0 win over Forest Green ensured Wrexham was going up  and another pitch invasion by jubilant fans  as the team finished the season in second place behind Stockport County. For the first time in its 159-year history, Wrexham earned promotion in two consecutive seasons. Optimism and aspiration was suddenly rife, on and off the field, in a much-changed city that quickly became something of a tourist destination. The team earned record turnover, and was valued at nine million pounds ($11.8 million) by a board member ahead of the start of a first season in the third-tier League One in nearly two decades. Itll be much more than that now. Wrexham didnt even need Mullin, its top scorer for the previous three seasons, to launch an unlikely promotion challenge that never really wavered and captured growing attention on both sides of the Atlantic. Boosted by the midseason signings of some strikers, including Sam Smith, Wrexham held off Wycombe to secure a second-place finish behind Birmingham and a return to the second tier for the first time since 1982. Reynolds was there for the clinching victory over Charlton on Saturday, pulling pints ahead of the game in The Turf pub thats connected to the ground and then celebrating wildly after the final whistle. Maybe the Premier League. First of all, however, comes the not-so-easy task of overcoming a bunch of big-name clubs in the Championship, many of whom have recently been in the top flight  like Ipswich, Southampton, Leicester, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich. Theres also Birmingham, which counts NFL great Tom Brady as a minority owner. Wrexham executive Humphrey Ker has already acknowledged the club might have to quadruple its current wage bill  a reported 11 million pounds ($14.65 million)  to survive a grueling league. Ker seems sure Reynolds and McElhenney will dig into their pockets once again, no doubt fueled by the ongoing success of Welcome to Wrexham. The renovation of Wrexhams once-imposing Kop stand should also be finished by the end of next season, in time for the Racecourse to potentially host qualifying matches for international tournaments for Wales mens national team. Expect the caliber of players turning out at the stadium to improve, too.

Crystal Palace reaches FA Cup final for the third time after dismantling Aston Villa,"LONDON (AP)  Crystal Palace is getting another shot at winning the FA Cup  and wont have to meet Manchester United in the final this time. Palace beat Aston Villa 3-0 at Wembley Stadium on Saturday to advance to the May 17 title match back at the home of English soccer. It will be the south London clubs third appearance in the final, after 1990 and 2016. On both occasions, Palace was beaten by Man United. Eberechi Eze smashed home a shot from the edge of the area in the 31st minute for the opening goal after good work from Ismaila Sa, who finished Villa off with two second-half goals. Sa scored in the 58th and again in the fourth minute of stoppage time to seal a convincing win over an opponent that reached the Champions League quarterfinals this season. Villa  a seven-time FA Cup winner  was eliminated from Europe by Paris Saint-Germain last week and has just a top-five finish in the Premier League to play for as it looks to secure a return to the Champions League. Villa is in seventh place in the league. It could have been a bigger margin of victory for Palace, with Jean-Philippe Mateta missing a penalty in the 53rd. Palace, which has never won a major trophy, will meet Manchester City or Nottingham Forest in the final. They meet on Sunday, also at Wembley. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/aston-villa-crystal-palace-fa-cup-semifinals-508ed6429c07e05ae0ea00d0245c3408,sports
"Palou, Pato, Newgarden and Fox: IndyCar starts season with big stars, big hopes and new TV partner","Fox Sports marked its new oversight of the IndyCar Series with glossy new commercials that have been showcased everywhere from the Super Bowl to the Daytona 500. The network partnership begins in earnest this weekend with the season-opening race on the streets of downtown St. Petersburg, Florida. There is hope that Fox Sports will push IndyCar back toward the top of motorsports.  How Fox might be able to boost the Roger Penske-owned series has been on overwhelming theme of the offseason, overshadowing Alex Palous bid for a third consecutive IndyCar championship, Josef Newgardens quest for a third consecutive win in the Indianapolis 500, a change at the top of series, a new team and a revolving cast of drivers. I love what Fox has done with the series and it does feel like theres a different level of excitement  it is the best racing across many of the series and thats the story that needs to be told, said Dan Towriss, the new majority owner of Andretti Global. Fox has done their part in that and brought in a lot of momentum. Its probably premature to say IndyCar is back but Im really hoping IndyCar is back and really catches the wave of motorsports excitement thats developing in the U.S. 
        
     Fox Sports acquired IndyCars broadcast rights last June after the series spent 16 seasons with NBC Sports. Fox promised all 17 races would receive network broadcasts  as well as the two days of qualifying for the Indy 500  throughout the multiyear deal, the exact length of which has not been disclosed. Fox Sports has also promised all races will be on Fox and the Fox Sports app, while Fox Deportes will carry Spanish-language coverage. All practice and qualifying sessions will be aired on either FS1 or FS2. Nineteen races on a network will be an IndyCar record and it is the only top motorsports series in the country with all its races set for that kind of exposure. NASCARs schedule, for example, is spread across multiple networks in 2025; Fox has said five of its 14 NASCAR races will be on its network, the rest on cable. I think what Fox and IndyCar are doing is freaking phenomenal, said McLaren driver Pato OWard, who along with Newgarden and Palou are the three featured drivers in Fox Sports marketing campaign of commercials he called fun and edgy. His commercial aired early during the Super Bowl.  Its flirting with that line where people do get engaged and youre like, Hey, this is different, OWard added. It felt like I was doing a movie shoot. The marketing of IndyCar has long been a paddock-wide sore spot for drivers and team owners, who say a lack of series spending is a major factor in slow growth. That is where Eric Shanks, the CEO and executive producer for Fox Sports, can help most. Shanks is an Indiana native and with that comes an automatic affinity for the Indianapolis 500 and Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He promised that the Indy 500 will be the networks biggest event of the year, a large order considering Fox Sports has the Super Bowl, the Daytona 500 and the World Series.  In the list of things that we can do to improve IndyCar, number one was finding the right broadcast partner, and to have FOX on board is fantastic. Eric Shanks has a personal commitment to and passion for IndyCar, and I think that will come through in the broadcast quality, McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown wrote to fans this week. Theyre focused on learning about the history and future of IndyCar and what works best, intent on evolving their broadcast through the season. Continuous improvement, I love that. This year will be the first full season for IndyCars new hybrid engine, which was introduced midway through last season. The cost of the transition  along with a new car in development for 2027  has ruffled ownership. Tensions over the two projects may have played a role in the dismissal of IndyCar President Jay Frye, who was replaced by speedway President Doug Boles weeks before the season opener. Many believe Frye was fighting hard to help the teams reduce spending, while others grumbled that the installation of Boles has made IndyCar The Penske Series since the bulk of the executive leadership team consists of Penske loyalists.  Penske, who turned 88 last week, has tried to maintain a separation from his three-car team and ownership of the series; when Will Power was in the thick of last years title chase, he stopped discussing IndyCar issues with media. Team Penske also was embroiled in a cheating scandal when it was discovered that Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin illegally used their push-to-pass system in finishing first and third in last years opener at St. Pete. Palou has dominated the series since his move to Chip Ganassi Racing in 2021. The Spaniard has won 11 races and three of the last four championships, the last two while locked into a $30 million lawsuit with McLaren over a breach of contract claim. The two sides met for mediation last month with another session set for October. McLaren has a new lineup as OWard has two new teammates in Christian Lundgaard and Nolan Siegel, but most of its title hopes are tied to OWard, the wildly popular Mexican driver who is also McLarens reserve driver in F1. OWard was in tears after finishing second to Newgarden in last years Indy 500, and has made winning that race and the series title his 2025 priorities.  Newgarden is seeking a third consecutive Indy 500 victory, a feat that has never been done. He led a combined 22 laps in his two victories, which is far from the dominance needed to continue the streak.  We have figured out how to win the race twice so far. I like our process, Newgarden said. Well see if it keeps working. If it doesnt, well change the formula. But I think weve got a good process. Power, his Penske teammate, is in a contract year and has hired Fernando Alonsos management group to represent him in negotiations. It is the first time Power, a two-time series champion and Indy 500 winner, has used an agent. NASCAR star Kyle Larson plans to run in the Indy 500 again, though he has made clear his stock car team and the Coca-Cola 600 that same day are his priority. All eyes will be on Andretti driver Colton Herta, who is among the candidates for the new Cadillac Formula 1 team that is set to debut in 2026. Herta, who finished second to Palou in last years standings, believes landing that job will require him to win the Indy 500 and the championship. And new to the IndyCar grid this year is Prema Racing, an Italian team that competes in F1s lower levels. Prema will debut with Callum Ilott, who has bounced in and out of IndyCar the last four years, and rookie Robert Schwartzman, who won the F2 and F3 titles for Prema.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/indycar-2025-preview-fda3a1ee76ded65a45feb60f8b7e81bd,sports
NASCAR stars enjoy immersive Mexico City visit ahead of first international Cup Series race,"MEXICO CITY (AP)  Daniel Suarez led a quartet of NASCAR stars through the streets of Mexico City, after midnight, in search of a nightcap following a full day of showcasing his native country to his fellow competitors.  NASCAR will hold its first points-paying international Cup Series race in modern history in June when it competes at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodrguez, one of the most popular stops on the Formula 1 calendar. It will be the first time since 1958 and only the third time in 77 years that NASCARs top series will run an event that counts in the championship outside of the United States. When the announcement was made last August it was met with excitement over a new venue in a new country. But as the 2025 season has started, rumors have floated through the industry that the race may not even happen, questions about security and safety have been asked, and many weekly attendees have declared they wont be going to Mexico City.  NASCAR hasnt waffled once on this venture  it has a two-year contract with promoter OCESA, which also hosts the F1 race and other large-scale entertainment events across the country  and made a two-day tour this week through the city to promote Thursdays opening of ticket sales. The opening price for a three-day general admission ticket is about $50.  What this weeks visit did for NASCAR was give four of its top drivers a chance to experience the culture of Mexico City, witness the first-class promotional efforts of OCESA and see firsthand the excitement locals have for the top motorsports series in the United States.  
        
     Suarez was joined by former series champions Ryan Blaney and Chase Elliott, as well as Christopher Bell, last weekends race winner. The group had an immersive experience that included a track walk, taco tasting, a night at Lucha Libre wrestling  where Blaney and Suarez both tried some moves in the ring  and a Wednesday news conference that drew hundreds. I dont think many people actually realize how special this is for me because its not every day that I get to show these guys my home, my culture, Suarez told The Associated Press. Everyone has an idea  theyve been to Cancun or somewhere like that. But to come to Mexico City and to take them to very authentic places and see the city, its just been amazing to show them what they are going to experience in June. For OCESA, this weeks visit was a feeler for the market demand for NASCAR, which ran in Mexico City with the second-tier Xfinity Series from 2005 to 2008. Tickets for this years F1 race sold out in one day, but OCESA is in a contract year with Formula One Management and is juggling both F1 extension negotiations and the relaunch of NASCAR.  Those two pressing matters have put talks with IndyCar for a 2026 event on pause as the promoters wait to see if Mexico City has an appetite and ability to afford multiple racing series.  But for NASCAR, this weeks visit was a chance for its drivers to spread a positive message when they return to the garage this weekend at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. A large contingent of the OCESA staff is traveling to COTA to learn the routines of a Cup race weekend.  This visit is almost like how NASCAR is as a sport  we always tell people that Hey, once you go to a race, youre going to fall in love with it, said chief operating officer Steve ODonnell. Thats been my experience in Mexico City and I think youre seeing the same with the drivers who came down here. Seeing them smile, relax, have some fun, learn some new things  Im hopeful theyll return with some positive messaging. Blaney, who vowed to learn Spanish before he returns in June, said he loved every minute of the trip and anyone in the industry who is nervous about attending the race is overthinking things.  I was never one of the ones who was sketched out about coming to Mexico City, Blaney said. Theres nothing to worry about. The place is beautiful, the people are amazing and weve had no issues. Elliott, NASCARs most popular driver and the most reserved of the quartet in Mexico City, said he wont hesitate encouraging fans to come to the race.  Theres been nothing about my experience over the last two days that raises any level of concern of how were going to be accepted, if theres a lack of excitement, or if there are safety issues, he said.

Lewis Hamilton is enjoying his new Ferrari as Carlos Sainz goes fastest in testing,"SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP)  Lewis Hamilton said hes really enjoying driving his new Ferrari after he was narrowly beaten in Formula 1 testing results on Thursday by the driver he replaced at Ferrari, Carlos Sainz, Jr. Hamiltons time from the morning session was the fastest for much of the day until new Williams driver Sainz beat it by .031 of a second. Hamiltons Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc was third fastest, .083 off the pace, with a much larger gap to Mercedes George Russell in fourth, 0.43 off Sainzs time. Hamilton and Sainz were over a second faster than the best lap from the first day of testing Wednesday, which was set by Lando Norris for McLaren. I am really enjoying the car. Were slowly bonding, I think, Hamilton said in televised comments. Today was a bit more of getting to explore my interaction with my engineer, but so far I really enjoy driving this car. Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur said he was satisfied with the teams work in testing. So far so good, but the first topic is reliability. Its always a question at the start of the season, and it went well, Vasseur said part-way through Thursday. He added its harder to tell a cars true performance because it isnt clear how much fuel competitors have in their cars for test runs. Adding to the unseasonably cold conditions, the rare sight of light rain in Bahrain was an extra complication for teams trying to learn more about their new cars. 
        
     Expecting dry conditions in the desert, only two teams  Aston Martin and Haas  brought wet-weather tires for the test. There is a third and final day of testing on Friday. The first race of the season is the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 16. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-testing-bahrain-4302e23ece2c58be3421c209052541c2,sports
Verstappen and Norris respect each other while joking about their F1 rivalry,"SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP)  Max Verstappen and Lando Norris dismissed suggestions their Formula 1 rivalry has become a personal feud, going so far as to joke on Thursday that theyd been reduced to brawling in a pub. Norris was Verstappens closest challenger last season as the Dutch driver won a fourth consecutive F1 title. Hard-edged and controversial battles on track sparked debate about whether F1 rules do enough to deter aggressive or risky driving.  Its a terrible relationship. We dont get on anymore. Its taken its toll, deadpanned Verstappen as Norris chuckled next to him in a news conference on the second day of preseason testing. We had a fight the other day in a local pub, Norris chimed in. We had to get escorted (out), Verstappen added. I always say, You should have seen the other guy, but actually he still looks good. Norris said this month hed learned from the experience of challenging Verstappen last year, and indicated hed have an elbows out approach when racing Verstappen in future.  I know there are going to be tough battles and Im sure some of them are not always going to end the way I want or hopefully Max wants but were racing drivers. We get along, Norris said on Thursday. I know everyone tries to make their own points and say whats correct and whats not correct, but we respect each other a lot and we look forward to more racing on track. Norris strong form in the second half of 2024 means hes considered a strong candidate to dethrone Verstappen this year, and he was fastest on the first day of preseason testing in Bahrain on Wednesday. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/verstappen-norris-f1-f27996e9baf36feb889fd2c34ba699c8,sports
Charley Hull sets the pace in Arizona with 63 to lead LPGAs Ford Championship,"CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP)  Charley Hull ended her long and active day without any blood seeping through her sock, only a bogey-free card of 9-under 63 that gave her a one-shot lead over Nanna Koertz Madsen in the opening round Thursday at the Ford Championship. Nelly Korda, returning to work after skipping the Asia swing, rallied with four birdies on the back nine and opened with a 67 in her bid to catch up to Hull, who has been as entertaining as ever. Key to Hulls round at Whirlwind Golf Club was her driver, and she wasnt even sure what to expect. She tweaked the club early in the week and had a TaylorMade official work on it. And I really, really, really hit it well today, Hull said. I felt like that put me in a lot of good positions. I putted pretty well. I chipped pretty well. I hit it pretty well with my iron shots. She was playing so well that Hull thought more about the four birdie putts that she narrowly missed instead of the nine that she made, including one stretch of five birdies in six holes around the turn. Koertz Madsen also had nine birdies, offset by one bogey on the par-5 fifth. One of her birdies was a bonus, a bunker shot on the 10th hole that she felt would have gone 8 feet by the hole except that it hit the pin and dropped for a surprise birdie. Brooke Henderson of Canada and Sei Young Kim were among eight players at 65 on a day of low scoring. The key was getting the ball in the fairway to handle firm greens. 
        
     Hull had quite the day. She awoke at 2 a.m. to call her family in England, and then headed to the gym at 4 a.m. and ran seven kilometers (4.4 miles) on the treadmill. She is big on fitness these days. Her biggest goal that she has set for 2025 has nothing to do with golf, rather her bid to run a 5K in under 20 minutes. She went so hard at it earlier in the week that Hull noticed blood from her toe oozing through her sock. She also made a $10,000 bet with fellow pro Ryan Evans that she will quit smoking. All seems to be going well, especially on the golf course. She was rarely out of position and was putting for birdie or better on every hole. And she thinks it could have been better. I feel like I left actually a good four shots out there, he said. Like, the last I lipped on the left edge. The hole before I left it like an inch short. Went in the jaws on a few holes before and it just stayed out. Then I missed birdie putt on the front nine, and that was like from like 6 feet. So Im looking back thinking, Oh, I could have done more. At one point on her second nine, she started thinking about a 59. And then she missed the putt. I was just trying to go as low as I could, she said. To be fair, my boyfriend said to me, What will make me happy is seeing you on the top of the leaderboard and just smash it. Thats what I had in my head. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/charley-hull-lpga-tour-ford-championship-nelly-korda-0f71cfb49619c9b40e2fcd8da7eb04f1,sports
Scottie Scheffler 2 back of a 4-way tie for the lead at Houston Open. Rory McIlroy 5 behind,"HOUSTON (AP)  Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy wanted a final tune-up before the Masters and spent parts of the Thursday at the Houston Open under an umbrella in wind and rain that prevented anyone from getting too far away. Keith Mitchell made a late eagle and Ryan Gerard let a good start slip away by finishing with two bogeys. They both wound up at 5-under 65, tied for the lead with Alejandro Tosti and Taylor Pendrith when play was suspended by darkness. Scheffler didnt dazzle. He just didnt do much wrong, one of his best attributes. The worlds No. 1 player played bogey-free and made a pair of long birdies on the back nine that added to a 67, leaving him two shots behind. Conditions were pretty tough out there today with the rain and the wind, so overall nice to keep a clean card, Scheffler said. McIlroy, coming off his second victory of the year at The Players Championship two weeks ago, played in the morning and that was no picnic. The rain was steady as he stood on the 10th tee and it eventually stopped long enough for him to enjoy the end of his round. He had two birdies (both on par 5s), two bogeys and 14 pars for a 70 that he described as a little pedestrian. Couldnt really find the middle of the club face for the first few holes, McIlroy said. Once it brightened up and as the conditions got a little better, I felt like I drove it pretty well. 
        
     Tosti contended late in the Houston Open last year. He also played bogey-free, and he made birdie on all three of the par 5s at Memorial Park. Mitchell got his mistakes out of the way early  two bogeys in four holes, and finished strong. Pendrith had the lead to himself until he found a bunker left of the green on the 18th and missed a 10-foot par putt. Jackson Suber was poised to join the group at 65 until a four-putt double bogey on the 18th. The first putt was 70 feet. The last three putts were from 5 feet. And then there was Gerard, who was motoring along at 7 under with two holes to play, starting with the par-5 eighth. But his tee shot was so far right he had to take a penalty drop, and his wedge from 124 yards went 50 feet long. He managed to two-putt for a bogey. On the par-3 ninth, he went into a back lip of the bunker and had to play away from the flag because of water on the other side, leading to another bogey. The 65 was a solid start. The finish stung. Id be lying to you if I wasnt a little bit upset, Gerard said. But you kind of just got to take a step back. If they said after the morning wave youd be T-1, everyone in the field would sign up for that starting their round, especially when it was rainy and kind of windy and off and on from different directions. The grind was real out there. And it was wet for so much of the day, leading to preferred lies from the short grass. The issue for Gerard was staying dry.  Im weird  I dont like holding the umbrella because I feel like my arms get fatigued and I stand over a shot and I feel like I hit it weird, he said. So I wear the rain jacket and try and not get the grips wet. If I can do that and just pick quality targets and try and just make solid swings to the targets, whatever happens from there is kind of up to the skid or the rain or the water droplets or whatever it could be. Suber wound up with eight players at 66, a group that included Rasmus Hojgaard, who at one point was tied for the lead until a double bogey. He played in the same group as his Danish twin, Nicolai Hojgaard, who had a 69. Michael Kim and Ben Griffin opened with a 70. Both are just outside the top 50 in the world and are trying to move inside that number to get into the Masters. The cutoff for the top 50 is after the Houston Open. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/houston-open-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy-ryan-gerad-4e00a2b3c5de6a03b87cccc2c761b5e7,sports
Scottie Scheffler ties record with 62 for the lead in the Houston Open,"HOUSTON (AP)  Scottie Scheffler opened with two straight birdies and was on his way Friday in the Houston Open, tying the Memorial Park record with an 8-under 62 for a one-shot lead when the second round was halted by darkness after a two-hour storm delay Friday. It was the most complete round of the year for Scheffler, who missed the first month of the season recovering from a glass puncture in his right palm that required minor surgery. The only green he missed was on No. 2  his 11th of the round  and he holed that from just inside 30 feet for birdie. Yesterday I felt like I made a couple key par saves, and today I felt like for the most part I kept the golf course in front of me and I had a lot of looks for birdie, Scheffler said. So I didnt feel like I was struggling for par too much, and that was mostly because I was in the fairway. Scheffler also shot 62 in 2021 at Memorial Park. He shares the course record with Tony Finau, who shot 62 in 2022 and 2024. It was the eighth time Scheffler shot 62 or lower  one of those was a 59 in the FedEx Cup playoffs at TPC Boston in 2020  and his first since he shot 62 in the final round at Le Golf National to win the Olympic gold medal at the 2024 Paris Games. Scheffler was at 11-under 129. He led by one shot over Taylor Pendrith of Canada, who shot a 65. Nico Echavarria also was one shot behind until he hit his tee shot into the water on the 17th hole. Echavarria faced a par chip from 45 feet when play resumed Saturday morning. 
        
     Rory McIlroy was 11 shots behind when he stood on the tee for his afternoon start. After returned from the storm, his first concern was making the cut. But McIlroy ran off three straight birdies late in his round and managed to finish out for a 66. He was seven back. Its the sort of golf course where its easy to just make a ton of pars, not a lot of trouble out there, but you just need some putts to go in to make birdies, McIlroy said.  Ryan Gerard had the best chance at catching Scheffler. He was at 9-under par and still had seven holes to finish in the second round due to the storms. Scheffler and the early starters managed to avoid bad weather. It was a lot different than we thought it was going to be, Scheffler said. Today looked like  checking the forecast this morning  it was going to be one of those days where were going to be playing on and off, looking at a few delays out there. Instead, he was on from the start with a 10-foot birdie putt on the 10th hole and a 25-footer on the 11th. Scheffler played bogey-free for the second straight round. Pendrith had three birdies on his last five holes to pull within one shot of Scheffler. Kind of hung around all day and was able to make a few late ones, Pendrith said. The group at 7-under 133 included Gary Woodland, still regaining his form after returning last year from brain surgery. He had a stretch on his second nine of six birdies in seven holes, the exception on the par-5 third hole when he missed a 5-foot birdie. I needed that. I havent had a run like that, Woodland said. Ive been knocking on the door for a little while and its nice to see some results. My coach Randys been telling me I have all the tools and its coming, Ive just got to stay patient. That would be Randy Smith, who also is the longtime coach for Scheffler. Scheffler felt his iron play wasnt quite as sharp as he wanted. He also knew he had a good feel on the greens and didnt have to attack pins if there was no need. It led to a stress-free round, just the kind he likes. Throw in eight birdies, and Scheffler figures to be in the pole position going into the weekend of his final start before the Masters. Michael Kim did his part to make it to Augusta National. He is No. 52 in the world ranking  the top 50 after this week get Masters invitations  and shot 65. Also just outside the top 50 is Ben Griffin, who played late and was 6 under through nine holes. he sputtered on the bad nine, missing a 3-foot par putt on his last hole to settle for a 67. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/scottie-scheffler-houston-open-mcilroy-pendrith-5d554d05f8fdfb29ccee29ec84396207,sports
Diana Taurasi still mulling over decision to retire or play another year,"Diana Taurasi is still mulling over her decision whether to play another season in the WNBA or retire. The 20-year veteran and future Hall of Famer told The Associated Press on Tuesday that shes going to take her time on deciding what she wants to do. I dont take retirement lightly. I know the minute I say it or announce it, whether its, you know, in a month or two months, Im going to mean it, Taurasi said. I talk to (wife) Penny (Taylor) and the Mercury, so Im still in the thought process. Taurasis season ended when the Mercury were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Minnesota Lynx. She hasnt spoken since the loss. I have not taken it lightly. I think about it every day. You know, Im still in deep thought about it. I want to make the right decision., you know, and Im just taking my time a little bit, the 42-year-old Taurasi said. And, you know, sometimes when the season ends, the last thing you want to think about is the next season. Taurasi likes the moves the team made last offseason adding Natasha Cloud and Kahleah Copper which she said made the team into a potential championship contender.  Add to that the opening of the $100 million training center that the Mercury use now which has Taurasis name and logo on the courts. I do think with the additions (on court) we made and in the front office well be there for a long time, she said. You know those are my sisters. Ive gone through a lot with them. So, you know, Ill chat with them. Its a lot to process the season as a whole. 
        
     Taurasi has been speaking out lately about her battle with the skin condition eczema that shes been affected by. Shes been dealing with it since her days at UConn, where she helped the school win three NCAA championships. Taurasi began having outbreaks of red, itchy, scaly skin, which made her feel uncomfortable on and off the court. Ive had to deal with for, you know, most of my life. And, you know, Ive shared my story and you know how enduring it is, the WNBAs all-time leading scorer said.  Especially when you play sports. And, you know, obviously in basketball, youre always in a jersey and youre exposed. And not only that, the physical part of it. And you know how itchy and red, the discomfort you feel. These are all things that I internally battled with for, for a long time. Taurasi has been taking Dupixent after working with her dermatologist. An estimated 2.7 million people in the US ages 6 months and older have uncontrolled moderate-to-severe eczema. When she does decide to retire, whether its this year or sometime soon, Taurasi is intrigued with the idea of getting involved with ownership of a team. I definitely love the idea of being able to have a position where obviously you influence a team, she said. But more than that, just being around (owner) Mat (Ishbia) for a little bit, just seeing how hes influenced this whole city and change the energy of what an owner can do to really the outlook of a city, the feeling of a city. The things to which hes done with the team, its really the next step, I think, for female athletes. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/diana-taurasi-wnba-mercury-9aa8bd4bc1ae4b5b5c1f5eab61fd5471,sports
Lilia Vu has another bogey-free day and leads a pack of LPGA stars in Arizona,"CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP)  Lilia Vu didnt feel her best on the range. She made up for that on the golf course Friday with an 8-under 64, giving her a two-shot lead over a group that includes Nelly Korda and Jeeno Thitikul in a Ford Championship packed with LPGA stars. Korda and Thitikul, the Nos. 1 and 2 players in the womens world ranking, were grouped together in the morning and put on quite a show at Whirlwind Golf Club. Thitikul had a birdie-birdie-eagle-birdie start and was 6 under through six holes. She shot 29 on her opening nine, with Korda at 31. Thitikul wound up with a 64, Korda with a 65.  It was like a great tempo. We kept our rhythm really nicely, Korda said. When everyone is playing nicely, you kind of feed off each other as well. The Ford Championship is the first domestic LPGA event since the Asia swing (Korda skipped it for the second straight year), and the field was as strong as it gets this side of a major, with everyone from the top 10 in the world and 19 out of 20. Vu, a double major winner in 2023 who struggled with a back injury last year, was feeling stress on the range and said her caddie settled her down. He told her to pick a target, and thats about as simple as Vu made it look. She goes into the weekend at 14-under 130 without having made a bogey yet. Just focused on the shot in front of me and getting from point A to point B, Vu said. That really kind of helped me. Somehow just happened to play well. Felt like everything was grooving in the right spot. 
        
     Charley Hull, who led after the first day with a 63, struggled to get going as a light wind picked up in otherwise comfortable weather for Arizona. She was even par through six holes  that meant losing ground on this day  and rallied for a 69. But she made only one birdie on the four par 5s and joined Korda, Thitikul and Nanna Koertz Madsen at 12-under 132. I hit some really good chips out there and even some good saves and played solid. Just looking forward to the weekend now, Hull said. The cut was at 4-under 140, good scoring for a course that still features firm, bouncy greens that can make it difficult to get easy looks at birdie. Thitikul and Vu relied on plenty of medium-length birdie putts. Lydia Ko was one shot above the cut line when the Olympic gold medalist finished birdie-eagle-birdie to get with five shots of the lead going into the weekend. Just with how firm the course is, I was kind of scratching my head on the 11th thinking, Why does it feel like I had a poor ball-striking day? I didnt, but just with how firm the greens are sometimes its really hard to get really close to the pins. Ive just got to keep my head high and hit one shot at a time, she said. I think thats what led to the good finish today. Brooke Henderson, who opened with a 65 and was two shots out of the lead, ballooned to a 75 and made the cut on the number.  ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/lilia-vu-nelly-korda-jeeno-thitikul-charley-hull-lpga-2a7859648d62b186d4b45c38ccae6d2b,sports
Washington Mystics part ways with coach Eric Thibault and GM Mike Thibault,"The Washington Mystics are parting ways with coach Eric Thibault and general manager Mike Thibault, the franchise announced Wednesday. Eric Thibault is the fifth WNBA coach to be let go this offseason, joining Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles. He took over for his father after the 2022 season. The younger Thibault spent 10 years as an assistant coach with the Mystics, including four as associate head coach. The Mystics finished this season 14-26, just missing the playoffs. Washington started the year with 12 straight losses and dealt with injuries to Shakira Austin and Brittney Sykes. The team also underwent major changes this offseason with Elena Delle Donne sitting out and Natasha Cloud leaving for Phoenix. After extensive reflection and conversation, we have decided we are at a point in our competitive and evolutionary cycle to turn the team over to new leadership with a renewed vision to carve our path into the future of WNBA basketball, Monumental Monumental Basketball President Michael Winger said. Coach Mike elevated the Mystics program to its proud status as a league leader in innovation, the standard bearer in player care, and a model franchise. Mike Thibault came to the franchise in 2012 as both the GM and coach, leading the team to its first title in 2019. The Mystics made eight postseason appearances and he earned the leagues WNBA Coach of the Year award in 2013. He has the most wins in WNBA history with 379. He built and coached the championship team, developed high performing players, and pioneered many of the processes teams use today in building rosters and organizations. His fingerprints are all over this franchise and will be for years to come, Winger said. We are grateful for Mikes commitment, passion, and leadership and wish him well. Coach Eric is a skilled coach and equally talented motivator. Our players are fortunate to have played for Eric these past two seasons, as will many other players in this league for decades ahead. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/mystics-thibault-coaching-change-c02f99cdd4fa2ccbb34f395f53781d44,sports
"WNBA outlook is promising after record-setting year, although the league has a few challenges ahead","NEW YORK (AP)  The WNBA looks promising heading into the offseason after a banner year with record ratings, attendance and a first-time champion in New York. Soon after the confetti stopped falling on the sellout crowd at Barclays Center following Game 5 of the WNBA Finals, the league and its players turned their attention to 2025. Less than 24 hours after Sunday nights game and days before the Libertys championship parade on Thursday, the players union opted out of the current collective bargaining agreement. The decision was expected with a new 11-year media rights deal worth approximately $200 million per year beginning in 2026. The players are looking for a bigger share of the revenue pie among other things, including pensions and higher salaries. The current CBA will still be in effect throughout next season, but both sides would like to get a deal done sooner rather than later. Negotiations are always intense, but those associated with the WNBA have much to be excited about.  The league is expanding and will increase the number of regular season games to 44. The WNBA will hold an expansion draft for Golden State in December. The Valkyries will be the leagues 13th franchise. The league will add franchises in Toronto and Portland in 2026, with at least one other team starting in either 2027 or 2028. Although the WNBA could lose one of its iconic stars if Diana Taurasi announces her retirement, league officials are looking forward to another highly anticipated draft. The draft lottery is next month. It will determine who gets the first pick and potentially Paige Bueckers, who 21 years after Taurasi could become the next UConn guard to be selected No. 1.  
        
     Many of the leagues top players will remain in the U.S. this winter and play in January in Unrivaled  the 3-on-3 league started by WNBA Finals standouts Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier. The Stewart and Collier championship showdown led to strong ratings, with all five games having more than a million TV viewers. The decisive Game 5 drew an average of 2.2 million viewers, peaking at 3.3 million, which made it the most-watched WNBA game in 25 years. The league as a whole had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and best attendance in 22 seasons. During the 40-game regular season, 22 telecasts topped at least a million viewers on a host of networks.  The leagues rookie class, led by Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, was a big part of that success  and all should come back stronger and better next year. When Caitlin Clark announced she was going to enter the draft, I remember ... the wave of enthusiasm that came from a player that wasnt even going to play for the Lynx, Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve said. So there was a lot of excitement and momentum for the WNBA. But to see it actually translate business-wise across the league, whatever the reasons were. Theres one really big reason and a lot of other little reasons why. And I think the movement that were in now is exciting. Not everything has been positive around the leagues growth. Nearly half of the WNBA franchises have fired coaches in the past month. Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Washington are all looking for new leaders on the sidelines. All of the coaches who were let go had three years or less with their teams. Off the court, players say they were targets of increasing online racial and homophobic threats, including one to Stewart and her wife during the WNBA Finals.  Commissioner Cathy Engelbert addressed the rising number of abusive comments players have dealt with on social media at her state of the league address before the start of the WNBA Finals. She said the league will work with the players union to figure out what they can do together to combat it. The online abuse and the CBA are two of the offseason issues the WNBA and its players must address, but they have arguably the strongest foundation since the leagues launch to build on. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-cba-caitlin-clark-eabe7a584a95de91df017a1123988ae6,sports
New York Liberty basketball team honored with ticker-tape parade in Canyon of Heroes,"NEW YORK (AP)  Jonquel Jones, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and their New York teammates were showered with confetti as the Liberty celebrated winning the WNBA title in the Canyon of Heroes in downtown Manhattan.  New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams joined the thousands who lined the streets on Thursday.  The Liberty won the franchises first championship, defeating the Minnesota Lynx in overtime in a decisive Game 5 of the WNBA Finals on Sunday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.  (To) see how many people were in the crowd, smiling, celebrating the Liberty, Ionescu said, it really puts into perspective what it means to bring a championship to this city and how it really takes everyone. Veteran Liberty players from the early teams, including Teresa Weatherspoon, Vickie Johnson, Kym Hampton and Crystal Robinson, along with current coach Sandy Brondello. attended the parade and ceremony afterward at City Hall. The Liberty even brought out former mascot Maddie. The parade route was full of fans of all ages, with many of the kids wearing jerseys of their favorite players. Jones carried her Finals MVP trophy atop her float, while Stewart and Ionescu went into the crowd, giving high-fives and taking selfies with fans. The Liberty also had a celebration at Barclays Center on Thursday night to cap off the festivities, highlighted by a performance from the teams incredibly popular mascot, Ellie the Elephant, with rapper Lil Mama.  
        
     There have been over 200 ticker-tape and confetti parades in New York. The most recent to honor a womens sports team came in 2019 when the U.S. soccer team won the World Cup. Two years later, there was a parade to honor essential workers and first responders for their service during the coronavirus pandemic.

Swiatek and Sabalenka power into Madrid quarterfinals a day after blackout. Top seed Zverev loses,"MADRID (AP)  Power was restored at the Caja Magica tennis complex Tuesday and the Madrid Open resumed with a packed schedule that included second-ranked Iga Swiatek advancing to the quarterfinals after a more relaxed day because of the blackout. Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka made into the last eight by defeating Peyton Stearns in straight sets, while on the mens side, top-seeded Alexander Zverev was upset by 21st-ranked Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina.  Following the major blackout that prompted 22 matches to be postponed on Monday, Swiatek returned to the center court and defeated Diana Shnaider 6-0, 6-7 (3), 6-4 to stay on track to defend her title in the Spanish capital. I liked yesterday. I think the whole world was just more relaxed, kind of, obviously the people who didnt lose because of this, she said. I enjoyed the time off, and I tried to just recover, because we need to savor these free days, for sure. Swiatek said she took away food from the tournament site and relaxed at the hotel until the power came back on. I just chilled and used that time to not think about what I should do, she said. There was no signal, so basically no one used their phones. It was nice, I liked it. Most parts of Madrid regained power overnight, but the Caja Magica was still without electricity early Tuesday, causing a delay in the opening of the gates for fans. The power came back quickly, though, and organizers did not have to alter the days schedule of matches, although there was the possibility of the night session being delayed because of the high number of matches during the day. Swiatek cruised in the first set but had to save 11 of 13 break points to seal a hard-fought victory against the 13th-seeded Shnaider. Swiatek has not lost before the quarterfinals in seven tournaments this season but hasnt gone past the semifinals since Roland Garros last year. She will next face Madison Keys, who defeated Donna Vekic 6-2, 6-3. It will be Swiateks first meeting with Keys since she lost despite having match point in the semifinals of the Australian Open that was won by Keys. We played last year here, but I think it was a night session or something, Swiatek said. I dont know, I think it was like colder or a little bit different, so for sure well watch that match. Sabalenka defeated 44th-ranked Stearns 6-2, 6-4 to advance to the Madrid quarterfinals for the fourth time in five years. It was the WTA Tour-leading 28th win this season for the two-time Madrid champion. She was tied with Jessica Pegula with 27. Sabalenka lost last years final to Swiatek. Cerundolo defeated the second-ranked Zverev 7-5, 6-3 to continue his quick rise in the rankings. Cerundolo, who also defeated Zverez last year in Madrid, broke serve once in each set and saved the only break opportunity he conceded at center court.  who also defeated Zverev last year in Madrid. Zverev was coming off the title in Munich and will move on to defend his title in Rome. He played better than me today, Zverev said. He definitely played better than me last year when we played here. But to be honest, I didnt play terrible, he just played better than me. In the mens side, 31st-ranked Matteo Berrettini withdrew with an abdominal injury after losing the first set 7-6 (2) to sixth-ranked Jack Draper. Sixth-seeded Alex de Minaur tied Carlos Alcaraz with a tour-leading 24th win this season by getting past Denis Shapovalov 6-3, 7-6 (3). The seventh-ranked De Minaur will next face Lorenzo Musetti, who beat 2019 runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 7-6 (3). Americans Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe both won their matches. The 11th-seeded Paul defeated Karen Khachanov 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, while the 16th-seeded Tiafoe beat Alexandre Muller 6-3, 6-3.  Paul was among the players having to play doubles on the same day as their singles matches. Another was 19-year-old Jakub Mensik, the Miami winner who defeated Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-2 before having to play his doubles match on the same court a bit later. The 27-year-old Bublik joked in a conversation with the matchs referee during a changeover. Remember when tennis was easy? Like five years ago it was super easy to play tennis, the four-time winner on tour said. A bunch of random people in the top 50, barely moving. Now this guy is not even top 5, not even top 10. What is that? Ninth-seed Daniil Medvedev matched his career-best result in Madrid by reaching the last eight with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory over American Brandon Nakashima. Fourth-ranked Taylor Fritz was another American eliminated, losing 7-5, 6-4 to Casper Ruud. There were huge lines outside the complex, and people with tickets for Mondays matches were not allowed back in on Tuesday. Nobody said anything yet, said Juan Duato, who was denied entry when he arrived on Monday during the power outage. They said we couldnt come in and asked us to contact customer support. Apparently they will send us an email. Organizers said later Tuesday that anyone who purchased tickets for Monday would receive a full refund for the purchase. That process would be carried out automatically over the next few days. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/madrid-open-power-outage-sabalenka-swiatek-62f3eb256132a57f41bcf11b65a6611a,sports
Vaibhav Suryavanshi becomes world crickets wunderkind at the age of 14,"A 14-year-old wunderkind has the cricket world in raptures after scoring an electrifying 35-ball century in the Indian Premier League.  Vaibhav Suryavanshi broke all sorts of batting records in Twenty20 cricket during the IPL game in Jaipur on Monday night.  The precocious batter seemed destined for stardom when he went to Rajasthan Royals during the IPL auction last year at the age of 13. He hit a six with the first ball he faced in the tournament. It took Suryavanshi just three games in the sports richest, ritziest league to grab global attention as he smashed 11 sixes and seven fours in his breathtaking 101.  Now hes the real thing. He plundered all those boundaries against an experienced Gujarat Titans bowling attack with a combined 694 games of international experience.  Suryavanshis fearless hitting stunned Rashid Khan, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Prasidh Krishna, Karim Janat, Mohammed Siraj and Sai Kishore, who have carried Gujarat to six victories in nine IPL games this season. Rajasthan, which won the inaugural edition of IPL in 2008, has a history of nurturing cricketing talent. Suryavanshi was born a year after Yousuf Pathan hit the then fastest century in IPL in 2010 off 37 balls for Rajasthan against Mumbai Indians. Pathan was quick to congratulate the youngster for breaking his record for fastest IPL hundred by an Indian. Even more special to see it happen while playing for ( rajasthanroyals ), just like I did. Theres truly something magical about this franchise for youngsters, Pathan posted on X. Long way to go, champ. 
        
     Royals batting coach Vikram Rathore knew what Suryavanshi was capable of doing at top level cricket after watching him practice a few months ago, and quickly figured it was important to nurture him. To do it in front of this kind of crowd and in a situation like this against a really, really good bowling attack, I think it was really special and a lot of credit to him, Rathore said. He has a solid head on his his shoulders. Today was an extraordinary innings. Rathore was careful, though, not to pile too much pressure on his young star by comparing him with the great Sachin Tendulkar. Its too early to say that and its unfair I think on the kid to compare him to Sachin Tendulkar, he told the post-game news conference. As I said hes a new Vaibhav Suryavansh. Hes a special kid and hes a special talent. If he keeps working hard hell have a special place in Indian cricket Im sure. Tendulkar, who transformed from teenage talent into an iconic figure and the leading international scorer in the sport, was impressed with Suryavanshis innings. The cricket fraternity, including stars from other IPL franchises, praised the talent of the youngest player to score a century in a professional T20 league, and the second-fastest in the history of the IPL.  Witnessed this carnage of an innings by this youngster. Absolutely insane! Suryakumar Yadav of Mumbai Indians posted on X. Former India batter Yuvraj Singh was impressed with the fearless attitude of Suryavanshi. What were you doing at 14? This kid is taking on the best bowlers in the world without blinking an eyelid! Yuvraj posted to his 6.4 million followers on X. Vaibhav Suryavanshi -- remember the name! Playing with a fearless attitude Proud to see the next generation shine! With the likes of Rahul Dravid and Rathore around him at Rajasthan, Suryavanshi could easily be fast tracked into international cricket. IPL commentator and ex-West Indies international cricket Ian Bishop said Suryavanshi needs to be surrounded by the right people so that he doesnt fade out. Its unprecedented, 14 years old. This is new territory, Bishop said. The scrutiny on him when he plays the next game, and if he doesnt score any runs, you know, there are going to be detractors out there  this kid is going to be tested.  His parents are going to have to be so close to him, and hopefully  Im sure they are great parents  youve got to surround this kid with proper people for the next five years to ensure this high that hes got so early in his career, there isnt a drop. Suryavanshi made his first class debut for Bihar in northeast India in January 2024.  Vaibhav has shown the world the immense talent that lies hidden in the soil of Bihar, his father Sanjeev Suryavanshi said in a statement Tuesday. Today, Bihar stands tall with pride. Our entire family and people across Bihar are overjoyed by this accomplishment. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/vaibhav-suryavanshi-14-ipl-india-cricket-7eb72d22e60031ec687ae07bcfaadd3d,sports
Grand Slam doubles champion Max Purcell accepts an 18-month doping ban,"SYDNEY (AP)  Two-time Grand Slam doubles champion Max Purcell has accepted an 18-month ban after breaching anti-doping rules, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) said Tuesday. The Australian player admitted to a breach of rules relating to the use of a prohibited method after unknowingly receiving an intravenous infusion of vitamins above the allowed limit of 100 milliliters in a 12-hour span and entered into a provisional suspension in mid-December. Purcell said hed informed the clinic he was a professional athlete and that the infusion had to be less than 100 milliliters. The ITIA said the 27-year-old had received IV infusions of over 500 milliliters twice but his full cooperation and information sharing during the investigation had allowed for a 25% reduction in the sanction. This case does not involve a player testing positive for a prohibited substance but demonstrates that the anti-doping rules are broader than that, ITIA chief executive Karen Moorhouse said. It also shows the ITIA considers intelligence from a range of sources with the overriding aim to protect everyone covered by the tennis anti-doping rules, and ensure a level playing field for all. Purcell said the stress of the ongoing case had been seriously affecting (his) quality of life over the past few months. From being unable to sleep and eat properly, and refusing to be by myself, to developing nervous and anxious tics which I still currently battle day to day, Purcell said in a statement he posted to Instagram. 
        
     I couldnt sit and enjoy anything without the thought of the case and the endless possibilities of what sanction I would receive. Im so glad this is finally over for me and I can move on with my life. Purcell teamed with Jordan Thompson to win the U.S. Open last September, and with Matt Ebden to win Wimbledon in 2022. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/tennis-doping-max-purcell-499df5bc3db22d14729c904760ea591c,sports

Man arrested following death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson wont face charges,"LONDON (AP)  A man arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson has been told he will not face any charges, British prosecutors said Tuesday. Johnson played for the Nottingham Panthers and died shortly after his neck had been sliced in a collision with Sheffield Steelers defenseman Matt Petgrave during a game on Oct. 28, 2023. A man was arrested two weeks later and though South Yorkshire Police did not publicly identify him, Petgrave himself said in a crowdfunding appeal for legal fees that he was the subject of a police investigation. On Tuesday, the Crown Prosecution Service announced it would not bring criminal charges against the man arrested following what it described as a shocking and deeply upsetting incident. The CPS and South Yorkshire Police have worked closely together to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought against the other ice hockey player involved, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Michael Quinn said. Following a thorough police investigation and a comprehensive review of all the evidence by the CPS, we have concluded that there is not a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offense and so there will not be a prosecution. Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Adam Johnson. After his arrest, Petgrave had been re-bailed several times while the investigation took place. His agent declined to comment Tuesday. 
        
     During the game, Johnson had skated with the puck into Sheffields defensive zone when Petgrave collided with another Panthers player nearby. Petgraves left skate elevated as he began to fall and the blade hit Johnson in the neck. The native of Hibbing, Minnesota, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. The death of the 29-year-old former Pittsburgh Penguins player sparked debate across the sport about improving safety for players. Petgrave, a 33-year-old Canadian, had support from some of Johnsons teammates. Victor Bjrkung had told a Swedish newspaper there isnt a chance that its deliberate. Bjrkung had played the pass to Johnson and said he was traumatized by what he saw. Johnson  one of the import players in the Elite Ice Hockey League  was in his first season at Nottingham after stints in Germany and a handful of games for the Penguins in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons. Johnson was living with fiance Ryan Wolfe and studying at Loughborough Business School. The English Ice Hockey Association, which governs the sport below the Elite League, reacted to Johnsons death by requiring all players in England to wear neck guards from the start of 2024. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/adam-johnson-hockey-death-petgrave-ac24f4993af3f63040e8c8752f86292d,sports
Shadmans century gives Bangladesh narrow lead in 2nd test against Zimbabwe,"CHATTOGRAM, Bangladesh (AP)  Opener Shadman Islam hit a century to give Bangladesh a narrow lead in the second and final test against Zimbabwe on Tuesday. Shadman made a career-best 120 to guide Bangladesh to 291-7 at stumps on Day 2, leading the visitors by 64 runs. But a late flurry of wickets prevented Bangladesh from taking complete control as Zimbabwe leg-spinner Vincent Masekesa claimed 3-44 on his debut. Masekesas three-for included the wicket of Mominul Haque (33) and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (23), who appeared set for a big knock. Veteran Mushfiqur Rahim was run out for 40 to give Zimbabwe further hope. Shadman and Anamul Haque gave Bangladesh a good start, adding 118 runs for the teams first century partnership in the opening stand since December 2022.  They kept the side unscathed throughout the morning session after Zimbabwe couldnt add to its overnight score and was all out for 227 in the first innings. Bangladesh bowler Taijul Islam got the better of Blessing Muzurabani with the first ball of the day, leaving Tafadzwa Tsiga stranded on 18. Taijul finished with 6-60 from 27.1 overs. Anamul and Shadman were proactive right from the start with the latter slashing Richard Ngarava for a boundary past point in the third over to show his aggressive intent. Playing his first test in three years, Anamul got off the mark with two boundaries against Nagarava in the fifth over. But just after the lunch session, Muzurabani had Anamul leg-before for 39 after a gritty 80-ball-knock that was laced with four fours. 
        
     Shadman, who made just 12 and 4 in the two innings of the first test in Sylhet, drove pacer Richard Ngarava for a boundary past cover to raise his second test ton off 147 balls. His first century also came against Zimbabwe in Harare in 2021. He also became the 16th Bangladeshi batter to reach 1,000 runs. Shadman and Mominul added 76 runs for the second-wicket stand but then fell in two balls just before tea. Left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza (1-77) broke the partnership by dismissing Mominul for 33 and Brian Bennett got rid of Shadman in the next over.  Shanto and Mushfiqur were solid as Bangladesh appeared set for a big total but Masekesa broke through with the wicket of Shanto to end the 65-run partnership. Shantos dismissal triggered a collapse that saw Bangladesh lose four wickets for 20 runs. Mehidy Hasan (16) and Taijul Islam (5) hung on for the last seven overs. Zimbabwe leads the two-match series 1-0 following their three-wicket victory in Sylhet. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/cricket-bangladesh-zimbabwe-test-7e62bb00860c97406cfec5598e22828c,sports
NCAA decision has the potential to alter junior hockey and with it the pipelines that feed the NHL,"Boston University sophomore Aiden Celebrini has no regrets over the decision he reached at 16 to maintain his college eligibility by skipping a chance to play for the Western Hockey Leagues Saskatoon Blades. And it makes no difference that college hockey wasnt on his radar growing up in North Vancouver and regularly attending WHL games with his younger brother Macklin, the NHLs drafts No. 1 pick last summer. We didnt know much about college hockey, Celebrini said during the Frozen Four championship in St. Louis. Going to Vancouver Giants games, that was always kind of our dream to play in the WHL and then eventually play in the NHL. Its a dream Macklin has already achieved in completing his rookie season with the San Jose Sharks and after one year at BU. Aiden could well follow after being drafted by his hometown Canucks in 2023. Last fall, the NCAA made a landmark eligibility decision to allow Canadian Hockey League players to compete at the college level. The ruling frees todays players from the either-or choice the Celebrinis faced to either join the CHL team that drafted them or preserve their college eligibility as they did by playing at the Canadian Junior A or USHL levels  Aiden in Alberta and Macklin in Chicago. Im kind of jealous, Aiden Celebrini said. I think its awesome that guys can experience both now because I think the WHL is a top league, and obviously the NCAA is also. Its great to have that kind of pipeline now. While players will benefit most, the NCAA ruling has the potential to dramatically tilt North Americas junior hockey developmental landscape toward U.S. colleges in a fundamental altering of how prospects reach the NHL. The route for many has traditionally run through the CHLs three leagues, the WHL, OHL and QMJHL. The CHL remains the clear leader in having 839 players drafted from 2015-24, with the NCAAs 74 a distant seventh. And yet, of those 74 college players, 63 were chosen in the first round, including two Canadians selected first overall (Celebrini and Michigans Owen Power in 2021). The 16-team USHL says it has produced more NHL draft picks (197) over the past four years than each of the CHLs individual leagues, led by the OHL (166), the WHL (155) and QMJHL (89). Meantime, college hockey players now make up about a third of NHL rosters, up from 20% in 2000, with Hockey East commissioner Steve Metcalf envisioning that number growing. I dont think its that complicated. Therell be an increasing number of NHLers that come from college, Metcalf told The Associated Press at the Frozen Four. (The CHL and USHL) will feed players up into college hockey. And college hockey will feed the players up to the NHL. College sports awaits the final approval of a $2.8 billion antitrust settlement that will change the economics across the NCAA and its hundreds of member schools by allowing revenue sharing. That, and the availability of NIL endorsement money, will provide college programs beyond football and basketball different resources to attract recruits. A hot topic of discussion at the Frozen Four was the potential of hockey programs making six-figures offer to lure top-end CHL players, such as Medicine Hat forward Gavin McKenna, already projected to be No. 1 pick in the 2026 NHL draft. The better talent we can get into college hockey, the better it is for college hockey. So access to a new talent pool is a good thing, said Western Michigan athletic director Dan Bartholomae, whose Broncos won their first title. Were going to compete in that space, he added of an athletic department in the midst of building a $500 million new downtown arena. We could grow a little bit in the sport of hockey, and were planning to. Questions include how much college hockey can expand, given the eight-figure price tag to launch a Division I program, and how the CHL and USHL adapt. CHL President Dan MacKenzie doesnt expect his three leagues to take a back seat to anyone. The changes have been monumental, obviously. Weve all been trying to get an handle on whats going to happen, he said. What weve seen in those five months is the CHL basically get stronger. For proof, MacKenzie noted that 205 CHL alumni, representing more than 50% of NHL rosters, are currently competing in the playoffs. He also pointed to NHL Central Scouting having 170 CHL players included in their pre-draft rankings, the most ever. Expansion is on the horizon, with the WHL preparing to launch two teams in British Columbia, which would increase the CHLs total to 60. Every player is going to make a different decision, MacKenzie said. All we can do is try to run a whole bunch of great programs across our teams and leagues and let the chips fall, because we feel pretty confident that were going to be the destination for that player. The challenge for the USA Hockey-backed USHL is somewhat different in staying competitive while maintaining its objectives of growing the game across American and developing U.S.-born talent. The initial fallout from the NCAA ruling led to two teams, Youngstown and Muskegon, being rejected in their bid to leave the USHL and join the OHL. All 16 teams have since committed to remaining in the USHL next year. Commissioner Glenn Hefferan dismissed the potential of a lawsuit by noting the USHL has anti-trust protections. He instead foresees a future in which the USHL and CHL forge closer bonds, with the potential of inter-league preseason games on the horizon. A bigger concern is the NCAAs change in eligibility rules leading to Canadians potentially displacing Americans on college rosters. Hefferan and USA Hockey executive director Pat Kelleher both said theyd like to see the U.S. Congress cap the number of international players on college teams. Hockey Easts Metcalf dismissed that proposal outright. My immediate reaction is thats the opposite direction were going in, Metcalf said. College hockey is interested in getting the best players they can from where ever theyre from. In the meantime, the NHL is monitoring developments and might eventually need to weigh in, with input from the NHL Players Association. Currently, NHL teams retain the draft rights to players for 30 days after they leave college. By comparison, teams hold CHL players right for two seasons after being drafted. One benefit NHL teams have in drafting college players is, once signed those players can be sent directly to the minors.

Nat Sciver-Brunt appointed captain of the England womens cricket team,"LONDON (AP)  Nat Sciver-Brunt has been appointed captain of the England womens cricket team. The England and Wales Cricket Board said Tuesday that Sciver-Brunt will replace Heather Knight, who stepped down after nine years in March as part of an overhaul following poor results.  England was eliminated in the group stage of last years T20 World Cup and lost the multi-format Ashes series to Australia 16-0 this year. The appointment of the all-rounder came after former England captain Charlotte Edwards succeeded Jon Lewis as head coach earlier this month. Sciver-Brunt, who has served as vice-captain the last three years, will captain the team in all three formats. Im really proud to take on the role of captain of the England womens team and its an honor to have been asked by Charlotte, someone Ive always looked up to, Sciver-Brunt said. I will try my best to lead this team to success, whilst empowering them to be the best version of themselves.  The 32-year-old Sciver-Brunt has made 259 appearances for England in all formats since her debut in 2013 and was on the team that won the 2017 World Cup. She averages 46.47 in test cricket, 45.91 in one-day internationals and 28.45 in T20s. She has taken 181 international wickets.  She is ranked No. 3 in the ICC world batting rankings in ODI cricket. England kicks off the summer season on May 21 with a ODI and T20 series against West Indies.  The first major event for Sciver-Brunt, the 50-over World Cup, is scheduled for September in India. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/england-women-cricket-new-captain-sciver-brunt-acf44deb1360d5c4136a3e29e8d0a2be,sports
Troubled SafeSport Center looks for a new leader and tries to chart a different course,"DENVER (AP)  The letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley to the person now in charge of steadying the U.S. Center for SafeSport laid bare his views of festering problems at an agency he portrayed as having lost its way. Among the concerns the Iowa Republican outlined in that March 31 letter to the centers board chair and now its interim CEO, April Holmes, included repeated failure to adequately supervise SafeSports officers, and a concern that SafeSport is not prioritizing serious sexual and child abuse cases over other cases. Four months after The Associated Press revealed the centers firing of an investigator  former police officer Jason Krasley, who would later be charged with sex crimes  the board took care of one of the concerns by ousting the centers CEO, JuRiese Colon. But as Grassleys questions to Holmes indicate, Colons departure last week does not by itself guarantee an end to turmoil at the troubled 8-year-old agency. The AP spoke to more than a dozen people familiar with the center to gauge the next moves it must take to rebuild trust. A consensus emerged that the center is a good idea that is ultimately worth taking the time to repair. It is definitely worth saving, Phil Andrews, the CEO of USA Fencing, wrote in a text, before ticking off areas that need improvement. They included finding a strong, new leader; additional funding to clean up the mess; and further improvement of processes that critics view as cumbersome, not transparent and too drawn-out. 
        
     They have made some real progress in stemming incidents of abuse and weeding abusers out of the system, said Sarah Hirshland, the CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, which bankrolls most of the centers $23 million annual budget with help from its 52 affiliated sports organizations. Thats undeniable. But theres also more work to be done. Currently, that task belongs to Holmes, 52, a 2008 Paralympic sprint gold medalist who became the board chair in 2023. Her mission, she said, is to ensure operational continuity and conduct the search for new leadership. Any large-scale changes to the Center should and will be led by the new CEO with input and support from the leadership team, our stakeholders, and Center staff, Holmes wrote in answers emailed in response to a series of questions from the AP. In 2017, in the wake of scandals involving Larry Nassar and others, the independently run center was created to investigate and levy sanctions for abuse cases as part of a remit that covers some 11 million people who play Olympic sports in the U.S. Over the past two years, around two dozen people  some accusers, some accused, some parents of minors involved with the center  have approached the AP with stories about cases that took months, if not years, to resolve, some of which led to emotional or financial devastation. One such person, equestrian Zoubair Bennani, has received a permanent ban from the center, been forced to sell his 14 horses and says he has spent more than $275,000 in attorneys fees fighting allegations of sexual and physical misconduct brought against him by former girlfriends. He has no criminal record and insists the women used the center to punish him. Thats all I think about every day, is how to get my status back, at any cost, because I am innocent, Bennani said. In outlining a problem that came up frequently in the AP reporting  creating a safe space for survivors while also protecting the rights of the accused  he asked; Why cant SafeSport have transparency where theyre doing more vetting on the people who bring the accusations? Bennanis case began as one of the more than 8,000 reports the center receives a year  a 2,500% increase from when it opened. His name is among more than 2,300 on the centers Centralized Disciplinary Database. The steady growth of both numbers could be the most tangible measures of success for what is, in essence, still a start-up among this countrys tangled Olympic infrastructure. Other achievements include establishing a SafeSport Code that standardized rules across the country; developing educational resources it says have reached millions; and establishing an audit process for the nations Olympic-focused sports organizations  a mission that has created accountability but also tension between the center and the agencies. The Center has also continued to build relationships with athletes and survivor organizations, seeking their engagement on policy improvements and much needed research in the area of abuse prevention in sport, Holmes said.  Grassleys letter to Holmes conjured long-running complaints about a process that takes too long and isnt clearly defined to either accusers or the accused. He questioned whether the center was prioritizing the worst of abuse cases over other cases. The center has authority to take cases involving bullying and harassment of a nonsexual nature. It also can investigate cases involving the millions of athletes who arent on the Olympic track but participate in those sports. Before the center was created, Olympic leaders debated whether its scope should have been this wide. The shock from the Nassar scandal, and the failure of the Olympics existing agencies to prevent it, essentially shut down that debate and locked in the centers wider mandate. If you were starting an organization, you would never start it with 12 product lines at once and say, Were going to do all of these, said Hirshland, who took over at the USOPC about a year after SafeSports founding. It feels like thats how they got started. Maybe thats not their fault, but thats where it is. Thats been challenging. Some insiders suggest a streamlining of the centers scope might be in order. One path could be narrowing the now-unlimited statute of limitations, which has opened the window for the center to adjudicate abuse cases from as far back as the 1960s. Another would be shrinking the types of cases it will accept, perhaps by fencing off grassroots sports into a different category. This was, in essence, one of the recommendations from a congressionally appointed commission that released a report on the U.S. Olympic movement last year. Among its findings were that people lacked confidence in the center, which it said was in potential crisis. The commission co-chair, Dionne Koller, said other suggestions in the report  increasing athlete control over the center and bringing its funding  and thus oversight  under congressional control are radical changes that would improve its performance. You can keep making incremental tweaks in response to issues that come up, and they can do some good, Koller said, in a nod to a series of reforms that were made last year. But were just going to keep repeating the same type of problems unless bigger changes are made. As things stand, it is Grassley, along with a handful of other lawmakers in Washington, who appear to be keeping the best watch over the center. They, along with Holmes and her fellow board members, will play a pivotal role in what, and who, comes next. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/safesport-olympics-sex-abuse-eae76690e17b07a705fef75dddc29426,sports
Giro dItalia cycling race to go inside the Vaticans walls in homage to Pope Francis,"ROME (AP)  It could very well be the biggest sporting event ever held inside the walls of the Vatican. The Giro dItalia will pay homage to the late Pope Francis by passing through the Vatican gardens behind St. Peters Basilica and in front of the Santa Marta hotel  where Francis lived  during the final stage of the cycling race on June 1. More than 150 cyclists will pedal for three kilometers (nearly two miles) through an area of the Vatican rarely seen by the general public and live TV images will broadcast the scenes around the world. The original idea was to have Francis signal the start of the last stage to promote the Vatican and the Eternal City in the 2025 Holy Year, Giro director Mauro Vegni told The Associated Press on Tuesday following a presentation of the 21st stage. Francis, however, died last week at 88. We wanted to go right up to Casa Santa Marta because we knew the pope was aging, so we thought he could come down and offer a blessing to start the final stage. Then unfortunately things turned out differently. But it will remain an homage to Francis, Vegni added. By June, there should be a new pope, with the conclave to elect Francis successor slated to start May 7. Bishop Paul Tighe, the No. 2 in the Vaticans culture and education ministry, said hosting the Giro highlights that there is kind of an interest in the Church in the whole reality of sport. 
        
     If you think about it, on any given Sunday, there will be as many people watching sports as maybe participating in religious functions. And sometimes the same people, Tighe added. So this is a way of saying that this is the human reality that celebrates human achievements. That is important for us as a church. The cyclists will enter the Vatican through the Petriano gate to the left of St. Peters, ride around the basilica and then climb up toward the gardens before exiting near Santa Marta at the Perugino gate. The passage through the Vatican will be during the neutralized period before the stage. The official start will then begin after the riders exit the narrow Perugino gate. The official start cant take place inside the Vatican because it would raise the likelihood of crashes. While 184 cyclists divided into 23 teams of eight riders each will start the Giro on May 9  with the opening three stages held in Albania for the first time  there will likely be 20 to 30 riders who dont make it to the final stage. In 1974, the Giro started in the Vatican and in the 2000 Holy Year, the opening prologue finished in St. Peters Square. The race has also passed by St. Peters multiple times, including the last two years. But never before has the race gone so far into Vatican City like it will this year  which has called for extraordinary negotiations between race organizers and the Holy See. Team cars covered with sponsors labels will not be allowed inside the Vatican. So organizers will provide one pool car of mechanics in case any of the riders puncture their tires or have other issues inside the walls. The usual array of photographers riding on motorcycles who document the race will be reduced and TV images will be produced by the Vaticans own media team and race organizers. Discussions are ongoing over whether aerial TV coverage provided by helicopters or drones will be permitted in what is usually heavily protected air space. Its been a difficult negotiation, Tigue said, But it was the enthusiasm of the pope for the project that opened doors. Otherwise, it would have been very easy to say, Its impossible. It cant be done. Its not going to be a competitive moment. Its more a moment symbolically that theyre there, Tigue added. And then, by coincidence, the area where theyre up in the higher end of the gardens is an area where there are all these statues of our Lady from all over the world, from various sanctuaries, so in a sense its a reminder of the international dimension of sport and the international dimension of faith. After leaving the Vatican, the final Giro stage follows a 143-kilometer route (89-mile) concluding with a circuit of eight laps through downtown Rome and the finish next to the Colosseum. The Vatican has expanded its presence in the sports world in recent years, in cycling in particular: Dutch-born rider Rien Schuurhuis competed for the Vatican at the cycling world championships the last three years. Francis was a big soccer fan and often hailed sports as a way to promote solidarity and inclusion, especially for young people. In 2019, the Vatican launched an official track team featuring Swiss Guards, priests and nuns to compete in international events. ___ AP cycling: https://apnews.com/hub/cycling",https://apnews.com/article/giro-ditalia-vatican-pope-francis-23d7c0595194225d2a9830621ae44c2c,sports
NWSL submits request for lower-tier womens league to develop players,"The National Womens Soccer League has asked U.S. Soccer to sanction a lower division womens professional soccer league that could launch as early as next year.  The six-team league would sit on the second tier of the U.S. soccer pyramid, below the NWSL and the USL Womens Super League, and would serve to develop young players.  The NWSL on Friday confirmed that it had formally submitted an application and supporting documentation for a new for a Division II league with the U.S. Soccer Federation. The move was first reported by CBS Sports.  As a global leader in the womens soccer landscape both on and off the pitch, the NWSL and its member clubs are committed to growing our sport in meaningful ways, the league said in a statement. The demand for professional soccer has never been higher. We look forward to working to build a strong foundation for future generations of players, officials and coaches and ensure the continued advancement of the womens game. U.S. Soccer has certain conditions for Division II sanctioning, including a minimum number of teams and stadiums that seat at least 2,000. In the case of the NWSL, all of the lower-division teams would be affiliated with top-tier clubs, sharing ownership and infrastructure.  The NWSL clubs that would field a Division II team include the Kansas City Current, Bay FC, North Carolina Courage, Racing Louisville, Gotham FC, Orlando Pride, Seattle Reign and Washington Spirit.

Newcastle and Chelsea win to boost top-five hopes in Premier League as Ipswich relegated,"Newcastle and Chelsea picked up victories in the Premier League to move into the Champions League qualification positions as Ipswich became the third and final team to be relegated on Saturday. On the day Newcastle manager Eddie Howe returned to the dugout after recovering from pneumonia, his teams 3-0 win over Ipswich at St. James Park was significant at both ends of the standings. Newcastle jumped into third place in the congested race to finish in the top five and secure a spot in next seasons Champions League. Meanwhile, Ipswichs return to the Championship was confirmed, with the team partly owned by pop star Ed Sheeran joining Southampton and Leicester back in the second tier. Its the second straight season that the three promoted clubs have gone straight back down. Its been a massive challenge, said Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna, who led the team into the Premier League and back-to-back promotions from the third tier. Many things we have done positively that will set us up well for the years ahead (and) theres been some things we could have done better and things we will learn from. Howe has already guided Newcastle to the English League Cup title this season for the clubs first major trophy in 70 years. He said his teams remaining four league matches feel like cup finals, too. Youre ticking down, he said. We have put ourselves back into a strong position but we know it can change quickly. 
        
     Chelsea climbed into fifth place, two points behind Newcastle and one behind Manchester City, by beating Everton 1-0 thanks to Nicolas Jacksons first-half goal. That sealed back-to-back wins for Chelsea. Just five points separate Newcastle and seventh-placed Aston Villa, which wasnt in action in the Premier League on Saturday. Instead, Villa was losing to Crystal Palace 3-0 at Wembley Stadium in the first FA Cup semifinal. Eberechi Eze and Ismaila Sarr (two) were the scorers for Palace, which reached the final for a third time in its bid for the first major trophy in the south London clubs history. It lost to Manchester United on both previous occasions, in 1990 and 2016. Jamie Vardy began his long goodbye to Leicester, after confirming on Thursday hed be leaving at the end of the season, by having a penalty saved in a 3-0 loss at Wolverhampton. That was so unfortunate, Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy said. I really wanted him to score to get us back in the game but also for himself. Brazil striker Matheus Cunha, linked heavily with a summer move to Manchester United, scored one and set up two in Wolves sixth straight win that has seen the team power clear of relegation danger. It shows he is committed with us, with his teammates, with everyone, Wolves manager Vitor Pereira said of Cunha. Van Nistelrooy said he was unaware about his own future after falling to keep Leicester up. It is a matter of being patient and waiting, the Dutchman said. Last-placed Southampton conceded in stoppage time to lose at home to Fulham 2-1 and stay on 11 points  tied for the lowest ever tally for a single season in the Premier League, set by Derby County in the 2007-08 season. Brighton scored in the 89th minute and again in stoppage time to secure a 3-2 win over West Ham, whose winless run extended to seven games under recently hired manager Graham Potter  formerly of Brighton. West Hams Premier League status was guaranteed because of Ipswichs relegation but Potter accepted that being one place above the bottom three was not good enough. We have to acknowledge the season we are having is a bad one, he said. The fact we have stayed clear is good but not good enough. ___ Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80 ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/fa-cup-premier-league-chelsea-newcastle-b72bc6ebca3d64630f9858ba63deadc1,sports
Celtic wins Scottish league title No. 55 to tie record of Glasgow rival Rangers,"Celtic tied fierce Glasgow rival Rangers on a record 55 Scottish top-flight titles by clinching the trophy on Saturday with four games to spare. A 5-0 win at Dundee United in the Scottish Premiership put Celtic 18 points clear of second-place Rangers, which has five matches to play. It was a fourth straight league title for Celtic and kept the team on course for a sixth domestic treble in the last nine seasons. Celtic has already won the Scottish League Cup and has reached the final of the Scottish FA Cup, against Aberdeen on May 24. Rangers won the last of its 55 league titles in 2021 but could not stave of its Old Firm rival for long, with Celtic overseeing an utterly dominant period in the Scottish game. The team has captured 21 of the last 26 domestic trophies on offer in Scotland. That could soon be 22 from 27 if Celtic wins a third straight Scottish FA Cup title. Amazing performance, outstanding, Celtic captain Callum McGregor said. It means the world to us. For Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, its an 11th trophy  and fourth league title  from his two spells in charge. He is bidding for a third treble at the helm of Celtic. Leading into this game, there was a little bit of negativity around the league and the competition, but we can only concentrate on ourselves. Our mentality has been so, so good, Rodgers said. The competition is for everyone. When it matters, this team has produced. Its not our fault were 18 points clear and scoring goals. 
        
     Rodgers insisted he would 200% be at Celtic for next season, saying: I have never been happier here. Its important, he added, to keep the motivation and the hunger at this stage of the season and we know what we want to achieve and what records we want to beat. The teams fans disrupted the game against Dundee United early in the first half by throwing dozens of tangerines onto the field in protest at the hosts pricing of tickets for away supporters. Celtics fans chanted about the prices as the pieces of fruit were lobbed on, and a banner was held up that read: Enjoy the fruits of our labour. The tangerines were cleared off the field by stewards and Celtic players. Before kickoff, a minutes silence was held for Pope Francis on the day of his funeral. Celtic fans paid tribute with banners and Vatican flags and chanted Papa Francesco before the period of silence began. A Celtic delegation, including Rodgers and his playing squad and staff, met Pope Francis in a private audience after a game against Lazio in December 2023. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/celtic-rangers-title-55-scotland-45f1d4b4cb757bb085cce3594064c82e,sports
Wrexham seals third straight promotion and will play in English soccers second tier,"WREXHAM, Wales (AP)  Wrexham fans ignored the warnings. They were always going to.  By the time the final whistle blew on Saturday to confirm promotion to English soccers second tier, thousands were ready and waiting to storm the home field in celebration.  Flares were lit, red smoke filled the air, Welsh flags were waved proudly and songs sung raucously. Wrexham was one step from the Premier League and nothing was going to stop this party. Charlton was beaten 3-0 to ensure Wrexham went up as the third division runner-up behind champion Birmingham, and co-owner Ryan Reynolds reflected on their third promotion in three seasons. It just seemed like an impossible dream, the movie star said. We said five years ago our goal was to make it to the Premier League. There were understandably a lot of laughs, but it feels like a thing that could make it to fruition right now. There were warnings of police action for pitch invaders before kickoff. And as the game reached its final moments, an announcement over the loudspeaker told fans it could be stopped if they didnt move back behind barricades.  But everyone inside the clubs historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.  The Welsh soccer teams remarkable rise under Hollywood owners Reynolds and Rob McElhenney has hit a new high  returning to the second tier for the first time since the 1981-82 campaign.  
        
     It means that from next season it will be playing one level below the Premier League, something that was unthinkable just four years ago when it was a struggling non-league team. Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans. The stadium and atmosphere is incredible, its a massive club and a big project, it will be a special week now, said striker Sam Smith, who scored two goals in the win. Who knows whats next for a team that has defied the odds since the actors bought it for $2.5 million in 2021 and turned it into a household name around the world. The owners have come in and done an amazing job. Im so pleased for them because they deserve it, manager Phil Parkinson said. Theyre invested in all the decisions, but they trust us in in our decision making and thats why weve had success over the last three years.  While celebrations greeted the final whistle, the party began much earlier after promotion rival Wycombe lost to Leyton Orient 1-0.  Wrexham just needed victory then to clinch the second promotion place in League One.  Reynolds posed for selfies with fans outside and served drinks behind the bar in a marquee set up outside the nearby Turf pub, which has earned world renown from the docuseries Welcome to Wrexham. Fans erupted in cheers after the final whistle of Wycombes loss, which was shown on a big screen. Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbones long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smiths volley. When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexhams fans serenaded the players with chants of We are going up.  This is for those supporters who followed the team in those 15 years in the (non-league) National League in really, really tough times, but stood strong behind their club and they deserve tonight, Parkinson said.  ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/wrexham-promotion-charlton-ryan-reynolds-58d5d3744c969460194f59593906e798,sports

Cadillac F1 to be managed by global group TWG Motorsports. Dan Towriss named CEO of racing portfolio,"The group that owns Cadillac Formula 1 officially launched TWG Motorsports on Tuesday as the division responsible for its rapidly growing motorsports portfolio. TWG Global is the main company owned by co-chairs Mark Walter and Thomas Tull and has controlling interest in the Los Angeles Dodgers, Premier League club Chelsea, the Professional Womens Hockey League, and stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers and other ventures. The Cadillac F1 team is expected to join the grid in 2026. TWG Motorsports is also the majority owner of Andretti Global, which competes in IndyCar, Indy NXT and Formula E; NASCAR team Spire Motorsports, which won last weekends Truck Series race and nearly won the Cup Series race; the two-car IMSA sports car GTP program fielded by Wayne Taylor Racing; and Walkinshaw Andretti United, the Bathurst 1000-winning race team competing in Australias Supercars Championship. Dan Towriss, longtime partner of Walter, was named CEO of TWG Motorsports. Towriss will also retain his role as CEO of Group 1001 Insurance, a U.S. financial services firm with more than $66 billion in assets under management. Dan has been instrumental in forming the landmark Cadillac Formula 1 team in partnership with General Motors and acquiring for TWG Global a broad racing portfolio that includes Andretti Global, Wayne Taylor Racing, and Spire Motorsports, Walter said in a statement. 
        
     TWG Motorsports was formed in late 2024, not long after Michael Andretti stepped aside as leader of Andretti Global. Andrettis step back helped push through the Cadillac F1 bid, which had previously been denied by Formula One Management. Andretti plans to be at this weekends IndyCar season-opening race in St. Petersburg, Florida, Towriss said in an interview with The Associated Press. The two spoke earlier this month before the Daytona 500. Hes good. We were just talking, you know, motorsports, we were talking about how each of the teams were doing, Towriss said. He wanted to talk about how the team was doing. Andretti was engaged  just not in the day-to-day operations  because that is now Towriss job. He was thrilled following the NASCAR weekend at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where Kyle Busch won the Truck Series race and Carson Hocevar made a late move that backfired to try to win the Cup Series race. Hocevar finished second, which is almost like a victory to growing Spire Motorsports. TWG and Towriss have been supporters of Spire for several years but Towriss only last season bought into the team by acquiring the stakes of former team co-owner T.J. Puchyr. Jeff Dickerson, the other team founder, runs the team. I cant say enough good things about Jeff Dickerson and the work that hes done and the kind of partner that he is in that series, Towriss said. Each of these racing series actually fit into the culture that were building at TWG. Its consistent with the culture of the company I built on the insurance side, through Group 1001, and its going to be fun to see, to watch each of these teams grow. Which begs the question, how did a businessman in Indiana with zero racing experience suddenly find himself running teams in nearly every major racing series? When you put it that way, it seems very puzzling, doesnt it? Towriss acknowledged. But motorsports is business  and can be successful when done correctly  and TWG Global is committed to expanding its portfolio. Years ago, people were asking Why did you buy a baseball team? Or why did you do this? And I think we see a business opportunity, Towriss said. The question is, What are you trying to build? So we wanted to see the building blocks of a global motorsport series thats participating in every iconic motorsport race on the planet. Theres a lot of excitement about that. So it was just a vision that I had to put those pieces together. Towriss believes the TWG brand can transform the motorsports space and set new standards for the industry and build a legacy of success across the globe. Hell make the switch this weekend from NASCAR to IndyCar, where the season will open on the downtown streets of St. Petersburg with lofty goals for the three-car Andretti team. Colton Herta, a candidate for the Cadillac F1 lineup, finished second in last years season standings but his two victories were the only two wins amongst the three Andretti drivers. The team fields cars for Indianapolis 500 winner Marcus Ericsson and Kyle Kirkwood, who won twice in 2023. Towriss goal for this year is an Indianapolis 500 win and IndyCar championship; Andretti drivers have not won either since Ryan Hunter-Reay won the 2012 series title and Takuma Sato won the 500 in 2017. Towriss also wants to be in routine conversation about contenders with Team Penske and Chip Ganassi Racing. Josef Newgarden won back-to-back Indy 500s for Penske, and Alex Palou has won three of the last four IndyCar titles for Ganassi. Towriss noted that IndyCar television partner Fox Sports has debuted three high-level commercials that feature Newgarden, Palou and McLaren driver Pato OWard  while the Andretti drivers have been shut out of the marketing campaign. I feel responsibility for the Andretti legacy and I think seeing them get back to their winning ways is very important, Towriss said. Weve put a lot of effort into getting the team back to being a top-tier performer, to consistently winning in IndyCar, and the team wants it bad. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-cadillac-indycar-towriss-twg-motorsports-e2b3030dd2cabbeea3cc36bc6c427251,sports
Lando Norris is fastest and Lewis Hamilton 13th as a power cut disrupts F1 testing,"SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP)  Lando Norris was fastest and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton 13th as Formula 1 teams had to deal with a power outage that disrupted preseason testing Wednesday. In an early sign favoring Norris bid to beat defending champion Max Verstappen, the McLaren driver was fastest by .157 seconds from Mercedes George Russell. Verstappen was third-fastest and Hamiltons new Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc fourth. The afternoon session was suspended for just over an hour when an electrical failure plunged pit lane garages into darkness and disabled floodlights around the track. An hour of the lost time was added on to the end of the day. The day was split into two sessions, with 10 drivers on track in each, and Hamilton was fifth-fastest in the morning  when times were generally slower  while his replacement at Mercedes, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, posted the fastest time. The 18-year-old Italian rookie was seventh-fastest overall for the day. Times in testing often dont reflect a driver or cars true pace because of different strategies. The 40-year-old Hamilton left Mercedes to join Ferrari this season after spending 12 years and winning six of his seven world titles with the Silver Arrows. The British driver joined Ferrari last month and will line up in the 2025 season alongside Leclerc, who has been at Ferrari since 2019. Each team is allowed one car on track at a time during preseason testing. Wednesdays morning session saw Hamilton joined by Liam Lawson, whos partnering Verstappen at Red Bull this season, McLaren driver Oscar Piastri and two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin. 
        
     Two factors mean preseason testing could be less useful in predicting the teams race pace this year. The weather so far Wednesday has been windy and unusually cool for Bahrain, unlike a typical F1 race weekend.  Bahrain also isnt hosting the opening race of the season, like it did last year. The first race is the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 16. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-formula-one-hamilton-ferrari-bc7e074450310bc2c4e34b291c966139,sports
FIA confirms 2 pit stops for F1s Monaco Grand Prix to liven up dull racing,"PARIS (AP)  Formula 1 drivers will have to make at least two pit stops at the Monaco Grand Prix in an attempt to inject some jeopardy into a glamorous race where overtaking is almost impossible. F1s governing body, the FIA, confirmed Wednesday that it would mandate using at least three sets of tires with the primary intent of improving the sporting spectacle of this race given the notable difficulty in overtaking at this circuit. The overtaking challenges for wide modern F1 cars has seen recent races in Monaco often decided largely by grid positions from Saturday qualifying. Last years race was red-flagged after first-lap crashes and resumed with a standing restart, which allowed all cars to change tires. There was little action after that as Charles Leclerc took the victory without stopping again. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/monaco-f1-pit-stops-fia-face1306037883a02937edc6dcfffea8,sports

Love wasnt in the air for everyone at Valspar Championship. Tempers were flaring,"The Valspar Championship likes to bill itself as the most colorful tournament in the world because its sponsor is a paint company. A few players added their own color to a wild week of tempers at Innisbrook. First came Patton Kizzire, who had missed the cut in six straight tournaments and then missed a 5-foot putt on the 15th hole in the opening round. Frustrated, he punted his putter high in the air, and then tapped in with the blade of a sand wedge. He then withdrew with a back injury. Kizzire took to Instagram on Monday to apologize. It wasnt my putters fault, he said. I just lost my cool and its unacceptable. Im looking forward to being a better version of myself and I appreciate you guys understanding. Next it was Sahith Theegala, now on a streak of 10 straight PGA Tour starts without a top 10. He was so disgusted with his swing on the par-3 fourth hole in the second round that he dropped the club, then picked it up and violently heaved it toward the ground. Adam Hadwin might have topped both of them. He was walking toward the 10th green when he slammed his club into the ground. It struck a sprinkler and set off a gusher. Jordan Spieth also was caught on video screaming a four-letter expletive (it wasnt Fore) at the ground after a flop shot behind the green. Golf can do that, and three moments caught on camera made it look to be a vexing week. 
        
     Hadwin was not the first to set off a sprinkler. Davis Love III caught a plugged lie in a bunker at Bay Hill in 1999, watched the shot roll through the green and smacked the sprinkler with his sand wedge. It shattered the valve and water gushed into the sand. That was before social media and the response was different. Instead of it going viral, Love received a note in his locker the next day from tournament host Arnold Palmer. It was a mock bill  $3.50 for parts, $175,000 for labor. They all bring to mind a famous observation by Bobby Jones, who once said, Golf is usually played with the outward appearance of great dignity. It is, nevertheless, a game of considerable passion  either the explosive type, or that which burns inwardly and sears the soul. These were the explosive types. Scottie Scheffler has won the Masters twice in the last three years, and he has embraced everything about Augusta National from the time he arrives. You pull in, and everything else just kind of melts away, he said on a conference call. He said his favorite spot on the property was outside the locker room upstairs, where he can sit alone on a patio that loops around the back and gives him a view of the first tee and 10th tee and as much of the golf course he can see. I sit up there and just watch whats going on and nobody really knows that Im up there, Scheffler said. Just kind of sitting there watching the crowds, enjoying the sights and sounds of Augusta, and nobody really knows that youre there, so its pretty nice. And then he realized what he said. I kind of just gave myself away with that one, Scheffler said. Thats tough. Maybe everyone will know now. He was so caught up in the mechanics of his swing that he wasnt playing freely. The Valspar Championship was another important step for Davis Riley. Riley got off to an atrocious start this year, going the entire West Coast Swing without playing on Sunday. He shot 80 in Kapalua and 80 in the opening round of The American Express. His scoring average for those five tournaments was 73.6. The culprit was a two-way miss. That creates a lot of anxiety on the golf course because you dont know where to miss, you dont know what side of the golf course youre missing on, all of a sudden you start steering golf shots, Riley said. It was a very uncomfortable feeling. The Mississippi native found more comfort when the PGA Tour reached Florida. He had a pair of top 10s in the Puerto Rico Open and the Valspar Championship. Riley found a predictable shot pattern and is back relying on a tight draw. A lot more freedom and better scores, he said. The PGA Tour Americas kicks off a six-tournament swing through South America and Mexico this week in Argentina. The field for the 93 Abierto del Centro  a tournament that dates to 1927  includes players who have combined for six PGA Tour wins and two majors. The bulk of that comes from Angel Cabrera, whose three PGA Tour titles include the 2007 U.S. Open at Oakmont and the 2009 Masters. Cabrera was eighth on the alternate list for the PGA Tour Champions event this week. Also playing is Andres Romero, who won the Zurich Classic in 2008, and two-time PGA Tour winner Fabian Gomez. Both are listed as having Korn Ferry Tour status (the circuit is off this week), while Cabrera is playing on a restricted sponsor exemption. The tournament is in Cabreras hometown of Cordoba. He is in an eight-time winner of the event. The total purse is $225,000. The PGA Tour in 2022 decided two players from the Player Advisory Council would be elected co-chairmen and then move onto the board. Webb Simpson and Peter Malnati won and began a three-year term the following year. Both are off the board after this year, and the PGA Tour is going back to one PAC chairman. Maverick McNealy is on the ballot for PAC chairman for the second time. He is joined by Rickie Fowler and Keith Mitchell. Whoever gets the most votes (voting ends April 14) will serve a four-year term on the policy board. The co-chair with second-most votes serves a three-year term. Previously, PAC chairmen served three-year terms on the board. Starting in 2026, they will serve four years. These governance changes will improve year-to-year continuity among the six Player Directors and allow the Policy Board to make informed decisions more quickly and effectively, Commissioner Jay Monahan said. Fowler is on the PAC subcommittee that oversees tournaments, fans and sponsors. McNealy and Mitchell are on the PAC subcommittee for business affairs. Ian Poulter had cause for celebration. His son Luke, a sophomore at Florida, birdied the last hole to win his first college tournament at the Schenkel Invitational ... In Viktor Hovlands last two PGA Tour victories, he led the field in making putts longer than 10 feet  12 of them at the Valspar Championship, 13 at the 2023 Tour Championship. ... The LPGA Tour resumes its domestic schedule in Arizona with a field that has 19 of the top 20 players in the womens world ranking. Players from five European countries have won six of the 13 tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule this year. One thing Id say to people trying to do it as a career, that moment is the most fulfilling thing in the world and its worth it. So stick in and hopefully youll get rewarded one day like I have today.

Viktor Hovlands pursuit of hitting pure golf shots is really not that complicated,"Golf doesnt have to be that complicated. Viktor Hovland only makes it sound that way. Hovland was confounding as ever at the Valspar Championship. His confidence was so low that he arrived at Innisbrook uncertain if he was even going to play, and then five days later he delivered two clutch swings during the toughest stretch on the Copperhead course to rally for a one-shot victory he never saw coming. Only the trophy was satisfying. Yeah, its still not great, he said when asked if he was happy with his swing. Hovland rarely is. And thats why the 27-year-old Norwegian star could say without sounding offensive how proud he was to win on such a tough golf course with not my best stuff. There is constant searching, not just to win but to hit shots the way he expects. Hovland has questions and he wants answers, and he wont stop looking until he finds them. He is not wired like Dustin Johnson, who made a career-defining decision to go from hitting a draw to hitting a fade. After winning the U.S. Open and a World Golf Championship in consecutive starts in 2016, Johnson was asked how he went about making such a big change. Well, I was just struggling with the draw to get it in the fairway, he replied. So I said, Im going to hit a fade. And I started hitting a fade. Simple, right? Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have had the same swing coach since they were about 8. Hovland has made 11 coaching changes since leaving Oklahoma State in 2019, some of them brought back on more than one occasion. 
        
     What hasnt changed is his mission  to hit pure shots  no matter how many detours. Hovland reached what looked like the summit in August 2023 when he had a 65-61 weekend at Olympia Fields to win the BMW Championship, and then a 66-63 weekend at East Lake to win the Tour Championship and capture the FedEx Cup. He went 3-1-1 at the Ryder Cup, including partnering with Ludvig Aberg for a 9-and-7 win over Scheffler and Brooks Koepka. He returned from a winters break in Norway and felt lost again. It was at Bay Hill a year ago when Hovland was asked the difference between winning without his best stuff or hitting it great and finishing fifth. I guess thats kind of the insane part of my brain is that I just enjoy flushing a golf shot, he said. Obviously, were out here to compete and win tournaments. But I really just cherish being able to hit the shots exactly the way I want to. I think its a better predictor of how youre going to play in the future. Therein lies the secret. He can win without his best stuff because hes very good. What he lacks is consistently strong finishes. He has never gone more than five straight tournaments in the top 10, which pales compared with the elite in the game. But he can contend out of nowhere, such as his third place in the PGA Championship last year at Valhalla when he wondered why he even bothered showing up. That wasnt a threat, more a state of his mind. He also was runner-up at a FedEx Cup playoff event last year. He doesnt doubt his ability, only what he has referred to as the machinery. Perfection in golf is something to chase, not attain. Thats why Hovland was amused at the label of being a perfectionist. I guess you can use that word to describe it, he said. I just view it as if you put your heart and soul into doing something, you might as well do it right. Ive swung the club extremely well and I think my ball striking has been really, really good over a long period of time. And then when its not doing that, Im going to work on that, Im going to figure it out. I find it kind of weird that were professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, Oh hes a perfectionist, hes out on the perimeter searching too much. Thats what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments. Thats worked out just fine for Bryson DeChambeau, renowned for going down rabbit holes and leaving enough bread crumbs to find his way out if needed. Hovland won with intelligent course management and good fortune. He could feel the club being out of position at the top, forcing him to try to save it on the way down. The timing worked in his favor at Innisbrook, particularly that 7-iron to 5 feet on the 16th hole Sunday. And so the trophy from the Valspar Championship is in hand  his 11th worldwide  and the search continues. He is back with Grant Waite (for the second time), and the immediate goal is to be ready for the Masters. Hes not sure the swing he had at Innisbrook will work at Augusta National. The chase continues, with no apologies. When youre struggling with something, its just problems, he said. And problems are usually a lack of information. I would encourage people to go out and seek more information and try it out for yourselves. See if it helps your problems. And if it doesnt, then youve got to seek more answers. And you keep going and keep going. ___ On The Fringe analyzes the biggest topics in golf during the season.

Billy Horschels big putt takes Atlanta Drive to the TGL title in indoor golf,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Billy Horschel made an 18-foot birdie putt down the slope and Patrick Cantlay clinched it with another clutch chip as the Atlanta Drive won the inaugural TGL title on Tuesday night by coming back for a 4-3 victory over New York. Atlanta won both matches in the best-of-3 TGL finals that wrapped up the first season of the high-tech indoor league at the SoFi Center. New York led the entire match and was up 3-2 on the 14th hole when Horschel delivered the biggest shot of the night. Atlanta threw a hammer challenge that New York accepted, making the penultimate hole worth two points. Rickie Fowler was in a bunker. Fowler splashed out to 4 feet. Horschel faced a putt down a sharp ridge that broke two ways, and it turned back to the left and into the cup as Horschel raced off the green, threw his putter and his hat and screamed, My (expletive) house! Two feet out I knew it was in the hole, and I blacked out, Horschel said. New York threw a hammer challenge on the final hole making it worth two points. Cameron Young and Cantlay each missed the green on the par 5. Cantlays pitch from 60 feet checked up and stopped a foot from the hole. Young had to make to force another match, and his pitch narrowly slid by the hole. The Atlanta Drive won $9 million to share among Horschel, Cantlay, Justin Thomas and Lucas Glover, who was inactive for the three-man match. New York received $4.5 million for Young, Fowler, Xander Schauffele and Matt Fitzpatrick. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/tgl-atlanta-drive-billy-horschel-cantlay-3ac082c7d56c3668a7bca61a8e9f33a3,sports
Lynx fall just short after Napheesa Collier leads them to the brink of a fifth WNBA title,"NEW YORK (AP)  Napheesa Collier and the Minnesota Lynx, who both had No. 2 finishes in the regular season, were on the verge of being No. 1 when it mattered most.  The Lynx were seconds away from a record fifth WNBA championship with perhaps a WNBA Finals MVP award waiting for Collier, whose flurry late in regulation had her team in the lead in the final minute. They couldnt hold on. The New York Liberty rallied for a 67-62 victory in overtime, denying the Lynx what would have been a WNBA-record fifth championship. Collier, the runner-up to unanimous MVP Aja Wilson in the regular season, scored 22 points before having to watch the final seconds from the bench after fouling out of a game Minnesota seemed poised to win just a few minutes earlier.  Like coach Cheryl Reeve, who said the game was stolen from the Lynx, she was frustrated with officiating and felt she was being held on some occasions, though credited the Liberty for making adjustments. They turned up the pressure, she said. Its the end of the game. Of course we are both trying to win. They turned up the pressure, and we got a couple turnovers. The Lynx controlled the first half but had fallen into a 56-52 hole on Sabrina Ionescus 3-pointer with 3:10 remaining. Then Collier, who started strong, got going again. She had Minnesotas next three baskets, with her drive past Breanna Stewart giving the Lynx a 60-58 edge with 1:04 to go. 
        
     Obviously the exclamation point to the incredible season that she had, Reeve said. You know, Napheesa showed up big time for this team. Put us in a position to be within seconds of a championship. Phee was phenomenal. But Minnesota wouldnt score again until New York had scored the next seven points, tying it on Stewarts free throws with 5.2 seconds left and going ahead 65-60 in the extra period. Collier finished with seven rebounds, two blocks and a steal. The WNBAs Defensive Player of the Year played all but 35 seconds of the 45-minute game, and most of what she missed is because she committed the foul to stop the clock with 13 seconds remaining in OT. It was clearly a fantastic season for the forward, who averaged 20.4 points and 9.7 rebounds in her sixth year out of UConn. She also won a gold medal with the U.S. Olympic team and helped the Lynx notch a franchise-record 30 wins and earn the No. 2 seed. But if Game 5 plays out differently, she might have also picked up a WNBA Finals MVP trophy, joining the elite Lynx players from the past to have done so.  Sylvia Fowles won it in 2015 and 2017 after their last two championships. Seimone Augustus, enshrined last week in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, was the winner in 2011 and Maya Moore two years later.  The Lynx believe similar accolades could be on the way for Collier. We just have so much confidence in who she is on and off the court, and Im lucky to be alongside of her. Im just in awe, said Kayla McBride, who scored 21 points. Shes had an amazing season and amazing postseason obviously. Cant wait to see what she does in the future. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-finals-lynx-collier-53e90204265169c415e48522db230b35,sports
Coach Cheryl Reeve says WNBA title was stolen from the Lynx during complaints about officiating,"NEW YORK (AP)  Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve said the WNBA championship was stolen from the Lynx during her complaints about the officiating Sunday night. The New York Liberty beat the Lynx 67-62 in Game 5 in overtime, getting there after a disputed foul gave Breanna Stewart two free throws that tied the game with 5.2 seconds remaining in regulation. We know we could have done some things, right, but you shouldnt have to overcome to that extent, Reeve said. This s- aint that hard. Officiating is not that hard. Reeve, who has led the Lynx to four WNBA championships and coached the U.S. women to an Olympic gold medal this summer in Paris, said she was aware there would be headlines about her complaining. Bring it on, she said, because that s- was stolen from us. The Liberty shot 25 free throws, while the Lynx went 7 for 8. Minnesota was called for 21 fouls to New Yorks 17, with All-Star forward Napheesa Collier, the WNBAs Defensive Player of the Year, fouling out. Reeve took particular issue with the foul on Alanna Smith with Minnesota holding a 60-58 lead. Stewart drove into the lane and appeared to take the shot before there was any contact. The Lynx challenged the call, but it was upheld after video review. Reeve called the contact marginal at best. This sucks, she said, after mentioning faulty officiating in Minnesotas loss in the 2016 WNBA Finals. This is for a championship, for both teams. Let them decide it. What contact is legal should be the same for both teams. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-finals-lynx-coach-reeve-a8889ef30bb51ab3dd72f9fbdd4f497d,sports
"New York Liberty win first WNBA championship, more could be on the horizon","NEW YORK (AP)  Breanna Stewart joined the New York Liberty two years ago with one goal in mind: to bring the long-suffering franchise its first championship. WNBA Finals MVP Jonquel Jones soon joined her and the pair helped the Liberty accomplish their mission, a year after they suffered a disappointing loss in the Finals to Las Vegas. The wait was so, so, so worth it, Stewart said. We talked about it two years ago when it was free agency, and we wanted to come together. You look back and me, JJ, (Courtney Vandersloot), we all came together to win a championship. Last year we lost in the Finals. But look at us, now were here. Now with the core group mostly intact, winning more championships might be in the future for Stewart and the Liberty after Sundays 67-62 overtime victory against the Minnesota Lynx in the deciding Game 5 of the WNBA Finals.  She had won two titles before with Seattle, but this was special for her as the only player born in the state of New York on the roster. This is more personal because Im from New York. Im from upstate, she said. I came here for a reason, and thats to win a championship. With Stewart, Jones, Sabrina Ionescu and other key players signed for next year, theres no reason to think the Liberty couldnt repeat. I think its been fun. Hey, lets not stop at one, though. Lets go for two, Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said. Its hard to win because this league is so good. You need a little bit of luck on your side, but you also need talent. You also need talent, the right talent to put together. 
        
     It wont be easy. The league will look different with the addition of Golden State as a 13th team. Theyll also be squads like Minnesota, Las Vegas and others hungry to knock them off. In the past 20 years, only the Aces have repeated as champions, winning in 2022 and 2023. This series was a fitting conclusion to a record-breaking season for the league. All five games came down to the last few possessions and have included two overtime games and a last-second shot, which have led to record ratings. The five games produced a record attendance for a WNBA Finals. Many of those New York fans, dying for a championship in a city known for winning titles in other sports, will celebrate at a parade later this week. It most likely will be in the Canyon of Heroes in downtown Manhattan  right across the bridge from Barclays Center where the Liberty play. Then its on to the offseason with the first order of business for the league and players being whether either side will opt out of the current collective bargaining agreement. They have until Nov. 1 to do it. For now the Liberty can enjoy their first-ever title. They had been this far five times before, losing each time, including last seasons defeat. Some of the great Liberty players of the past like Teresa Weatherspoon and Sue Wicks, who came up short in their time of winning a championship, were in the sellout crowd Sunday to see the team win. I told her I hope you enjoy this because this is for you, Vandersloot said she told Weatherspoon. You laid the foundation and, you know, sometimes it doesnt show right away. ... I hope she feels appreciated because, you know, she kind of started this and now the city has won and that can never be taken away. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-finals-liberty-repeat-bb5df166f2b459b9e469b1d5a2211c35,sports
WNBA players union decides to opt out of current collective bargaining agreement,"NEW YORK (AP)  The WNBA players union has decided to opt out of the current collective bargaining agreement, two years before its expiration. The league and players union had the option to do so before Nov. 1. The early opt-out marks a crucial juncture for the league. The WNBA signed a historic 11-year media rights deal worth $200 million a year. The league had record attendance and viewership this year that culminated in the WNBA Finals that saw New York beat Minnesota in overtime on Sunday in a decisive fifth game. This is a defining moment not just for the WNBA, but for all of us who believe in progress, WNBPA President Nneka Ogwumike said Monday. The world has evolved since 2020 and we cannot afford to stand still. If we stay in the current agreement, we fall behind. This is a new era and we are ready to lead transformational change. The league has been skyrocketing, with 2024 marking a huge breakthrough after years of significant and sustained growth. ESPN had huge increases in ratings with viewership in the regular season going up 170%, according to the union. The current CBA will still cover the 2025 season so the two sides have a year to negotiate a new agreement. With the historic 2024 WNBA season now in the books, we look forward to working together with the players and the WNBAPA on a new CBA that is fair for all and lays the foundation for growth and success for years to come, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. 
        
     Engelbert said at her state-of-the-league address before Game 1 of the Finals that with the new media rights deal in place and many more corporate partners the strength of the league is in a great spot. She also went on to say that the players have been getting a lot more marketing deals, making them into household names. The union said it was hoping for a new economic model that transforms the current system, which imposes arbitrary and restrictive caps on the value and benefits of players. The players want an equity-based model that grows and evolves with the leagues increased business success. Other areas that the union would like to see improved include: salaries, retirement benefits, better child care and family planning benefits. This isnt some sudden wake-up call. Its the culmination of what weve been driving for over the last several seasons, WNBPA vice president Kelsey Plum said. Weve played a key role in the leagues historic growth and now were breaking free from the current system to demand full transparency and an equitable stake in the business weve helped build. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-collective-bargaining-agreement-3fd6c2eb9924689d3a0ea929d309d605,sports

Falcons GM Fontenot says he was not surprised QB Kirk Cousins reported for offseason program,"ATLANTA (AP)  The status of quarterback Kirk Cousins remains a backdrop to the Atlanta Falcons plans for the NFL draft after he surprised some observers by reporting for the first day of the teams voluntary offseason program. Falcons general manager Terry Fontenot said Wednesday he was not surprised Cousins was present for Tuesdays first day of the offseason program.  I wouldnt say a surprise, Fontenot said. This is a voluntary thing. Whether a player comes or doesnt come we have a lot of good professionals who we know are going to take care of their bodies, including Kirk. Fontenot has said the team is comfortable in having Cousins, 36, remain with the team as the backup to starter Michael Penix Jr., the teams 2024 first-round pick. Coach Raheem Morris said the team is open to listening to trade offers. At the NFL meetings in Palm Beach, Florida, this month, Morris said the Falcons still feel very strongly about Kirk being our backup quarterback. Morris also acknowledged Cousins would like an opportunity to start, even if for another team. We wont hold him back if opportunity presents itself, Morris said. Hes made it clear hed like to be a starter. There has been speculation the Falcons could cut Cousins, who signed a four-year, $180 million contract last March that included $100 million guaranteed. Cousins led the Falcons to a 6-3 start last season but lost his job after struggling with interceptions. 
        
     Any team expecting Cousins to be released would be less likely to make a trade offer for the veteran. Cousins presence at the first day of the offseason program supports the teams stance that he remains in the plans for the 2025 season and will not be released. Fontenot refuted a report the Falcons were asking any team trading for Cousins to pick up $20 million of his remaining guaranteed salary. We havent put a number on it, Fontenot said. We wouldnt share specific conversations, but to answer your question we wouldnt put a specific number on it. The Falcons could have saved a $10 million roster bonus by releasing Cousins. Instead, he is guaranteed $27.5 million, plus the $10 million bonus, in 2025. The Falcons were 1-2 with Penix as the starter for an 8-9 final record. They have only five picks in the NFL draft, including the No. 15 overall selection in Thursday nights first round. Atlanta added depth at quarterback this week by signing Easton Stick, a fifth-round draft pick by the Los Angeles Chargers in 2019. Stick played in only six games in six seasons. Stick joins Emory Jones on the depth chart behind Penix and Cousins. The Falcons could be interested in including Cousins in a draft-day trade as they look for pass rush help. They have the No. 46 overall pick in the second round and then one pick in the fourth round and two in the seventh. Were going to do whats best for this football team, whether thats a trade or whatever it is, Fontenot said when asked about his interest in trading Cousins. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/falcons-cousins-nfl-draft-d83a09d51af600d505e2c0ddc177dff4,sports
NFL shines spotlight on flag football as the draft takes over Green Bay,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP)  While the NFL draft takes over Titletown and Lambeau Field, the league is leveraging the excitement surrounding its premier offseason event to promote flag football. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Cam Ward, Travis Hunter and other draft prospects participated in a flag football skills clinic with middle school students and 75 Special Olympics athletes on Wednesday. Ward, Hunter, Abdul Carter and other players tossed passes and led drills. Goodell also joined in and posed for pictures with the special Olympians. I just hope they learn they got to work hard, Ward said. They gotta push themselves to how far they think they cant push themselves. Theres a lot of days where I wanted to quit but I didnt quit. Former NFL players Bobby Taylor and Mike Daniels also led a flag football training clinic for students on Tuesday. Six high school girls flag football players will be backstage Thursday night to hand off hats to the prospects who are drafted. On Saturday, girls flag players from Oneida Nation High School will announce one of the draft picks on stage thanks to Packers quarterback Jordan Love and Toyota. Having the NFL draft here in Green Bay, and obviously, flag football, especially girls flag football, its a growing sport, Love said. So were giving a girls flag football team in the area of Green Bay the opportunity to come out, get on stage during Day 3 of the NFL draft, actually go up there and announce a draft pick. We are empowering them and hopefully giving them an opportunity to visualize what a future in football looks like and making it to that pinnacle of the top. 
        
     Love has also teamed up with Toyota, presenting sponsor of NFL Flag League Play, to increase opportunities for flag football players. Theyre covering registration fees for all NFL Flag teams within a 25-mile radius of the Green Bay area. The NFLs goals of expanding flag football starts with Goodell. The league played a major role in getting flag football included in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Flag football has been growing dramatically here in the states as well as internationally, Goodell said earlier this month. Its brought young women into the sport and its given them a chance to play, which I think is incredibly valuable to our future and rewarding. So now to put it on that Olympic stage is really putting a seal of approval. And frankly its going to be a stage where a lot of athletes are going to want to participate in, including former and current players, so well to have to work through it. I think its a great opportunity for the athletes, a great opportunity for the NFL and I think itll be a great opportunity for people to understand football and what it brings to the world. Many NFL star players have already said theyd like to play flag football in the Olympics. But the league and the players union still have to figure out if thats possible. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/nfl-draft-flag-football-c3b201766ab64fd9ef9c8b25e814814a,sports
Panthers wont host fans at training camp for 2 years because of construction at practice fields,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Carolina Panthers fans will have to wait until at least 2027 before watching the team go through drills at training camp. The team announced on Wednesday that it will be unable to host fans at its new Charlotte-based training camp site because of ongoing construction of the teams new indoor practice facility, which is being completed in phases to maximize the amount of field space. Only one practice will be open for fans, which is the teams annual FanFest held inside Bank of American Stadium on Aug. 2. Panthers quarterback Bryce Young said on a conference call Wednesday the news is super unfortunate. We love that fan interaction, the support, the community, the environment that is really one of the highlights of the year for us, Young said. That is something we are definitely going to miss. The Panthers held training camp at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, for decades, but owner David Tepper moved it to Charlotte last year. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/carolina-panthers-nfl-training-camp-8a480350c66bb66ddbf0ae6ede9b492e,sports
Colin Blackwell gets his chance and rises to occasion for Stars with OT winner in NHL playoffs,"DALLAS (AP)  Colin Blackwell was hoping for another crack at the playoffs when he signed with the Dallas Stars in free agency last summer. This is his sixth team in seven NHL seasons, and he had only been in the postseason one other time.  After being a healthy scratch for the Stars playoff opener, he got his shot and changed the trajectory of their first-round series against Colorado with his overtime goal for a 4-3 win in Game 2 on Monday night.  I always felt my games kinda built for the playoffs and stuff along those lines. I love rising to the occasion and playing in moments like this Blackwell said. That was a big win for us. I think if we go into Colorado down 2-0, its a different series. I think thats why youre only as good as your next win or your next shift. Blackwells only previous playoff experience was a seven-game series with Toronto in a first-round loss to Tampa Bay three years ago.  Stars coach Pete DeBoer talked to Blackwell when he didnt play in Game 1 on Saturday.  (I) said be ready, youre not going to be out long, DeBoer said. I wanted to get him in Game 2. Hes one of those energy guys. I thought after losing Game 1 we needed a little shot of energy. Hes a competitive player and I thought he was effective all night. But its also great to see a guy like that get a goal, out Game 1, work with the black aces, and then come in and play a part in playoff hockey. Blackwell scored 17:46 into overtime after his initial shot ricocheted off teammate Sam Steel and Avs defenseman Samuel Girard in front of the net. But with the puck rolling loose on the ice, the fourth-line forward circled around and knocked it in for the winner.  
        
     The 32-year-old Blackwell, a Harvard graduate who played for Chicago the past two seasons, said he has often had to go in and out of lineups and has learned over the years to stay sharp mentally and keep working hard on and off the ice. In his first season for Dallas, he had 17 points (six goals, 11 assists) over 63 regular-season games.  Its been a long season, and not playing the first game, stuff like that, just kind of been in and out of the lineup toward the end here, he said. I dont really worry about making a mistake. I just go out there and play hockey and good things happen. And they certainly did for the Stars, who were in danger of dropping their first two games at home in the first round for the second year in a row before his winning shot. Game 3 is Wednesday night in Denver. Colins one of those guys, especially me being out, I get to see how hard he works every day, said Tyler Seguin, who missed 4 1/2 months after hip surgery before returning last week. I get to see how he is in the gym. I get to see how good of a basketball player he is. Theres many things that I get to see with some of these guys that are in and out of the lineup. Youre just proud of a guy like him and what he did. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/blackwell-stars-nhl-playoffs-4aab05abba9ac6c14a06e1704e8951ae,sports
"Mets OF Brandon Nimmo breaks out of slump, drives in 9 to tie franchise record","WASHINGTON (AP)  Brandon Nimmo got a chance to go over his breakout performance with New York Mets first base coach Antoan Richardson. With a grand slam and nine RBIs on the day, there was a lot to talk about. Hes like Well, nine ribbies, thats got to be a career high, right? Nimmo said. And I was like Yeah, that definitely is. I didnt know it tied (a) franchise record, but I did know how many RBIs I had. I think before this my career high was five and that was an amazing day as well. These days dont come around that often and you kind of sit back and enjoy it. Nimmos performance powered the Mets to a 19-5 victory over the Washington Nationals. He equaled the franchise record for RBIs set by Carlos Delgado in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees on June 27, 2008. The 32-year-old outfielder hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning and his second career slam in the seventh. He also doubled home two runs in the eighth. He became the third player with nine or more RBIs in a three-inning span within a game since RBI became an official statistic in 1920, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He joined Ivn Rodrguez in the first three innings on April 13, 1999, and Sammy Sosa in the third through fifth innings on Aug. 20, 2002. Nimmo finished with four hits in his seventh career multihomer game, raising his batting average from .192 to .218. He hit .149 (7 for 47) with no extra-base hits in his previous 12 games. 
        
     Hes a really good player, Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. Hes a good hitter. At some point, you know those guys are going to come out of it. Its part of a big league season where at times its going to be hard. And then youll see games like this. Hopefully, well start seeing the Nimmo we all know. Nimmos previous career high was five RBIs at Atlanta on April 8, 2024. He went deep four times in his first 14 games this year, but he had struggled to produce since then. He had his first multihit game since April 13 in Fridays series opener, then followed it up with back-to-back 0-for-4 performances. Ive been hitting the ball harder lately, and thats usually a good sign, Nimmo said. Where theres smoke, theres fire, usually. Just trying to stay with it and keep trusting that it would come along. Nimmos sixth-inning homer off reliever Colin Poche bumped New Yorks lead to 6-0, and his grand slam off Cole Henry made it 11-0. His two-run double against Eduardo Salazar extended New Yorks advantage to 13-0. Nimmo got another plate appearance in the ninth, but he grounded out right after Mark Vientos homered off infielder Amed Rosario. I was thinking Man, it would be really cool to get double-digit RBIs in a day when I was coming up before Swaggy hit the three-run homer, Nimmo said. Was not able to get over the top of that. But hey, its still really awesome to me all the same to be able to be in Mets history like that. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/mets-nimmo-6edf94f487d4f704646e6c74fc03a820,sports
"Sacramento State hires Shaquille ONeal as a voluntary GM, AP source says","Hall of Famer Shaquille ONeal has agreed to become the general manager of the mens basketball program at Sacramento State under new coach Mike Bibby. A person familiar with the situation said Monday that ONeal will take the voluntary job for the program that his son, Shaqir, recently joined as a player. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the school hadnt made an announcement. ESPN first reported the news. Bibby, the former NBA star for the Sacramento Kings, was hired as head coach for the Hornets last month as the school tries to raise its profile in collegiate athletics. One of the first additions Bibby made was signing Shaqir ONeal as a transfer from Florida A&M. Now Bibby has ONeals father involved in the program. ONeal is the latest high-profile athlete to take on a general manager role at a college program. Stephen Curry was recently announced as the assistant general manager at Davidson and Trae Young has that same role at Oklahoma. ONeal won four NBA titles, three NBA Finals MVPs and a league MVP during his 19-year career in the NBA. He is currently an analyst on TNTs Inside the NBA show. He also served as a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013-22. Sacramento State went 7-25 this season under interim coach Michael Czepil, who was promoted last spring after David Patrick left to take a job as associate head coach at LSU. 
        
     The Hornets had gone 28-42 in two seasons under Patrick and the program has never made an NCAA Tournament since moving up to Division I in 1991-92. The Hornets have had a winning record only twice since then, going 16-14 in 2019-20 and 21-12 in 2014-15. ___ AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/sacramento-state-shaquille-oneal-gm-069ffa85a02b5040837302937af1486c,sports
"Twins get season-high 17 hits, Bailey Ober allows 1 run in 7 2/3 innings in 11-1 rout of Guardians","CLEVELAND (AP)  Jonah Bride had three of Minnesotas 17 hits, Bailey Ober allowed one run in 7 2/3 innings and the Minnesota Twins rolled to an 11-1 victory over the Cleveland Guardians on Monday night. Minnesota had 10 players with hits, the first time the Twins had done that since last June against the Athletics. Six players had at least two hits, including Ryan Jeffers, who had a two-run homer and three RBIs. Edouard Julien also went deep for the Twins, who have won four straight and six of seven. Ty France and Byron Buxton both had two hits and each drove in a pair of runs. Ober (3-1) has won his last three starts. Cleveland has allowed 24 runs in the past two games and its taxed pitching staff saw Paul Sewald leave in the fifth inning due to right shoulder inflammation. Shortstop Will Wilson pitched the last two innings, allowing Jeffers homer. Starter Gavin Williams (2-2) allowed four runs and seven hits in two innings. Steven Kwan extended his hitting streak to 11 games for the Guardians, who have lost three straight and four of five. Julien jumped on a fastball by Williams that was up in the strike zone and drove it over the center-field wall for his fourth career leadoff homer. It was the second time in the homestand a Guardians starter allowed a first-pitch homer after the New York Yankees Ben Rice off Tanner Bibee last Tuesday. Minnesota had a season high in hits and was 8 for 14 with runners in scoring position. Right-hander Chris Paddock (0-3, 6.45 ERA) goes for Minnesota.

Martinez pitches 6 sparkling innings as the Reds beat the Cardinals 3-1 for their 5th straight win,"CINCINNATI (AP)  Nick Martinez pitched six sparkling innings, and the Cincinnati Reds beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1 on Monday night for their fifth straight win. Martinez (1-3) allowed one run and five hits in the opener of a seven-game homestand. Graham Ashcraft and Tony Santillan each got three outs before Emilio Pagn finished the five-hitter for his eighth save. Jose Trevino homered for Cincinnati, and Noelvi Marte drove in the go-ahead run with his first career triple. Reds star Elly De La Cruz doubled in the first to extend his hitting streak to a career-high 12 games, and Gavin Lux collected three hits, including two doubles, to run his hitting streak to a career-best 12. St. Louis right-hander Andre Pallante (2-2) allowed three runs and six hits in six innings. Lars Nootbaar doubled and scored on Nolan Arenados two-out double in the first against Martinez. But the Reds tied it when Trevino hit a leadoff drive in the third for his second homer. Lux singled and scored on Martes triple in the fourth, and Lux doubled home Austin Hays in the sixth. Cincinnatis Matt McLain singled in the seventh to end a career-worst 0-for-21 slump. The Cardinals had two on and nobody out in the fifth. Trevino pounced on a Masyn Winn bunt and threw to third for the first out, and Martinez escaped the jam when he induced a double-play grounder from Nootbaar.

OHearns 3-run homer leads Orioles over Yankees 4-3,"BALTIMORE (AP)  Ryan OHearn hit a three-run home run off Will Warren and the Baltimore Orioles held on for a 4-3 victory over the New York Yankees on Monday night. Ramn Laureano doubled in Baltimores other run, and 35-year-old Japanese rookie Tomoyuki Sugano (3-1) struck out a career-high eight over five scoreless innings to help Baltimore stop a three-game losing streak. Aaron Judge, hitting a major league-leading .405, had two hits to extend his on-base streak to 25 games and drove in New Yorks first run when he hit into a forceout against Yennier Cano in the seventh inning. Anthony Volpe and Austin Wells hit consecutive RBI doubles with one out in the eighth off Gregory Soto, who struck out Jasson Domnguez and retired Oswaldo Cabrera on a groundout. Flix Bautista struck out Judge and Cody Bellinger during a perfect ninth for his fourth save. In his first appearance since being demoted from his role as Yankees closer, Devin Williams pitched a 1-2-3 eighth but started all three batters with balls. He lowered his ERA to 10.000. Warren (1-1) allowed all six hits in 3 1/3 innings, walking Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman ahead of OHearns homer on an up sweeper. Paul Goldschmidt drove Suganos final pitch of the night to deep center.

Tyler Glasnow is the latest Dodgers starting pitcher to hit the injured list,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Right-hander Tyler Glasnow has been placed on the 15-day injured list by the Los Angeles Dodgers with right shoulder inflammation in the latest setback for the defending World Series champions perpetually injury-plagued pitching staff. Glasnow went on the IL one day after leaving his second straight start early due to shoulder discomfort Sunday. He allowed two homers in the first inning against Pittsburgh, but returned to warm up for the second inning before exiting. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Monday that Glasnow developed overall body soreness in addition to his shoulder woes. Theres the mechanics piece of it, theres the uncomfortable, not feeling right, Roberts said. As Tyler said, very frustrating, and were all just trying to get to the bottom of it. For the second consecutive season, Glasnow has joined an alarmingly long list of Dodgers pitchers with significant injury problems. Top-line starters Glasnow, Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Clayton Kershaw (recovery from toe and knee surgery) are on the injured list, along with Blake Treinen (right forearm tightness), Michael Kopech (right shoulder), Brusdar Graterol (right shoulder surgery) and several other relievers. Pitching is certainly volatile, Roberts said. We experienced it last year  I think every year. I think the thing thats probably most disconcerting is leading Major League Baseball in bullpen innings. I think that thats something the starters are built up to take those innings down, so thats sort of where my head is at, to make sure we dont red-line these guys. 
        
     The 6-foot-8 Glasnow has a lengthy injury history, but the Dodgers still signed him to a five-year, $136.5 million contract after acquiring the LA-area native from Tampa Bay in December 2023. Glasnow was solid to begin his debut season with the Dodgers, going 9-6 with a 3.49 ERA and a 0.95 WHIP  but he didnt pitch after Aug. 11, developing elbow tendinitis that kept him out of the postseason. Glasnow altered his delivery and his between-starts routine in an attempt to stay healthier, but he only got through five starts and 18 innings this season before his latest injury woes, going 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA. Snell, who got a $182 million free-agent deal from deep-pocketed Los Angeles last November, made only two starts for his new team before going on the shelf this month. The Dodgers used 17 starting pitchers during the 2024 regular season while their rotation was altered almost weekly by major injuries. Los Angeles won the World Series while relying on an October starting rotation of late-season acquisition Jack Flaherty, Yoshinobu Yamamoto (who missed three months of the regular season) and Walker Buehler (who also missed three months) along with multiple bullpen games. Flaherty and Buehler departed in free agency when the Dodgers declined to re-sign them. Gavin Stone, who led LA with 25 starts last season, is out for the entire 2025 season after right shoulder surgery. The Dodgers high-priced starting rotation is thin yet again in 2025: LA will have to throw a bullpen game Tuesday against the Miami Marlins, while former All-Star right-hander Tony Gonsolin will return to the mound Wednesday to make his first start since August 2023 after recovering from Tommy John surgery. Gonsolins return is part of the good news for the Dodgers staff. Dustin May, Mondays starter, is also back in the rotation after missing two years with injuries, while Yamamoto and newcomer Roki Sasaki have remained healthy this month. And two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is expected to make his Dodgers debut on the mound in the first half of this season, although the team hasnt set a timeline. Roberts isnt sure how he will fill out his rotation when the Dodgers begin a road trip with 10 games in 10 days on Friday in Atlanta. The Dodgers might stretch out reliever Ben Casparius, a longtime starting pitcher before he reached the majors. The Dodgers recalled right-handed reliever Noah Davis to fill Glasnows roster spot. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/dodgers-tyler-glasnow-injured-bf4f3acfe090abdfa03b7fc9e24da2ec,sports
Laura Stacey scores in OT as Victoire beat Fleet 3-2 after blowing 2-goal lead,"LAVAL, Quebec (AP)  Laura Stacey scored with 4:17 into overtime to give the Montreal Victoire a 3-2 victory over the Boston Fleet on Monday night. It was Staceys 11th goal of the season and fourth game-winner as Montreal secured home-ice advantage in the opening round of the Professional Womens Hockey League playoffs. If the Toronto Sceptres lose on Tuesday against the New York Sirens, Montreal will clinch first place. Boston forced overtime with two late goals 39 seconds apart, but it wasnt enough to pull out the victory. Montreal opened the scoring on the power play when Jennifer Gardiner came off the bench to knock in the rebound after Abby Boreens shot rang off the post. The goal came on the Victoires third power play of the game. Montreals power play struck again 4:48 into the third period when Catherine Dubois tipped a shot by Maureen Murphy for her fifth goal of the season. Boston goaltender Klara Peslarova made 33 saves in the loss. Boston cut the lead to 2-1 with 2:46 remaining with a short-handed goal by Hannah Brandt. Hannah Bilka tied the game just 39 seconds later. Ann-Renee Desbiens, who made 27 saves, earned her league-leading 14th win of the season. Fleet: The injury-riddled Fleet missed a chance to secure their playoff fate. Victoire: Montreals second power-play unit was on the ice for Montreals first two goals as they try to get their depth scoring going. 
        
     Boston scored two goals in 39 seconds late in the third period to tie the game and send it to overtime. When Gardiner opened the scoring, it was the first PWHL goal scored on Peslarova in her first 125:40 of game time spanning parts of three games.

Altuve and Walker each hit a 2-run homer to help the Astros beat the Tigers 8-5,"HOUSTON (AP)  Jose Altuve hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning that sent the Houston Astros to an 8-5 win over the Detroit Tigers on Monday night. Christian Walker also had a two-run shot in the fourth to begin Houstons comeback from a 3-0 deficit. The Astros still trailed by one when Jeremy Pea singled in the sixth. Altuve followed with his drive off Jack Flaherty (1-3) that crashed off the wall above the left-field seats to put Houston up 4-3. Altuve had two hits and three RBIs while batting second for the first time since 2023. He asked to move out of the leadoff spot to give him more time to get ready to hit in the first inning after coming in from the outfield. The nine-time All-Star moved to left field this year after spending his first 14 major league seasons playing second base. Houstons victory snapped a four-game winning streak for the Tigers, who got two homers from Riley Greene and one from Kerry Carpenter but managed just two other hits. The Astros tacked on four runs in the seventh with the help of sloppy defense by the Tigers. Rookie shortstop Trey Sweeney made throwing errors on consecutive plays with no outs to put runners at second and third. Mauricio Dubn singled to score them both and extend the lead. Houston added runs on a groundout by Altuve and an RBI single by Yordan Alvarez to push it to 8-3. Houston starter Ronel Blanco allowed three hits and three runs while striking out six in five innings. Steven Okert (1-0) worked a scoreless sixth for the win. Josh Hader pitched the ninth for his eighth save.  Flaherty yielded six hits and four runs  both season highs  in five-plus innings.

Soderstrom hits a 2-run double as the As knock off the Rangers 2-1,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  Tyler Soderstrom hit a two-run double to help JP Sears and the Athletics beat the Texas Rangers 2-1 on Monday night. Sears (4-2) struck out seven in 5 2/3 innings. He allowed one run and five hits in the opener of a seven-game trip. The As went ahead to stay in the fifth. Gio Urshela hit a leadoff double and Brent Rooker reached on a two-out walk. Soderstrom then drove a 1-1 pitch from Patrick Corbin into the right-field corner, giving him 24 RBIs on the season. The Rangers got one back when Kyle Higashioka doubled and scored on Jonah Heims two-out single in the sixth. Mitch Spence then came in and allowed a single and a walk to load the bases before retiring Adolis Garca on a popup to second. Spence also worked the seventh and Tyler Ferguson pitched a 1-2-3 eighth before Mason Miller earned his ninth save. Miller, who had 21 strikeouts and just one walk in his first 10 innings, walked Marcus Semien to begin the ninth before retiring the next three batters. Corbin (2-1) allowed seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. He threw 93 pitches, 56 for strikes. The Athletics (15-14) have won nine of 13. The Rangers (15-14) finished with six hits in their seventh loss in 10 games. Garca struck out swinging before pinch-hitter Dustin Harris bounced to second base for the final out of the game. The Athletics have scored 123 runs  fifth in the AL  while the Rangers are last with 87.  Jacob deGrom (0-1, 3.33 ERA) starts Tuesday for the Rangers in the second game in the four-game set.

Braves win 6-3 to hand Rockies their 7th straight loss and drop them to MLB-worst 4-24,"DENVER (AP)  Bryce Elder pitched six solid innings, Michael Harris II hit a tiebreaking double in the fifth and the Atlanta Braves beat the skidding Colorado Rockies 6-3 on Monday night. Colorado has dropped seven straight games and 15 of 16 to fall to 4-24, the worst record in the majors. Elder (1-1) gave up a three-run homer in the first to Hunter Goodman but settled down to scatter three hits the rest of the way. He struck out four and walked two in matching his season high for innings. Raisel Iglesias struck out Brenton Doyle looking with a runner aboard to earn his fifth save. Nick Allen had three hits and Eli White, Alex Verdugo and Sean Murphy added two apiece for Atlanta, which has won eight of 10 following a 5-13 start. The Rockies led 3-0 on Goodmans fifth homer but Atlanta chipped away. The Braves got two runs in the third and tied it in the fourth on Allens RBI single. Harris put Atlanta ahead when he laced a two-out double to right-center off Ryan Feltner (0-2). The Braves added a run in the seventh on Murphys single. Jordan Beck led off the bottom of the eighth with his second double and Ryan McMahon followed with a walk. But then Daysbel Hernndez got Goodman to fly out and fanned Michael Toglia before Mickey Moniak lined out to first base to end the threat. Colorado starters fell to 2-18 this season. Antonio Senzatela and Chase Dollander, who won his major league debut, are the only members of the rotation with a win. Colorado will send RHP Germn Mrquez (0-4, 9.30 ERA) to the mound for the second game of the series.

Edman delivers in 10th as Dodgers weather Myers pinch-hit slam for 7-6 win over Marlins,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Tommy Edman hit a two-run single in the 10th inning and the Los Angeles Dodgers blew a five-run lead before rallying to beat the Miami Marlins 7-6 on Monday night. Teoscar Hernndez homered in his third consecutive game for the Dodgers, who opened a three-game series with their third straight win in hair-raising fashion. Dane Myers delivered a pinch-hit grand slam as Miami rallied from a five-run deficit in the sixth, and the Marlins went up 6-5 in the 10th on Jess Snchezs RBI double off Kirby Yates (3-1). But then Andy Pages drew a leadoff walk from Ronny Henriquez (1-1) in the bottom half, and Kik Hernndez bunted both runners over before Edmans drive to right comfortably scored Michael Conforto and Pages. Dustin May yielded three runs on five singles and three walks while pitching into the sixth for the Dodgers. He has lasted at least five innings in all five starts since his return from a nearly two-year injury absence, providing stability to an ailing rotation that took another blow Monday when Tyler Glasnow went on the injured list. Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts had early RBI singles before Miguel Rojas added a two-out RBI double in the fourth against the team with which he spent eight seasons. May gave up Eric Wagamans RBI single in the sixth before Anthony Banda blew the rest of the lead on Myers first career grand slam. 
        
     Kik Hernndezs sacrifice bunt drew a loud ovation from Dodgers fans, and Edman ended it on Henriquezs next pitch. Teoscar Hernndez hit a two-run shot in the fifth. Its the 2024 Home Run Derby champs ninth homer already this season, tied for third-most in the majors. Miami ace Sandy Alcntara (2-2, 6.56 ERA) makes the sixth start of his unimpressive-to-date season Tuesday.

Family of Ecuadorian soccer player rescued after being kidnapped,"QUITO, Ecuador (AP)  The family of Ecuadorian soccer player Jackson Rodrguez was rescued after being kidnapped from their home in the coastal city of Guayaquil, police authorities reported on Friday. Rodriguez, 26, hid under his bed while his 24-year-old wife and five-year-old son were taken on Wednesday by four hooded and heavily armed individuals who forced their way into the home in the Mucho Lote neighborhood. The wife and son received medical attention following their release and were safe, police commander Pablo Dvila said. The kidnappers demanded $500,000 for the release of the wife and son but the family refused to pay, Dvila added. Rodriguez is a left back who plays for first division club Emelec. After police operations late Thursday, officers located the pair in the popular neighborhood of El Fortn in the northwest part of the city. The area is considered one of the most dangerous, a place where 22 people were massacred in March.  Guayaquil is 270 kilometers (170 miles) southwest of the capital, Quito. The kidnapping occurred amid a state of emergency declared 10 days ago by the government in nine areas of the country, including the province of Guayas, to which Guayaquil belongs. The measure allows the mobilization of security forces in those territories to combat the operations of organized crime groups, which authorities blame for the wave of violence. Insecurity and crime have plagued Ecuador for four years, with an increase in the first few months of the year, according to the government. From January to March, 2,345 violent deaths were reported, 742 of them in Guayaquil. 
        
     The port city is considered one of the most dangerous areas in the country. From those ports, illegal drug shipments are sent to Europe, Central America, and the United States, according to authorities. Other athletes have been targeted in the past. Last December, Liga de Quito soccer player Pedro Perlaza was kidnapped in Esmeraldas, 182 kilometers northwest of Quito, and rescued a few days later. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-soccer-kidnapping-rodriguez-4508e712d75c447d5321ea44b6e5e022,sports
Copa del Rey referee denounces Real Madrid video discrediting him before final,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  The referee for the Copa del Rey final got emotional on Friday when he described the verbal abuse his child suffers because of criticism his profession receives from soccers top clubs  in his case led by Real Madrid. Ricardo de Burgos Bengoechea expressed his anguish to reporters after Madrids club-owned television station aired a video supposedly documenting his bias against the club. To see your son come from school crying because some kids have said his dad is a crook is very hard to take, De Burgos said as he choked up. What I do is tell my son that his father is honorable. I make mistakes, like any athlete, but I am honorable, he said. I want my son to be proud of his father and of the refereeing profession.  Nobody has the right to submit my colleagues to what they are dealing with. The Real Madrid TV video claimed that Madrid won 64% of its games refereed by De Burgos, compared to 81% won by Barcelona under his watch. An unnamed voice called it an incredible difference while also questioning his talent and showing images of his alleged errors. The video was accompanied by dramatic music. It failed to say who the opponents were in those matches or if they were played home or away. Many neutral observers see this as Madrid attempting to pressure referees before games.  Madrid faces Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday in Seville. 
        
     The clubs TV has made it a regular practice to air videos discrediting referees. Its part of a hostile publicity campaign the club has launched this season against soccers rule keepers. In February, the club sent a letter to the Spanish Football Federation claiming that the record 36-time league champion was being routinely harmed by refereeing decisions. It said decisions against Real Madrid have reached a point that the adulteration and manipulation of the competition cannot be ignored. Another referee who red-carded Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham for cursing at him was reported by some Spanish media outlets of having business activities that meant a conflict of interest with refereeing. The federation looked into the matter before clearing him of any suspicions. De Burgos spoke along with video assistant referee Pablo Gonzlez Fuertes at the now customary pre-Copa del Rey press conference for the referee crew, a rare moment for referees to be questioned by the press. Gonzlez Fuertes supported his fellow referee and launched a warning that Spains referees were going to take unspecified actions to curtail attacks on their honor. Do not have the least doubt that we are going to have to start taking more serious measures, Gonzlez Fuertes said, without giving details. He added that he was worried that the verbal hate referees receive from players and as well on social media could have real-world consequences. One day we will have a real problem and we will all hold our heads and condemn what happened, but who will be held responsible for the situation? Madrid fired back at the referees, calling their statements unacceptable in a statement issued late Friday. These statements, which have surprisingly placed in the spotlight videos made by a media outlet protected by freedom of expression, such as Realmadrid TV, made in a premeditated manner 24 hours ahead of the final against one of its participants, demonstrate, once again, these referees clear and manifest animosity and hostility towards Real Madrid, the club said. The powerhouse said it hoped the federation sanctions the referees. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/referees-real-madrid-video-9376adf6456d8771ed3c4d07776e2553,sports
Nice shocks PSG and ends champions hopes of unbeaten Ligue 1 season,"PARIS (AP)  Paris Saint-Germains bid to go unbeaten in Ligue 1 was ruined on Friday when it lost to Nice 3-1. PSGs first home defeat in almost a year was a shock reverse for a club which clinched the French league title three weeks ago and was shifting its focus to the Champions League semifinal first leg at Arsenal on Tuesday. Coach Luis Enrique rested several starters but it was still one-way traffic as PSG dominated the early stages. However, profligate finishing and an inspired performance by Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka kept PSG scoreless. Nices Morgan Sanson broke the deadlock when Badredine Bouananis elegant through ball left him with only Gianluigi Donnarumma to beat and he slipped the ball neatly under the keeper. Nices lead, however, lasted only five minutes. PSGs Fabin Ruiz turned inside the box and fired home a neat chip over the defense from Ousmane Dembl. Nice did the unlikely again a minute into the second half and once more it was Sanson who did the damage, scoring with a spectacular scissor kick volley. Even with the introduction of Bradley Barcola, Gonalo Ramos, Warren Zaire-Emery, and Lucas Beraldo, the home side failed to react and, incredibly, Nice scored again. An unmarked Youssouf Ndayishimiye headed home the third in the 70th. The win lifted Nice into fourth place, equal on points with Monaco and a point behind second-placed Marseille. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/psg-nice-ligue1-champion-898ba0513d81c7848a315dd48c41006b,sports
Briscoe tries to move past devastating penalties and Blaney to start on pole in NASCAR Atlanta race,"HAMPTON, Ga. (AP)  A massive fine left Chase Briscoe facing a huge points deficit heading into Sundays NASCAR Cup Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Even so, Briscoe insists he feels no new pressure. He says he already felt an urgency to win this week because those are the expectations at Joe Gibbs Racing, his new NASCAR home.  I mean, I feel like Im in a must-win situation just starting at JGR, Briscoe said Saturday. Like you need to be winning at JGR. ... So yeah, I dont feel like it changes anything from that standpoint. Ryan Blaney won the pole on Saturday for Sundays race. Two other Team Penske drivers, Austin Cindric and Joey Logano, will start second and fourth, respectively. Hopefully the first stage you can control but its not going to stay that way the whole race, Blaney said of the potential for the teammates to help each other. Briscoe won the pole for last weeks Daytona 500 and then finished fourth before NASCAR announced on Wednesday its inspection found Briscoe used a modified spoiler on the No. 19 Toyota in time trials. Joe Gibbs Racing was docked 100 driver/owner points and 10 playoff points and fined $100,000. Also, crew chief James Small was suspended for four races. Small is still coordinating Briscoes plan for Sundays race as the team appeals the devastating penalties. Briscoe was left with negative 67 points and dropped from 10th to 39th in the standings. 
        
     You know, if we dont win the appeal, youve kind of used up your mulligans, Briscoe said. Briscoe acknowledged I was bummed on Wednesday before realizing he had to approach the Atlanta race with the same goal for his No. 19 Toyota. William Byron surged from ninth on the final lap of overtime to win the Daytona 500, giving the Hendrick Motorsports driver a repeat win in the sports biggest race. Daniel Suarez won in Atlanta last February, edging Blaney and Kyle Busch in Atlantas closest finish. Suarez beat Blaney by only 0.003 seconds, the narrowest margin at any 1.5-mile track. Logano won Atlantas second race last year in the opener of the NASCAR playoffs. Briscoe qualified 25th in his Toyota. Suarez will start 29th. Josh Berry qualified third as Ford drivers earned 10 of the top 11 spots in the lineup. Kyle Busch qualified sixth in his Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing. Chase Elliott, who won in Atlanta, his home track, in 2022, opened this season by winning the Clash. Byron will start 16th, Kyle Larson will be 17th and Elliott 19th as Hendrick Motorsports drivers will be looking for a third straight win to launch the season. The last year a team won the Clash and the first two points races was in 1997 when Hendrick Motorsports Jeff Gordon won the first three races. Ryan Preece, who will start 11th, said I feel fine following a scary crash at Daytona in which his No. 60 Ford became airborne and flipped. It was the second time his car flipped at Daytona, following another terrifying crash in 2023 that left him with two black eyes the following week. Preece had no black eyes on Saturday but said he hopes he doesnt have another similar scare. I joke with my wife that Im like a cat with nine lives right now, Preece said. You dont want to use all nine of them. Martin Truex Jr., who retired from full-time racing after last season and finished 38th in the Daytona 500, will have his Cup Series-leading streak of consecutive starts end at 685, the sixth-longest all-time. The streak began at the 2006 Daytona 500. Logano now holds the longest active start streak in the Cup. Atlanta is his 578th consecutive race. NASCAR celebrated its TV ratings win for last weeks Daytona 500, despite a lengthy rain delay. The Daytona 500 telecast on Fox earned a 3.42 household rating with an average of 6.8 million viewers to finish ahead of the NBA All-Star game and the NHLs 4 Nations Tournament game between USA and Canada.  The rating excluded the rain coverage during the delay of more than three hours. NASCAR was happy to report the rain delay coverage averaged 4.95 million viewers and if considered a separate event would have ranked as the weeks No. 2 telecast, behind only the Daytona 500. Blaney and Logano are listed as co-favorites (+1000) to win the race, per BetMGM Sportsbook. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-atlanta-preview-55e01135388636abc4cb88ab36db1d40,sports

"Bell takes only lead in OT to edge Hocevar, Larson in another thrilling NASCAR finish in Atlanta","HAMPTON, Ga. (AP)  Christopher Bell celebrated a drought-ending victory for himself and Joe Gibbs Racing after a dramatic comeback in Atlanta. Bell edged Carson Hocevar and Kyle Larson in overtime Sunday in another close NASCAR Cup Series finish at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Bell led only the final lap in his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota and had a slight edge on the outside when the caution light came on in overtime following a wreck by Josh Berry. That last lap of the race we were at our best, Bell said. It was the first victory for Joe Gibbs Racing since Bells win at New Hampshire Motor Speedway on June 23, 2024. I am glad that we dont have to hear about that, Bell said. Joe Gibbs Racing hasnt won since June. Thats all Ive heard. So Im very happy to end that narrative.  The 30-year-old Oklahoma driver has 10 career Cup victories, and he acknowledged Atlanta wasnt the spot his team had circled to end the drought. Bells strength in his career has not been superspeedway style racing, but he pulled off the comeback after qualifying only 32nd and struggling most of the day to look like a serious contender. Even Bells crew chief, Adam Stevens, wasnt expecting the late comeback. I think I fell off the edge of my seat a couple of times, especially there what was it, maybe 10, 15 to go when we were up in the top three or four and then fell back outside the top 10, Stevens said. I thought we were toast. But Bell just kept his head down and really dug deep all day. 
        
     Austin Cindric led in his Team Penske Ford before he and William Byron, the Daytona 500 winner last week, wrecked with three laps remaining, setting up the overtime. Hocevar faced criticism from Ryan Blaney and other drivers after the race for his aggressive style on the track. Yeah, I mean, theres some stuff I got to learn and clean up a little bit, but I feel like we put ourselves in the perfect opportunity to try and win a race, Hocevar said after falling short in a bid for his first victory. Ive never had that opportunity really before, especially on a superspeedway. Kyle Busch finished seventh, ending his hopes of snapping a winless streak on the Cup Series. Busch won the Atlanta Truck Series race Saturday but is still looking for his first Cup win since 2023 after having his NASCAR-record 19-year streak with at least one win end last year. Larson failed to finish the last four and five of the last six Atlanta races and was involved in accidents in each of the six. Larsons Hendrick Motorsports teammates claimed the spotlight in NASCARs first two weeks. Chase Elliott won The Clash on Feb. 2 before Byron avoided late wrecks to win the Daytona 500. Larsons string of bad luck ended Sunday after he qualified only 17th. Larson, the 2021 Cup champion, surged late the win the second stage. Came up a little bit short, but proud of the effort today by everybody on our HendrickCars.com Chevy, Larson said. Yeah, finally finished at Atlanta and finally got to run up front. Elliott was in the top 10 when his Hendricks Motorsports Chevrolet hit the wall late in the second stage and then hit Brad Keselowskis RFK Racings Ford, ending Keselowskis race. Elliott finished 18th. Daniel Suarez, who edged Blaney Kyle Busch in a thrilling three-wide finish in Atlantas 2024 February race, saw his hopes for a repeat win end when he was involved in a seven-car crash early in the third stage. Cole Custer, Ty Gibbs, Cody Ware, Noah Gragson and JJ Yaley also were involved. Blaney was in contention before his late one-car spin caused a caution, but he rallied to finish fourth. Billy Gibbons, the lead guitarist and singer for the rock group ZZ Top, served as the grand marshal and gave the start your engines command. The 23XI Racing team announced a multi-year deal with Corey Heim as a development driver. Heim will drive a limited number of Cup Series races in the No. 67 Toyota and also will compete on Xfinity races, including next week at Circuit of the Americas. His first Cup race on the new deal will be at Kansas Speedway on May 11. Heim made three Cup starts for 23XI last year and has a Truck Series win at Daytona this year. He finished 23rd in Saturdays Truck Series race in Atlanta.

Bells overtime win in Atlanta boosts hopes that 2025 will be a breakthrough season for No. 20 team,"HAMPTON, Ga. (AP)  Christopher Bell believes he could be headed toward a big year with Joe Gibbs Racing following what he hopes will be a breakthrough win. Bell clinched a playoff berth by winning the NASCAR Cup Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway in overtime on Sunday. Bell said he would be disappointed if he doesnt have more wins before the playoffs. Bell has big hopes for his No. 20 team following his unlikely win after qualifying only 32nd, beginning with next weeks race at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. He just didnt expect his teams breakout win to come in Atlanta. COTA is a good place to start, Bell said. Honestly were just getting into the bread and butter of what the 20 car likes. COTA should be a strong track. Phoenix, Vegas, Darlington, Homestead. All of these tracks coming up in the early part of the season is where we think we can compete for wins and do good, score a lot of points. Bell had less optimism about his teams chances in Atlantas drafting style, speedway race. Winning in Atlanta has only boosted his outlook for a big season. Atlanta was not one of those racetracks we had circled, Bell said. Its very refreshing to be able to get one early in the season, especially one where we didnt expect to win at. Hopefully we can keep the ball rolling. Team owner Joe Gibbs said Bells win provides evidence that offseason changes are paying off. In November, the team announced that Chris Gayle will serve as the crew chief for Denny Hamlins No. 11 team, with Chris Gabehart being promoted to competition director. Tyler Allen was named crew chief for Ty Gibbs No. 54 team. 
        
     We felt like we needed some help for our crew chiefs in general, all four of them, Gibbs said after Sundays race. Gibbs said each crew chief is so caught up in their cars that he decided it would help to have Gabehart responsible to look over all of it. The victory by Bell only raises the stakes for the remainder of the season, according to his crew chief, Adam Stevens. It frees you up a bunch, Stevens said. The position that our team is in, we expect to run up front. We wouldnt think that even if we didnt win a race that we would really be counting points when it came time for the playoffs to start. What we really need to be thinking about is winning that regular season championship and stockpiling as many bonus points as we possibly can. It was the first victory for Joe Gibbs Racing since Bells win at New Hampshire Motor Speedway on June 23, 2024. Bell edged Carson Hocevar and Kyle Larson. Bell had a slight edge on the outside when the caution light came on in overtime following a wreck by Josh Berry. It was the only lap Bell led. Bell believes he benefitted from being given the clearance to race sprint cars on dirt tracks in the offseason. He believes that helped keep him sharp for the start of the NASCAR Cup schedule. I definitely feel the best I have as a race car driver, Bell said. Im sure that some of it or part of it is due to the fact that I have been racing through the offseason. Its a dream come true to be able to drive for Joe Gibbs Racing in these Cup Series cars, and Im honored and privileged to be able to have some fun outside of the Cup Series cars now. I hope that I can make this the best year ever and prove to the company that its the right thing for me to do to be out there racing. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-christopher-bell-atlanta-aa22114c9346b4d2fcc5d35cd380f5a0,sports
Viktor Hovland finds a swing that works and rallies to beat Justin Thomas at Innisbrook,"PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP)  Viktor Hovland won the Valspar Championship on Sunday and has no idea how it happened. His swing is so out of sorts that Hovland has gone through five coaches since he won the FedEx Cup in 2023. He had gone eight months without making a 36-hole cut against a full field and felt so lost he wasnt even sure he was going to play this week. And then he delivered one world-class shot after another, none more impressive than a 7-iron from 186 yards over a bunker to 5 feet on No. 16, the toughest hole on the Copperhead course. Three shots behind with five to play, he rallied with three birdies to pass Justin Thomas and close with a 4-under 67 for a one-shot victory. Its been quite the struggle the past year-and-a-half, so for me to come back and win this tournament is quite incredible, Hovland said. I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week. Just goes to show this game is pretty crazy. Wasnt sure I was going to show up, but Im glad I did. He didnt leave satisfied that his game was back in order. Theres still too many errant shots, too many times he feels the club is out of position and he has to find a fix on the way down. But he found a swing that worked on the toughest stretch of Innisbrook. I honestly did not believe I could do it this week, Hovland said. It looked bleak even after Hovland and Thomas finally separated from the pack during a final round so tight that nine players had at least a share of the lead at some point. 
        
     Hovland was three shots behind Thomas when he holed a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-5 14th to start his amazing run. He hit 7-iron at a tucked pin on the 16th hole  the toughest hole on the Copperhead course  to 5 feet for birdie that tied him for the lead. And then he took dead aim to a back pin on the par-3 17th to 12 feet for birdie, which turned into a two-shot cushion when Thomas faltered late. Thomas made it a little easier on Hovland. He made four birdies in a five-hole stretch on the back nine and was ahead by three when he walked off the 15th green. But he chose driver on the 16th and hit that into the trees, leaving him no choice but to chip out to the fairway. Thomas had to get up-and-down from a bunker to escape with bogey. Hovland caught him with his birdie on the 16th, and Thomas was in trouble on the 18th with a drive into deep rough on the left that led to bogey. He was 7 under through 15 holes but had to settle for a 66. Hovland played it safe on the 18th with a two-shot lead, and his bogey only determined the final margin. He finished at 11-under 273 for his seventh career victory that moves him back into the top 10 in the world. This one he might not have seen coming. Hovland spoke openly about the frustrations of his supreme ball-striking becoming a liability. He missed three straight cuts coming into the Valspar Championship, including an 80 in the first round of The Players Championship a week ago. Hovlands last made cut against a full field was the Scottish Open last summer. So, what happened? Ive got no idea, he said with a laugh when his victory was secure. Jacob Bridgeman, who started with a three-way share of the lead, needed to hole out from the fairway on the 18th to force a playoff. He wound up with a par and finished third. I hit a lot of disgusting shots, but they happened to go where I looked, Hovland said. Somehow I was able to hit the good shots I can a lot more often. There were only great shots down the stretch. Hovland chose to lay up on the 14th  he went for the green in two on Saturday and made bogey  and had to rely on a 12-foot, slippery birdie putt to have any chance. That was a big one to make it. The pin on the 16th was back right, protected in front and to the right by a bunker, and his shot never left the flag. And then came the shot and birdie putt on the 17th. Thomas was left to wonder what went wrong. His always hits driver on the 16th and figured the worse he could make was 5. He quickly realized Hovland did plenty of good. Ive had plenty of chances this season, but nothing quite like that, said Thomas, whose last victory was the 2022 PGA Championship at Southern Hills. I felt so good out there, so excited for every shot, he said. Hell, theres not much I can do. He birdied 16 and 17. I obviously made it a lot easier. Its really hard  but really fun  trying to win golf tournaments. Bud Cauley (66), Billy Horschel (67) and Ryo Hisatsune (68) tied for fourth. Horschel delivered the most incredible shot at Innisbrook when his ball settled up against a tree on the par-5 fifth hole. He inverted a 9-iron and swung left-handed, hitting it 117 yards onto the green and converting the birdie putt from just outside 30 feet. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/viktor-hovland-justin-thomas-valspar-championship-innisbrook-26d4d6399e226087480dfe13870b6e04,sports
Billy Horschel makes improbable birdie after left-handed shot,"PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP)  Billy Horschel hit a 9-iron from near the base of a tree high in the air and onto the green, just like anyone would expect from a PGA Tour player. Except he hit this shot left-handed. Horschel delivered a most improbable birdie Sunday in the Valspar Championship when he inverted a 9-iron and hit what otherwise looked to be a normal shot on the par-5 fifth hole. Even sweeter was capping it off by making a 30-foot putt. Horschel wound up in a tie for fourth. His theatrics began when he pulled a 3-iron and the ball settled just to the right of a large pine. There was no way to hit it but lefty, Horschel said. I grabbed a 9-iron hoping it wouldnt go too far, and I was just hoping to get it up in the air and go straight. He also required some gallery control  specifically his young son. The funny thing was my little boy was about 50 yards in front of me just to the left on the cart path sitting down, and I had to yell at him to sort of get out of the way because I didnt know exactly where this thing could go, Horschel said. Last thing I need to do is call my wife and tell her I just hit my son with a golf ball. Listen, it was a hit-and-hope shot and I pulled it off and to make the putt ... I mean, funny things happen like that. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/billy-horschel-lefthanded-shot-valspar-championship-620da4eab09206d48f2f9288021c5e44,sports
Tiger Woods confirms his relationship with Vanessa Trump in a social media post,"Tiger Woods has confirmed his relationship with the former daughter-in-law of President Donald Trump, publishing two images to social media in a post that said, Love is in the air. Woods and Vanessa Trump, who was married to Donald Trump Jr., had been seen at Torrey Pines in San Diego along with her daughter, Kai, when Woods arrived for the final round to hand out the trophy to the winner of the Genesis Invitational. He is the tournament host. Kai Trump goes to the Benjamin School with Woods two children, Sam and Charlie. She and Charlie competed on an invitation at a high-profile junior golf tournament this week.  Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side! We look forward to our journey through life together, Woods said on X, where he has 6.4 million followers. He added: At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts. One photo shows Woods and Vanessa Trump posing together, another with them lying in a hammock with her arm draped across his chest as he gazes skyward. Woods and Vanessa Trump had been featured in gossip outlets for the last several weeks. She was married to Donald Trump Jr. for 12 years. They had five children together. Woods announced March 11 that he ruptured his left Achilles tendon, knocking him out of the Masters and likely for the rest of the year. It was not clear what prompted Woods, who keeps his personal life fiercely private, to publish photos confirming the relationship. It was reminiscent of 2013, when he and Lindsey Vonn both posted photos of them together to confirm they were dating. 
        
     Woods said at the time he and Vonn wanted to limit the stalkarazzi and all those sleazy websites that are out there following us, saying it could lead to dangerous situations involving his children. He also said their photos would devalue anything the paparazzi had.  Woods has two children from his marriage to Elin Nordegren, who divorced him 2010 after he had been exposed for multiple extramarital affairs. His only other public relationship was with Erica Herman, which lasted about seven years until he ended it in October 2022. It was a messy split, and Herman eventually dismissed lawsuits against Woods and the trust that owns his south Florida estate, where she had been living. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/tiger-woods-vanessa-trump-donald-trump-jr-9b2a50f11efce7f23dcec362963ee839,sports
"Trump celebrates the Super Bowl champ Eagles at White House, but star QB Jalen Hurts skips ceremony","WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump feted the 2025 Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles at the White House on Monday, but several players, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, decided to skip the celebration. Hurts and other players cited scheduling conflicts as the reasons for their absences, according to a White House official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Still, Trump called Hurts a terrific guy and terrific player who turned in one stellar performance after another in helping the Eagles to a 14-3 regular season and their Super Bowl run. The Eagles have turned out to be an incredible team, an incredible group, Trump said. In his first term, Trump invited and then canceled a celebration for the Eagles in 2018 after the franchises first Super Bowl title. He instead threw his own brief Celebration of America after it became clear most players werent going to show up. Asked by a reporter on the red carpet of the Time magazine gala last week whether he would take part in the White House visit, Hurts responded with an awkward um and long silence before walking away. Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley visited Trump over the weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and caught a ride with the president to Washington on Air Force One and then to the White House on Marine One. 
        
     He loved it, Trump said of Barkleys short flight on the presidential airplane. Hes a great young guy and an incredible football player. Saquon had a season for the ages, running behind the most powerful offensive line in the NFL, Trump said. Barkley, meanwhile, pushed back on social media criticism earlier Monday for spending time with Trump. He noted that he has golfed with former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.  Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand, Barkley posted on X.  Barkley ran away with the Offensive Player of the Year award this past season after rushing for 2,005 yards, eighth-best in NFL history. It was his first season with the Eagles. Trump attended the Eagles decisive Super Bowl victory in New Orleans over the Kansas City Chiefs. He predicted ahead of the game the Chiefs would win, and offered lavish praise for Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. After the game, Trump mocked pop star Taylor Swift, who is dating Mahomes teammate Travis Kelce. Swift faced boos from some fans at one point during the game when she appeared on the Jumbotron.  Swift had endorsed Trumps Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving! Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Trump made a nod to the moment at Mondays ceremony.

Trump administration says Penn violated sex discrimination laws after transgender swimmer competed,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)  The Trump administration said Monday that the University of Pennsylvania violated laws guaranteeing women equal opportunities in athletics by letting a transgender swimmer compete on the schools womens team and into team facilities. The administrations statement does not name Lia Thomas, the transgender swimmer who last competed for the Ivy League school in Philadelphia in 2022 and was the first openly transgender athlete to win a Division I title that year  an award Thomas now faces losing. But the investigation opened in February by the U.S. Education Departments Office for Civil Rights focused on Thomas, who became a leading symbol of transgender athletes and a prominent political target of Republicans and President Donald Trump. The department said Penn violated a law barring sex discrimination in schools and colleges, called Title IX, by denying women equal opportunities by permitting males to compete in womens intercollegiate athletics and to occupy women-only intimate facilities. Penn had no immediate comment Monday, but Penn has said in the past that it always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams, both when Thomas swam and currently. The department said Penn has 10 days to voluntarily resolve the violations or risk prosecution. The department wants Penn to issue a statement saying that it will comply with Title IX; effectively strip Thomas of any awards or records in Division I swimming competitions; and apologize to each female swimmer whose individual recognition is restored expressing an apology on behalf of the university for allowing her educational experience in athletics to be marred by sex discrimination. 
        
     The Trump administration in March suspended approximately $175 million in federal funding for Penn over its decision to let Thomas compete, the White House has said. The Ivy League schools federal money came from the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2022, the NCAA used a sport-by-sport approach to allowing transgender athletes to participate, deferring to an individual sports national governing organization, international federation or prior established International Olympic Committee criteria.  Thomas competed under those guidelines, which allowed female transgender swimmers who had completed one year of hormone replacement therapy to compete. The NCAA changed its policy the day after Trump signed an executive order on Feb. 5 that was intended to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls and womens sports. That ended its sport-by-sport practice in favor of a blanket policy that only allows athletes assigned female at birth to participate in womens sports. The Education Department also opened reviews of San Jose State University volleyball, Denver Public Schools, Portland Public Schools, Oregon School Activities Association and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association. It also sued the state of Maine to force it to ban transgender athletes from girls and womens sports or face prosecution. ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter.",https://apnews.com/article/penn-transgender-swimmer-trump-federal-funding-decee6d555d61ac1a5462cf4d495db1c,sports
Rob Manfred says he discussed Pete Roses status with Donald Trump and will rule on reinstatement,"NEW YORK (AP)  Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said he discussed Pete Rose with President Donald Trump at a meeting two weeks ago and he plans to rule on a request to end the sports permanent ban of the career hits leader, who died in September. Speaking Monday at a meeting of the Associated Press Sports Editors, Manfred said he and Trump have discussed several issues, including Manfreds concerns over how Trumps immigration policies could impact players from Cuba, Venezuela and other foreign countries.  Manfred is considering a petition to have Rose posthumously removed from MLBs permanently ineligible list. The petition was filed in January by Jeffrey Lenkov, a Southern California lawyer who represented Rose prior to the 17-time All-Stars death at age 83. I met with President Trump two weeks ago, I guess now, and one of the topics was Pete Rose, but Im not going beyond that, Manfred said. Hes said what he said publicly, Im not going beyond that in terms of what the back and forth was. Trump posted on social media Feb. 28 that he plans to issue a complete PARDON of Pete Rose. Trump posted on Truth Social that Rose shouldnt have been gambling on baseball, but only bet on HIS TEAM WINNING. Its unclear what a presidential pardon might include  Trump did not specifically mention a tax case in which Rose pleaded guilty in 1990 to two counts of filing false tax returns and served a five-month prison sentence. The president said he would sign a pardon for Rose over the next few weeks but has not addressed the matter since. 
        
     Rose had 4,256 hits and also holds records for games (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890). He was the 1973 National League MVP and played on three World Series winners. An investigation for MLB by lawyer John M. Dowd found Rose placed numerous bets on the Cincinnati Reds to win from 1985-87 while playing for and managing the team. Rose agreed with MLB on a permanent ban in 1989. Lenkov is seeking Roses reinstatement so that he can be considered for the Hall of Fame. Under a rule adopted by the Halls board of directors in 1991, anyone on the permanently ineligible list cant be considered for election to the Hall. Rose applied for reinstatement in 1997 and met with Commissioner Bud Selig in November 2002, but Selig never ruled on Roses request. Manfred in 2015 denied Roses application for reinstatement. Manfred said reinstating Rose now was a little more complicated than it might appear on the outside and did not commit to a timeline except that I want to get it done promptly as soon as we get the work done.  Im not going to give this the pocket veto, he said. I will in fact issue a ruling. Roses reinstatement doesnt mean he would automatically appear on a Hall of Fame ballot. He would first have to be nominated by the Halls Historical Overview Committee, which is picked by the Baseball Writers Association of America and approved by the Halls board. Manfred is an ex-officio member of that board and says he has been in regular contact with chairman Jane Forbes Clark. I mean, believe me, a lot of Hall of Fame dialogue on this one, Manfred said.  If reinstated, Rose potentially would be eligible for consideration to be placed on a ballot to be considered by the 16-member Classic Baseball Era committee in December 2027. Manfred added he doesnt think baseballs current ties to legal sports betting should color views on Roses case. There is and always has been a clear demarcation between what Rob Manfred, ordinary citizen, can do on the one hand, and what someone who has the privilege to play or work in Major League Baseball can do on the other in respect to gambling, he said. The fact that the law changed, and we sell data and/or sponsorships, which is essentially all we do, to sports betting enterprises, I dont think changes that. Its a privilege to play Major League Baseball. As with every privilege, there comes responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is that they not bet on the game. Manfred did not go into details on his discussion with Trump over foreign-born players other than to say he expressed worry. Given the number of foreign-born players we have, were always concerned about ingress and egress, Manfred said. We have had dialogue with the administration about this topic. And, you know, theyre very interested in sports. They understand the unique need to be able to go back and forth, and Im going to leave it at that. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/pete-rose-reinstatement-00a2532eeb4f1aa3dd81530260de44b8,sports
"Tom Brown, who had clinching interception for Packers in 1966 NFL title game, dies at age 84","Tom Brown, the two-sport star whose interception sealed the 1966 NFL title game for Vince Lombardis Green Bay Packers, has died. He was 84. Both the Packers and Browns alma mater the University of Maryland announced his death on Monday. The Packers said he died last Wednesday. Brown played six seasons in the NFL after being drafted in the second round by the Packers in 1963. He joined Green Bay the following year after playing one season of Major League Baseball with the Washington Senators. Brown was part of Green Bays three straight NFL title-winning teams from 1965-67 under Lombardi, starting in the secondary and playing a key role on one of the most important plays during that dynasty. With the Packers protecting a 34-27 lead in the final minute of the 1966 NFL title game, Dallas drove down to the 2-yard line with a chance to tie the game. But on fourth down, Don Merediths desperation pass was intercepted by Brown in the back of the end zone to seal the win. The Packers went on to win the first Super Bowl two weeks later against Kansas City. Brown also had an interception in the 1967 playoffs against the Los Angeles Rams. The Packers then won the NFL title the following week in the Ice Bowl against Dallas and another Super Bowl against the Oakland Raiders. Green Bay also won the NFL title with Brown starting in the secondary in 1965  the year before the first Super Bowl.  
        
     Brown was traded to Washington from Green Bay in 1969 after Lombardi had been hired there and played just one game that season in his final year in the NFL. Brown finished his NFL career with 13 interceptions and six fumble recoveries in 71 regular-season games, along with the two interceptions in the playoffs.  Brown batted .147 in 61 games for the Senators in his only year in the majors with one home run and four RBIs. Brown became the first person ever to homer in a major league game and play on a Super Bowl champion  a feat only matched since then by Deion Sanders.  Brown spent the start of the 1964 season in the minors before quitting baseball in July and signing with the Packers. I think I could probably have played major league ball, but not as a starter; probably as a utility player, he said in a 2009 interview, according to the Packers website. But I had the opportunity to play with the Packers and I took that opportunity. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/tom-brown-packers-obit-e3122b1d2ed0280607cbd77555e578a6,sports
Braves bring back right-hander Ian Anderson and outfielder Eddie Rosario,"DENVER (AP)  Ian Anderson, the winning pitcher in Game 3 of the 2021 World Series, rejoined the Atlanta Braves on Monday, a day after he was claimed off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels. Atlanta also signed veteran outfielder Eddie Rosario, optioned outfielder Jarred Kelenic to Triple-A Gwinnett and designated right-hander Zach Thompson for assignment. A 26-year-old right-hander, Anderson went 0-1 with an 11.57 ERA in seven appearances this season for the Angels, who acquired him in a trade with Atlanta in March. The appearances were his first in the majors since 2022; he had Tommy John surgery the following year. The Braves gave Anderson an opportunity in spring training to earn a spot in their starting rotation. But he was traded to the Angels after he walked 20 batters in 20 innings. It feels great coming back here, Anderson said. Theres so much familiarity, and its just going to be about trying to tap into more of the positive results Ive had this year and just get things going. Anderson is expected to work out of the bullpen for Atlanta, which begins a three-game series at Colorado on Monday night. Be ready for whenever they call me, he said. Anderson shined for the Braves throughout the 2021 postseason, which concluded with Atlanta beating Houston in six games for the World Series title. He pitched five hitless innings to win Game 3. Rosario, an 11-year veteran, returns for his third stint with Atlanta. He played in two games for the Los Angeles Dodgers this season. Rosario hit 21 homers in 142 games for the Braves in 2023. 
        
     Hes going to be mainly used as a pinch hitter, manager Brian Snitker said. We dont pinch-hit a lot but I told him you just got to be ready to go and do anything we ask. Kelenic batted .167 with two homers in 23 games for the Braves this season. Were going to give Eli (White) some run. I think it could be good for Jared to go back and play and get some at-bats, Snitker said. Thompson did not allow a run over 3 2/3 innings in two appearances this year. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/braves-ian-anderson-eddie-rosario-cca196b2cdd348be462373be5c4b149a,sports

Florida QB DJ Lagway resumes throwing after resting sore shoulder during spring practice,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP)  Florida quarterback DJ Lagway has resumed throwing after resting his ailing right shoulder throughout spring practice. Lagway posted two short videos on social media Monday of him making throws at CORTX Sports Performance in Ponde Vedra Beach, a training center near Jacksonville that has worked with current NFL quarterbacks Brock Purdy, Anthony Richardson, Jordan Travis and Gardner Minshew. It was a positive step forward for Lagway, a sophomore who reported shoulder soreness in the offseason that carried over from last year. He was limited in spring practice and then played just five snaps in the teams annual spring game, all of them ending in handoffs. The Gators took a cautious approach with Lagway in hopes of giving his throwing shoulder extra time to heal. Lagway also was recovering from a core muscle injury that coach Billy Napier referred to as lower-body stuff. In his final three years at Willis High School in Texas, Lagway threw 849 passes for 8,264 yards and 99 touchdowns and ran 278 times for 1,684 yards and 29 more scores. He also serves as a pitcher on the baseball team, leaving his shoulder little downtime. Lagway missed some practice time as a freshman last fall with shoulder soreness, a lingering issue from his high school days in Texas. But it never caused him to miss a game. He was sidelined one game last November while recovering from a strained left hamstring he suffered against Georgia. But he started every game after, including Floridas bowl victory against Tulane in December. 
        
     Napier said the plan to sit him during spring was to be very smart. Now, given rest, he is expected to be full go when the team reconvenes for workouts in June. Lagway completed 60% of his passes for 1,915 yards, with 12 touchdowns and nine interceptions as a freshman last season. He took over the starting role after Graham Mertz tore a knee ligament at Tennessee in October. The Gators signed college journeyman Harrison Bailey to be Lagways backup this fall. Bailey has played at Tennessee, UNLV and Louisville. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/dj-lagway-florida-a71a83b0a9d2a9fd6db5eefe94c2c479,sports
Astros star Jose Altuve asks out of leadoff spot to have more time to get ready to hit,"HOUSTON (AP)  Jose Altuve asked manager Joe Espada to move him out of the leadoff spot and into the second hole for the Houston Astros. The reason? He wanted more time to get ready to hit in the bottom of the first inning after coming into the dugout from left field. Altuve is playing left for the first time in his career after spending his first 14 major league seasons at second base. I just need like 10 more seconds, he said. The 34-year-old Altuve made the transition to the outfield this season after the trade of Kyle Tucker and the departure of Alex Bregman shook up Houstons lineup. Jeremy Pea was in the top spot Monday night against Detroit. Altuve had two hits, including a two-run homer, and three RBIs to help the Astros to an 8-5 win. It was the first time since 2023 he batted anywhere besides leadoff. I enjoy playing baseball, Altuve said. I love playing, especially with these guys. I like being in the lineup. In the end it doesnt really matter if I play second or left, if I lead off or not. I just want to be in the lineup and help this team to win. Altuve didnt suggest that Pea take his leadoff spot. I just told Joe that maybe he can hit me second some games at some point and he did it today, Altuve said. I just need like that little extra time to come from left field, and he decided to put Jeremy (there). Pea is hitting .265 with three homers and 11 RBIs. He batted first in Sundays 7-3 win over Kansas City  with Altuve getting a day off  and had two hits and three RBIs. He added two more hits and scored twice Monday. 
        
     Along with giving him a little extra time to get ready to bat, Altuve thinks the athletic Pea batting leadoff could give a boost to a lineup that has struggled at times this season. Jeremy is one of those guys that has been playing really good for our team, Altuve said. Hes taking really good at-bats. Hes very explosive and dynamic on the bases, so when he gets on base a lot of things can happen. Maybe I can bunt him over so Yordan (Alvarez) can drive him in. Altuve is a nine-time All-Star. The 2017 AL MVP is hitting .282 with four homers and 12 RBIs this season. Espada said he and Altuve often share different ideas about the team and they had been talking about this possibility for a while before the manager made the move. Hes always looking for ways to get everyone involved and hes playing left field, comes in, maybe give him a little bit more time to get ready between at-bats, just a lot of things that went into this decision, Espada said. Hes been around, he knows himself better than anyone else here, so hopefully this could create some opportunities for everyone here and we can score some runs. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/astros-altuve-houston-101a84f2927407ad1930a21de7a488d9,sports

Brandon Nimmo ties Mets record with 9 RBIs in 19-5 rout of Nationals,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Brandon Nimmo hit a grand slam and matched a franchise record with nine RBIs, helping the New York Mets pound Washington Nationals 19-5 on Monday. Nimmo also hit a three-run drive in his seventh career multihomer game. The 32-year-old outfielder had four hits and scored four times after beginning the day with a .192 batting average. New York earned a split of the four-game series. The Mets have won nine of 11 overall to improve to a major league-best 20-9. Jeff McNeil and Mark Vientos also homered for New York, which finished with 21 hits. Vientos connected for a three-run drive against Washington infielder Amed Rosario in the ninth. James Wood and Nathaniel Lowe homered for Washington in the eighth. The Mets had a 3-0 lead when Colin Poche replaced Nationals starter Trevor Williams (1-3) with two on in the sixth. Nimmo greeted the left-hander by ripping a 2-0 fastball deep to right-center. An inning later, the Mets had the bases loaded when Nimmo sent Cole Henrys fastball into the right-field seats for his second career grand slam. Nimmo added a two-run double in the eighth to tie the franchise record for RBIs set by Carlos Delgado in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees on June 27, 2008. McNeil, who made his season debut Friday after missing 25 games with a right oblique strain, hit the first pitch of the fifth deep to right for his first home run of the year. 
        
     Griffin Canning (4-1) pitched five innings of four-hit ball for New York. He has won four consecutive starts for the first time in his six-season career. Jos Urea earned his first save of the season. He allowed five runs in three innings in his Mets debut. Williams yielded five runs in a season-high 5 1/3 innings. Francisco Lindor was hit twice by Cole Henry pitches in the seventh. He became the ninth player to be hit twice in an inning and the first since the New York Yankees Brandon Moss on April 25, 2014, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  Nimmos sixth-inning shot broke open the game. It was his first homer since April 12. Nimmo was mired in a 7-for-47 (.149) slump with no extra-base hits in his previous 12 games before Monday. New York left-hander David Peterson (1-1, 3.29 ERA) starts Tuesday in the opener of a three-game series against Arizona.

Wrexham has another promotion in sight and Ryan Reynolds can hardly stand the tension,"MANCHESTER, England (AP)  Another promotion is within touching distance for Wrexham.  The Welsh soccer team has been propelled to worldwide fame by co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. It has also been propelled up the league in double-quick time, having been a down-on-its-luck minor league team when the Hollywood pair completed their unlikely buyout in 2021. At this rate, Wrexham could be playing in the Premier League next year.  One step at a time, but if results go its way on Saturday, Wrexham will seal promotion to the Championship  the second tier of English soccer.  There it will mix with the likes of Leicester  a Premier League champion in 2016, Champions League quarterfinalist in 2017 and FA Cup winner in 2021; the same year as Reynolds and McElhenney changed the fortunes of Wrexham forever. With two games to go this season, Wrexham is in second place in League One and will be promoted if it beats Charlton on Saturday and third-place Wycombe loses or draws against Leyton Orient. Birmingham, at the top of the standings, is already up. I have, literally, like an 8-inch ulcer in my stomach right now because its the end of the season, Deadpool star Reynolds told the TIME100 Summit this week. It all comes down to the next two weeks. They just cant do it easy, like just one year lets do it without having receding hairlines all around. Were all losing it. Stress (is) killing us. It would be typically Wrexham to take it to the final game. And it is the teams taste for drama, last-gasp wins and losses, that has helped make the globally-streamed docuseries Welcome to Wrexham so popular.  
        
     Thats not a consolation at all, Reynolds said.  While there have been moments of high drama during Wrexhams rise under Reynolds and McElhenney, if anything, success is becoming all too predictable.  This would be a third straight promotion, defying the odds even with the financial boost that comes with having celebrity owners. Just ask the group of Manchester United greats, including David Beckham, Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, who havent managed to rise beyond League Two with their team Salford, despite pumping money and fame into the club.  Indeed, Wrexham passed Salford on its way up the league and would be within one division of Manchester United if it secures promotion.  Success has come both on and off the field given the ongoing popularity of its hit streaming series and a record turnover of 26.7 million pounds ($34.5 million) last season, a 155% rise, which helped repay all of its loans to shareholders.  The down-on-its-luck element of the Wrexham story has been left in the past. It is now an upwardly mobile team fast-approaching the top tier of English soccer.  With that in mind Charlton manager Nathan Jones could have chosen his words more wisely when describing Wrexham as a circus this week.  It is a lack of respect to our owners, the team, the staff, the supporters and the heritage of Wrexham Football Club, manager Phil Parkinson told local newspaper The Leader.

An easy Premier League title? Slot says no as Liverpool tries to clinch No. 20,"Liverpool manager Arne Slot rejected the notion that his teams imminent Premier League title triumph has come easy, saying Friday that it is harder than ever to win games in Englands top division. Slot is on the verge of becoming just the 12th manager  and first Dutch coach  to capture English soccers biggest prize, with Liverpool needing just a point against Tottenham on Sunday to clinch a record-tying 20th top-flight title. Liverpool holds a 12-point lead over Arsenal, whose inconsistency is highlighted by drawing 13 games this campaign, and is 18 points clear of third-place Manchester City, the team which won the last four titles but has regressed spectacularly this season because of a mixture of injuries and mental fatigue. When questioned at his pre-match news conference whether it was fair to say the Premier League hasnt been the strongest this season, Slot pointed to the tight race for the five Champions League qualification spots that sees just four points separate City and seventh-place Aston Villa. I think it has never been so exciting for a top-four, top-five finish, Slot said. The year before, it was quite clear which clubs would probably get the first three or four positions. Its never been as hard to end up top four or top five in the Premier League. In my opinion, its a really difficult league because thats what Ive experienced over here. There has never been an easy game. It has always been really hard to win a game of football, but maybe that tells you something about us. 
        
     Liverpool has won 24 of its 33 games so far, exerting more control in matches under Slot that it used to under his predecessor, Jurgen Klopp. The margin of victory has only been more than two goals on five occasions. Although we arent the only team in this league who finds it hard to win a game of football by a margin of three or four goals, Slot said. That was maybe easier two, three, four, five years ago. So either the teams arent so good anymore  the Liverpools, the Citys, the Arsenals  or we are still very good and the other teams have the funds to spend just as much, or in some situations even more, than Arsenal, City and Liverpool. Slot described getting the chance to seal the league in front of Liverpools fans as a big responsibility. In 2020, when Liverpool claimed league title No. 19 to end a 30-year drought, it was clinched as a result of a loss by second-place City and no fans could attend the final matches at Anfield during the pandemic. We are aware of the fact the last time this club won the league, it was Covid time, Slot said. So everyone is looking forward to Sunday. But we know there is still a job to be done. And thats one point. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/arne-slot-liverpool-premier-league-title-3ccee66401d3e698dd1ebe93fa3b7870,sports
Barcelona and Real Madrid clash in Copa del Rey final with more than a trophy at stake,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP)  Barcelona and Real Madrid meet in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday with more than just the trophy on the line. Barcelona wants to grab the first piece of a potential treble of major titles in coach Hansi Flicks debut season. The team is on pace to conquer La Liga, and three days after the cup final it will start its two-leg Champions League semifinal against Inter Milan. We want to fight for every title we can and we now have the opportunity to win thee titles, and that is our goal, Flick said Friday. It could also be the last trophy for Carlo Ancelotti, who many Madrid watchers speculate could leave the powerhouse this summer, possibly to take over Brazil. Madrid arguably has more at stake. Out of the Champions League, the cup is its best chance to salvage the campaign with some silverware. It is also alive in La Liga, but it needs to overhaul a four-point deficit to Barcelona with five games left  a finale that includes yet another clasico. For Barcelona, a title won at the expense of Madrid would give it a huge momentum boost for Inters visit on Wednesday as the Catalan club pursues its first European Cup in a decade. Barcelona dominated their other two meetings this season, beating Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup final in January after winning 4-0 at Madrid in the league in October. The third clasico of the season will be played before 70,000 spectators in Sevilles La Cartuja Stadium, where King Felipe VI will award the trophy to the winners. 
        
     This is the first Copa del Rey final between Spains biggest clubs since 2014. Barcelona holds a record 31 Spanish cups. Madrid has 20, third place all time. The referees will also be in the focus after a spat between them and Real Madrid because of a video aired by the clubs television discrediting the head referee for the game. Flicks biggest task will be filling in for the injured Robert Lewandowski, who picked up a left thigh injury last weekend. The Poland striker is producing another stellar season with a team-high 40 goals across all competitions. Ferran Torres is likely to start in his place. The versatile forward has emerged as Barcelonas super sub in this campaign. He has netted 17 goals overall in limited minutes, including five in the cup. Another option, however, could be playing attacking midfielder Dani Olmo as a false nine flanked by Lamine Yamal and Raphinha. Barcelona will also be without starting left back Alejandro Balde. Youth player Gerard Martin is likely to take his place unless Flick wants to slot in a more experienced player. Goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen was included in Barcelonas squad for the first time since tearing a tendon in his right knee in September. Finishing the season without a trophy would be a major disappointment after Madrid brought in superstar Kylian Mbapp last summer. The France striker has scored goals galore but has failed to produce big in the biggest games. He was jeered when substituted late in the second of two losses to Arsenal in the Champions League quarterfinals. Vincius Jnior has seen his productivity in attack fade ever since he felt overlooked in the Ballon dOr award selection earlier this season. But the Brazil forward has previously risen to the occasion in finals. Midfielder Eduardo Camavinga injured a tendon this week and will miss the rest of the season, joining Madrids long-term casualty list that includes defenders Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao. Madrids main task in defense will be keeping Yamal and Raphinha in check after both ran rampant in the previous clasicos. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-real-madrid-copa-del-rey-final-2ffbf973042af117afb39a5aa3cce400,sports

He was back working on Wednesday and will be in the dugout at St. James Park on Saturday to face Ipswich. Im not 100% in my body, Howe said on Friday, but Id like to think Im 100% in my mind, which is the most important thing. Howe said he had zero contact with his coaching staff while in hospital, with assistant Jason Tindall taking charge of the team. I made a conscious decision, when I didnt feel well enough to focus on the football, to give Jason and all the coaches the full responsibility, Howe said. For me, youre either all in or all out. So I said to Jason right at the start, Its over to you. And didnt he do well. After losing to Villa 4-1 on Saturday, Saudi-controlled Newcastle has dropped to fifth place in the Premier League.

F1 set to liven up Monaco Grand Prix with extra pit stops,"LONDON (AP)  The Monaco Grand Prix has long been nicknamed the jewel in Formula 1s crown but for all the sparkle, the racing has often been dull. That could change with a planned rule change that would require drivers to stop in the pits at least twice, potentially shuffling the running order on Monacos narrow streets at least a little. The Formula 1 Commission, which brings together F1 teams and management with the governing body, the FIA, met Tuesday ahead of the new season launch event in London and agreed to increase the numbers of mandatory pit stops in Monaco, the FIA said. The rule change isnt yet set in stone  the FIA said the proposals will be further discussed by a committee  but Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said it would mean a minimum two stops per race, rather than the current one, and for cars to use three different tire compounds. Obviously Monaco, you cant change the layout of the circuit. And of course, as weve seen previously, with particularly these cars as big as they are now, the race is very much dictated by the Saturday (qualifying session), Horner said. So what we saw last year was, if you get a red flag early on and everybody just puts another tire on, then its very static. So stating that you have to use potentially all three compounds brings in another element. So it becomes a two-stop race and should it rain as well, it would also be a mandatory two stop. So its unique to that race. 
        
     Last years race in Monaco was red-flagged after first-lap crashes and resumed with a standing restart, which allowed all cars to change tires. With overtaking all but impossible on the Monaco streets, Charles Leclerc took the victory without stopping again. The FIA said the commission also approved a new cooling system for drivers in hot races and more stringent tests on the flexibility of cars front and rear wings. Those rules came under scrutiny last year when McLarens rear wing appeared to bend at high speed, potentially allowing a higher top speed. New tests for rear wings will apply from the start of the season and for front wings from the Spanish Grand Prix weekend in late May and early June. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/monaco-grand-prix-pit-stops-f1-971523de04811e4fc3d8c3e4c870f1aa,sports
Mercedes rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli says Lewis Hamilton told him to enjoy himself in F1,"LONDON (AP)  As an 18-year-old rookie taking over Lewis Hamiltons spot at Mercedes, Andrea Kimi Antonelli is having an introduction to Formula 1 unlike any other. Fortunately, hes had some advice from the seven-time champion.  He said mainly to enjoy (it), not worrying about the external circumstances, Antonelli told reporters Tuesday. Just working on yourself, enjoy the process, that was the main thing he said. Given Hamiltons legacy at Mercedes, where he won six titles, and his influence on F1, Antonelli prefers to be called the next Mercedes driver rather than the replacement for Hamilton, whos now at Ferrari. Hamiltons own rookie season for McLaren in 2007  one year after Antonelli was born  went down in F1 history as he won four races and missed out on the title by one point to Kimi Raikkonen.  Looking back at his 2007 season, which was incredible because he almost won the championship in his rookie year, what was quite impressive was the consistency, Antonelli said.  What (Hamilton) did really well is starting off well and then keep developing without trying to do too much. Thats why he did an amazing season and thats what Im going to try to do. 
        
     Long considered one of the most promising talents in junior series, Antonelli raced in Formula 2 last year and got his first taste of F1 with a drive in Friday practice at his home Italian Grand Prix in August. Driving George Russells car, he had a high-speed crash and apologized to team principal Toto Wolff. Antonelli said Mercedes gave him the support he needed. When you have the right people around you, they really help you not to get too bogged down by these things. I think the natural thing for a driver is you go on track and you try to push as hard as you can, he said. And the F1 (cars) nowadays are really complicated on this factor because the aerodynamic (effect) is so powerful that the fine line between being on the limit and going over is so little. And as soon as you go 105%, it happens like what happened in Monza. Antonelli was able to drive an F1 car before he could legally drive on the road and only got his license last month. His examiner turned out to be a fan. I was quite nervous, Im not going to lie, because I didnt want to fail, Antonelli said. It was nice because after the test, we also had a nice conversation about everything because shes really passionate about the sport. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/mercedes-andrea-kimi-antonelli-lewis-hamilton-3997f46b3371ce1cd90fb66dd2c1367c,sports
NASCAR deals Daytona 500 pole winner massive fine for 2nd consecutive year,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Daytona 500 pole-winner Chase Briscoe was dealt a major penalty Wednesday when NASCAR said Joe Gibbs Racing had a modified spoiler on the No. 19 Toyota in time trials.  Joe Gibbs Racing was docked 100 driver/owner points and 10 playoff points. The spoiler base is a single-source part that cannot be modified and was discovered in NASCARs inspection process. JGR also was fined $100,000 and crew chief James Small was suspended for four races. Briscoe now goes to Atlanta Motor Speedway with negative 67 points in the standings. He dropped from 10th in the standings to 39th. Joe Gibbs Racing said it would appeal and the issue in question was caused in the assembly process when bolts used to attach the spoiler base to the deck lid caused the pre-drilled holes to wear due to supplied part interferences. It is the second consecutive year the Daytona 500 pole-winner has been penalized: Joey Logano was found to have an illegal glove during his qualifying run in 2024. The Briscoe penalty marks a devastating start to his first season driving for Gibbs. The earliest he can move into positive points is the third race of the season, at Circuit of the Americas. In other penalties announced Wednesday, the No. 34 Front Row Motorsports team of Todd Gilliland and No. 51 Rick Ware Racing team of Cody Ware were penalized for a safety violation for added ballast to their cars. Gilliland and Ware were docked 10 driver points and their teams lost 10 owner points.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-daytona-500-penalties-briscoe-3d96cdc3aa903d20ea9f05931e6399b9,sports
Parker Kligerman loses appeal after having NASCAR Truck Series win erased by disqualification,ATLANTA (AP)  Parker Kligerman on Thursday lost his appeal after having his NASCAR Truck Series season-opening win at Daytona erased by a disqualification. NASCAR disqualified Kligermans No. 75 on Friday night when his truck was found to be too low in a postrace inspection. Corey Heim was declared the new winner. Kligerman immediately announced plans to appeal the ruling. That appeal was denied on Thursday by the National Motorsports Appeals Panel. The panel upheld NASCARs original finding by ruling The panel confirms it is more likely than not a rules violation did occur and the disqualification penalties in Rule 10.5.2.4 necessitate a race disqualification. The adjustment to the standings gave actor Frankie Muniz his first career top-10 finish. Kligerman retired from full-time racing at the end of last season and has a larger role as a television analyst this year.

Angela Stanford named US captain of Solheim Cup for the 2026 matches in the Netherlands,"Angela Stanford was introduced Thursday as the next U.S. captain of the Solheim Cup, leading a young core of Americans who are coming off a victory and will try to win the cup overseas for the first time in more than a decade. Stanford was on the last American team that won away from home, in 2015 in Germany when Juli Inkster was at the helm. She was an assistant on the last three teams, including what she calls a massive victory in Virginia last September. The U.S. team was so young that 10 of the 12 players had never experienced what it was like to win the Solheim Cup. They needed that feeling, Stanford said. Virginia was big for a lot of these players, and I hope getting a taste of that win and getting a taste of what it meant ... you cant feel something youve never felt before. That was kind of cool. Hopefully, theyll want to accept the next challenge, which is winning one overseas. The 2026 matches will be held at Bernardus Golf in the Netherlands. Anna Nordqvist of Sweden had been selected captain for Europe. Stanford, 47, has seven LPGA Tour victories, including her lone major in the 2018 Evian Championship when she was 40. She also played in 98 consecutive majors, the longest streak in LPGA history. She played six times in the Solheim Cup, with three wins and three losses, and was at the last three as an assistant to Pat Hurst (2021 ) and Stacy Lewis (2023 and 2024). 
        
     Lewis was captain for consecutive years because the Ryder Cup went back to odd-numbered years after the COVID-19 pandemic and the Solheim Cup went back to even-numbered years. Lewis effectively signed up for two years, and delivered a big win in Virginia. It was Stanfords second stint as an assistant  the tie in Spain, with Europe retaining the cup as defending champion  that she first thought how much she would like to be captain. Ive always wanted to be a captain overseas, Stanford said. I won my Curtis Cup overseas. I got to play on two of the teams that have won the Solheim Cup overseas. Growing up, I played a lot of different team sports and I loved going to other peoples gyms, going to their fields. It doesnt bother me to go into a hostile environment and try to play and try to perform. The core of the American team is Nelly Korda and Lilia Vu, with multiple major championships between them. Nine of the U.S. players were in their 20s at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, which held off a late European charge. Stanford expects there to be some turnover, as there was even a year apart between the 2023 and 2024 matches. But she likes the core of the U.S. team, especially a team she watched celebrate into the night after winning the last time. I think Im pretty fortunate and pretty blessed to be in this line of a solid core, Stanford said. Theyre still young. Theyre all going to be playing really well. Among the two players who had previously won a Solheim Cup is Lexi Thompson, who said 2024 would be her final year of a full schedule. Thompson still plans to play occasionally, and Stanford would not rule out Thompson being on the 2026 team if her play warranted it. Shes earned that right to do what she wants to do, Stanford said. I will be watching, for sure. Lexi is just one of those names you always pay attention to, and theres always an open door. Theres certain players that have earned that right. ___ (This version corrects the photo links to replace one that misidentified Stanford) AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/angela-stanford-solheim-cup-captain-netherlands-europe-1f28ecee6582c8a1c1971dd89927716f,sports

Converted reliever Clay Holmes has been a key addition to the Mets surprisingly effective rotation,"The New York Mets experiment with Clay Holmes is working swimmingly so far. And the bullpen he left behind  across town in the Bronx  is still in flux. Holmes has made the transition from closer to starter look easy, going 3-1 with a 2.64 ERA in six outings. Thats helped the Mets surge to baseballs best record despite injuries elsewhere in the rotation and a pedestrian start by Juan Soto. Soto is batting .248 with three home runs, and hes not the only high-priced addition to the Mets who hasnt peaked yet. Frankie Montas hasnt thrown a pitch, and reliever A.J. Minter just joined him on the injured list. Sean Manaea, who came back to the Mets with a $75 million, three-year contract, hasnt pitched yet either because of an oblique strain. But Holmes, who saved 30 games for the New York Yankees last year before signing a $38 million, three-year deal with the Mets, has been a solid addition. Despite the injuries to Montas and Manaea, New York boasts a major league-best 2.36 ERA from its starters. Kodai Senga has a 1.26 ERA, and Tylor Megill (1.74), Griffin Canning (3.12) and David Peterson (3.29) have done their part as well. The Mets offense hasnt yet produced as expected, but spending the money ($54 million for two years) to keep Pete Alonso is working out nicely. Hes hitting .333 and is second in the National League with 26 RBIs. The Yankees, meanwhile, lead the AL East. They replaced Holmes as their closer late last season, putting Luke Weaver in that role. Then they acquired Devin Williams from Milwaukee in an offseason trade. But Williams, so dominant with the Brewers, has already been relieved of his closing duties in New York after allowing 10 earned runs in his first 10 appearances. Weaver hasnt allowed a run all season, so its not as though the Yankees necessarily want Holmes back. But the Mets are happy to have him at the moment. Eugenio Surez had a game for the ages Saturday night, hitting four home runs for Arizona in an 8-7, 10-inning loss to Atlanta. He was the 19th player in MLB history to hit four homers in a game and the first since J.D Martinez did it in 2017. Martinez was also with the Diamondbacks when he pulled off the feat. Surezs big night came eight seasons after MLBs previous four-homer game. The longest drought between four-homer games in the live ball era was nearly 15 years. One Hall of Famer did it on April 30, 1961, and another pulled it off on April 17, 1976. Who were they? As well as theyve been playing, the Mets did end the week with a thud when they blew a six-run seventh-inning lead in an 8-7 loss at Washington on Sunday. New York had a 99% percent chance to win in the seventh, according to Baseball Savant, but Riley Adams hit a three-run homer to cap a five-run seventh for the Nationals. Washington then scored twice in the ninth to win. Honorable mention: The Chicago Cubs trailed the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-7 on Tuesday night before Kyle Tucker hit a two-run homer in the eighth and Miguel Amaya delivered a tying solo shot with two outs in the ninth. Ian Happ led off the bottom of the 10th with an RBI single to win it 11-10. Willie Mays hit four homers in a game in 1961, and Mike Schmidt did it 15 years later. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/clay-holmes-new-york-mets-devin-williams-3e58ac0885966fda31b22e21e3bdd7d0,sports
Former Uber driver J.C. Escarra gives pitch a ride for first major league home run,"NEW YORK (AP)  An Uber driver a little more than two years ago, J.C. Escarra gave a pitch a ride into Yankee Stadiums bleachers for his first major league home run. I didnt feel the ball off the bat, the rookie said after his drive Sunday capped New Yorks 11-2, 5-1 doubleheader sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays. I felt amazing  amazing. And it was special because the first MLB home run and I did it here at home at Yankee Stadium. Escarra, who turned 30 on Thursday, was out of baseball when the Baltimore Orioles released him in 2022. He took detours to teams in Mexico and Puerto Rico, did part-time work as an Uber driver and substitute teacher and signed a minor league contract with the Yankees ahead of the 2024 season. He earned a job on the opening day roster as catcher Austin Wells backup, got his first hit when he made his first start on April 3 and homered in his seventh start behind the plate. Escarra singled in a run against Brendon Little in the three-run sixth inning, then sent a Chad Green slider 415 feet into the right-center bleachers in the eighth. You could see the glow. You could see the joy that hes bringing in those moments, reliever Luke Weaver said. Just letting him know, like, `Hey, sick homer. And its like he just lights up. Escarra got the ball back from a fan in exchange for an autographed bat and is giving the ball to his father, who grew up a Yankees fan in Yonkers. 
        
     This is my team. This is my familys team. Its a dream come true, and Im doing everything as a Yankee so it cant get better than this, Escarra said. If you would have asked me two years ago that Ill be here doing this, Ill tell you that youre lying. Escarra is hitting .200 with three RBIs in 25-bats. We were smiling, jumping around and just really excited for a guy like that who who works hard and obviously you can tell just appreciates the moment and just doesnt take anything for granted, starting pitcher Clarke Schmidt said. Those guys, theyre easy to root for. Pitchers have praised Escarras framing ability. Hes got a really good presence behind the plate, Weaver said. You got to steal some strikes and get as many as we can because we sure appreciate it. Hes a natural at it. Hes worked really hard at it and hes right where he needs to be. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/escarra-first-home-run-yankees-96f94e11bd041cedc6270bd5d427b444,sports
Tennis players in the dark at Madrid Open as matches suspended due to major power outage,"MADRID (AP)  Former U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff was preparing to shower in a dark locker room after play at the Madrid Open was suspended and then postponed Monday due to a major power outage in Spain and Portugal. Then Gauff realized the water was off, too. So I just had to take baby wipes and wipe myself, Gauff said, and spray some perfume and call it a day. Gauff managed to beat Belinda Bencic 6-4, 6-2 shortly before the outage, which apparently cut off the sound as she was giving a post-match interview on the court. Then the 2023 U.S. Open champion posted an Instagram story showing only an emergency light working in an otherwise dark locker room. The power went out at 12:34 p.m. local time (1034 GMT), stopping two ATP singles matches and one doubles match that were underway. For the day, a total of 22 matches had to be canceled. The cut is preventing the use of electronic line calling systems and also left a spider cam dangling over the court inside Manolo Santana Stadium, the ATP added. Tournament organizers said they had no choice but to suspend/cancel all sporting activity in order to guarantee the safety of the players, fans and personnel. Spectators were told to leave the sports complex. Power was restored at night through most parts of Madrid, and organizers said play will resume on Tuesday. Second-ranked Alexander Zverev, a two-time Madrid Open champion, will face Francisco Cerundolo, while Alex de Minaur and Daniil Medvedev will also be in action.  
        
     On the womens side, the remaining six fourth-matches were expected to be played on Tuesday, including top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka facing Peyton Stearns and second-ranked Iga Swiatek taking on Diana Shnaider. When play was stopped, Grigor Dimitrov was leading Jacob Fearnley 6-4, 5-4 inside the main stadium. Also, Matteo Arnaldi was leading Damir Dzumhur 6-3, 3-2 but that match continued later  apparently with manual line calling  and Arnaldi won 6-3, 6-4. The doubles was also completed and some players practiced despite the outage. The blackout brought much of Spain and Portugal to a standstill, knocking out subway networks, phone lines, traffic lights and ATM machines. Spanish power distributor Red Elctrica declined to speculate on the cause of the blackout. Meanwhile, Gauff also posted a photo of candles being distributed. Its just crazy how much we depend on electricity, Gauff said. Its really insane and puts it in perspective. Another fourth-round womens match was also completed before the blackout: Mirra Andreeva beat Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-1, 6-4. ___ Dampf reported from Rome.  ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",https://apnews.com/article/madrid-open-power-outage-ba43f02c3862544f139471bb634aa81b,sports
College baseball notebook: Schlossnagle sweep against his old team solidifies Texas as nations best,"Texas got as much and maybe more than it hoped for out of its weekend series against Texas A&M. The Longhorns won three straight one-run games, extended their win streak to nine games and solidified themselves as the best team in college baseball. The series was played against the backdrop of Jim Schlossnagles first meeting with Texas A&M since he left the Aggies after coaching them to a national runner-up finish last year. Minutes after the College World Series wrapped up, he memorably told the media he planned to finish his career with the Aggies. A day later he was named head coach at Texas. Fans of the burnt orange thought it was a boss move by athletic director Chris Del Conte. The Aggies 12th Man fanbase was livid. It means a lot to me that they played well and didnt get caught up in all the peripheral things about the weekend, Schlossnagle said of his players. This series isnt about any coaches or any of that kind of stuff. Its about the players, about the fans, and we had that conversation last week and they did an awesome job. The wins of 2-1, 3-2 and 6-5 improved the Longhorns to 37-5 and made them the third team to start 19-2 or better in Southeastern Conference play since the league expanded to a 30-game conference schedule in 1996. Texas increased its lead in the SEC to five games over Arkansas and LSU with three regular-season series left. 
        
     Freshman Adrian Rodriguez, who flipped from Texas A&M to Texas when Schlossnagle made his move to Austin, delivered the sweep-clinching home run in the eighth inning Sunday and sixth-year pitcher Andre Duplantier II threw a season-long 5 2/3 innings. The games drew a Texas three-game series attendance record of 23,680. Texas remained the consensus No. 1 team in the polls Monday. The Longhorns visit Arkansas this week, host Florida next week and close the regular season at Oklahoma. LSU (36-9) is No. 2 by D1Baseball.com after taking two of three from defending national champion Tennessee, and Clemson (36-10) is No. 3 after getting swept at North Carolina State. Baseball America also ranks LSU second followed by North Carolina (33-10), which won two of three at Pittsburgh. Oregons three wins over visiting Oregon State marked the Ducks first-ever sweep of a top-three opponent and moved them to Nos. 6 and 12 in the polls. Oregon (30-12) got home runs from Jacob Walsh in each of the games and Maddox Molony went deep Saturday and Sunday. The Ducks on Tuesday visit Oregon State, which is playing as an independent this season, before resuming Big Ten play at Michigan State. UC Irvine swept a key road series against Cal Poly to extend its lead in the Big West to four games over the Mustangs with three conference series left. James Castagnola homered twice in a 6-4 win Friday, Trevor Hansen threw 7 2/3 scoreless innings and extended his shutout streak to 21 1/3 in a 4-0 win Saturday, and Rowan Felsch delivered a tie-breaking, two-out single in the ninth in a 10-8 win Sunday. Big 12-leading West Virginia took three from UCF for its fourth straight sweep. The Mountaineers have won 14 conference games in a row. ... Miami has won nine of its last 10 after finishing a sweep of Boston College with a 3-2 win at Fenway Park on Sunday. ... UConn has gone from 13-17 to 26-17 while winning 13 straight, the longest active streak in the nation. The Huskies are coming off the first-three game sweep of St. Johns in program history. ... Georgia homered seven times in three games against Oklahoma to increase its nation-leading total to 112. Nebraska scored its most runs in a game since 2017 in Sundays 21-5 win at Maryland. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",https://apnews.com/article/college-baseball-6298d081f73f23f51ee9ae8d7920c92b,sports
Jimmer Fredette hired by USA Basketball as mens 3x3 managing director,"Jimmer Fredettes hopes for an Olympic medal were dashed last year by injury. Hell try again to lead USA Basketball to a medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Only this time, he wont be playing. Fredette was announced Monday as the first managing director of USA Basketballs 3x3 mens national team, the same role that Grant Hill has with the senior mens national team. Fredette  the former NBA lottery pick and 2011 AP college player of the year who retired as a player last week  will essentially oversee the selection of players and coaches for major international competitions such as the FIBA World Cup, FIBA AmeriCup, the Pan American Games and ultimately the Olympics. Its an unbelievable honor to be a managing director at USA Basketball, Fredette said. Theres not a whole lot of bigger titles than that in the sport. To be able do something meaningful in the sport, to help build a program and hopefully do it the right way, its an unbelievable opportunity. Fredette didnt know much about the 3x3 game  a fast-paced style played on a half-court with a 12-second shot clock, games going to 21 points and capped at 10 minutes, baskets worth one and two points  when he was asked to consider playing for the U.S. for the first time about three years ago. He eventually became the top-ranked 3x3 player in FIBAs world rankings. Jimmer brought his legendary shooting style to 3x3 in 2022 and quickly became one of the most beloved athletes on the halfcourt, USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said. His knowledge of and skill for the game, ability to lead and reputation as one of the games best shooters in history puts him in a prime position to become the first person in this role and help shape USA Basketballs 3x3 mens national team program on the road to Los Angeles. 
        
     USA Basketball plans to proceed with the same structure for the 3x3 womens national team program. It is in the process of identifying a managing director, with plans to announce that persons hiring later this year. Jimmer Fredette is the ideal former athlete and leader to continue to build the USA 3x3 mens program into the premier program in the world, said retired Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chair of USA Basketballs board of directors. Fredette was USA Basketballs 3x3 Male Athlete of the Year in 2023, won gold medals at the 2023 Pan American Games and 2022 FIBA 3x3 Mens AmeriCup, and made the roster for the Paris Olympics. The 3x3 game, he said, came at the right time for his life as a player. He wanted more time with his family in Colorado and passed on opportunities to continue playing the 5-on-5 game internationally, turning to the 3x3 game instead because it rarely took him away from home for more than a few days at a time. He accepted this offer in part because he wants to thank USA Basketball for that opportunity. I definitely can see myself doing this and being a part of this, Fredette said. The people treated me so well, and I love all the people involved. I just want to be able to give back and help as much as I can. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/jimmer-fredette-usa-basketball-olympics-9ed6d29105c0eadc324187b435f41661,sports
14-year-old Suryavanshi smashes a record-breaking T20 century in crickets Indian Premier League,"JAIPUR, India (AP)  The 14-year-old batter Vaibhav Suryavanshi hit a breathtaking century in the Indian Premier League on Monday, and made it one of the greatest innings in mens Twenty20 cricket history. Just nine days after becoming the youngest player to debut in the IPL, Suryavanshi blew away observers again with a century in just his third match and, to boot, the second fastest in the tournaments 18 years. He got there in just 35 deliveries by pulling Gujarat Titans star spinner Rashid Khan for a six over midwicket, and sending the Rajasthan Royals packed home crowd in Jaipur to their feet yet again.

(AP Photo/Surjeet Yadav) Of the 100 runs, an incredible 94 came off boundaries. He hit 11 sixes and seven fours. It feels really good, Suryavanshi said. It is like a dream to score a century in the IPL. What Ive been practicing for the last three, four months, the result is showing. He was out three balls later for 101, missing a yorker. But his 166-run opening stand with Yashasvi Jaiswal, who scored 70 not out off 40 balls, propelled Rajasthan to a remarkable rundown of Gujarats imposing total of 209-4 with 25 balls to spare. Rajasthan made 212-2, winning for only the third time in 10 games to stay in playoffs contention. Cricket is the most popular sport in India by a considerable margin, and the lucrative IPL has offered a showcase for talent emerging from the population of 1.4 billion to mix it with the sports top international stars. 
        
     Fervent fans are always on the lookout for the next superstar player like Sachin Tendulkar, who transformed from precocious teenage talent into an iconic figure and the leading international scorer in the sport. The great Tendulkar was impressed with Suryavanshi, who was described by TV commentators during his dramatic innings as an amazing 14-year-old boy. Suryavanshi rose to fame when he was drafted at age 13 last November. In a splashy debut this month, he whacked the first ball he faced for six at the same venue. He showed brutal power-hitting on Monday against a battery of seasoned international bowlers including Khan, Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma and Washington Sundar. The teenager smacked Sharma for three sixes and two fours in one over and clubbed spinner Sundar for two sixes and a four to raise the 2025 IPLs fastest half-century off 17 balls. Suryavanshi raced to 94 when he belted Afghanistan fast bowler Karim Janat for three sixes and three fours, and raised the hundred against the great Khan. It was incredible, Rajasthan captain Riyan Parag said of Suryavanshi. Weve spent two months with him (and) we have seen what he can do, but to see him do this against the world-class bowlers ... (I) cant express in words. Suryavanshi was patted on the back by his partner Jaiswal as he celebrated, removed his helmet and raised his bat to acknowledge the applause of the home crowd. He also saluted his teammates in the dugout with his bat.

(AP Photo/Surjeet Yadav) Only West Indies great Chris Gayle has hit an IPL hundred in less balls, 30, and that was 12 years ago. Fast bowler Prasidh Krishna finally bowled out Suryavanshi, who walked off to another standing ovation and to hugs from teammates. Left-handers Suryavanshi and Jaiswal raised Rajasthans highest stand for any wicket in the IPL, and the teenager eclipsed Sanju Samsons record of 10 sixes in an IPL innings for an Indian batter. Batting with him (Jaiswal) gives me confidence because he keeps very positive, (and it) becomes easy to bat with him, Suryavanshi said. He added he doesnt notice the crowds much to just focus on the ball. Gujarat captain Shubman Gill made an aggressive 84 off 50 balls while his opening partner Sai Sudharsan scored 39 to overtake Virat Kohli as the leading scorer of the season with 456 runs in nine matches. The pair added 93 runs for the first wicket off 62 balls before Sudharsan holed out at long-on in the 11th over. Gill looked well set for a century but missed Maheesh Theekshanas low full toss and was caught at long-off. Jos Buttler cut loose in the death overs with a 26-ball unbeaten 50. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/suryavanshi-14-ipl-rajasthan-gujarat-d574d22838adf4bbd18e3239406f2545,sports
"Kentucky Derby: How to watch, the favorites and what to expect in the 151st running of the race","The first Saturday in May means its time for the 151st Kentucky Derby, Americas longest continuously held sporting event. Nineteen horses stampeding 1 1/4 miles around Churchill Downs isnt just a race. Its 150,000 fans jammed under the Twin Spires for a fashion show mixed with an all-day party that is heavy on traditions like mint juleps, singing My Old Kentucky Home and a garland of red roses draped on the winner. 6:57 p.m. Eastern on Saturday. Saturdays forecast is for a high around 65 degrees (32 Celsius) with a 90% chance of rain. The last muddy track was in 1989 when Sunday Silence won. The last sloppy track was in 2019 when Country House won via disqualification. Friday: Coverage runs from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern on USA Network and streaming on Peacock. The highlight is the 151st Kentucky Oaks for fillies with a post time of 5:51 p.m. Saturday: Derby Day coverage begins at noon Eastern on USA Network and streaming on Peacock. NBC and Peacock have coverage from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Telemundo Deportes begins at 6:30 p.m. on Universo and streaming on the Telemundo app. All races at Churchill Downs except the Derby will be shown on FanDuel TV. A pre-race tradition is the walkover, when the horses are led from the stables to the paddock where they are saddled for the race. Some are cool and calm, others get fractious and sweaty. They walk on the track along the rail with fans yelling all the way. The riders emerge from the jockeys room and walk to the paddock to meet their mounts. Besides the sleek thoroughbreds, check out the crowd decked out in hats and fascinators, floral-print dresses and seersucker suits that make the Derby the worlds most fashionable sporting event.  Journalism was the 3-1 morning-line favorite. The Southern California-based colt is trained by Michael McCarthy and ridden by Umberto Rispoli. Journalism will break from the No. 8 post, which has had nine winners, the last being Mage in 2023. He has won four races in a row. The morning-line favorite has won 18 times, the last was Justify in 2018. Sovereignty was the early second choice at 5-1. The Florida Derby winner is trained by Hall of Famer Bill Mott and ridden by Junior Alvarado. He drew the No. 18 post, putting him outside most of the 20-horse field. Third choice on the morning line was Sandman at 6-1 odds. The Arkansas Derby winner is trained by Mark Casse and ridden by Jose Ortiz. He will break from post 17, which has never produced a winner. Six-time Derby winner Bob Baffert is back after serving a three-year suspension by Churchill Downs. He scratched Rodriguez, who won the Wood Memorial with a front-running style, on Thursday. That leaves Baffert with 20-1 long shot Citizen Bull, last years 2-year-old champion. He drew the dreaded No. 1 post with Martin Garcia aboard. No horse has won from the inside post since 1986. Hall of Famer trainer D. Wayne Lukas saddles his 51st Derby starter  second-most ever  with 30-1 shot American Promise. He has four Derby victories and at 89, he would be the oldest trainer to win. The colt drew the No. 5 post, which has had the most Derby winners with 10. With Rodriguez scratched, Baeza moves into the field. The colt was runner-up in last months Santa Anita Derby and is trained by John Shirreffs, best known for guiding superstar Zenyatta and winning the Derby in 2005 with Giacomo at 50-1. Grande, a 20-1 shot, was scratched on Friday with a sore foot, leaving 19 horses in the starting gate. While some of the owners, trainers and jockeys are the same from year to year, the horses never are. The Derby is for male and female 3-year-olds only, meaning a horse is eligible just once in its career. Only three fillies have won, the last was in 1988. The late country singer Toby Keiths Dream Walkin Farms is a part-owner of 30-1 shot Render Judgment.  Former Philadelphia Phillies star Jayson Werth, whose stable is Two Eight Racing in a nod to his old jersey number, is a co-owner of Flying Mohawk, also at 30-1. Grammy-nominated singer Grace Potter performs the national anthem on Derby Day. Seven-time Olympic champion gymnast Simone Biles gives the Riders up! call, signaling the jockeys to climb aboard.  For the second straight year, the Derby total purse is $5 million, with the winning owner earning $1.3 million and a gold trophy. Second place is worth $1 million, with payouts down to fifth place. The winning horses breeding rights are likely to soar. The winning jockey typically receives 10% of the purse and a smaller trophy. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing and Derby coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/kentucky-derby",https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-derby-guide-626276aa4ff6b6032b774abc4db2e890,sports
Federal judge tosses lawsuit brought by ex-college basketball players against NCAA over use of NIL,"NEW YORK (AP)  A federal judge dismissed an antitrust lawsuit Monday that had been brought against the NCAA by several former college basketball players, including Kansas standout Mario Chalmers, after ruling its claims fell outside the four-year statute of limitations. The lawsuit, which included 16 total players who played before June 16, 2016, claimed that the NCAA had enriched itself by utilizing their names, images and likenesses to promote its mens basketball tournament. That date in 2016 is the earliest date for players to be included in the House v. NCAA antitrust settlement awaiting final approval from a federal judge. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer pointed toward a four-year statute of limitations for federal antitrust violations, despite the lawsuit contending that the law continues to be breached by the NCAAs use of the players NIL in March Madness promotions. Chalmers famously hit a tying 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds left for Kansas in the 2008 title game against Memphis, a highlight that remains a staple of NCAA Tournament packages. The Jayhawks went on to win the championship in overtime. The NCAAs use today of a NIL acquired decades ago as the fruit of an antitrust violation does not constitute a new overt act restarting the limitations clock, Engelmayer wrote in the 34-page decision. Instead, as the NCAA argues, the contemporary use of a NIL reflects performance of an aged agreement: a contract between the student-athlete and the NCAA under which it acquired footage and images of the plaintiff. Engelmayer also noted that the plaintiffs were part of the class in OBannon v. NCAA, the 2015 case that helped to usher in the age of NIL payments so the lawsuit was not demonstrably different from other settled cases involving the athletes. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",https://apnews.com/article/ncaa-lawsuit-dismissed-431a0c5cec0da3e8c812603a374f99ac,sports

Soccer player gets 14-month jail sentence for causing death of cyclist in England,"LEEDS, England (AP)  A soccer player from a third-division English club was sentenced to 14 months in prison Thursday for causing the death of a cyclist three years ago, West Yorkshire police said. Lucas Akins, a forward for League One team Mansfield, was driving a Mercedes when it struck 33-year-old cyclist Adrian Daniel at an intersection near Huddersfield on March 17, 2022. Daniel died 10 days later. Akins, 36, was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court after having previously admitted causing a death by careless or inconsiderate driving. Akins, who played in Mansfields game on Monday, was also disqualified from driving for a year. The club is considering its position with regards to Lucas and will be making no further comment at this stage, Mansfield said in a statement that also offered sincere and deepest condolences to the family of Adrian Daniel. Daniels wife, Savanna, said in a statement after sentencing that three years of hell, three years of avoidance and adding further to my trauma has finally come to a close today with Akins sentencing, according to the West Yorkshire police announcement. Never being allowed to fully live the reality of Adrians absence, she continued, because of the farce Akins has made of the justice system and the chances offered to him, has finally been put to bed and this man is no more deserving of any further of my time or concern. It should have been resolved sooner, she added, which makes a mockery of any remorse that Akins offers for his actions. Akins has made several appearances for the Grenada national team. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/lucas-akins-death-cyclist-sentenced-jail-27a1de9b579a1ca3cf9b12cfec4a50d7,sports

Harry Kane is about to end his long wait for a trophy with Bayern Munich after a career as runner-up,"World soccers great runner-up is finally about to lift a trophy. Harry Kane is on the verge of winning the German league title with Bayern Munich and he could seal the deal on Saturday. After a career filled with individual top scorer awards and a host of runner-up medals  the Champions League, two European Championships, two English League Cups  it will be the first major trophy of Kanes career.  A player whos often talked of putting the team above himself will finally get his reward. If its me scoring a couple of goals, Ill take that for sure, but if its someone else, Im not going to worry too much, Kane said this month. All those kinds of individual achievements are what you think about after its done. Bayern has an eight-point lead over second-place Leverkusen with four games to play. The title could be confirmed Saturday if Bayern beats Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen doesnt beat Hoffenheim. No one deserves it more than him, Bayerns honorary president Uli Hoeness told broadcaster Sky on Wednesday. Theres been bad luck along the way and Kanes trophy drought has sometimes brought mockery from opposition fans. At Tottenham, it often seemed like Kane and Son Heung-min were working wonders with a team which couldnt match rivals budgets. Tottenham has been in sharp decline since its all-time top scorer left. There have been tough days, especially when Kane was limited by an ankle injury in Tottenhams 2-0 loss to Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League final, or Englands penalty shootout loss to Italy at his home European Championship two years later. 
        
     Kane could have won a trophy hours after signing for Bayern for a fee of potentially over 100 million pounds ($110 million at the time), but the team lost the German Super Cup on his debut. Months later, his club lost the league title to Leverkusen in a major upset. Things have improved this season under new coach Vincent Kompany but Bayern was knocked out of the German Cup by Leverkusen in December and eliminated from the Champions League by Inter Milan last week.  When Kane moved to Germany in 2023, it was a shock. Hed been at Tottenham since he was 11 and once seemed set to spend his entire career there. Kane is captain of the England national team, whose players typically tend to stay in the Premier League. Hes also a big cricket fan, and was leaving that sports birthplace for a country where few have ever heard of it. Kane settled in well after initial delays moving his family to Bavaria  his fourth child was born a week after he signed with Bayern  and has been taking German lessons.  He fits Bayern well, too. Just like club great Robert Lewandowski, who left for Barcelona in 2022, Kane provides the center-forward focus which provides the structure for other players like Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise to operate around. Kanes putting up impressive scoring numbers. He scored his 60th Bundesliga goal in his 60th game last week, reaching that mark faster than anyone before him. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/harry-kane-bayern-munich-bundesliga-trophy-14b5c463f29a59475cdbd7882b3ca000,sports

Why cant Kyle Larson win the Daytona 500? Jeff Gordon believes defeats are getting in his head,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Owen Larson called it when he said his dad wouldnt win the Daytona 500 because he probably needs to try really hard because hes not good at superspeedway racing. The 10-year-old was right in his assessment. Kyle Larson can win just about anywhere in any type of car. But when it comes to Daytona and Talladega, NASCARs 2021 Cup Series champion is a disaster. Larson dropped to 0 for 22 at Daytona International Speedway  its 0 for 42 in the Cup Series once Talladega Superspeedways stats are included  when he finished 20th in Sunday nights Daytona 500. The Associated Press was embedded with the Hendrick Motorsports No. 5 team with a front row seat for his 201 frustrating laps in which Larson complained over his radio that I make all the wrong moves. Any move I make is the wrong one. His exacerbation only mounted when all three of his Hendrick teammates led laps, William Byron won for a second consecutive year, and Byron and Alex Bowman finished inside the top-six. Chase Elliott was 15th. Jeff Gordon, the vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports and a three-time Daytona 500 winner, didnt dispute Larsons notion of not being able to properly navigate the pack racing typical of Daytona International Speedway. I noticed that, he said of Larsons declaration he couldnt make a single right move. I can be hard on him because I love Kyle and I think hes amazing. 
        
     Larson is amazing and opened 2025 with a slew of victories, including in sprint cars in Australia, the Chili Bowl and at Volusia Speedway in the lead-up to the Daytona 500. But, just as his oldest son predicted, he was a non-factor at Daytona despite every motivational speech crew chief Cliff Daniels tried on his driver. The two have been paired since Larson moved to Hendrick and the No. 5 team in 2021 and won 10 races and the Cup title. Larson has won 23 Cup races since his move to Hendrick, and for that, the leadership at Hendrick is able to give him a pass on his struggles at superspeedways. Gosh, the guy is not perfect, Gordon said, but added that his struggles have now become bigger than just not being able to feel confident at Daytona or Talladega. I think now Im starting to see its getting in his head. Ive had a few conversations with him, and like, Man, just go for it, just forget about it, dont try to even overthink it, Gordon said. I dont know what advice to give him other than  all I told him today is Just be Kyle Larson. Dont try to be something youre not. Dont look at what somebody else is doing thats having success. Just go out there and execute, and the other things will turn around and come your way eventually. Byron was quick to point out that not winning the season-opening race means little for Larson in the grand scheme of things. The next month includes Cup races at Phoenix, where Larson won the race to clinch the 2021 championship, and Las Vegas, where two of his three career wins have come in the last three visits to the desert track. Wait until we get to Vegas, and hell just be ripping, Byron said. Larsons difficulties at Daytona could be traced to his 2013 Xfinity Series debut at the track. He sailed into the fence and destroyed his car in a frightening crash for a driver who had skyrocketed from sprint cars to the top level of racing in the United States. Although he won the Xfinity race in 2018, hes never really been a factor in the Daytona 500, where he dropped to 0 for 12 in The Great American Race. Larson figures his career resume would be fine without a Daytona 500 victory. Hes won every other crown jewel: NASCARs All-Star race in 2019, 2021 and 2023; the 2021 Coca-Cola 600; the 2023 Southern 500; and the 2024 Brickyard 400. Like, Im not going to lose sleep if I dont ever win this race, but I still want to win the race and have that ring and that trophy and be a part of the names that have won it, Larson said. But again, I think theres a lot else, a lot more that goes into winning and a lot of luck. Its not a big deal. Gordon said Larson and Daniels have a lot of soul-searching to do to make success on superspeedways happen. Its a head-scratcher for sure, for he and Cliff and the whole team, Gordon said. But Im sure theyll figure it out. Owen Larson, perhaps his fathers harshest critic, disagrees. Until his father gets better, his oldest child believes Daytona is always going to be a struggle for Larson. He has to try harder, Owen Larson said. And what specific area? Probably drafting. Perhaps Larson should take his sons advice before NASCAR gets to Talladega later this spring. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-daytona-500-kyle-larson-c7a230f24fed740d87250f71e3d239ef,sports
"Red carpet, fashion and music: F1 launches its 2025 season Hollywood style","LONDON (AP)  Formula 1 kick-started its 75th anniversary season with music, glitz and glamor Tuesday as the race series aims to reach beyond a sports audience with a two-hour televised arena show. Lewis Hamilton arrived wearing a tie in Ferrari red for his biggest event yet since joining the Italian team, before the seven-time champion emerged to rousing cheers in a full race suit to present the teams livery alongside teammate Charles Leclerc. Asked to pick a word to describe his mood ahead of the new season, Hamilton picked invigorated, because I feel so full of life and so much energy, because everythings new. Just focused on whats up ahead. Im so proud to be part of the team, something new and exciting for me. The F1 75 Live event at Londons O2 arena was the first time the sport hosted its own large-scale launch event, rather than leaving it to the individual teams. Drivers arrived on the red carpet for a show unlike any other event in F1 history which ended with all 20 drivers on a stage transformed into a grid, standing alongside cars in each teams 2025 livery. Lavish team presentations included a James Bond parody for Aston Martin, a line of drummers with glowing sticks, cars sliding down the stage on motorized platforms, a parade of title-winning McLarens, and a comedy skit that played on Racing Bulls sponsor-heavy full name.  The live crowd of F1 fans brought some unpredictability, with some boos for a mention of the governing body, the FIA, which has been in dispute with drivers over how it enforces punishments for swearing, and for Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. 
        
     There were also musical acts like country singer Kane Brown, who introduced Haas, British band Take That. American rapper and singer MGK, also known as Machine Gun Kelly, gave the show a high-energy, guitar-heavy intro. Teams presented their 2025 liveries, but didnt have to show off the actual cars theyll race this season. Teams are still allowed to hold their own launch events to present their 2025 cars, as McLaren and Williams did last week and Ferrari is expected to do Wednesday. It comes at a time when F1 is keen to expand beyond a sports audience, with races in cities like Miami and Las Vegas, a movie called F1 starring Brad Pitt releasing in June, and the ongoing popularity of the Drive To Survive series on Netflix. To have this many fans out shows that we bring the sport together away from the racetrack. Theres a lot of excitement, McLaren chief executive Zak Brown said Tuesday. The Brad Pitt movie will no doubt create a huge amount of awareness for the sport. Netflix, Im sure, knowing what happened last year, will be a drama-filled television show again, which has been great for all of us. So I think the sports going from strength to strength. Drivers broadly welcomed the new launch show, though two-time champion Fernando Alonso warned it could be a little bit of distraction at a time when drivers and teams are fine-tuning their approach to the season. Asked if he thought the launch would become a regular event, Horner said: Im sure if they think they can make some money out of it, well be doing this most years. F1s preparations for the new season  which marks the series 75th anniversary  continue with preseason testing next week at the Bahrain International Circuit. The first race is the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 16. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-75-live-launch-o2-cf9df86474638ca57b5d49975cce3730,sports
George Russell says he wont change approach to Max Verstappen after F1 feud in 2024,"LONDON (AP)  George Russell says he wont follow Lando Norris by changing his approach to Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen following a feud last season, as Verstappen said he has no intention to continue any kind of beef. Russell accused Verstappen of bullying in November and claimed the Dutch driver had threatened to crash into him deliberately. The rift began with a dispute over a penalty in qualifying which cost the world champion pole position. McLarens Norris said last week hell drive with his elbows out when racing Verstappen in 2025 after controversial on-track battles between the title rivals last season. We havent spoken (with Verstappen since last year), no concerns about him or his driving or anything. That happened last year and I want to focus on myself, Russell said Tuesday ahead of F1s season launch event in London. Obviously things, I felt, got out of line at the end of last year and I made it pretty clear that Im not going to take it. But now its 2025 and Im focused on the job and the job is to win, so Im not going to change my approach fighting him, fighting any other drivers. The goal is the same. Asked about Russells comments, Verstappen signaled hed like to let the matter lie. Honestly, I have no intention to continue any kind of beef in February, he said. Im still enjoying my time actually away from Formula 1 and just getting ready for the season. So I have honestly nothing to say about that subject. 
        
     FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayems push to cut down on swearing by F1 drivers led to punishments last season for Verstappen and Charles Leclerc. Of course I understand that you cannot always swear everywhere you go, right? And I think we all understand that as racing drivers, Verstappen said Tuesday. But sometimes in the heat of the moment or when you get interviewed, when youre in your car or whatever, youve just had an adrenaline rush or whatever. You know, sometimes things slip out a little bit. Russell is a director of the Grand Prix Drivers Association, the body representing F1 drivers, which called on the FIA to treat drivers like adults on the issue last year. Since then, new rules for 2025 mean drivers could now be suspended or lose championship points if they swear repeatedly. I do think theres merit in saying there is no need to swear in an environment like this, Russell said, sitting alongside new Italian teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli. But ultimately, especially for the guys when English isnt their first language, the first thing you get taught are the swear words and the first Italian words hes teaching me are the swear words. Russell has also been critical of the FIA after the governing body fired leading officials, including then-race director Niels Wittich, last season. In November he called for clarity over whos getting fired next at the FIA. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/george-russell-max-verstappen-f1-881a8d4ab5f0062f50995bf09c5cf210,sports
Rory McIlroy wins The Players Championship and Masters expectations rise,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Rory McIlroy winning The Players Championship gave him so much of what he doesnt need. The $4.5 million prize is the largest for any tournament in the world. It pushed McIlroys career earnings on the PGA Tour alone to just over $99.7 million, second only to Tiger Woods. The perks include a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour (his 28 wins make him a life member) and three-year exemptions to the majors (hes been eligible for all of them since 2009). It also raised expectations for McIlroy going into the Masters. He probably doesnt need those, either. Even at the TPC Sawgrass for the premier championship of the PGA Tour, the week for McIlroy started and ended with talk about the Masters. It was last Tuesday when a University of Texas golfer watched McIlroy hook his tee shot into the water on the 18th during a practice round and told him it was just like the shot McIlroy hit on the 10th hole at Augusta National  the one that started his shocking collapse in the 2011 Masters. That remains as close as McIlroy has come to winning a green jacket. McIlroy took his phone and handed it to security, the Longhorn lad was removed and McIlroy didnt want to talk about the incident a few days later. Far more pleasant was the end of the week. Disappointed after losing a three-shot lead with five holes to play in regulation Sunday, more nervous than he would have expected at the start of a three-hole playoff Monday, McIlroy made quick work of J.J. Spaun with three great swings. The last one was a three-quarter 9-iron in the wind that left everyone hopeful until it plopped down in the middle of an island at No. 17. 
        
     Winning The Players is a big deal, and McIlroy now has won it twice. I dont want to put any sort of label on it, but it is one of the biggest championships in the world, McIlroy said. This also is the first time in his career he has two victories leading to the Masters, having won at Pebble Beach last month. Go back to last November, when McIlroy won the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, and that makes three wins in his last six starts. The first question from Sky Sports: Have you ever been in a better headspace going into the majors after those two big wins? The majors start with the Masters. For McIlroy, its always the Masters. This starts the 11th year since he last won a major, his 11th time going to Augusta National knowing its the one major keeping him from the career Grand Slam. Ive had good starts to years before, McIlroy said, and this much is true. Go back to 2019 when he started the year with seven straight top 10s, including a victory in The Players Championship. He tied for 21st at the Masters. Look, Im in good form, he said. Im playing well. I feel like all aspects of my game are under control. I just have to keep working hard, keep my head down. Its another opportunity to just refine little bits that need refining. But this is setting up nicely for him. Scottie Scheffler had to wait a month to get going because surgery to his right palm that was punctured by a wine glass he was using to make ravioli. Scheffler still hasnt had all the pieces fall together since returning at Pebble Beach, though he does not appear to be far off. Xander Schauffele, winner of two majors last year, just returned from two months away because of a rib injury. His only celebration has been making the cut on the number the last two weeks to extend his streak to 59 in a row. McIlroy plans one more start  the Houston Open  before the Masters, the ultimate measure. He feels more equipped than ever to bag another major, and he certainly has been hardened by more failures than he would like to remember. St. Andrews in 2022 and the U.S. Open the last two years were his for the taking and someone else took home the trophy. Pinehurst No. 2 was particularly brutal last year when he missed a pair of short putts on crispy greens down the stretch. McIlroy believes he began to turn the corner last fall in a playoff loss at Wentworth, and spending quality time on finding freedom in his swing. He also points to the second round of the Masters last year, when the wind came up and he went down with a 77 that effectively took him out of the tournament. Now he has a shorter swing for the occasion, once for his wedge and now down to the 7-iron. He employed those beautifully in the Pacific wind when he won at Pebble Beach. His 9-iron to the par-3 17th in the playoff at Sawgrass on Monday was masterful. When the conditions come like that, he said, reflecting on that Friday round at Augusta last year, I just feel like Im a lot better prepared to handle them. Its always been OK off the tee, but its flighting the wedges and short irons, which have been the issue, and I feel like Ive been able to rectify that. It all leads to what he believes has made him a more complete player. There is a certain calmness to him, even with the nerves he felt Monday in the playoff. The pressure will be strong as ever when he gets to Augusta National. Everything feels like its in good working order at the minute, he said. Just keep practicing and doing the right things and practicing the right habits. And day after day, week after week, they all add up to days like today. ___ On The Fringe analyzes the biggest topics in golf during the season.

A dream week for Danny Walker at The Players. Graeme McDowell faces big week in Macau,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  The Players Championship is reducing its 144-man field to 120 players next year, a move that might allow weekday rounds to finish on time, perhaps improve the overall pace of play and probably will eliminate a week like the one Danny Walker had. Walker, a PGA Tour rookie who last year was a spectator at the TPC Sawgrass, moved up the alternate list when Tiger Woods and three other eligible players did not enter, and Lee Hodges withdrew on Monday. And then Walker got his big break when Jason Day had stomach issues that forced him to withdraw about 90 minutes before his tee time. Oddly enough, Walker also was in the bathroom when he got the call he was in Thursday morning. He went out to his car for a moment of meditation. Walker, who has lived down the road from the TPC Sawgrass the last five years, was the mystery guest in the marquee group alongside Jordan Spieth and Wyndham Clark. He left Friday with a pit in his stomach after a three-putt bogey on the 18th hole that looked as though it would cause him to miss the cut. He made it on the number, had weekend rounds of 66-70 and held his own along the way, still in the mix until a bogey on the 13th hole and nothing but pars the rest of the way. He tied for sixth, worth $843,750. Thats about $190,000 more than his career earnings on four PGA Tour-sanctioned circuits dating to 2018. 
        
     Not even a year-and-a-half ago, I had little to no money in my bank account, Walker said. Its a big change. He is off to the Valspar Championship next week, hoping to ride some momentum the rest of the year. Along with the enormous paycheck, he moved to No. 46 in the FedEx Cup. Its early, yes, but with only the top 100 getting cards, this indeed was a big week. Graeme McDowell might be feeling more pressure than the other 19 players from LIV Golf at the International Series Macau on the Asian Tour. At stake are three spots to the British Open for the leading players not already exempt. The Open returns this year to Royal Portrush, his hometown. Obviously it is a great opportunity next week in Macau to have three Open Championship spots, McDowell said. Especially for me with it being Royal Portrush, my hometown, there is a little bit of extra motivation there. The LIV Golf event in Singapore would not suggest McDowell goes to Macau riding good form. He finished 53rd in the 54-man field. His best finish in four LIV events is a tie for 12th the previous week in Hong Kong. Others playing in Macau are former Masters champions Sergio Garcia and Patrick Reed, neither of whom are eligible for Portrush. Both are assured of playing only in the Masters. McDowell was not eligible for Portrush in 2019 when he earned one of the two spots at the Canadian Open. If he doesnt earn an Open spot in Macau, he could have two more opportunities. The Open Qualifying Series also offers spots at the Korea Open on the Asian Tour on May 22-25, and the Mizuno Open on the Japan Golf Tour the following week. LIV Golf is not playing those weeks. Rory McIlroy has a history of changing his views, particularly when it comes to LIV Golf, but he was certain as ever when he said he would absolutely not play the PGA Tour Champions. Something has went terribly wrong if I have to compete at golf at 50, he said. Ernie Els isnt so sure. The Big Easy also felt certain the 50-and-older league would be the last place for him. Now hes a regular, and even leading the Charles Schwab Cup early in the season. At 35 years old I was also bullet proof saying things about not playing past 50, Els said in a social media post. Im 55 now and laughing at my comments from back then. ... Competition is a powerful tool! It was reminiscent of a conversation with Tiger Woods in 2005, when he was 29 and on the verge of going on another big run. He was asked how long he would play. Ill definitely quit the game earlier than people think, Woods said that day in a parking lot at Doral. The only reason I would play is the occasional tournament if my son is good enough to be out there, and he chooses to play. This was four years before his son, Charlie, was born. When my best isnt good enough to win anymore, Im walking, Woods said. Ive won tournaments when I wasnt playing my best. If I play my best and dont win, theres no reason to be out there. Injuries were not part of that conversation, of course. At that time, Woods had only two surgeries on his left knee, both considered more about cleanup than repair. Views at age 29 are different than age 49. Theres also knowing when a player can no longer compete. Woods was asked that day if he had ever played his best and didnt win. No, he replied. Had he ever played his best and come close not to winning? No, he said. That led to one last question. Had he ever played his best? He mentioned his 15-shot victory in the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, and his 12-shot win at the Masters. And as he turned to leave he added, And the (2000) British Open. That was a good week. That was the year he said he hit a 2-inch draw on the 14th hole at St. Andrews. He won by eight to complete the career Grand Slam. He was 24. Matt Fitzpatrick and caddie Billy Foster had been together six years, a reasonable tenure notable for Foster finally being on the bag for a major when Fitzpatrick won the 2022 U.S. Open at The Country Club. That came to an end last week when Fitzpatrick said it was time for them to part ways after he missed the cut at The Players Championship. All good things come to an end. This game never stops to frustrate you & infuriate you!!! Foster said in an Instagram post. Unfortunately times change & ultimately its the caddie or the coach that has to accept results are not good enough & when you stop enjoying what you are doing its time for a change. Foster has worked for Seve Ballesteros, Thomas Bjorn, Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood, and even filled in for Tiger Woods. Hes been around long enough to know that sometimes a player-caddie relationship simply runs its course. He looked at me and said its not working, Foster told Athlon Sports. So I just hugged him and said I understood. More than 6,000 tickets were scanned Monday at The Players Championship for a three-hole playoff that lasted 47 minutes. ... Paul Casey and Tom McKibbin of LIV Golf are not in Macau this week with three British Open spots available. They are playing the Porsche Singapore Classic on the European tour. Both are Porsche ambassadors. ... How to spend the night before a three-hole playoff at the TPC Sawgrass? Rory McIlroy said he ordered room service and watched, The Devil Wears Prada. ... Jon Rahm is the only player on LIV Golf to have finished in the top 10 at all four events this year. By winning The Players Championship and its $4.5 million prize, Rory McIlroy moved past Phil Mickelson to No. 2 on the PGA Tours career money list with $99,709,062. I went through my fair share of losses, criticism, expectations. You have to be willing to get your heart broken.

"Georgia man sentenced to to 1 year in theft of Arnold Palmer green jacket, other Masters memorabilia","CHICAGO (AP)  A former Georgia warehouse worker for the Augusta National Golf Club was sentenced to one year in prison Wednesday for transporting millions of dollars worth of stolen Masters tournament memorabilia, including one of Arnold Palmers iconic green jackets.  Richard Globensky, 40, pleaded guilty last year to one count of transporting stolen goods across state lines. He appeared Wednesday in Chicagos federal court wearing a suit and red tie. With his parents and wife seated in the courtroom behind him, he apologized for his actions before U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman handed down the sentence. I deeply regret the decision that led me to this moment, he said, his voice breaking. I have taken full responsibility for my actions and remain committed to doing everything in my power to make amends. Globensky and his attorney did not respond to reporters questions as they left federal court. Under the sentence, he will also have to pay more than $3 million in restitution and face one year of supervised release. Federal prosecutors had sought a 16-month sentence, while defense attorneys wanted probation. Globensky took items from the warehouse for sellers in Florida, who then sold them online at a markup, according to prosecutors. Globensky was paid through a limited liability company set up in his wifes name, among other ways. The scheme lasted for more than a decade, earning him over $5 million. 
        
     The violation of trust was very serious and ongoing, Brian Hayes, an assistant U.S. attorney, said in court.  Still, he noted how Globensky cooperated in the ongoing investigation, providing text messages between him and a third-party. Court documents only identify the third party as Individual A, along with an associate Individual B. Hayes said Globensky also preemptively sold his house and gave the proceeds to the government. The items, which were stolen between 2009 and 2022, included such historic memorabilia as tickets to Masters tournaments in the 1930s, as well as T-shirts, mugs and chairs, according to prosecutors. Among the stolen legendary green jackets were those won by Palmer, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen.  Some of the stolen goods were recovered in the Chicago area, which is why the court case was at the downtown courthouse.  Globensky, who had worked at the warehouse since 2007, would secretly photograph items and send them to a Florida-based seller. Globensky would then sneak out items that they were interested in, taking small quantities to avoid the risk of Augusta Nationals auditing practices, according to court documents. Items were hidden in an offsite storage facility and shipped.  Prosecutors say the money was used to fund a luxurious lifestyle, including $370,000 to buy vehicles and a boat, $160,000 for Disney-themed vacations and $32,000 for items at Louis Vuitton, according to court documents made public earlier this month.  In court, Globenskys defense attorney, Thomas Church, said it wasnt uncommon for employees to occasionally take items from the warehouse, his client had expressed remorse and wasnt a danger to the public.  This is not a case where he went and broke into any vaults. He didnt manipulate any data or access any electronic data, Church said in court, explaining that his client saw the opportunity to take items that were set to be destroyed or werent selling. The total loss to Augusta National was more than $3 million, according to prosecutors.  An Augusta National spokesman asked for comment Wednesday pointed to a victim impact statement submitted to the court during the hearing. We were severely disappointed to learn several years ago that a former Augusta National employee betrayed that principle, and our trust, by stealing from the Club, Tournament and even a number of legends whose accomplishments at the Masters and in the game of golf are revered by all, Augusta National said in the letter. In short, the employee made significant personal gain with no regard for the impact his selfishness would have on the Club, players, the Tournament, and his fellow employees. Augusta National hosts the annual Masters golf tournament each year in April, which Scottie Scheffler won last year.  Palmer, who died in 2016 at age 87, won four green jackets. Hes widely credited with introducing golf to the masses and hit the ceremonial tee shot every year at the Masters for years after he stopped playing in the tournament in 2004. Getting a ticket to the Masters also gives fans the chance to buy exclusive merchandise thats not officially sold online. But the green jackets are particularly guarded by the Georgia company that owns Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters golf tournament. The company sued in 2017 to stop a golf memorabilia company from auctioning off items, including a champions green jacket. Augusta National Inc. filed a federal lawsuit against the Florida-based auction company seeking to stop it from selling a champions green jacket and two member green jackets, along with other items.",https://apnews.com/article/theft-worker-golf-augusta-arnold-palmer-5af8c3ccc3371bdd9ef1946d441f0d1c,sports

Minnesota cant finish off New York and now must find way to win two straight games for 5th title,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Minnesota Lynx got the start they wanted. They just couldnt finish off the New York Liberty. The Lynx blew a 15-point lead and will need two straight victories to win a record fifth WNBA championship after losing 80-77 to the Liberty on a last-second shot by Sabrina Ionescu Wednesday night in Game 3 of the Finals.  Game 4 is Friday night. Theres so many ups and downs and swings all around, and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to sort of weather those swings, and here we are, Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve said. Were disappointed. Were home. We played well and just couldnt come up with the win. Minnesota had only led New York for about three minutes in the first two games of the best-of-five series. The Lynx were able to come home with a split though and were playing at home in front of a franchise-record crowd of 19,521 that included former point guard Lindsay Whalen, who was part of the teams four championships. That energized the team to get off to a strong start, as Minnesota led by 10 after one quarter. The Lynx were able to build a 15-point lead in the first half before seeing that evaporate as Breanna Stewart rallied New York. Minnesota hit 10 of its 20 shots in the opening quarter but was 19 for 55 the rest of the way. Definitely, we got the shots that we wanted. We got good shots, and we just didnt convert and they did, said Courtney Williams. Again, great players make great plays. Thats kind of how the game played out. 
        
     Minnesota now will have to find a way to win the final two games. Four teams have done that in the Finals after trailing 2-1. The Lynx were the last to do it in 2017, which also was the franchises last title and trip to the championship round. Phoenix was the only one of the four to lose Game 2 and 3 and still win a championship. I feel like they were making plays at the end of shot clocks and like Coach said, we were getting really good looks, said Napheesa Collier, who led Minnesota with 22 points. We just werent executing on the offensive end. Its just hard when you get that and then obviously they are a great offensive team. Minnesota had to play the last few minutes without forward Alanna Smith, who was having issues with her back. Reeve didnt have any update after the game on Smiths status. She finished with two points and six rebounds in just under 20 minutes. She didnt play the final 6:06 of the game. Give credit to Lan. She did what she could do, Reeve said. We were plus-20 when she was on the floor. So it obviously hurt. Our starting five is a really good starting five, and you know, not having Lan, foul trouble, and then just not feeling like she could go put us in a bit of a bind. ___ AP freelance writer Tyler Mason contributed to this story. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/lynx-wnba-finals-d326362c6b6c1589f15b08a35a6434c9,sports
Sun coach Stephanie White is focused on family emergency and not coaching future,"Connecticut coach Stephanie White is more focused on a family emergency that her professional future right now. My priority is my family right now, White said on a zoom Thursday while holding back tears. Honestly, just being here for my family getting through this, thats my priority. White didnt disclose what the emergency was. Her name has surfaced as a potential candidate for some of the WNBA coaching openings after she led the Sun to the WNBA semifinals before losing to the Minnesota Lynx in five games. Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles all have head coach openings. Im not having conversations right now about anything outside of my family, White said. Im solely focused on my family and getting through this tough time. White has been the head coach of the Sun for the last two seasons and she also was in charge of the Indiana Fever in 2015 and 2016 before going to coach at Vanderbilt. The Sun, who have made it to the semifinals in each of the past six seasons, are a team that could be in flux. Stars Brionna Jones, Alyssa Thomas and DeWanna Bonner are all unrestricted free agents. DiJonai Carrington, who won the leagues Most Improved Player, is a restricted free agent. It was a lot of fun on and off (the court) with this group for me, Thomas said. Its just, its about winning. I dont really care about the moments or the accolades or anything like that. Its just about trying to get it done, and unfortunately, again, we did not get it done. The Sun started the season with a franchise-best 13 wins in their first 14 games before finishing as the No. 3 seed. They swept Caitlin Clark and Indiana in the first round before losing to the Lynx. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/sun-stephanie-white-8aa4716798a0a64c1b523ff606adff55,sports
"Liberty hope their last-second shot provides a new outcome, a WNBA title, rather than 1999s letdown","MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Its been 25 years since the New York Liberty had a chance to close out a WNBA championship. Just like in 1999, a last-second shot gave them the opportunity to play for a title. This time around, the Liberty are hoping for a different outcome. Twenty-five years after Teresa Weatherspoon hit  The Shot  to even up the Finals series against Houston, Sabrina Ionescu nailed a 28-footer with a second left Wednesday night to give New York a 2-1 lead in its best-of-five series with the Lynx. The Libertys first chance to close out the series is Friday night in Game 4. In 1999, the Comets and Liberty played the next day and the Liberty lost that game for the championship. I havent thought about that, in the sense of they didnt go out and achieve what it is that they wanted to do, Ionescu said. I think for us, its going to be changing that scripted narrative a little bit. Ionescus shot gave New York its own spot in history as its the first time that the franchise has ever led a Finals series in its six appearances in the championship round. It would mean everything. Stephen A. (Smith) was on today just talking (about) how it brings him chills to think about a championship in New York, and its just so many people who have New York running deep in their veins, wanting a championship, Ionescu said. And knowing that were doing that to other peoples lives through the way we play and bring them happiness and joy, thats what sport is about. Minnesota will try and force a decisive Game 5 in New York on Sunday. The Lynx are looking for their own history as two straight wins would give the franchise five championships, breaking a tie for the most in league history with Houston and Seattle. 
        
     Four teams have been able to rally from 2-1 deficits to win a championship  the last being Minnesota in 2017. Assistant coach Rebekkah Brunson was on that squad and talked to the team after the loss Wednesday night. Theres a lot of experience that we try to impart on them, Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve said. I did remind them how special they are and that weve answered every challenging situation whether its a run in the game or any part of the season. Friday isnt going to be any different. Were going to answer the call for sure. The Lynx might have to do it without forward Alanna Smith, who was a key addition to the squad this season. She injured her back in Game 3 and played a gutty 20 minutes. She had to sit out the final six minutes when New York got the victory. Smith said that she was going to play. Ive been taking some anti-inflammatories, some painkillers, Smith said. Despite the loss, the Lynx are still a confident bunch. They shot 19 for 55 after the first quarter on Wednesday night, missing some really good looks in the final few minutes of the game. For sure we are confident still, Courtney Williams said. Watching the film, we know that those are shots we definitely can make. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/liberty-lynx-wnba-finals-00413fc14464908819e3cec499dc63c0,sports
Ionescus 3-pointer is latest iconic last-second shot in WNBA Finals history,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Sabrina Ionescus thrilling shot for the New York Liberty with a second left in Game 3 on Wednesday night will go down as one of the best in WNBA Finals history. It came 25 years after one of the most iconic shots in basketball history when Teresa Weatherspoon hit a halfcourt heave at the buzzer to even the Libertys playoff series with Houston. The Minnesota Lynx also have their own storied past with Finals buzzer-beaters, finishing on both the winning and losing side because of them. Heres a look at five of the most iconic WNBA Finals shots in chronological order: New York trailed 67-65 with 2.4 seconds left when Weatherspoon took the inbounds pass and dribbled to halfcourt and heaved the ball up, seeing it bank in at the buzzer to even the best-of-three series with Houston. The Liberty lost less than 24 hours later to the Comets.  Maya Moore hadnt hit a buzzer-beating shot since her AAU days. With the game tied at 77, the Lynx star forward caught the ball near the top of the key with 1.7 seconds left. She faked a shot, took one dribble to her right and launched the winning 3. Minnesota took a 2-1 lead in the series and ended up winning it in five games. Alana Beard might be the most surprising player on the list. The defensive star helped the Sparks take a 1-0 lead in the series when she broke a 76-all tie by hitting a jumper in the corner in front of her teams bench as the clock expired. This was the first year of the leagues playoff format that didnt go by conferences. The WNBA just took the top eight teams to the playoffs. 
        
     While Beard got the Sparks the first win, Nneka Ogwumike earned Los Angeles the championship with her Game 5 winner. The back-and-forth contest saw 11 ties and 23 lead changes with the final one coming with 3.1 seconds left. Ogwumike grabbed an offensive rebound and had her first attempt blocked. She went up against and her fadeaway gave the Sparks a 77-76 lead they wouldnt relinquish. The Liberty rallied from a 15-point deficit and the game was tied at 77 when Ionescu got the ball near halfcourt. She dribbled the clock down before going to her left and pulling up in front of the logo and swishing the 28-footer with a second left. Minnesota couldnt get a shot off and New York took a 2-1 lead in the series. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-finals-historic-shots-3232525f6b247048df9ef8008c917c18,sports
Brock Purdy reports to 49ers and George Kittle stays away from offseason program,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP)  Brock Purdy reported to the start of the offseason program for the San Francisco 49ers on Tuesday, while star tight end George Kittle stayed away from the start of the voluntary program. Purdy and Kittle are both entering the final years of their contracts and are seeking extensions, leading to speculation about whether they would report for the offseason program. The Niners have had offseason contract disputes last deep into the summer the past three seasons. Deebo Samuel missed the first few training camp practices in 2022 before signing an extension, while Nick Bosa didnt get his deal done in 2023 until just days before the season opener and Brandon Aiyuk missed all of training camp practice last summer waiting for a new deal. Purdy said at the end of the season in January that he hoped to have a new deal done before the start of the offseason program. That hasnt happened yet but he chose not to hold out as he tries to help the Niners rebound from a 6-11 season. Thats Brock, general manager John Lynch said. Hes a pro. Brocks very clear-minded and not going to let other people influence what he should be doing. ... Were looking forward to having him as our quarterback for a long time. Purdy has made less than $1 million a year for his first three seasons and is set to get a small raise in 2025 to about $5.2 million under the leagues proven performance escalator for making the Pro Bowl last season. 
        
     But Purdys play has far exceeded that salary and he is eligible this offseason to negotiate an extension for the first time and could be in line for a contract that will pay him in excess of $50 million a year. The two sides have been talking for much of the offseason and Lynch remains optimistic a deal will get done. I think theres been some talks that have this thing going in a good direction and Ill leave it at that, he said. After finishing fourth in MVP voting in his first full season as a starter in 2023, Purdy was far less productive last season as injuries to several key playmakers had a major impact on the Niners offense. Purdys passer rating dropped nearly 17 points to 96.1, he had only 20 TD passes and 12 interceptions on the season, and also came up short in several late-game scenarios when the 49ers had a chance for a comeback win. But the belief in Purdy from the organization remains as strong as it has been from owner Jed York, to Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan. The 31-year-old Kittle is entering the final year of a five-year, $75 million extension that he signed in 2020. He is owed $14.4 million in base salary for this season. The tight end market got re-set this offseason when Arizona signed Trey McBride to a $76 million, four-year extension for the highest annual value for any tight end. Kittle was a second-team All-Pro last season when he had 78 catches for 1,106 yards and eight TDs. Since being drafted in the fifth round in 2017, Kittle has been a first or second-team All-Pro five times in eight seasons and has 538 catches for 7,380 yards and 45 TDs. Lynch said he didnt know if Kittle would show up later in the offseason program. Well see on that, he said. These things are voluntary right now. Weve had good communication and good talks and well see how that goes. Lynch said that star left tackle Trent Williams was in attendance after missing the end of last season with an ankle injury and is feeling healthy.  ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/49ers-brock-purdy-george-kittle-ebad1b32bd63e623f9cc9aea406fb18b,sports
Steelers say their NFL draft plans dont rely on the unknown playing status of Aaron Rodgers,"The Pittsburgh Steelers are still waiting for Aaron Rodgers to decide whether he wants to play in 2025. Yet coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Omar Khan stressed Tuesday that Rodgers uncertain status will not impact how they approach this weeks NFL draft. The Steelers have the 21st overall pick in Thursday nights first round and have needs across the roster, most notably along the defensive line and at quarterback, where Mason Rudolph and Skyler Thompson are the only two players under contract. Khan said the plan is to have that number double by the time the team reports to training camp in late July, and that all options are on the table on how the club might add whoever those two quarterbacks end up being to the roster. The 41-year-old Rodgers toured Pittsburghs facility in March and said last week that he remains in contact with the Steelers, but added that current circumstances in his personal life have taken precedence over whatever might be left of his career. The group of quarterbacks in the draft isnt particularly deep, though Khan said multiple times its a good group. The Steelers brought in four prospects for a pre-draft visit, including potential first-rounders Jaxson Dart and Shedeur Sanders.  Tomlin called his time with Sanders productive and said that the focus was on football, not Sanders father, Colorado coach and Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. 
        
     Theres a toughness there (in Shedeur) that doesnt get talked about enough, Tomlin said. Theres a competitive spirit there that doesnt get talked about enough. I know he is very talented and has made a lot of plays for his university and his team, but the intangible qualities displayed on tape were impressive to me. The Steelers dont have a ton of draft capital, having sent a second-round pick to Seattle for wide receiver DK Metcalf in March. While theres a chance they could trade into the second round, Khan doesnt seem interested in including talented but immature wide receiver George Pickens in whatever package it might take to make it happen. Pickens is entering the final year of his rookie contract. Were glad we have George and DK here, Khan said. I think theyre going to be exciting for everyone to watch. Pittsburgh used more than half of its 30 pre-draft visits on running backs or defensive linemen. The Steelers let Najee Harris leave in free agency, leaving Jaylen Warren as the most experienced back on the roster. Tomlin expressed confidence that Warren is ready to be a feature back, but it is highly likely that Pittsburgh will use at least one of its six selections on another ball carrier to throw into the mix. There are a ton of options along an exceptionally deep class of defensive linemen. The Steelers are looking for reinforcements up front to complement 35-year-old four-time All-Pro Cam Heyward. Pittsburgh was pushed around by opponents during a five-game skid to end the season. No matter how the draft shakes out, the Rodgers question doesnt appear to be going anywhere until the four-time MVP makes up his mind for good. The Steelers dont seem to be in any rush to hear from him. Asked if he was OK with the idea of Rodgers not participating in organized team activities or minicamp next month should Rodgers remain uncommitted at that point, Tomlin shrugged. I hadnt pondered those things to be quite honest with you, the NFLs longest-tenured head coach said. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/aaron-rodgers-pittsburgh-steelers-nfl-draft-9613bdb353f1e55f70aa6cd5ff778e6b,sports
"From 8-man football to competitive CrossFit, some prospects took a different road to the NFL draft","INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Former Virginia safety Jonas Sanker took a somewhat unconventional path to this weeks NFL draft. He initially drew the interest of college scouts while playing high school basketball in Charlottesville, Virginia, but then emerged as a star in eight-man football. Sankers rapid ascension from fast-break-style prep games to college captain to the cusp of a pro career sounds more like Hollywood, but Sanker has made it this far with hard work. I tried to make the most of it and then the transition to college is a little bit of a learning curve, he said, describing the move from his high schools narrower field to a regulation-sized college field. But I was willing to learn. Sanker fine-tuned his skills in a game that features three fewer players on offense and defense, everyone is an eligible receiver and the potential for high-scoring games is a constant. This version is attractive to schools that lack enough bodies to be competitive in the traditional 11-man style of football. And with concussion concerns growing and the number of players declining, more schools seem to be opting for a game that typically produces fewer injuries because there are fewer interior line collisions. It also appears to be opening another door to the NFL. If Sanker makes a roster this fall, he will join a short list of eight-man alums who have played in the NFL since 2017 that includes Bills offensive tackle Spencer Brown, recently retired Cowboys linebacker Leighton Vander Esch, and former running back Tarik Cohen. 
        
     Finding players who havent taken the traditional journeys is hardly a new phenomenon in a world that rewards creativity, athleticism and innovation. Former receiver Bullet Bob Hayes joined the Dallas Cowboys after winning the 100-meter dash at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Hes still the only player to win an Olympic gold medal and a Super Bowl ring.  Former world-record hurdler Renaldo Nehemiah played three seasons with San Francisco in the 1980s and former NFL career rushing champ Jim Brown was a multisport star at Syracuse before joining the Cleveland Browns. Australian kickers and punters have become the norm in college football and are dotting the NFL landscape now, too. And position players are now being found more routinely in Europe and Africa. This years draft class follows the trend. Tight end Elijah Arroyo of Miami faced a different kind of adjustment after playing six seasons of football in Mexico, where he learned how to play the game with a Spanish playbook. When his family moved back to Texas while he was in high school, Arroyo found himself competing against bigger, stronger, more polished opponents while learning the playbooks in English. I feel like the sport of football in Mexico grew a lot throughout my years there, he said. I learned the game in Spanish first, which was pretty cool, and then I came back over and I realized how similar things were. Its still the same sport, its still football. This years most unique story may come from defensive end Ahmed Hassanein, who went from football novice at age 16 to two-time all-conference selection at Boise State. He moved to Egypt with his father at age 6 and used sports as an outlet to help guide him through his parents separation. Hassanein tried ping pong, jujutsu and basketball before thriving at CrossFit, which focuses on high-intensity, functional movements that constantly vary. It was a perfect introduction for him to the skills hed need later when, after a decade, his brother, a semi-pro player in Austria, broke the silence and convinced Hassanein to give American football a shot. Now the guy who was Egypts No. 1 CrossFit athlete, ranked No. 10 in Africa, is just a few days from finding out where hell land in the NFL. I didnt know what I was doing at the beginning, Hassanein said. One day I didnt even know what the NFL was. One day I was watching Aaron Donald play and I was like, what high school does he go to. My brother was like, Bro, thats the NFL. I was like, The NFL? Whats that? He certainly knows now. And from Egypt to North America, football fans are likely to get to know their stories, too. Its a little overwhelming at first, but, you know, just meeting so many people and just, really taking everything in, its cool to just be here, Sanker said. So Im grateful for the opportunity and looking to make the the most of it. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/nfl-draft-7e29f6a6528a7c59e368238d732c145d,sports
"Bears GM Ryan Poles hopes to sign Joe Thuney to extension after deals with Gordon, Edwards","LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP)  Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles was glad to sign cornerback Kyler Gordon and linebacker T.J. Edwards to contract extensions.  One more player he would like to get a deal done with is guard Joe Thuney. Yeah, thats definitely, I would say, one of the priorities moving forward, Poles said on Tuesday. The Bears acquired the 32-year-old Thuney from Kansas City in a trade in March, one of several moves they made to overhaul a shaky offensive line and give Caleb Williams the protection he needs. The quarterback was sacked a franchise-record and league-leading 68 times after being drafted with the No. 1 overall pick last year. The Bears hope that number goes down in a big way after reinforcing the line and hiring coach Ben Johnson. Topping the list is Thuney. A nine-year veteran and an All-Pro the past two years, he played on two Super Bowl champions in New England and two more in Kansas City. Its not hard to see why Poles would want to extend him. But its not clear if Thuney feels the same way or would rather test free agency with his contract set to expire after the upcoming season. Though he said he was grateful to be here and pumped to play in Chicago at a news conference following the trade, he sidestepped questions about a potential extension. I kind of let my agent handle all that. I just try and focus on the game and football, just getting ready for the season, he said at the time. 
        
     Besides landing Thuney, the Bears acquired guard Jonah Jackson from the Los Angeles Rams. They signed center Drew Dalman, too, and might add another blocker with the No. 10 pick in the draft on Thursday. Poles hasnt ignored the defense, either, this offseason. The Bears added two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Grady Jarrett and edge rusher Dayo Odeyingbo. They also retained two key players by extending Gordon through 2028 and Edwards through 2027. The 25-year-old Gordon was the first player drafted by Poles when he was taken in the second round out of Washington in 2022. He has five interceptions and 17 passes defended in three seasons.  Edwards, 28, signed with Chicago in 2023 and has had 284 total tackles, 14 quarterback hits and 6 1/2 sacks in that span. He set career highs with four sacks and 12 tackles for loss last season while starting all 17 games for the third year in a row. Edwards spent his first four seasons in Philadelphia after going undrafted out of Wisconsin. When you see a guy like that go from being undrafted and working himself into his first contract, elevating his game again and getting a second contract, I think thats special and I think that motivates all the other guys that come in the door, Poles said. And again, no one is more deserving than he is. Kyler as well. Really happy to get that done. Impact player for us. Ability to make plays all over the field in different phases. Hes a guy that I believe is ascending and will continue to grow when he gets into this new defense, I think his game can go to the next level as well. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/ryan-poles-chicago-bears-e79933f5acf6161c21fe6b64cff46592,sports
Denis Bouanga scores twice in second half to rally LAFC to 2-2 draw with St. Louis City,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  Denis Bouanga scored two goals in the second half, including the equalizer in stoppage time to rally LAFC to a 2-2 draw on Sunday after St. Louis City had taken the lead in the 89th minute on a shorthanded goal by Joakim Nilsson. Nilssons first goal of the season and the second of the defenders career put St. Louis City (2-4-4) in position to beat LAFC (4-4-2) for the first time in five tries. But Bouanga, a 20-goal scorer in each of the past two seasons, found the net unassisted in the fifth minute of extra time to help LAFC improve to 3-0-2 against St. Louis City. It was his fourth netter this season. Bouanga tied it a 1-1 in the 70th minute but had Ben Lundt turn away his penalty kick five minutes later with a chance for the lead. Cengiz nder notched his first assist in his seventh appearance. Cedric Teuchert ended a scoreless match when he used assists from defenders Jannes Horn and Timo Baumgartl seven minutes into the second half to score his second goal. It was the first assist for Baumgartl in his first season in the league and the first for Horn after collecting two last year. Teuchert has seven goals in 19 career appearances with the club. St. Louis City had to play a man down from the 83rd minute on after Alfredo Morales was tagged with two yellow cards in the second half. Hugo Lloris totaled four saves in goal for LAFC. Lundt stopped seven shots for St. Louis City. Lundt had four saves and Lloris one in the scoreless first half. St. Louis City travels to play the Seattle Sounders on Saturday. LAFC will host the Houston Dynamo on Saturday. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/st-louis-city-lafc-score-035dfb18b7c8db614269d7599d186f46,sports
Bohm hits a sacrifice fly in the 10th as the Phillies beat the Cubs 3-1,"CHICAGO (AP)  Alec Bohm hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Chicago Cubs 3-1 on Sunday night. Trea Turner had three hits and two RBIs for Philadelphia, which took two of three in the weekend series. Aaron Nola pitched seven innings of three-hit ball after dropping his first five starts this season. The patient Phillies loaded the bases in the 10th on walks by J.T. Realmuto and Max Kepler against Julian Merryweather (0-1). Bohm then drove in Nick Castellanos with a flyball to the warning track in right. A two-out walk by Bryson Stott loaded the bases again before Kepler scored when the speedy Turner singled on a grounder to third. Jos Alvarado (3-0) got three outs for the win, and Jordan Romano pitched the 10th for his second save.  The Cubs wasted a sharp performance by Jameson Taillon, who pitched seven innings of five-hit ball. The right-hander has a 2.08 ERA over his last three starts  all no-decisions. Chicago closer Ryan Pressly worked the ninth in his first appearance since he had his right knee drained on Tuesday night. With two down and a runner on first, Castellanos flied out to the wall in left.  The Cubs jumped in front in the second. Nico Hoerner blooped a two-out double into shallow right-center and scored on Pete Crow-Armstrongs double off the wall in right-center. The Phillies got their first run in the third. Stott tripled and scored on Turners single to left. 
        
     The Cubs went down in order in the 10th. Michael Busch struck out swinging, Dansby Swanson flied out and Hoerner bounced back to Romano.

"Timbers extend unbeaten streak to 7 games, beat winless Galaxy 4-2","CARSON, Calif. (AP)  David Da Costa, Santiago Moreno and Kevin Kelsy each scored a goal Sunday to help the Portland Timbers beat the LA Galaxy 4-2 and extend the defending MLS Cup champions season-opening winless streak to 10 games.  Portland (5-2-3) is unbeaten in seven consecutive games, beginning with a 1-1 tie with the Galaxy on March 16.  The Galaxy (0-7-3), off to the worst start of any champion in MLS history, has a minus-12 goal differential, the worst in the league.  Antony Alves Santos  known simply as Antony  had three assists for the Timbers.  Antony chased down a loose ball along the left side of the goal line, flicked a pass over the head of defender Miki Yamane to himself and then side-footed a pass to Da Costa, who slammed home a volley to open the scoring in the 38th minute.  On the counterattack, Antony played a centering pass to Moreno for the finish from near the right corner of the 6-yard box to make it 2-0 in the 53rd and Kelsy bounced a first-touch shot off the crossbar to give the Timbers a 3-0 lead in the 63rd minute.  Christian Ramirez got the Galaxy on the board in the 67th with a sliding one-touch finish off a cross played in by Joseph Paintsil and then fed Marco Reus, who slipped behind the defense and beat goalkeeper James Pantemis to make it 3-2 in the 69th minute. Jonathan Rodriguez, who subbed on for Antony in the 71st, converted from the penalty spot in the 75th minute to cap the scoring.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/timbers-galaxy-score-2312dc6545feeec4d3ddf23182e8f6be,sports

Taijul takes 5 wickets for Bangladesh to trigger Zimbabwe collapse on first day of second test,"CHATTOGRAM, Bangladesh (AP)  Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam claimed 5-60 to put Bangladesh in control against Zimbabwe on the first day of the second test Monday.  Sean Williams and Nick Welch batted resolutely as Zimbabwe looked to be on top of Bangladesh for much of the day until Taijul triggered a sensational collapse that saw the visitors lose seven wickets for 55 runs. Taijul eventually finished with his 16th five-for in test cricket as Zimbabwe reached 227-9 at stumps.  Sean Williams made a team-high 67 while Welch hit 54 for his second fifty in as many tests. They put on 90 runs for the third wicket to help Zimbabwe dominate the first two sessions. Openers Brian Bennett and Ben Curran were solid against the pacers after their captain Craig Ervine chose to bat first. They put on 41 runs before pacer Tanzim Hasan gave Bangladesh a breakthrough in the 11th over by dismissing Bennett for 21 for his debut wicket. Bennet, who scored half-centuries in both innings of the first test, edged a three-quarter length delivery that carried extra bounce to baffle him. Zimbabwes batters then struggled against spin, with the exception of Welch, who hit both Mehidy Hasan and Taijul Islam for sixes. But Taijuls relentlessness got him a wicket when he turned one past sharply to get the better of Curran for 21. Williams and Welch kept the visitors unscathed in the whole second session, putting pressure on Bangladesh as the hosts aimed to avoid a series whitewash following a three-wicket defeat in the first test. 
        
     Welch raised his second test fifty off 107 balls, punching Taijul past point for a couple of runs. Williams played patiently throughout for his fifth half-century and brought it up by chopping down a short ball of Mehidy for a single from 114 balls. Just after the second session, Welch had to retire after having been cramping since the morning, and his departure triggered a collapse. Offspinner Nayeem Hasan initiated it with a double strike, dismissing captain Ervine (5) and Williams in consecutive overs. Williams 166-ball knock included seven fours and one six. Taijul completed his five-for by dismissing Welch, who returned to bat after the fall of eighth wicket. Welch was able to play just two balls before being out on 54, an innings laced with three fours and two sixes.  Tafadzwa Tsiga was batting on 18 with Blessing Muzurabani on 2 at stumps after surviving five tricky overs. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/cricket-bangladesh-zimbabwe-test-8e67de2587abffd8d8b28733466b49d5,sports

Draisaitl scores in OT as the Oilers beat the Kings 4-3 in Game 4 to tie series,"EDMONTON, Alberta (AP)  Leon Draisaitl scored on a power play at 18:18 of overtime and the Edmonton Oilers beat the Los Angeles Kings 4-3 on Sunday night in Game 4 to tie the first-round playoff series. After assisting on Edmontons first three goals, Draisaitl beat goalie Darcy Kuemper after the puck found him on the right side off a scramble. The Oilers got the power play when defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov tripped Connor McDavid. Edmonton defenseman Evan Bouchard tied it with 29 seconds left and goalie Calvin Pickard off for an extra attacker, beating Kuemper with a straightaway slap shot from near the blue line. Bouchard had his second straight two-goal game, also pulling the Oilers within one at 7:51 of the third with a shot that deflected in off Kings defenseman Drew Doughtys skate. Bouchard had the go-ahead goal Friday night in Edmontons 7-4 home victory. Thats our identity in here. Weve built that years ago. Its a mentality that we have, that were never going to quit, no matter what, Draisaitl said. Weve shown that in the series so far, maybe a little bit too much. Weve got to find a way to play with a lead. It shows a lot of character, and we can be really proud of that. But you dont want to do that every night. Game 5 is Tuesday night in Los Angeles. The Kings havent won a playoff series since beating the New York Rangers in 2014 to win the Stanley Cup. 
        
     I thought we skated a lot better tonight than we did in Game 3 and had plenty of opportunities to put it away. And did not, Kings coach Jim Hiller said. So, here we are. We go home 2-2 instead. They get a power play in overtime, those are tough. Corey Perry also scored for Edmonton, and Pickard stopped 38 shots. Trevor Moore, Warren Foegele and Kevin Fiala scored for the Kings, and Kuemper made 44 saves  17 in overtime. Of course its painful, but thats playoffs though, Kings forward Phillip Danault said. Its 2-2, its back to even. Now we go back home and play hard, put our heart on the line and anything can happen. Fiala made it 3-1 on a breakaway at 7:32 of the second. Moore opened the scoring with 9:25 left in the first. He foiled a hard-around along the right boards, got the puck back from Danault, skated toward the goal and beat Pickard with a wrist shot. Foegele gave Los Angeles a 2-0 lead on determined rush at 1:31 of the second period. Perry got one back for Edmonton on a power play at 4:11, batting the puck out of the air just below the crossbar and swatting it in as it fell. I would like to have a better start, said McDavid, who had two assists. I dont want to have to keep digging ourselves out of two, three, four-goal leads. But it is good that weve shown them that we can. Were a tough group to close out in games. Weve got some good players that make plays coming down the stretch. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/kings-oilers-score-nhl-stanley-cup-playoffs-de72a3aad8c0a93fd47dfa0df2d5998d,sports

Real Madrid loses injured Camavinga for Copa del Rey final against Barcelona,"MADRID (AP)  Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga is expected to miss the Copa del Rey final and rest of the season because of a muscle injury. Camavinga has a complete tear of the tendon in his left abductor muscle, Madrid said on Thursday. He was hurt late in the 1-0 win at Getafe in La Liga on Wednesday. Madrid said his recovery will be assessed. Madrid faces Barcelona in the Copa final on Saturday in Seville. Also hurt with a muscle ailment on Wednesday was defender David Alaba, though the club did not immediately give a medical update on him. It said he practiced alone in the indoor facilities on Thursday. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said after the match on Wednesday that it would be hard to see both players in the Copa final.  Camavinga had to leave in the final minutes of the match against Getafe. He replaced Alaba at halftime. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/eduardo-camavinga-real-madrid-e6ba5d7da3417294007e3049f50a0d4f,sports

Alguacil to step down as Real Sociedad coach at end of season,"SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP)  Real Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil will step down this summer, putting an end to a successful six-and-a-half-year stint, the Spanish club said on Thursday. Alguacil took over the San Sebastian-based club in December 2018 and helped it consistently finish in the upper part of La Liga. Among active coaches in the league, only Atletico Madrids Diego Simeone has been in charge of a club longer that Alguacil. Under his leadership, Sociedad won the 2020 Copa del Rey title against fierce rival Athletic Bilbao in a final that was delayed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. It also reached the Champions League round of 16 last season, following three straight Europa League appearances. Alguacil, a former Sociedad defender, took his decision with his team in ninth place in the league standings.

NBA great Jason Kidd joins ownership group of Premier League soccer club Everton,"NBA great Jason Kidd has entered the soccer world by joining the ownership group of English Premier League club Everton. The Hall of Fame point guard and current Dallas Mavericks coach said he was honored to join Roundhouse Capital Holdings, which is part of the Friedkin Group that took control of Everton last year. The group also owns Italian team Roma. In a statement released Thursday by Everton, executive chairman Marc Watts said Kidds knowledge and winning mentality will be an incredible resource for a nine-time English champion which is without a major trophy since 1995 and has been battling relegation in recent years. Kidd is a respected leader and household name for many sports fans, Watts said, and will bring a deeper understanding of high performance as we collectively strive to build a brighter future for this storied club. Kidd won an NBA title as a player with the Mavericks in 2011 and was a two-time Olympic gold-medal winner with the U.S. national team, in 2000 and 2008. He took the Mavs to the NBA Finals as coach last year and has had previous spells in charge of the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks. Everton recently secured its status in the Premier League for another year and is moving to a new state-of-the-art stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock for the start of next season. Im honored to be joining Evertons ownership at such an important moment, Kidd said in Evertons statement. With a new stadium on the horizon and a bright future ahead, its a great moment to come on board. 
        
     Everton has been an ever-present in Englands top soccer league since 1954. The 52-year-old Kidd becomes the latest high-profile figure from American sports to get involved in English soccer. In 2023, NFL great Tom Brady became a minority owner of Birmingham and chairman of its advisory board. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James bought a small stake in Liverpool in 2011 and PGA Tour golfers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas are investors in 49ers Enterprises, which owns Leeds. On Wednesday, Everton announced that Christopher Sarofim, chairman of global investment firm Fayez Sarofim & Co, had joined the ownership group in a move that will further strengthen the clubs financial base. Everton said Sarofim will be a board observer at the club. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/jason-kidd-everton-dallas-mavericks-a7a5e0c5812d92e73cf46d5e62414a98,sports

Owner/driver Jimmie Johnson notches his best Daytona 500 finish since winning the race in 2013,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Jimmie Johnson was simultaneously relieved and overwhelmed as he climbed out of his No. 84 Toyota at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday night. It was a different set of emotions for the seven-time NASCAR champion and the two-time Daytona 500 winner. Johnson drove a masterful final lap in the Daytona 500, finishing third behind William Byron and Tyler Reddick and nearly getting retired NBA great Shaquille ONeal to victory lane  at least virtually. It was Johnsons best finish in The Great American Race since winning his second one in 2013 and tied his best Cup Series finish since his last full season in 2020.  Although he came up short in the rain-delayed event that featured a visit from President Donald Trump, the overall result may have been as special as those Daytona 500 wins because it came in his first year as majority owner at Legacy Motor Club and included a strong showing from his drivers, John Hunter Nemechek and Erik Jones. Nemechek came home fifth in the No. 42 Toyota, giving Legacy two of the top five spots. Jones was 12th. I have emotions that I didnt expect to have, Johnson said afterward. Ive never been in this position as an owner. Its really a different set of emotions. The pride that I have in this resolve and the pride I have in this company, knowing what were trying to achieve and the journey were on, I am so satisfied, so happy right now. Johnson tightened his commitment at Legacy and became the majority owner under an offseason restructuring in which a private equity firm bought into the Cup Series team. Johnson is Legacys ultimate boss and got help from Shaq on the No. 84 Toyota.  
        
     After working with rock bands Creed and Guns N Roses each of the last two seasons, Johnson turned to a paint scheme for the 500 that was inspired by the current NBA analyst. I love racing, Johnson said. A long time ago, my give-a-(hoot) meter broke, and Im not here for me. I know other people have different opinions. But Im not here for me. Johnson, a member of the 2024 class, skipped NASCARs Hall of Fame ceremony last week to shoot hoops and promote his car and the Daytona 500 at a carnival-themed Super Bowl party thrown by ONeal. Johnson and ONeal ripped the cover off the car with cameras on them  good luck getting  Entertainment Tonight  to Daytona  and engaged in a free-throw shooting contest. What Johnson did on the track Sunday proved he still has some fast laps left. Absolutely, he quipped. The situation Im in, being a recent team owner and driving my own equipment, it was just something I didnt have on my bingo card growing up and I never dreamed of. Those emotions are just new, and I guess thats why Im still do this  to experience new things. Johnson was 15th when he took the white flag for the final lap but passed a dozen cars  some of them wrecking  over the final 2 1/2 miles around the famed speedway. Jimmie blew my doors off, Nemechek said. I dont think he ever lifted. Johnson was scheduled to have Shaq in his pits at Daytona, but ONeal ended up having All-Star game commitments across the country. Nonetheless, Shaqs supersized firesuit was on hand for the 500 and, had Johnson won the season opener, the team owner surely would have gotten Shaq to victory lane through a video call. I hope Shaq is watching, Johnson said. Thank you, buddy. We got your car in the top three. Its been an interesting couple of years, and to have our cars come out and be this strong  this Toyota was rocket-ship fast  Im just smiling inside now. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/daytona-500-jimmie-johnson-legacy-motor-club-a44de73add4d2470e139f7a78ad4bd48,sports
Hamlin expected a late caution would give him a 4th Daytona 500 win. NASCAR never threw the yellow,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Denny Hamlin surged into the lead on the final lap of the Daytona 500 and thought he had a fourth victory in The Great American Race within his reach Sunday night.  Especially when Riley Herbst, who drives for the Hamlin and Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing, went spinning through the infield grass. NASCAR was for sure going to throw a caution, Hamlin thought, especially after the Xfinity Series race a day earlier ended under yellow.  But when Herbst was able to save his Toyota, NASCAR didnt need to throw the caution and Hamlin wound up collected in the inevitable crash that comes from drivers making desperate moves. He was three-wide in the middle when Cole Custer wiggled into Hamlins car to trigger a race-deciding crash.  William Byron slipped through the carnage to win the Daytona 500 for the second consecutive year and Hamlin wound up 24th.  I thought the race was going to be over when (the Herbst) wreck happened, and then when I realized theyre not going to throw this caution ... all I focused on was, Let me get a run and win this race. Hamlin was understanding of Custers aggressive move to the outside to make it three-wide as Custer was also going for the win in that moment. Had the crash not happened, the winner would have been Hamlin, Custer or Austin Cindric. Custer is back in the Cup Series this season after a demotion at Stewart-Haas Racing to the Xfinity Series the last two years. He won the Xfinity championship in 2023 and finished second in 2024, and when SHR shuttered at the end of last year, team owner Gene Haas decided to field a single car in the Cup Series this year and move Custer back to the big league.  
        
     I dont fault Cole. I mean, hes back in the Cup Series, hes got a good opportunity to go out there and lock himself in the playoffs, Hamlin said. Its probably pretty big, all around, for the 41 team, so hes doing everything he can to make a move that he thinks is the race-winning move. Hamlin said he told Custer after the race that he made his move too soon, that he should have waited until the cars were exiting the final turn to try to steal the win.  Hamlin drives a Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing but owns 23XI alongside Jordan; 23XI and Front Row Motorsports are both suing NASCAR over antitrust allegations that the France family runs stock-car racing as a monopoly.  He never inferred that NASCAR didnt throw the caution to force Hamlin to earn the victory, and instead noted that NASCAR was likely sensitive to criticism it has received the last two days for ending the Xfinity Series race under caution and disqualifying Parker Kligerman for failing inspection after winning the Truck Series race.  I think they react. They feel like if they get trashed, socially, on a call, they will over-go on the next one, Hamlin said. Either way, we werent going to win, so I dont care.   ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-daytona-500-hamlin-custer-f6ac41c2df7d48c1cfbe5a464dc39606,sports
Ryan Preece says something needs to be done after enduring another flip at Daytona,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Ryan Preece called on NASCAR to do more to prevent cars from becoming airborne during superspeedway races. Preece took another terrifying tumble at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday, this time avoiding a trip to a hospital but nonetheless bringing safety to the forefront at the Cup Series most-storied track. As a father, as a racer, we keep beating on a door hoping for a different result and we know where theres a problem: at superspeedways, Preece said. I dont want to be the example. When it finally does get somebody, I dont want it to be me. I got a 2-year-old daughter, just like a lot of us; weve got families. Something needs to be done because cars lifting off the ground like that. Preece was involved in a more harrowing crash in the summer race at Daytona in 2023. His car flipped numerous times, and he was transported to a hospital and kept overnight. He showed up the week with two black eyes from the wreck. NASCAR and Daytona responded by replacing sections of infield grass with pavement.  He said the one in the closing laps of the Daytona 500 on Sunday was worse. He finished 32nd in the No. 60 Ford for Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing. Its his first year with the team. Everything about that: airborne, heading toward the fence, its not a good place to be in, honestly, he said. With a hit like that  a head-on impact  I dont really think it should have gone airborne. Im just not very happy. Im safe, just frustrated. 
        
     Three-time Daytona 500 winner Jeff Gordon, now vice chairman of Hendrick Motorsports and the race-winning team, said wrecking at superspeedways have always been on the drivers minds. Its always been that balance between entertainment and luck of the draw or whatever you want to call it, Gordon said. Theres a safety aspect of it, too, because the cars continue to be bumper cars at 200 miles-per-hour, then youre going to have a lot of wrecks. The cars have gotten much safer, as well. For (Preece), what is that, two years in a row or was it two years ago that he had that other incident? Of course hes going to be vocal about that. You never want to get airborne in a car once let alone what hes been through.  ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/ryan-preece-daytona-500-crash-dfc8d5b6e076a8c72e1e5483d2a0962e,sports
NASCAR Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon ready to partner with Tom Cruise on Days of Thunder sequel,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Help him, Tom Cruise! NASCAR Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon wants a Days of Thunder sequel and said at Daytona International Speedway that hes been in touch with the Hollywood actor about making the project come to life. Ive absolutely talked to Tom about it because I want him to do the project, Gordon said. We want to be a part of it if it were to happen. The Hollywood Reporter reported in November that Cruise had talked to Paramount about a follow-up to his 1990 NASCAR racing film. The original was a critically panned summer blockbuster that was largely lampooned throughout the NASCAR industry for its exaggeration and overindulgence. Over the decades, the film has since become a cult favorite in NASCAR circles and is still quoted by race fans to this day. Rubbin, son, is racin, lives on, the immortal line from crew chief Harry Hogge, played by Robert Duvall. Riding high from his Top Gun fame, Cruise had an idea for a movie based on fast cars and the characters who raced them. And so began the making of Days of Thunder. Gordon could inspired have Cruises Cole Trickle back in the day, though the character was loosely based on the late Tim Richmond. Gordon, now vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports, won the Daytona 500 on Sunday with team owner Rick Hendrick and driver William Byron. Gordon and Cruise have remained friendly  Cruise showed up at a 2015 NASCAR banquet to honor the retiring Gordon  which could boost the prospect of Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports involvement in a sequel. He seems to like to tease it, so I dont know, Gordon said Sunday night. Well see what happens. If that doesnt happen, I feel pretty confident theres a project out there that will get NASCAR back on the big screen, if not just a really cool docuseries or something beyond even what were already seeing right now. 
        
     The movie ultimately introduced NASCAR to a wider audience that had very limited exposure to stock-car racing before that summer. There had been racing movies before  think Thunder Road, Grand Prix, Stroker Ace, or even Smokey and the Bandit  but none that had depicted NASCAR in such a mainstream style. Hard to imagine how you pull that off today because they actually had race cars with cameras in the race, and the cameras were big, Gordon said. Cameras have gotten a lot smaller so maybe you could pull it off, but how do you do it and make it realistic and really authentic? NASCAR has seen more swings and misses than checkered flags when it comes to its portrayal on the big or small screen since Days of Thunder. For every Talladega Nights, there are 10 more bombs such as comedian Kevin James ill-fated Netflixs comedy series,  The Crew. Gordon said he was encouraged that better days are ahead for NASCAR in the entertainment industry. I am seeing just a lot more momentum in projects like coming through NASCAR and coming to Hendrick Motorsports and just more interest, he said. So thats good, right? It talks a lot about where the sport is at, where its heading, the amazing crowd that was here all weekend, not just today, new TV partners. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/nascar-daytona-500-gordon-cruise-6c99684ea9b807f75f2b6667c650cf62,sports
Min Woo Lee and Akshay Bhatia share lead at The Players as Justin Thomas ties course mark with 62,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Min Woo Lee and Akshay Bhatia shared the lead at The Players Championship going into a weekend with strong wind in the forecast and the potential for a wide-open chase. That includes Justin Thomas, the biggest surprise Friday. Thomas opened with a 78 and was tied for 134th when he set the tournament record with 11 birdies. A bogey from the water on the 18th hole forced him to settle for a 10-under 62 to tie The Players record with Tom Hoge. Everything seems to happen in mysterious and weird ways, Thomas said, unclear if he was speaking to his round or the very game of golf. Lee made a sloppy bogey on his final hole at the par-5 ninth. Bhatia got creative with a wedge to make birdie on the ninth. Both had a 66 and were tied for the lead at 11-under 133. Thomas was seven shots behind and not the least bit bothered by the deficit. Im happy I have a tee time tomorrow, Thomas said. I was losing to everyone playing golf at one point. Thomas witnessed the only other 62 at the TPC Sawgrass because he was playing with Hoge that day in 2023. He forgot about that until he saw an image posted on the video board behind the 17th green of him and Hoge hugging. From the right rough on the 18th, the plan was to punch it low under the trees to about 20 yards short of the green. But the thick grass grabbed his club and turned it left, and the ball raced through the fairway into the water. 
        
     Thomas took a penalty drop, hit a lob wedge to 2 feet for bogey and at least shared the mark.  He has had some wild swings in scores on consecutive days, recalling the 67-80 he had at Royal Birkdale in the 2017 British Open. This one is a lot cooler, he said. Now comes the hard part. The TPC Sawgrass can be daunting in any conditions, but the 25 mph gusts expected Saturday  and the possibility of wind and rain Sunday  can make the Stadium Course a real thrill ride. J.J. Spaun had a 68 and was one shot behind. Rory McIlroy was at the top of the leaderboard during his morning round that featured six birdies in 11 holes, only for his momentum to stall. He had a pair of bogeys over the closing stretch, the last one on the par-5 ninth, for a 68 to finish two shots back. I think I hit more fairways in six holes today than I did in 18 yesterday, McIlroy said. Got it in play much better and then from there was able to give myself some opportunities and obviously make some birdies early. Couldnt quite continue that on to the back nine, but it was much better off the tee. Collin Morikawa, the runner-up last week at Bay Hill who chipped in twice among his nine birdies in a round of 65, also was shots behind with Alex Smalley, who birdied two of his last three holes for a 67. I cant say I drove it great and hit the ball amazing, but I really just took advantage of when I did hit good shots, Morikawa said. I putted really nicely. Also I didnt try fighting it too much. I knew it wasnt quite exactly how I was hitting it, and you just make due. Two-time defending champion Scottie Scheffler had to settle for a 70 and was six shots behind, still very much in the mix considering he rallied from five behind on the final day last year. The 36-hole cut fluctuated throughout the afternoon with some wild shifts and plenty of emotion. The cut was 1-under 143. Xander Schauffele made it on the number, extending his cut streak to 59 on the PGA Tour, the longest active streak since Tiger Woods (142) from 1998 to 2005. That required the PGA and British Open champion hammering a hybrid onto the green at the ninth on his final hole and two-putting for birdie and a 71. That sounded like small consolation for Schauffele, who only returned last week from two months of letting a rib injury heal. Not hitting it close enough, to duffing chips, to missing every fairway, to hitting fairways, to missing greens. Its pretty gross, to be completely honest, he said. So if I can eke out this cut, that would be nice. But the game feels pretty bad. Danny Walker also gets a weekend tee time after starting the week wondering if he would play at all. He didnt get into the field until Thursday morning when Jason Day withdrew with an illness. One of 26 newcomers in the field, Walker three-putted the final hole to finish at 1 under and had to wait an hour to see if he would make it. Among those missing the cut were Ludvig Aberg, who won the Genesis Invitational at Torrey Pines last month and is No. 5 in the world. He had five double bogeys over two rounds, three of them Friday. Jordan Spieth had another wild ride, which included hitting one shot left-handed out of the pine straw well left of the fifth fairway. Spieth was on the cut line late in the day when he hit the island green at No. 17 and then drilled a drive down the 18th fairway, leading to birdie and a 71 that put him eight shots back. Divots: Wyndham Clark withdrew after nine holes with a neck injury. ... Six PGA Tour winners this year failed to make the cut, including Hideki Matsuyama.  ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/players-championship-tpc-sawgrass-340e88b7a87aeef7889c93b3c21ae5b4,sports
J.J. Spaun takes the lead at The Players Championship on windy day that wrecked rounds,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  J.J. Spaun only had to look at the video boards around the TPC Sawgrass to appreciate the chaos going around him Saturday in The Players Championship. Will Zalatoris was tied for the lead and then his name was gone after an astonishing stretch of 9-over par on the last five holes. Lucas Glover fell back, and then he was there again, and then sliding. A double bogey-eagle-double bogey stretch will do that. So imagine Spauns relief when his final putt on a wild, windy, round-wrecking day swirled 360 degrees around the cup and dropped for a par. He had a 2-under 70, the best score of the final 10 groups, and a one-shot lead over Bud Cauley. Spaun made his share of mistakes, just not that many and none too egregious. I was hitting really good quality golf shots from tee to green and just giving myself looks and not really being in stressful situations, Spaun said. Keeping the ball in front of me, keeping it in the short grass for the most part. I was just trying to hit it close to pins, but only when we knew we had the right club and the right wind to do so, and if not, then we were just going to hit it to 30 feet and try to make one. I think thats the key to playing in really tough conditions, especially around a course like this. What so many others wouldnt give for that. Cauley, whose body was crushed in a car crash during the Memorial in 2018, took a big step toward a long recovery. He teed off two hours earlier  still facing a bulk of the wind  and finished with three birdies on his last four holes for a 66. 
        
     That put him in the final group with Spaun and Glover, whose crazy finish ended with a 71. Its pretty razor thin around here anyway, Glover said. And then you add in 25, 30 miles an hour with some gusts, it shrinks things even more. I did a good job where I was missing for the majority of the day, and there was a couple holes where you just cant miss. Spaun was at 12-under 204. Glover and Alex Smalley were three back. There was plenty of heartache, not including the five rounds in the 80s, the worst of it an 85 by Emiliano Grillo. The Argentine started the second round just five shots behind and ended 19 shots out of the lead. Zalatoris was briefly tied for the lead when he stepped on the 14th tee. He played the final five holes in 9-over par  a quadruple bogey on the 14th, a double bogey on the 15th, a ball in the water on the 17th for double bogey and a bogey at the last. It added to a 78. He went from tied for the lead to 10 shots behind in the span of about an hour. Rory McIlroy made birdie on the final hole to salvage a 73 and perhaps his chances, leaving him only four shots behind. Most of the dropped shots were from around-the-green mistakes rather than tee-to-green, McIlroy said. I felt like I hit the ball pretty well, controlled my flight. Not out of it by any means The wind is supposed to still be blowing tomorrow, so yeah, it was nice to birdie that just to get one closer to J.J. on the last. Two-time defending champion Scottie Scheffler wasnt so fortunate. He was hanging around and poised to get closer until he went from the pine straw left of the par-5 16th fairway to a bunker, then another bunker under a large tree and wound up with a bogey. He three-putted from long range for bogey on the 17th, tossing his ball into the water. He hit what he thought was a perfect wedge on the 18th only to see it roll off the back of the green. He had a 72. A year ago, Scheffler birdied his last three holes to get within five shots and wound up winning with a 64. This time he played bogeyed two of the last three and was seven behind. Is that too much? Im not really thinking about it too much right now, he said. Im just a bit frustrated with the finish but hoping to come out of the gates a little bit better tomorrow and turn things around. The forecast was for more wind and enough rain that the PGA Tour moved up the tee times to send players off in threesomes from both sides Sunday morning. Akshay Bhatia, who shared the 36-hole lead with Min Woo Lee, put up a good fight after a miserable start, going from a birdie on the opening hole to a bogey-bogey-double bogey stretch that sent him spiraling down the leaderboard. He shot 75 and still wound up with a chance, four shots behind. Lee shot 78. Collin Morikawa had more of a slow bleed with eight bogeys that sent him to 77, leaving him eight shots behind. The group at 7-under 209 included Patrick Cantlay and Danny Walker, who left Friday evening after a three-putt that looked as though it would cost him the cut. But he made it on the number, teed off first before the wind arrived and posted a 66. Walker didnt get into the tournament until Jason Day withdrew Thursday morning. Now hes in the mix with so many others, chasing the $4.5 million prize from a $25 million purse that includes a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/players-championship-tpc-sawgrass-ccc8714724900157dd443cc0b54da45c,sports
Rory McIlroy and J.J. Spaun tie at The Players Championship to set up Monday playoff,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  Rory McIlroy had every reason to think he would be leaving The Players Championship with the gold trophy and a big payoff Sunday. He was three shots ahead of J.J. Spaun after a four-hour rain delay and had a rain-softened course ahead of him. Spaun refused to give in easily. He caught McIlroy with two great shots, held his nerve down one of the most daunting closing stretches and it ended in a draw when it was too dark for a three-hole aggregate playoff. This David-and-Goliath battle wont be decided until Monday morning at the TPC Sawgrass. McIlroy, keeping an eye on Spaun while playing in the group ahead of him, needed two putts from 75 feet on the par-4 18th for a 4-under 68. Then he had to wait until Spaun (72) came within inches of making a 30-foot birdie putt for the win.  Everyone expects him to win, said Spaun, who has one PGA Tour title and has never reached the Tour Championship. I dont think a lot of people expect me to win. I expect myself to win. Thats all I care about. McIlroy made birdie before and after the delay to build his lead to three shots. He played the final six holes in 1 over, and his 4-foot par putt on the 18th nearly slid out of hole.  Im standing here feeling like I should be going home with the trophy today, McIlroy said. But its all right. Ill reset and try to go home with the trophy tomorrow. 
        
     They finished at 12-under 276. They did well to finish in regulation before sunset. The Players has a three-hole aggregate playoff on the most memorable holes on the TPC Sawgrass  the par-5 16th, the island green on the par-3 17th and the 18th hole that requires the boldest of tee shots with water all the way down the right and trees to the right. It will be the first Monday finish at The Players Championship since Cameron Smith won in 2022, and the first playoff since Rickie Fowler won 10 years ago. Youve got to make five good swings. Thats all it is, said McIlroy, a four-time major champion with 38 titles worldwide. So try to get up there, make five good swings tomorrow morning and get this thing done. Tom Hoge had to wait out the four-hole delay before facing a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th. He missed, posting a 66 and wound up two shots behind. Lucas Glover rallied from a rough front nine for a 71 and joined Hoge and Akshay Bhatia (70). They each earned $1,325,000 for the tie for third from the $25 million purse, the richest in golf. Bud Cauley, who thought his career was over from crushing injuries in a 2018 car crash in Ohio, fell back early and steadied himself for a 74. He tied for sixth, giving him more than enough points to fulfill his medical exemption for the rest of the year. McIlroy faced a four-shot deficit going into the final round and roared into contention with an 8-foot birdie putt and beautiful long iron to 10 feet for eagle on the par-5 second. He took the lead for the first time when Spaun made bogey on the seventh hole. Spaun caught a big break on the ninth hole when his second shot was in the collar of deep rough. He got relief from standing on a sprinkler head, then more relief when his drop was in the sprinkler head, leading to a clean lie. He chipped to 6 feet for birdie. Still, McIlroy appeared to start pulling away right before and after the four-hour delay from a band of thunderstorms moving across north Florida. He holed a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-5 11th to reach 12 under. Spaun, playing in the group behind him, was in trouble in a bunker well short of the green. Four hours later, McIlroy made a 15-foot birdie on the 12th, while Spaun barely got the bunker shot on the green and made bogey with a three-putt from some 70 feet. Once that bogey kind of hit me, I just tried to just fight back, Spaun said. I kind of went with the odds. I had nothing to lose. Now Im trying to catch Rory, and I cant really control what he does, but I can control what I do, and I just started committing to my shots and my swing and trusting it more.  When Im hunting, its easier to let it go. Whereas, starting the round I was a little tentative, a little scared and stuff, he said. I think it put me in a pretty comfortable spot to finish off the round. McIlroy fanned a drive well right on the 14th, couldnt reach the green, leading to bogey. Even so, the one-quarter inch of rain softened the green. The 15 mph wind all but vanished. The Stadium course was vulnerable.  McIlroy, however, missed a birdie chance from just inside 6 feet on the 15th and didnt judge the speed of the green on the par-5 16th on his chip, leaving it 12 feet short. Another miss. Behind him, Spaun threw a dart to a foot on the 14th for birdie, and chipped tight at the 16th for a birdie that tied him for the lead. Both found land on the island at the 17th  McIlroy against the collar for an awkward stab at his 15-foot birdie attempt, Spaun lagging beautifully from 45 feet on a putt that is slow up the slope and races to the pin.  Two-time defending champion Scottie Scheffler was never really in the mix. He went 15 straight holes without a birdie between the third and fourth rounds, made only one birdie on Sunday and closed with a 73 to tie for 20th. Being able to repeat here was very special and I would have liked to have done it a third time, Scheffler said. At the end of the day, I just didnt have what it took this week. The guys that are ahead of me on the leaderboard  theres many of them, so they obviously played better than I did. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/players-championship-tpc-sawgrass-mcilroy-spaun-cb091d5a36e88d15d3ec1ce516f81ba1,sports
"With WNBA Finals even, Lynx will need to keep leaning on Courtney Williams to beat Liberty","MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Minnesota Lynx had just beaten the New York Liberty to win the WNBA Commissioners Cup earlier this season, and their next game was a noon start in Dallas. Courtney Williams just wasnt into it.  The ninth-year veteran went through the motions in that loss to a Wings team that wound up with the leagues second-worst record, and Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve let her point guard have it. We dont pay you just to play at 7 p.m. If we have a game at noon, we pay you to play then, too, Reeve said, recalling her message that day.  Williams shot 1 for 6 and had four turnovers. Reeve told her she felt she gave in to the fatigue. I told her I would never do that again. You will never have to worry about that again, Williams said. I think from that moment, I invited hard. Williams went so far as to declare that stern conversation changed her life, an assessment she reiterated again this week when she and Reeve spoke upon the teams return from New York. The Lynx split the first two games of the WNBA Finals with the Liberty. Game 3 is in Minnesota on Wednesday night. Some players arent held accountable like that, Reeve said. Shes an exceptional listener, and the coachabilty is off the charts. Thats one reason Reeve targeted Williams in free agency. Another was her experience. Then theres the play-making skill the Lynx needed to relieve the defensive intensity around star Napheesa Collier and set up outside shooters Kayla McBride and Bridget Carleton.  
        
     Including the four-point play that completed Minnesotas comeback from an 18-point deficit in Game 1, Williams had 23 points to open the best-of-five series. Liberty coach Sandy Brondello put it succinctly: Courtney Williams was a thorn in our side. She was the head of the snake. Drafted by the Phoenix Mercury eighth overall in 2016 out of South Florida, Williams made the Lynx her fifth team  and fourth in four years  when she signed with them before this season. The native of Georgia had barely begun her rookie year when she was traded, ironically by Brondello, to the Connecticut Sun to start a winding journey around the league. She had some stellar performances in the playoffs for the Sun over the years, but she never got to experience the thrill of a championship there. This season, playing for a coach in Reeve who guided the Lynx to four titles between 2011 and 2017, Williams has come tantalizingly close to finally getting a ring. In nine games in these playoffs, shes averaging 14.9 points and shooting 57.9% from 3-point range. Everything youve got in your bag, its time to pull it out, Williams said Tuesday after the Lynx practiced at Target Center. I guess Im built different. I love the moment. I dont shy away from the moment at all. All my life, since rec league, I always want the ball in my hand when its time to go make a play. Despite holding a lead for a total of roughly five minutes over the first two games, the Lynx flipped the home-court advantage. They will also host Game 4 on Friday night and, even though their team chemistry has been exceptional, they have no interest in hopping on another flight to New York for Game 5. We always believed it from the beginning. We have a great group, Williams said. Yeah, its hard. We understand that its hard. But we invite hard. We love hard. The Liberty deftly recovered from their collapse in Game 1 to take immediate control of Game 2 and follow through with a strong finish.  The same things that Sandy felt after Game 1, we felt after Game 2, Reeve said. The Lynx were focused intently on preparing to play much better in the games opening five minutes. Dont wait and let someone else strike first, Reeve said. Playing behind a loud crowd should help. Its not going to get any easier from here. This is the Finals, said Liberty star Breanna Stewart. Its only going to get harder, but were excited for the atmosphere where nobodys cheering for us and everybodys cheering against us. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-finals-liberty-lynx-williams-ba2194966842f86fd24c53251c97e827,sports
Rory McIlroy takes drama out of playoff to win The Players and build momentum to the Masters,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP)  The playoff was only three holes. Rory McIlroy needed only three swings. And yet his victory Monday over J.J. Spaun in The Players Championship revealed so much about the state of his game and the cruel nature of the notorious TPC Sawgrass. McIlroy delivered an early knockout against J.J. Spaun with his best drive of the week that set up a simple birdie, followed by a three-quarter 9-iron into a cold, cackling wind that found land on the island green at the par-3 17th.  By no means did I have my best stuff this week, McIlroy said after becoming the eighth multiple winner of The Players. But I was still able to win one of the biggest tournaments in the world. Thats a huge thing. Its the first time in his career he has won twice going into the Masters, the major that for more than a decade has kept him from joining golfs most elite group with the career Grand Slam. Spaun thought he had the perfect answer until he saw his 8-iron sail over the island on the second playoff hole, ending his hopes of the biggest win of his career. Can I watch this? Spaun said as he sat at a table, his eyes trained on a television in the back of the media center showing a replay of his tee shot on the 17th. It was his first time seeing where the ball landed  just beyond the wooden frame and into the water. He had heard only groans from the gallery. And he still couldnt believe it. 
        
     I never thought it was long, he said quietly. I never thought it was long. So ended a memorable week at golfs richest tournament, where thousands of spectators showed up in the cold and wind for 47 minutes of golf between McIlroy  among the most celebrated players who now has 39 worldwide wins  and Spaun, a 34-year-old with one PGA Tour title who until this week had never broken 70 on the TPC Sawgrass. McIlroy said he woke up at 3 a.m. and couldnt get back to sleep. Whether this was about trying to win or trying not to lose  he had a three-shot lead with five holes to play in the final round Sunday  didnt matter. He worked on his tee shot with the same helping wind off the right. To practice in the right wind for the 17th, McIlroy turned and hit balls from the range toward the third green. McIlroy had been spotty off the tee all week, missing nearly half of his fairways. He set the tone with his best of the week, a 336-yard blast right down the middle that set up a pitching wedge from 176 yards into the par-5 16th for a two-putt birdie from 35 feet. I thought if I could get the ball in the fairway there, it sort of puts a little bit of pressure on J.J., he said. To step up and make that swing was awesome. And then it effectively ended on the 17th. When my ball was in the air, I was telling it to get down, McIlroy said. Spaun hit his 8-iron with a higher trajectory into a hurting wind off the right, and his first instinct was to yell, Get up. It just looked like it was going to be short, Spaun said. I was stunned. I couldnt believe it was long. Im happy with the swing I put on it  I am. The wind must have just laid down just a little too much, and it just went through the wind. Wasnt my time. The first three-hole playoff in 10 years at The Players was caused by a four-hour rain delay on Sunday. McIlroy had to make a 4-foot par putt on the 72nd hole. Spaun had a 30-foot birdie putt for the win that stopped inches short. McIlroy, disappointed and having lost a three-shot lead on the back nine, looked ahead to the playoff by saying, Make five good swings tomorrow morning and get this thing done. Turns out he only needed three  the driver and wedge on No. 16, the 9-iron on No. 17  to beat Spaun and claim the $4.5 million prize from the $25 million purse. It was reminiscent of a 2008 playoff between Sergio Garcia and Paul Goydos, back when the 17th was used in sudden death. Garcia hit the green. Goydos came up short and into the water, and there is no lonelier walk than to the drop zone knowing its over. Spaun wound up three-putting from 45 feet for triple bogey. McIlroy ran his 30-footer well past the hole for a bogey, giving him a three-shot lead. Both hit drives well right on the 18th. McIlroy took a safe bogey and Spaun didnt bother putting the 10-footer he had left for bogey. Any mention of The Players being the fifth major or even resembling one is not where McIlroy wants to go right now because he knows the real one  the big one  is a month away at Augusta National. The trick now is to keep his game in good stead. He also won the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am last month. He plans to add one more start in Houston or San Antonio before the Masters. Everything feels like its in good working order at the minute, he said. Just keep practicing and doing the right things and practicing the right habits, and day after day, week after week, they all add up to days like today. Spaun won $2,725,000 for his runner-up finish and moved to No. 25 in the world ranking, high enough that he is assured a spot in the Masters. A good consolation to the week, Spaun said. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/rory-mcilroy-players-championship-tpc-sawgrass-jj-spaun-b094bd24b98c94344c739ead40f960d3,sports
TNT and its sports platforms to show new Unrivaled womens 3-on-3 basketball league games,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The new Unrivaled womens basketball 3-on-3 league will have its games broadcast on TNT and its sports platforms. The league announced a multiyear partnership with the network to show more than 45 games from the inaugural season that begins in January. Matchups will be shown three nights a week with twice-weekly games on TNT on Mondays and Fridays. Games that are played on Saturday will be shown on truTV. Games begin on Jan. 17 and will be played in Miami. Our TNT Sports portfolio centers on premium live sports and our media and equity partnership with Unrivaled deepens our commitment to further expanding the depth of top tier womens sports programming we offer our fans and presents an opportunity for us to shape and amplify the continued growth of womens basketball, said Luis Silberwasser, chairman and CEO of TNT Sports. The league features 30 of the top womens basketball players across six teams and was co-founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart. I mean, to be able to have a network like that that supports us, especially in Year 1, I think is just a huge testament to womens basketball right now and how much its growing, Collier told The Associated Press at shootaround before Game 3 of the WNBA Finals on Thursday. Having all the games on one platform was huge for the new league. The league was also having discussions with ESPN, Amazon, ION and the CW.  
        
     We had a lot of interest as you could imagine and you know, we thought about carving this up in certain ways, but to give credit to Luis and the vision that he had, he wanted it all, said former Turner President David Levy, who is the co-founder and co-CEO of Horizon Sports & Experiences and helped secure the media rights deal. He thought it was smart for the league. And we talked about it, and we ended up deciding that maybe it is right to go with one entity, and a strong entity. TNT will have a studio show at least one of the two nights its showing games. Being on TNT, you know, for two of the three nights is really important, not just to help grow this league, but also to the women who play in it, said Levy. You know, they they grew up watching TNT. And then lets not forget Bleacher Report and House of Highlights. Thats where all the Gen Zers are. Unrivaled President Alex Bazzell said that being on TV was received really well by the players. I think theres a lot of nostalgia that goes along with this for the athletes, he said. We have an obligation with whichever partner it is that its someone theyre proud of and I think that first and foremost theyre really proud of this partnership. Ive gotten tons of texts that our athletes are pumped up.  Salaries for the new league will be in the six figures. Compensation was key for players, many of whom have spent their offseason overseas supplementing their WNBA incomes. The average WNBA base salary is about $130,000 with the top stars able to earn more than $500,000 through salary, marketing agreements, an in-season tournament and bonuses. Many of the players also will have an equity stake in the league. The league will run for eight weeks with the 30 players divided into six teams. The squads will play two games a week with the contests taking place on a court about two-thirds the size of a WNBA one. The teams will stay the same throughout the season. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/unrivaled-3-on-3-wnba-53cc270e2813ee50d77733cf2b2d599b,sports
Ionescus 3-pointer with 1 second left gives Liberty 80-77 win over Lynx and 2-1 lead in WNBA Finals,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Sabrina Ionescu watched Breanna Stewart carry the New York Liberty all game, until it was time to win it. Then the ball was hers. In the timeout, (coach) Sandy (Brondello) was like, Youre going to shoot the shot, Ionescu said. The star guard made it, a 3-pointer from 28 feet with a second remaining that gave the Liberty an 80-77 victory over the Minnesota Lynx on Wednesday night and moved them a win away from an elusive first WNBA title.  New York leads the finals 2-1  the first time it has ever been ahead in the championship round  and can win the series Friday night in Minnesota. We know were one game away from winning the championship, and I think that they are going to give us their best shot, said Stewart, who won two titles with Seattle. They are going to give everything they have got, and you know what, so are we. The turnaround is quick but we are going to continue to be ready.  Ionescu said she had to watch replay of her shot after the game to see exactly what happened. I didnt even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was, she said. I feel like I was able to get a little separation in range and get a really good shot to go. With the game tied at 77, Ionescu had the ball and dribbled around before pulling up a few steps behind the arc and hitting from 28 feet to break the tie. 
        
     Its pretty special. It was never in doubt. Obviously Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there, but I thought the right time, this is Sabrina, Brondello said. She just made a big shot. Shes a great shooter and she just needed a little bit of separation. Stewart scored 22 of the teams 45 points in the second half and finished with 30 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots. We dont win this game without Stewie, Ionescu said. Theres nothing I can say. That shots nice, but what she was able to do for us tonight willed us back into the game. Minnesota didnt get a real shot to tie at the buzzer. Great player made a good shot, Minnesota guard Kayla McBride said. I guarded her for 40 minutes. The Liberty erased a 15-point deficit to move one victory from winning their first title. Theres a lot of things that we didnt do right tonight and have a kind of quick memory, Stewart said. I think that were happy we got this win but the jobs not done. The Liberty have appeared in the finals five times before, including last season, and lost each one.  Trailing 73-69 with 2:26 left in the fourth quarter, the Liberty scored eight straight points, including the first five by Jonquel Jones. Ionescu, who had a relatively quiet game, then hit another 3-pointer after a Lynx miss to make it 77-73 with 55.5 left. Bridget Carleton got the Lynx within 77-75 with a layup 21 seconds later. On New Yorks next possession, Ionescu had a 3-pointer go halfway through the basket before popping out and Minnesota got the rebound.  Napheesa Collier was then fouled with 16 seconds left and hit both free throws to tie it setting up the exciting finish. Collier finished with 22 points and McBride 19 for Minnesota. Our defense gave us a chance to win the game, period, and our offense is going to help our defense, Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve said. If you told me that we would have got the amount of stops that we did and we were playing off that, and we wouldnt have scored 80, that would be surprising to me. The Lynx flipped the script of the first two games, building a double-digit lead in the first half. Minnesota, which only led for just over three minutes in the first two contests, was up 60-50 with 2:28 left in the third quarter before the Liberty closed to 62-61 by the end of the period. Stewart scored the final five points, including a three-point play with 19 seconds left. She then scored the first eight points for New York in the fourth quarter, tying the game at 69 with another three-point play with 6:18 left. Carleton hit two free throws to break the tie 12 seconds later. Neither team would score again until Courtney Williams hit a baseline pullup with 2:26 left to give the Lynx a four-point advantage. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-finals-lynx-liberty-score-8efdf448485626ac2bbcad2105d286d4,sports
"Clark first rookie to make All-WNBA 1st team since 2008, joined by unanimous choices Wilson, Collier","MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  Rookie guard Caitlin Clark added another accolade to her outstanding first season, earning All-WNBA honors Wednesday. The Indiana Fever guard became the first rookie to make the team since Candace Parker did it in 2008. Shes the fifth rookie ever to have that honor, joining Sue Bird, Tamika Catchings and Diana Taurasi. Las Vegas Aces forward Aja Wilson and Minnesotas Napheesa Collier were unanimous first-team selections. Breanna Stewart of New York and Alyssa Thomas of Connecticut rounded out the positionless five-person team. Wilson, the leagues unanimous choice as MVP, earned a spot on the first team for the third consecutive season and fourth time overall. Collier, a three-time All-WNBA team selection, was voted to the first team for the second straight year. Clark earned 52 first-team votes and was on 66 of the 67 ballots that were submitted by a national media panel.

Deion Sanders laments criticism son Shedeur faces ahead of NFL draft but says hes built for this,"BOULDER, Colo. (AP)  Deion Sanders never fretted over his own NFL draft journey. He had the leverage to go where he wanted  Atlanta  because he was also a baseball star who had been drafted by the New York Yankees a year earlier.  Hes not stressing over his sons draft odysseys, either, even as highly touted quarterback Shedeur navigates heavy doses of negativity and safety Shilo is projected to go undrafted altogether. Youve got to understand, when that last name is on your back, youre going to be attacked and ridiculed by naysayers, Sanders said.  But, he said, his sons are built for this. Raised to handle the critics, to tune out the hostility. Sanders coached Shedeur and Shilo the last two years at Colorado. Before that he coached Shedeur for two years at Jackson State. Shilo joined his family in Boulder in 2023 after playing two seasons at South Carolina.  Sanders shudders to think what kind of hate hed have gotten in 1989 had he faced the kind of constant scrutiny kids  his and others  do nowadays. They receive a lot more ignorance than I did, Sanders said. You know, I received some, but we didnt have the social media channels and all the things thats privy today. Not at all. I mean, youve got to understand I was a two-sport star at the time so you could imagine what it would have been like with all the hate and the naysayers. I was a little different. Sanders made it clear that he wanted to play for the Falcons, who chose him with the fifth overall pick in the 1989 NFL draft. 
        
     My kids dont have that luxury of saying where they want to go, Sanders said. Shedeur Sanders, who is projected to go in the first round Thursday night, said he doesnt necessarily need the bright lights of Broadway or the Bellagio. I could bring cameras and eyes anywhere I go, he said. And he insists the attention wont bother him one bit because, as his father said, he was raised to, yes, keep calm and carry on. One thing I learned is to not really care about anybodys opinion but those around us who matter, Shedeur said.  Should Shilo go undrafted as so many seem to expect, he might be able to go to a desired destination providing teams come calling with the chance to make their roster as an undrafted free agent. He just needs a team to give him a shot, his father said, and Shedeur is a workaholic. He is who he is and sometimes people forget what hes accomplished here at CU and how accurate and how good he is because youve got to take a shot at somebody and you might as well take a shot at a Sanders. Keep bringing it on, Sanders said. Weve already won. We came from a private school. And we came from an HBCU. Weve won. Shedeurs getting drafted. Hes going in the first round. Shilos going to do his thing. All he needs is his opportunity. Weve won, man. Weve already won. Long before he was Coach Prime, Sanders was Neon Deion and later, Prime Time. He brought the swagger not only to the gridiron for nine NFL seasons but to the diamond during a 14-year career in Major League Baseball. Sanders flashed in the 40-yard dash at the 1989 NFL scouting combine, where he was clocked at 4.27 seconds, which is just six-hundredths of a second shy of Xavier Worthys record 4.21 dash recorded in 2024.  Sanders recently recalled saying he didnt stretch before running his 40 because the cheetah doesnt stretch before he goes and gets his prey. His sons, especially Shedeur, have that same bravado, like when he flashes his watch celebration after touchdowns. There were reports after the combine that at least one team didnt like Shedeurs braggadocio, although others said thats exactly what a team relishes in its quarterback. I dont know what they expect from my kids, Sanders said. Theyre daddys sons, man. Shilo Sanders had one bad game in college, a 31-28 loss to Kansas State last season after returning from a broken forearm that sidelined him three weeks. Shilos got several years of film that are impeccable, his father said. Shilo had one negative game that we could denote. Shilos been a pillar of consistency. Shilo is an old-school player playing under these new-school guidelines. Shilo is a dog. In 50 collegiate games, Shedeur Sanders threw for 14,347 yards and 134 touchdowns with 27 interceptions. He completed 70.1% of his passes and ran for 17 scores. And all of a sudden his arm is weak? his father cracked.  Travis Hunter, the Buffaloes Heisman-winning two-way star, is like another son to Sanders, who said a year ago Hunter and Shedeur should go 1-2 in the 2025 NFL draft. And Im going to stick by that. I think theyre the two best players in this draft, Sanders said. ___ AP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed.  ___ Follow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton at https://apnews.com/author/arnie-melendrez-stapleton ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/nfl-draft-shedeur-sanders-deion-sanders-32700a7997c6483b441ffd7764f9c75e,sports
Ex-NFL player Shannon Sharpe accused of rape in $50 million civil lawsuit,"LAS VEGAS (AP)  A young woman who says she was raped and threatened by retired NFL player Shannon Sharpe during a rocky consensual relationship has filed a civil lawsuit against him seeking $50 million in damages.  Attorneys filed the lawsuit Sunday in Clark County, Nevada, for a woman listed in court documents as Jane Doe. The lawsuit also accuses Sharpe of using physical force on her and inflicting emotional distress. The woman first met Sharpe at a gym in Los Angeles in 2023 when she was 20 and a nearly two-year relationship followed, according to court documents. Sharpe, 56, is accused of raping the woman in October 2024 and again in January, court documents said. Sharpe on Monday posted a statement from his lawyer on X saying the relationship was consensual and calling the lawsuit a blatant and cynical attempt to shake down Sharpe for millions of dollars. It is filled with lies, distortions, and misrepresentations  and it will not succeed, Lanny J. Davis said in the statement posted by Sharpe. Sharpe is accused of becoming increasingly verbally abusive, controlling and violent over time, once threatening to kill her and recording their sexual encounters without consent, according to the complaint.  Sharpe flew into fits of anger when Plaintiff noted his infidelity to their relationship, or called him out about his extraneous activities, the lawsuit said. Sharpe even figured out how to get into Does apartment complex without her permission. 
        
     Sharpe was a four-time All-Pro tight end who played on two Super Bowl champions with Denver and another with Baltimore over 14 seasons from 1990 to 2003. He was voted into the Hall of Fame in 2011. Sharpe retired as the NFLs all-time leader among tight ends in receptions (815), yards receiving (10,060) and touchdowns (62). Those records have since been broken. Sharpe has been a staple on TV and social media since retiring. He left FS1s sports debate show Undisputed in 2023 and joined ESPN soon afterward.",https://apnews.com/article/nfl-shannon-sharpe-sexual-assault-lawsuit-5d921fc4131f6cada3b262e91f075e1c,sports
Matthew Stafford is happy with his restructured Rams contract after he considered finding a new home,"LOS ANGELES (AP)  After a second offseason of financial discontent, Matthew Stafford is glad to be back at work with the Los Angeles Rams. The Super Bowl-winning quarterback attended the start of the Rams voluntary offseason workout program Monday several weeks after getting a substantial raise on the contract extension he received three years ago when the Rams won it all. Stafford got a restructured deal for the second straight offseason after challenging the Rams for better terms. The 37-year-old Stafford didnt go into many details about the standoff, which was much shorter this season after it stretched up to the start of training camp in 2024. The quarterback also acknowledged he did due diligence on potential landing spots in a trade before the Rams gave him what he wanted. Theres so many positive things about our organization, about our team, Stafford said. Never really wanted to leave, so just happy to be back and happy that the Rams want me back, and hopefully we can move forward and have a great season. Stafford, who began his career with 12 years in Detroit, will play his fifth season in Los Angeles after strongly considering the possibility of starting over elsewhere. The sides have gently downplayed the seriousness of their negotiations, with coach Sean McVay saying that he never seriously thought Stafford would leave. But Stafford definitely thought about it: His agent got permission from the Rams to gauge the quarterbacks potential value in a trade, and Stafford was quickly linked to theoretical deals with the Raiders and Giants. 
        
     I think anytime those kind of things come up, youre obviously doing due diligence and looking around, Stafford said. You obviously poke your head around and see whats going on. Obviously, wanting to be back with the Rams was my No. 1 priority, so Im glad it worked out and I dont have to worry about it. Heading into his 17th NFL season, Stafford has made it clear he will decide his future on a year-to-year basis from here on out, and the Rams seem content with that  for 2025, at least. Theres also the distinct possibility that the Rams will attempt to draft their quarterback of the future this week, either with the 26th overall pick or by moving up. If that happens, Stafford said it wouldnt change the way he approaches the season. Whoever we draft, I hope they come in and help our team win, Stafford said. You look at it last year, our first two picks were guys on defense that made huge impacts on our team. So for me, Im just trying to load this team up with as many good players as we possibly can. If a quarterback comes along and they feel the need to take him, (Id) welcome him with open arms and try to teach him as much as I possibly can. Stafford will have the entire offseason program to forge a bond with Davante Adams, his longtime rival in the NFC North. The star receiver signed a two-year deal last month with the Rams, who also released Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp, Staffords longtime favorite target. Hes been an unbelievable player for a long time, Stafford said of Adams. Obviously had a special connection with Aaron (Rodgers) there in Green Bay for a long time, which was great to watch as long as I wasnt on the other sideline watching it.  Great hands. Can finish plays down the field with scores as well. Im excited to get to work with him. Ive been a fan of his for a long time as a player, so hopefully I can give him the rock and he can do his thing. Staffords return cements the Rams chances to be a Super Bowl contender again this season after winning the NFC West and narrowly losing to Philadelphia in last seasons playoffs. That stability behind center  whether that center is incumbent Beaux Limmer or returning free agent Coleman Shelton  will allow the Rams to conduct their offseason with no worries about late-summer surprises. Its huge, right tackle Rob Havenstein said. Having (No.) 9 in the building is always a good thing. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL",https://apnews.com/article/rams-matthew-stafford-d9b93d42710ead48ef73b1fc4fbb8e83,sports
NFL NextGen Stats team unveils new draft website,"Many NFL fans spend the weeks leading up to the draft poring over predictions to try to figure out which players their favorite teams are most likely to select. Those mock drafts quickly become obsolete once the actual draft begins with some projected targets inevitably coming off the board before a team even makes its pick. That was the motivation for the NFLs NextGen Stats team to create a new draft site that adapts seamlessly with each move made before or during the draft. The site takes elements from the old draft preview magazines that presented easily digestible information. The draft magazine was so efficient at displaying information in a easy to digest way, said Mike Band, the senior manager for research and analytics at NFL NextGen Stats. In a lot of ways as weve optimized for mobile experiences, weve lost that art of a dashboard-like experience. That was the impetus for this project, creating a digital magazine that could be updated live and evolve in a dynamic way and hopefully have really fun and engaging live features. The NFL Draft IQ site launched earlier this month to preview the draft. It was designed to be the ideal second screen during the draft starting Thursday night. The site includes team-by-team pages that list each teams picks in the next two drafts, moves they had made in the offseason, potential draft targets for each day of the draft, a mock draft tracker and historic tendencies for each general manager. The site was created in less than three weeks with help from Amazon QuickSight, building on the work the NextGen Stats team did in creating Combine IQ, which provided context and comparisons to the loads of data produced at the annual scouting combine. 
        
     Band has been posting potential first-round targets for teams for the past six years and has had a high rate with about three-quarters of the teams taking one of his potential targets. That work used from looking at team needs, draft history, mock drafts, pre-draft meetings and other information leads to the potential targets on the Draft IQ site for each team for each day. Those will be updated throughout the draft based on whos left on the board and what needs have been met.  Its a fun exercise to try to match these teams to players across different pre-draft interests, team needs, Band said. A lot of teams have a lot of smoke screens, so you almost have to read between the lines in a lot ways. The team pages include tendencies for general managers, including how often they have traded up or down, whether they target certain positions in the prime rounds and if the GM has had patterns based on size, age or other attributes when picking players. For example, Houstons Nick Caserio has used 31 of his 32 picks on players who came out of power conferences. The Bengals also tend to go that direction with all 22 of their picks in the first two rounds since 2014 coming from power conference schools. Philadelphias Howie Roseman has used 10 of his 13 first-round picks when running the draft on the trenches, while Detroits Brad Holmes picks have the highest average athleticism score from NGS since he took over in 2021. If you want to know who the last few picks were you can go to the draft tracker on NFL(dot)com, Band said. But if you want to go deeper into every pick as its happening and trying to anticipate the next pick and you want to sound smart at an NFL draft party and tip the pick without actually talking to Ian Rapoport, then follow along with Draft IQ. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",https://apnews.com/article/nfl-draft-bbca37ed169f0bd3112eb28ec1f4d007,sports
Howden scores twice and Golden Knights beat Wild 4-2 in Game 1,"LAS VEGAS (AP)  Brett Howden had never scored double-digit goals until this season. Then he went out and scored 23. Turns out, Howden isnt finished. He had what turned out to be the game-winning goal and later delivered an empty netter, and the Vegas Golden Knights opened their first-round Western Conference playoffs series with a 4-2 victory Sunday night over the Minnesota Wild. Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said he told Howden to stick with what he did in the regular season rather than try to do too much in the playoffs. Howden had just six career postseason goals before this game. He didnt change his game, Cassidy said. He played physical. Hes part of our penalty kill. Hes always out when the goalies out, typically one of the six guys we use a lot because of his versatility. He can play wing. He can take draws as a center. Hes been real good for us all year and good again tonight. Tomas Hertl had a goal and an assist for the Golden Knights. Ive been long excited for this moment, Hertl said. I always try to play my game, and I think its kind of playoff style. Im glad I could help the team today. It was a team effort. Pavel Dorofeyev scored the other Vegas goal, and Adin Hill made 18 saves. Matt Boldy scored both Wild goals, Kirill Kaprizov assisted on both and Filip Gustavsson stopped 23 shots. Game 2 is Tuesday night in Las Vegas. I think both teams came to play hard, Wild coach John Hynes said. Pretty strong defensive efforts. Not a lot of special teams in the game. I thought we did a lot of good things to build on moving forward.  
        
     Both teams traded goals in the first period. Hertl took the puck from Minnesotas Brock Faber and hit the net from just inside the front side of the left circle. The Wild answered 2:20 later when Kaprizov delivered a cross-ice pass to Boldy, who scored off the rush. Dorofeyev scored the only goal in the second period when Hertl won the faceoff to open a power play. The puck went to Shea Theodore, who skated to the center and set up Dorofeyev for a blast from the right circle. Dorofeyev has scored goals in three consecutive games going back to the end of the regular season. Howden extended the Vegas lead to 3-1 early in the third period, but Boldys wrap-around goal with 8:14 left brought Minnesota to within one. Howden added an empty-netter with less than 1 second remaining, the Golden Knights second power-play goal. Wild 19-year-old defenseman Zeev Buium made his NHL debut by playing on the third pair with Zach Bogosian. He played 13:37 with a shot on goal. Buium was playing for Denver just 10 days earlier in the NCAAs Frozen Four. Linesman Bryan Pancich left the game 3:37 into the second period after a collision with Howden. Backup official Frederick LEcuyer took Pancichs place. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/wild-golden-knights-score-nhl-playoffs-b21af8ed1e5714cfb80c6ee85d9463a0,sports
"Here they go again: Lightning vs. Panthers in Round 1, for Sunshine State hockey supremacy","SUNRISE, Fla. (AP)  Its starting to feel like an annual tradition: Panthers vs. Lightning in the NHL playoffs, the battle of Florida, a matchup that has seemed to decide which team will eventually get to the Stanley Cup Final. And here they go again. Defending Stanley Cup champion Florida heads to Tampa Bay for Game 1 of an Eastern Conference first-round series Tuesday night, the start of the fourth postseason meeting in five years between the Sunshine State rivals. Tampa Bay won the East title in 2020, 2021 and 2022; Florida is trying to match that run of success after winning the East in 2023 and 2024. I think you see it every game we play, whether its preseason in Orlando or whether its Game 1 of the playoffs, Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said. Weve kind of known that the other ones going to be there at the end of the year. Its kind of always, were going to have to go through each other. I think theres that respect there  but we almost love to hate each other. Tampa Bay beat Florida 4-1 in 2021 (on its way to a second consecutive Stanley Cup title) and swept the Panthers in 2022  giving up just three goals in that series. Florida beat Tampa Bay in six games last season, on its way to its first Cup win. They know us and we know them, Lightning forward Brayden Point said. Were looking forward to it. Theyre always tight series and its going to be a good one. 
        
     Since the season resumed in February after the break for the 4 Nations Face-off event, Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy and Florida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky  both of them Stanley Cup winners  have looked playoff-sharp. Vasilevskiy had a 1.89 goals-against average and .927 save percentage in that span. Bobrovsky had a 1.95 GAA and .914 save percentage. And both had three shutouts. Bobrovsky backstopped Florida to the Cup last season. I dont remember much from what happened last year, Bobrovsky said. Its a new season, its a new challenge, its a new contest and were excited about it. We just want to enjoy that experience and were going to try our best to win it. A look at some stats in the Panthers-Lightning rivalry:  Wins this season: Florida 47, Tampa Bay 47.  Head-to-head wins this season: Florida 2, Tampa Bay 2.  Wins in last 20 meetings (including playoffs): Florida 10, Tampa Bay 10.  Goals, last 40 meetings (including playoffs): Florida 128, Tampa Bay 128.  Goals, last 145 meetings (including playoffs): Florida 454, Tampa Bay 454.  Record in last 168 head-to-head meetings (including playoffs): Florida 80 wins, Tampa Bay 80 wins, with eight ties. The state of Florida has had a team in the Stanley Cup final in each of the last five years. If the Lightning-Panthers winner gets there again this year, itll mark the longest stretch of one state or province making it to consecutive title rounds since Alberta  Edmonton six times, Calgary twice  had a team there in eight straight seasons from 1983 through 1990. No U.S. state has made it to the title round in six straight years since New York saw the Rangers get there in 1979 and the Islanders in each of the following five seasons. Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper has won 87 playoff games with the Lightning, the third-most of any coach with one franchise in NHL history. He wont be catching Al Arbour anytime soon; Arbour won 119 with the New York Islanders for the most by any coach with one club. But Cooper enters this series just two wins behind Glen Sather, who won 89 with Edmonton. Theres 32 teams. Theres only 16 left. Were one of the 16, Cooper said. I think every year, we get looked at as, OK, their times over. And every year, these guys come back and prove they can do it. Its been amazing to be part of for more than a decade. Tampa Bays Nikita Kucherov won the scoring title this season with 121 points, his second consecutive year finishing No. 1 on that list and his third consecutive 100-point season. Thats the good news. Heres the bad news. No scoring champion has played for that seasons eventual Stanley Cup champion since Evgeni Malkin with Pittsburgh in 2008-09. And only four players in the last 25 years have tallied 100 or more points, then gone on to win that years Cup: Malkin and Sidney Crosby in 2009, Carolinas Eric Staal in 2006 and Colorados Joe Sakic in 2001. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/stanley-cup-playoffs-lightning-panthers-e60eb5e725306ae9b89142e9c770fbce,sports
Lightnings Nikita Kucherov quietly among NHLs best again as playoff showdown with Florida arrives,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP)  In a crowded field of generational talents, Tampa Bay Lightning wing Nikita Kucherov hides in plain sight. Thats often the case with Kucherov, who just won his second consecutive regular-season scoring title and third overall. Yet when discussions turn to the top players in the game today, the conversation tends to turn to Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon, Sidney Crosby or Cale Makar. Kucherovs resume as he gets set to lead the Lightning into their first-round playoff matchup against Florida makes clear he is one of the best of his generation. No question, Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. Theyre all unique in their own ways. They all have these genuine, generational attributes to their game. Kuch is right up there with them. After collecting another Art Ross Trophy with 121 points and tying MacKinnon for the league lead with 84 assists, Kucherov continues to put his name alongside some of the greatest to ever play the game. He is one of only 10 players to win at least three scoring titles and one of 14 to record at least three seasons with at least 120 points. He joined Wayne Gretzky, Bobby Orr and Paul Coffey as the only players who have recorded three consecutive seasons with at least 80 assists. Those numbers jump off the page. How Kucherov reached them does not. His newer teammates now see that up close. Definitely a way higher appreciation for him as a player, said Lightning forward Zemgus Girgensons, who spent the first 11 years of his career with Buffalo. You see him a couple times a year, hell of a player. But then you see him day-to-day and see the stuff he can do is just amazing. 
        
     Jake Guentzel spent eight seasons in Pittsburgh where he played primarily on a line with Crosby. After signing an eight-year contract following a trade to Tampa Bay before the season, Guentzel set a career high with 41 goals and led the league with 17 power play goals. Guentzel figured out quickly how to play with Kucherov. You get awed at the plays he makes, game in and game out, he said. The things he does, its pretty incredible.  These guys, they think the game at a high level. Because (they) are elite passers and high-end playmakers, you just have to be ready at all times. Kucherov works on his craft, spending hours in the summer months on the ice. He dedicates that time to working on aspects of his game such as pulling a puck off the wall with his backhand. I dont think Ive seen him miss a rim since Ive been here, rookie center Conor Geekie said. Its just little things like that (which) sometimes goes overlooked. Hes special. To be 20 years old and watch one of the greatest, in my opinion, playmakers ever, I think its a blessing. Hes just really good at slowing the game down, changing the pace. Hes something special. While McDavid and MacKinnon are capable of wowing in real time with their speed and pace, the tape often has to be slowed down to realize some of the plays Kucherov pulls off. The subtleness of some of the passes he makes, cant really see them from the bench, rookie forward Gage Goncalves said. You watch him on the replay, and (the puck) went over one guys stick and through the other guys legs and landed flat perfectly on the tape. Thats the type of player he is and he works hard at it every single day. If the Lightning are going to reach the Stanley Cup Final for the fifth time since 2015, Kucherov will be a big part of it, just like hes done in the past. With four more postseason points, he will crack the top 20 all time in playoff scoring. To be able to put the point totals hes putting up year after year, and he has some of the best statistics in the playoffs of all time, thats how you build cases for Hall of Famers, Cooper said. Youre not a one-hit wonder, youre a one-decade wonder, and hes going to be more than that. - AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/nhl-playoffs-lightning-kucherov-6aa37d2695b57055e4a41ae925d98856,sports
Canadian hockey fans conflicted over traveling to U.S. to see their teams in NHL playoffs,"TORONTO (AP)  Jack Gurevitch is a Montreal Canadiens superfan and a proud Canadian who says he is upset by President Donald Trumps tariff plans and threats to annex Canada. Still, he says he wont let the political situation influence whether he travels to U.S. cities to support his team in the playoffs. Not everyone in his family agrees. In anticipation of this call, I shared with my sister my opinion, and she went, Absolutely not. Do not go. Do not go into the United States during this time. Its not being patriotic. Its not being a good Canadian, Gurevitch told the Canadian Press. I just kind of disagree with her. The latter half of the NHL season saw scattered booing during The Star-Spangled Banner at games in Canada amid Trumps threat of tariffs and his comments about turning its northern neighbor into a 51st state. It has led to resentment and anger, even clouding Wayne Gretzkys legacy for some fans given his ties to Trump. Five Canadian teams  Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg and Edmonton  have made the NHL playoffs this year and the Canadiens opened the postseason Monday night against the Capitals in Washington. Gurevitch said he often travels to the U.S. to watch hockey or baseball, and while its still just the start of the playoffs, he says he may travel south to cheer in person if hes able. Id love the experience of going into Washington and chatting with the fans there and just building that bond and feeding off it and having pleasant banter. Its fun. Thats what its all about  connecting with people and enjoying the sport, Gurevitch said. 
        
     Sunil Peetush, another Canadiens devotee who has already been to the U.S. this year to see games, has been having second thoughts about American travel after his familys recent cruise that departed New Jersey last month. We just didnt feel right as Canadians. We felt like we were betraying our country, Peetush said, noting that going to Washington would feel even worse since it is the center of U.S. government. We have a cruise booked in August and its going to Alaska, and we havent really decided whether were going to do it or not. British Columbia Premier David Eby, reacting to a California campaign to re-engage Canadian tourists, said last week that Canadians need to keep the pressure up on the U.S. by buying local and avoiding travel there. In Alberta, Edmonton Oilers fan Jasen Reboh says hes a patriotic Canadian but doesnt think that would stop him from going to a U.S. game if his team advances. Reboh, a season-ticket holder who went stateside to watch three of the Oilers Stanley Cup matchups against the Florida Panthers last year, rejects the argument that he should avoid the country in order to exert economic pressure. Theres a lot of stuff thats currently happening in our country that I dont have a lot of control over, so if I was picking and choosing who deserves my money and who doesnt, I think thats a slippery slope, Reboh said. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/trump-canadian-fans-7158a5f83cef83d549b5ac7b3c1d4841,sports
"Towns scores 31, Brunson has 30 and Knicks beat Pistons 118-116 for a 2-1 lead in series","DETROIT (AP)  Karl-Anthony Towns was aggressive early and Jalen Brunson was effective late. Towns scored 11 of his 31 points in the first quarter and Brunson had 12 of his 30 in the fourth to help the New York Knicks hold on for a 118-116 win over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night to take a 2-1 lead in the first-round series. I thought the way we started the game was much better, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. And, we made timely plays down the stretch. Game 4 is on Sunday in Detroit. The Pistons have lost eight straight home playoff games since 2008, pulling within one of an NBA record set by Philadelphia from 1968 to 1971. When Detroit won at New York in Game 2, the franchise ended a league-record, 15-playoff game losing streak to take home-court advantage, but the Knicks snatched it back. Brunson, who won the NBAs Clutch Player of the Year award on Wednesday, made consecutive layups late in the game to give the Knicks a seven-point lead. Brunson made one of two free throws with 3.5 seconds left for a four-point lead after Detroits coaches, players and fans were screaming for an over-and-back violation to be called. If you catch the ball, have possession and put it down, to me, thats possession in the front court, Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. Brunson made another free throw with 0.5 seconds left and after missing the second intentionally, the Pistons were given the ball in front of their bench after the buzzer sounded prematurely. 
        
     It doesnt seem right to me, Thibodeau said. Its unfortunate. That should never happen in a playoff game. Detroit, though, didnt get a final shot off because Jalen Durens pass from in front of his teams bench went out of bounds on the other side of the court. Towns, a 7-foot center, made 4-of-8 3-pointers after combining to shoot 1 of 5 beyond the arc over the first two games. He bounced back, Thibodeau said. He can score a lot of different ways and he used his versatility to his strength. Detroits Cade Cunningham scored 24 points and had 11 assists, but missed 15 of 25 shots and had six turnovers. Tim Hardaway Jr. had 24 points, making a career playoff-high seven 3-pointers. Dennis Schroder scored 18 points and Duren had 16 for the Pistons. OG Anunoby scored 22 points and Mikal Bridges added 20 points for the Knicks. New York led 33-27 after an emotionally charged opening quarter and was ahead 66-53 at halftime. The Pistons pulled within one point twice in the third, but the Knicks went on another surge to take a 10-point lead into the final quarter and the cushion was comfortable enough to hold off Detroits attempts to rally. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-2025-knicks-pistons-1f319e6c52fa169e3ca5c1f9dc559575,sports
"Pistons center Isaiah Stewart misses another game with knee injury, sits out Game 3 against Knicks","DETROIT (AP)  Detroit Pistons center Isaiah Stewart is out for a second straight game against the New York Knicks. The Pistons ruled him out due to an injured right knee on Thursday night in Game 3 of the first-round series. New York did not have a player listed on its injury report. Stewart had two points, two blocks and five rebounds in 19 minutes of Game 1, which the Knicks won after going on a 21-0 run. He missed Game 2 and players such as Paul Reed filled in to help the Pistons win and snap an NBA-record, 15-playoff game losing streak that dated to 2008.  Stewart averaged six points and nearly six rebounds in the regular season, his fifth with the team, while providing some muscle for the teams physical brand of basketball. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/pistons-knicks-isaiah-stewart-cd94be6581e1b3034a2b5374e8f666d6,sports
Grizzlies guard Ja Morant exits playoff game vs Thunder with left hip contusion after hard fall,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)  Memphis guard Ja Morant was knocked out of the Grizzlies playoff game against Oklahoma City on Thursday night with a left hip injury after taking a hard fall under the basket late in the first half. Morant went down hard with just over three minutes remaining in the half and was ruled out for the remainder of the game early in the second half after not joining the team at the start of the third quarter. Luke Kennard took his place in the Memphis lineup. Without Morant in the lineup, the Thunder stormed back from a 29-point deficit and beat the Grizzlies 114-108 to take a 3-0 lead in the first-round playoff series. Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo said after the game that Morant will undergo further evaluation Friday and then well know more. Asked how much his absence affected the Grizzlies play in the second half, Iisalo replied: I would say quite drastically from the end result. But not only the energy, but also the execution. Memphis was on a fast break after a Thunder turnover. Scotty Pippen was driving to the basket when he dropped the ball off to Morant at the rim. Luguentz Dort, who was stumbling at the time, fell into Morant while he was in the air, sending the Morant crashing to the floor. After shooting the ensuing free throws, Morant went to the locker room with Memphis up 67-40. Morant was being helped to the locker room but returned  noticeably limping  to shoot the free throws. He missed both, but the ball went out of bounds, allowing Morant to leave the game. He took his jersey off as he was helped off the floor.  The play was reviewed for a flagrant foul, but was ruled a common foul.  Morant had 15 points and five assists when he left the game. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/thunder-grizzlies-ja-morant-1cade82e540499a4a65c5b2e833608b3,sports
Karl-Anthony Towns and the Knicks bounce back to beat Pistons and take 2-1 lead in 1st-round series,"DETROIT (AP)  The New York Knicks left no doubt about their plan for Game 3 in the opening minutes against the Detroit Pistons. Karl-Anthony Towns took his teams first shot, made his first of four 3-pointers and scored five points in the opening minutes to start an 11-point quarter  more than he had in all of Game 2. He finished with 31 points, eight rebounds and two blocked shots to lead the Knicks to a 118-116 victory that gave them a 2-1 lead in the first-round series on Thursday night. He set the tone offensively for us, and defensively as well, All-Star guard Jalen Brunson said. Thats the KAT we know. Brunson scored 12 in the fourth quarter to finish with 30 points. But it was Towns fast start that helped New York play from ahead for most of the night. I just got opportunities to do things on the offensive end, he said. We found a way in transition to get me some good looks, and I was able to capitalize of off that to start the night off. If Detroit does not win Game 4 on Sunday, it might have a lot of nights off this spring. Towns was coming off a 10-point performance in Game 2, which was one of the reasons the Pistons won in New York to even the series. Hes unfazed, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. Hes been around. Hes got a lot of confidence. He bounced back. He can score a lot of different ways and he used his versatility to his strength. 
        
     Detroit tried to slow the 7-foot center down with Jalen Duren, Tobias Harris and others without much success. We knew he was going to be aggressive and thats how he came out, Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. Towns played the way the Knicks hoped he would in the playoffs after acquiring him last October from Minnesota in a three-team trade. His toughness, physical and mental, was also an asset against the ready-to-rumble Pistons. In the final minute of the quarter, New Yorks Mitchell Robinson and Detroits Paul Reed were engaged with each other and Towns intervened and pushed Reed, who had to be held back from retaliating. We just came to fight and give ourselves the best chance to win, Towns said. We had to match their physicality, so I thought we did a good job of that.  ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/knicks-karl-anthony-towns-3c7afa0a85d68a6611f4e930484de00a,sports
"Penguins GM Kyle Dubas wont put a timeline on return to contention, but believes the worst is over","CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP, Pa. (AP)  The standings said the Pittsburgh Penguins took a step back this season. At times, far too many, particularly early in the year, the on-ice product did, too. And while another sublime performance by the seemingly ageless Sidney Crosby couldnt stop the Penguins from missing the playoffs for a third straight year, general manager Kyle Dubas believes the worst is behind his club as it tries to navigate the tricky and often painful transition from one successful era to what he hopes is the next. While there remains plenty of work to be done at the NHL level over another exceedingly long summer, Dubas thinks the organization as a whole is in a better place than it March 2024, when the trade of popular winger Jake Guentzel to Carolina served as an emotional gut punch to both the fan base and Guentzels former teammates. It was a move Dubas deemed a necessary part of the process in an effort to restore a prospect pool decimated by years of trading away picks in hopes of extending a near two-decade run of excellence that included three Stanley Cups. The pace of prospect and pick acquisition has only picked up over the last 14 months. The Penguins have a whopping 30 selections over the next three NHL drafts and their minor league teams are contending. Dubas believes its only a matter of time before that success cascades up to Pittsburgh. Im more optimistic going into next year than I was organizationally (last year), Dubas said Monday. The results are going to be what theyre going to be, but I feel were closer to where we want to get back to now than last year. 
        
     The Penguins finished 11 points out of a playoff spot, their worst since Crosbys rookie year nearly two decades ago. Only Chicago and San Jose gave up more goals and only three teams had fewer wins in regulation. There are plenty of areas that need to be addressed by the time Pittsburgh reports for training camp in September. The goaltending tandem of Tristan Jarry and Alex Nedeljkovic ranked among the worst in the league. Jarry, a two-time All-Star, endured a demotion to the American Hockey League in January and Nedeljkovic couldnt seize the opportunity to establish himself as a bona fide No. 1. Yet given Jarrys contract carries more than a $5 million cap hit, dont expect teams to call Dubas to offer a lifeline. Dubas has already told both goaltenders they will be competing for a job when camp arrives, with the idea they will be pushed by Joel Blomqvist and maybe even Sergei Murashov, who turned 21 earlier this month. If you look at every metric measuring performance, we also conceded a lot defensively in terms of what was expected to be given up, but we also allowed more than expected, Dubas said. So thats a really poor combination. Both need to be rectified. Better play in front of them would help. Pittsburghs defensemen struggled to make any sort of impact. Three-time Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson would mix flashes of brilliance with extended periods of play where he too frequently gambled and lost, symbolic of a unit often left whoever was in net in a tough spot. Dubas described the teams approach to defense an organizational matter, one that he will sort out with longtime head coach Mike Sullivan and his staff in the coming weeks. Sullivan, the second longest-tenured coach in the NHL behind Tampa Bays Jon Cooper, is expected to return for what would be his 10th full season with Pittsburgh. Many coaches, no matter their resume, dont stick around after three straight playoff misses. Yet Sullivan remains committed to trying to help the club navigate its retooling to the finish. Theres always the point that very few coaches who are in (Sullivans) realm often want to see a team through this, Dubas said. But hes been very open about this (as) what he wants to do so well just continue to reaffirm that and as long as hes on that side of it, we will roll with that. Dubas declined to offer any sort of timeline on when he expects the Penguins to return to the NHLs elite, only that he remains committed to building Pittsburgh into a long-term winner rather than try to patch the roster together in hopes of sneaking into the postseason. There are no plans to add any more 30-somethings to a roster that began the season as the NHLs oldest. The Penguins do have more salary cap space than theyve enjoyed in quite some times, and theres a very real chance Dubas turns some of that draft capital into NHL players in their early-to-mid 20s who currently work elsewhere. The only real concession Dubas has made in terms of when he sees Pittsburgh becoming a legitimate Stanley Cup threat is before Crosby retires. The future Hall of Famer turns 38 in August, though he shows little signs of slowing down and has two years left on the extension he signed last September. Crosby has admitted its been difficult at times to endure the franchises roughest patch since the early 2000s. Dubas expects Crosby to be grumpy until the Penguins get back to where they have been for most of Crosbys career. (Were) trying to build something that can contain itself for a long time, he said. Getting those younger players who are going to be a part of that core around Sid (is important). Him helping them and them helping him is really what the focus is. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/pittsburgh-penguins-sidney-crosby-7cfaa40be9c9ddfe50ca52d7d675939f,sports
"Something broke for the Rangers, Shesterkin says after missing the playoffs and coach being fired","TARRYTOWN, N.Y. (AP)  A year ago, the New York Rangers were starting a playoff run to the Eastern Conference final and did not clean out their lockers until June, after losing to eventual Stanley Cup champion Florida. It was far different this time around, when players met with reporters Monday in the aftermath of missing the playoffs and coach Peter Laviolette getting fired over the weekend. After a season that included trading away captain Jacob Trouba and others who played important roles in previous years, there werent many concrete explanations for the teams drop to 39 wins and 85 points, including a midseason 4-15-0 swoon that essentially cost them a chance of getting in as a wild card. Franchise goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who had the worst season of his six-year NHL career, losing 34 of his 61 starts with a 2.86 goals-against average and .905 save percentage, feels like he and his teammates never established the same rhythm they did in 2023-24. In my mind, something broke during the season and went the other way. We couldnt handle it, said Shesterkin, who next season is starting an eight-year, $92 million contract that makes him the highest-paid goalie in league history. Probably not too much confidence. Shesterkin was far from the only problem. No. 1 center Mika Zibanejad and defensemen Adam Fox and KAndre Miller struggled, Laviolette paid the price and the Rangers will soon have their fourth coach since 2021. 
        
     We had long stretches of games in which we didnt perform well, said Fox, whose 61 points were his fewest since the pandemic-shortened 2021 season. If we did our job, the coach would still be here. Zibanejads production also dipped to 20 goals and 42 assists for 62 points, also his fewest since 21. Overall, I just think we just didnt get to the level of play we needed to get to, said Zibanejad, who has five years left on his contract with an annual salary cap hit of $8.5 million. There was a lot of I would say noise around our team this year. Im not saying that it is the cause of it. We didnt have the calmness we had the year before. Veteran Chris Kreider said he grappled with back issues, a bout of vertigo and a hand injury, but the 33-year-old forward who has spent his entire career with New York expressed eagerness to return next season. This is home for me. This is the organization that gave me an opportunity to live out my dream, said Kreider, a first-round draft pick by the Rangers in 2009 who has two years left on his contract. Ive developed so many relationships and spent so much time in this area. Obviously, this is where I want to be. This is the group  in whatever fashion  I want to help win hockey games. Kreider also alluded to off-ice situations that made it a tumultuous last 10 months around the organization. Gritty forward Barclay Goodrow was put on waivers last summer and claimed by rebuilding San Jose, and after drawn-out public drama, Trouba was traded to Anaheim in December. Its part of professional sports, but, obviously, at a certain point it becomes somewhat of a distraction, Kreider said. Two guys that were massive leaders for us and a big part of our room  it was certainly challenging. The Rangers vaunted power play that ranked third in the league in 23-24 plummeted to 28th of 32 teams this past season, which leading scorer Artemi Panarin blamed for missing the playoffs despite the same core in place. This year was hard, Panarin said. If our power play worked better, we make the playoffs. NOTE: Defenseman Braden Schneider had a sling on his right arm and said he had surgery to repair a torn labrum in that shoulder. Schneider said he expects to be fully healthy for training camp. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL",https://apnews.com/article/rangers-miss-nhl-playoffs-50d60f70f0d880365874d148baa69c1c,sports
"Avalanche captain Landeskog activated from injured list, but didnt play in Game 2 loss to Stars","DALLAS (AP)  The Colorado Avalanche activated captain Gabriel Landeskog off injured reserve, but again delayed his much-anticipated return when he was scratched from playing Game 2 of their first-round series against the Dallas Stars on Monday night. Landeskog, who hasnt played in nearly three years, was the first Avalanche skater to take the ice for pregame warmups after being activated earlier in the day. But when the roster report was released after that, he was a scratch.  Gabe wanted to like get a groove and take warmup tonight, get in the room and like be part of it, so thats why I did that, coach Jared Bednar said after the Avalanche lost 4-3 in overtime. It has been more than 1,000 days since the 32-year-old forward last played for the Avalanche on June 26, 2022, when they beat Tampa Bay 2-1 in Game 6 to clinch the Stanley Cup. The series switches to Denver for Game 3 on Wednesday night. A chronic right knee injury that led to two surgeries kept him off the ice through multiple attempts to get back.  Landeskog did a two-game conditioning stint with the American Hockey Leagues Colorado Eagles earlier this month to take another step forward in the process. He had practiced with the Avalanche leading up to their opener in the NHL playoffs. Having Landeskog could be boost for the Avalanche, who won the series opener 5-1 against the short-handed Stars. Dallas is without top defenseman Miro Heiskanen after his knee surgery and leading goal-scorer Jason Robertson, who was injured in the final game of the regular season. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/avalanche-gabriel-landeskog-bb2def1d7c835a49e0c1aeefcf71b3d8,sports
Panthers say Matthew Tkachuks status for Game 1 against Tampa Bay wont be decided until Tuesday,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)  Matthew Tkachuk will skate Tuesday morning. Whether hell play for the Florida Panthers in their playoff opener on Tuesday night is anyones guess. Tkachuk  who hasnt played for the Panthers since Feb. 8 and hasnt played any games since the 4 Nations Face-Off two months ago because of a lower-body injury  went through practice on Monday with the reigning Stanley Cup champions, his second on-ice workout in a three-day span. But the Panthers want to see how he gets through morning skate on Tuesday before deciding whether he plays in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference first-round series at Tampa Bay that night. Hes got to get through the morning skate tomorrow, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said after Mondays practice. Were still monitoring the recovery off the practice. So, he was out early before we went, went through a whole practice, stayed until the end. Well see how he feels coming back in tomorrow. And if he feels good and he gets through that morning skate and everybodys thumbs-up, then hell go. Tkachuk got hurt in the second game of the 4 Nations event, then tried to play in the final against Canada but didnt take any shifts for the third period or overtime of that contest. The Panthers placed Tkachuk on long-term injured reserve. He missed the teams final 25 games of the regular season, yet still finished with 22 goals, 35 assists and 57 points  third-most on the team in all three categories. He was also second on the Panthers this season with 11 power-play goals. 
        
     It sounds like the decision is going to be whether hes ready for Game 1 or Game 2. Maurice noted that two more days  the game between the series opener and Thursdays second game  might be useful. Were close enough now that you also put yourself in that situation where youd consider two more days, if you felt you were right there, Maurice said. Well just let the doctors and Matthew tell us where hes at and then well go from there. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",https://apnews.com/article/matthew-tkachuk-panthers-stanley-cup-playoffs-e5ee25fcd9d8e35eadd5e8e284e80e7e,sports
Leonard and Harden lead Clippers to easy 117-83 win over Jokic and Nuggets for a 2-1 series lead,"INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP)  After two close games to open the playoffs, the Los Angeles Clippers came home and had their way with the Denver Nuggets. Kawhi Leonard had 21 points and 11 rebounds in a 117-83 victory Thursday night that gave the Clippers a 2-1 lead in the first-round series. It aint over because we had a blowout, Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. We got to come and validate that. James Harden and Norman Powell added 20 points apiece in the first playoff game at the new Intuit Dome, where Clippers superfans sitting in The Wall section closest to Denvers bench wore horse hats mocking Jokics love of the animal. It was crackin, it was loud. Just how I expected it to be, Harden said. Thats one of the reasons why we jumped out to a huge lead. After the teams split the first two games in Denver  a pair of nail-biters decided by a combined five points  this one wasnt close after the first quarter. Both teams cleared their benches in the final 4 1/2 minutes. The first two games were very competitive. This game was not, interim Nuggets coach David Adelman said. But you can come back Saturday and you can right a lot of wrongs. Game 4 is Saturday at the flashy and tech-heavy Inglewood arena, the dream creation of Clippers billionaire owner Steve Ballmer. He animatedly clapped his hands and pumped his fist from his seat near his teams bench. 
        
     Jokic led the Nuggets with 23 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists for his second triple-double of the series. Jamal Murray also had 23 points. Bottom line, this was not good enough. This was not our standard in any way, Adelman said. Defensively, we have to meet them much better than we did tonight and I expect we will. Denver led by seven early before the Clippers took a 20-point lead in the second quarter and tightened up their defense. The Clippers outscored the Nuggets 23-2 over the end of the first quarter and start of the second, with Harden scoring 11 points.  Murray and Jokic combined to score 16 points in the third, when the Nuggets trailed 90-70.  The Clippers hit 18 3-pointers to seven for Denver. They controlled the boards, 48-38, and their bench outscored the Nuggets reserves, 31-6. Everybody contributed. It was a great game for us all, Leonard said. Denvers a great team. Theyve bene here before. We got to still stay focused and play together and come out with a great mindset Saturday. Denvers Russell Westbrook, who missed 4 of 5 from long range, left the game with left foot inflammation in the second half. Michael Porter Jr., who sprained his left shoulder in Game 2, was limited to seven points and six rebounds. There were reminders of the Clippers old Lob City era in their new building. Former Clipper Chris Paul was in the stands along with Patrick Beverley wearing a Zubac jersey, while DeAndre Jordan played five minutes for the Nuggets. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-2025-nuggets-clippers-adb6c1b6177007eb1634fe17b8762ecf,sports
"Thunder rally from 29 points down after Morant leaves with injury, top Grizzlies for 3-0 series lead","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)  Chet Holmgren scored all but one of his 24 points in the second half and the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 29-point deficit after Ja Morant left the game with a hip injury and beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-108 on Thursday night for a 3-0 series lead. Morant was hurt with just over three minutes left in the first half and Memphis leading 67-40. The Grizzlies led by 26 at halftime. The 29-point comeback was the second-largest in an NBA postseason game since play-by-play data began being recorded in the 1996-97 season. The only one bigger: A comeback from 31 points down by the Los Angeles Clippers against Golden State on April 15, 2019. The top-seeded Thunder, who won Game 1 131-80 in the fifth-biggest margin of victory in NBA postseason history, didnt even have a lead in this one until the fourth quarter. Now, they can close out the series Saturday. I just through out of halftime, we kind of reconnected to who we are. We were very out of character in the first half, Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points for Oklahoma City and Jalen Williams added 26, splitting a pair of free throws with 1:20 left to give the Thunder their first lead. Scotty Pippen scored 28 points, two short of his career high, to lead Memphis. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 22 points as Memphis saw its substantial lead evaporate in the second half.  
        
     Understanding leads, Williams said. Youre never too far ahead, and youre never too far behind. They built a 29-point lead in a half, so we felt like all we had to do was build our own 29-point lead, GIlgeous-Alexander said.  Morant went down hard under the basket with just over three minutes remaining in the first half and was ruled out for the remainder of the game early in the second half with a left hip contusion.  Memphis was on a fast break after a Thunder turnover. Pippen was driving to the basket when he dropped the ball off to Morant at the rim. Luguentz Dort, who was stumbling at the time, fell into Morant while he was in the air, sending the Morant crashing to the floor. The play was reviewed for a flagrant foul, but was ruled a common foul. Morant had 15 points and five assists. Memphis carried a 77-51 lead into the break. But the Thunder used a 36-18 scoring edge in the third quarter to claw back, I think it is very hard to describe to anyone who hasnt been in that situation, Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo said. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-2025-thunder-grizzlies-9d15deb145b5b7152a0b5e0d84822f0b,sports
"Saturdays NBA games: Cavaliers-Heat, Thunder-Grizzlies, Nuggets-Clippers and Rockets-Warriors","Oklahoma City has a chance to secure its spot in Round 2. Cleveland and the Los Angeles Clippers can get to the doorstep of the second round. And the Houston-Golden State winner is going to have control of their matchup. Those are the headlines going into a quadruple-header of NBA playoff games on Saturday: Oklahoma City can sweep its series with a win at Memphis, Cleveland can take a 3-0 lead over Miami, the Clippers will aim for a 3-1 edge when they host Denver and the nightcap is a Rockets-Warriors matchup in San Francisco with those teams tied at a game apiece. And there are some injury worries, particularly for Memphis and Golden State. Grizzlies guard Ja Morant took a bad fall that knocked him out of Game 3 against Oklahoma City with a bruised hip  and helped contribute to the Thunder rallying from a 29-point deficit  while Warriors forward Jimmy Butler also is dealing with the aftereffects of a fall that knocked him out of Game 2 in Houston. I never want to see anybody get hurt. I hope hes OK, Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said of Morant. You want everybody to be at full strength. Hes a great competitor. He was playing great. Obviously, that had something to do with the game as well. Itd be wrong of me not to acknowledge that. The Thunder, since relocating to Oklahoma City, were 0-95 in games where they trailed by at least 27 points  until Thursday. Never surprised. Always impressed, Daigneault said. They just feel an unbelievable responsibility to one another. 
        
     When/Where to Watch: Game 3, 1 p.m. EDT (TNT) Series: Cavaliers lead, 2-0. BetMGM Sportsbook: Cavaliers by 6.5. What to Know: Miami did a lot of things right in Game 2  teams in playoff games were 76-0 all-time when scoring at least 112 points, making 16 3s, shooting 50% or better from the field and holding their opponent to under 50% shooting. The Heat did all that and lost Game 2 anyway, simply because of Clevelands barrage of 3-pointers and Donovan Mitchells ability to make huge plays down the stretch to fend off a Miami run. The Heat say Game 3 is a must-win, so expect a big push to open the game. Itll be a good test for Cleveland, which was great on the road all year, to see how it handles a playoff road atmosphere. When/Where to Watch: Game 4, 3:30 p.m. EDT (TNT) Series: Thunder lead, 3-0. BetMGM Sportsbook: Thunder by 14.5. What to Know: Oklahoma City will have a chance to be the first team to reach Round 2 of the playoffs, plus can finish off a first-round sweep for the second consecutive year after ousting New Orleans 4-0 last season. The 14.5-point spread, assuming it doesnt move before game time, would be the largest according to BetMGM Sportsbook for any road team in a playoff game over the last decade. (Excluding bubble games, the biggest road favorites in the postseason since 2012 were San Antonio at Memphis in 2016 and Milwaukee at Detroit in 2019. Both were 12.5-point favorites and both covered). The challenge for Memphis will be how to fight back after losing a 29-point lead in Game 3. When/Where to Watch: Game 4, 6 p.m. EDT (TNT) Series: Clippers lead, 2-1. BetMGM Sportsbook: Clippers by 5.5. What to Know: The Clippers trailed 26-19 after 9 minutes of Game 1  and outscored the Nuggets 98-57 the rest of the way. Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray had 37 of those final 57 points for Denver while their teammates combined to shoot 7-for-37 and score only 20 points in those 39 minutes. That is all an obvious credit to the Clippers defense, which has been an overlooked story all season. Another boost for the Clippers out of that game was how Kawhi Leonard didnt have to log big minutes; he played only 34. Denver has to get some shooting going in Game 4, after getting outscored 54-21 on 3-pointers in Game 3. When/Where to Watch: Game 3, 8:30 p.m. EDT (ABC) Series: Tied, 1-1. BetMGM Sportsbook: Warriors by 2.5. What to Know: Golden State forward Jimmy Butlers injury status is the big question going into Game 3. And if he plays, can he be effective? The Warriors still have the upper hand in the series after getting a split of Games 1 and 2 in Houston and now come home to Chase Center  where they are 16-4 in playoff and play-in games. The Rockets are only 2-8 in that building, the third-worst record among Western Conference teams, ahead of only Utah (2-9) and Portland (1-9). Houston has to love what it has done defensively so far in the series, holding the Warriors to 95 and 94 points in the first two matches. Thats a clear trend, with the Warriors being held under 100 points in five of their last six games against the Rockets. The combined numbers from those games: Rockets 582, Warriors 579, and each team going 3-3. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-2025-c05c906efdb67d70c4049bc766cc9ae8,sports
Brooks to critics calling Thompson dirty for foul on Butler: The dirty player is Draymond,"HOUSTON (AP)  Some have questioned whether Houstons Amen Thompson is a dirty player after Warriors star Jimmy Butler was injured in a scary fall during Game 2 when the Rockets guard took out the legs of the Golden State forward on a hard foul. Thompsons teammate, Dillon Brooks, had other thoughts on the subject when asked about it Friday ahead of Saturdays Game 3. No, I think the dirty player is Draymond (Green), giving him a little push as regular basketball players do, Brooks said. And Jimmys fighting in the air for a rebound and stuff happens. Amens not a dirty player. He has (nothing) to do with being a dirty player. Butler was listed as questionable Friday, a day ahead of the game at Chase Center. An MRI exam revealed he injured his pelvis and has a deep gluteal muscle contusion, the team said. Butler sustained a pelvic contusion in the 109-94 loss that tied the first round series at 1-1. Green was named the winner of the 2024-25 NBA Hustle Award on Friday. Brooks said the Rockets must keep their focus on Game 3 and not be concerned about what people are saying about them. Were not worried about that, he said. Were on to the next game and we hope Jimmy can get better. Golden State coach Steve Kerr said after the game that he doesnt believe Thompson intended to hurt Butler. We didnt think there was anything wrong with the play, Kerr said. It was just one of those plays. 
        
     When told Friday that Brooks called Green dirty, Kerr said: Dillon said that? Interesting. Then with Memphis three years ago, Brooks Flagrant 2 foul on Gary Payton II during Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals of the Warriors championship run in 2022 fractured Paytons elbow. He returned for Game 2 of Golden States six-game NBA Finals victory over Boston. Houston coach Ime Udoka weighed in on the play Friday. Its obvious it wasnt intentional, he said. You look at all the bodies in between and him getting bumped and tripped and the way he fell. You dont fall into somebody face first on purpose. Wednesdays game became a bit chippy with players from both teams getting technical fouls in the second half and Houstons Jalen Green receiving a flagrant foul when he flailed an arm into Draymond Greens face. Amens obviously not a dirty player, Udoka said. Theres a difference between aggressive, physical play and being dirty and you could question some of their things as well on their on their end. ___ AP Sports Writer Janie McCauley in San Francisco contributed to this story. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",https://apnews.com/article/rockets-warriors-brooks-green-butler-a404f8fb640a4cd48c978584a3a239a0,sports
Keith Mitchell settles for a 5-way tie for the lead at Valspar Championship,"PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP)  Keith Mitchell thrived in a tough wind on a tough Copperhead course at Innisbrook on Thursday until he dropped two shots late in his round and had to settle for a 4-under 67 and a five-way share of the lead in the Valspar Championship. The gusts were in the 30 mph range at times. Rain pelted the players in the afternoon during a brief shower. And the course already has a reputation as one of the best tests on the PGA Tour. For Mitchell, it was all about timing. He was expecting his share of bogeys on a day like this. It just stung a little more to be at 6 under, in the fairway on the par-5 fifth just 90 yards from the hole, and have to settle for a 67. That dropped him into a share of the lead with Stephan Jaeger, Jacob Bridgeman, Ricky Castillo and Sami Valimaki. Only 21 players broke 70 with the potential of another, Kevin Velo, who was 2 under through 17 holes when play was suspended by darkness. Velo can appreciate what Mitchell felt. He was bogey-free, tied for the lead, until his day ended with back-to-back bogeys. Mitchell had a birdie chance from just inside 50 feet on the par-3 eighth, his 17th of the day, when he left it 10 feet short and three-putted for bogey. He then rode a strong wind into the right rough on the uphill ninth, went just over the back and finished with a bogey. Its crazy to say you left some out there when its windy, Mitchell said. I dont want to say that because youre going to make mistakes, youre going to hit shots that you wish you could have over or putts that you had over. 
        
     But you take those two (bogeys) out of the round and sprinkle them somewhere else (and) Im feeling good. Xander Schauffele showed some improvement in his third straight tournament since being away two months with a rib injury. He dropped a few shots like everyone else  three of his four bogeys on the par 3s  and opened with a 70. Justin Thomas went out in 40 in the afternoon and played hard to the end, bogey-free on the back nine to salvage a 73. That was one shot better than Jordan Spieth, who won at Innisbrook 10 years ago during his road to a Masters green jacket. Spieth hit only two fairways through 13 holes until hitting his last five in regulation. He three-putted from 18 feet for bogey on the 17th and made a 5-foot birdie on the 18th for 74. Mitchell has mixed feelings about Innisbrook, a course he loves but one that gives him bad memories. He had a two-shot lead going into the final round a year ago before a wild final round when he didnt make birdie until the 14th hole and shot 77. I still think about it, Mitchell said. Its still definitely in the back of my mind and I want it to stay there for hopefully for the rest of my career to just motivate me to remember what it feels like when you let those kind of nerves get in your way. A round like today feels like the opposite of that. The others at 67 rallied late. Jaeger, who next week defends his title in the Houston Open, birdied his last two holes. Bridgeman started bogey-bogey and rallied with a 32 on the front nine, starting with an eagle on the par-5 opening hole. Trouble was always lurking, though. Sahith Theegala was at 4 under after running off five birdies in a six-hole stretch on the back nine. He finished with a pair of three-putt bogeys, one from 18 feet at No. 17, the other from about 60 feet down the ridge on the 18th, and shot 69. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/keith-mitchell-jaeger-valspar-championship-innisbrook-schauffele-73cd117d50234c6640b1ebe71cf938e5,sports
Viktor Hovland part of 3-way tie for the lead at a crowded Valspar Championship,"PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP)  Viktor Hovland was steady amid a wild Saturday of charges and collapses at the Valspar Championship, leaving him in a three-way tie for the lead at Innisbrook with two dozen players still very much in the mix. Jacob Bridgeman showed plenty of mettle in his first time as the 36-hole leader, falling four shots behind at the turn and rallying for a 1-under 70 to share the lead with Hovland (69) and Nico Echavarria (66). They were at 7-under 206 with seemingly everyone on their heels. That includes Justin Thomas, who left on Friday hopeful he would make the cut. He shot 30 on the back nine for a 65, his lowest round ever on the Copperhead course at Innisbrook, to finish two behind. Jordan Spieth was entertaining as ever, twice making birdie from deep in the woods, and along with missing a pair of short par putts, and having to settle for a 67. He still was only four shots behind going into a Sunday in which 23 players were separated by four shots. Byeong Hun An was the only player to reach 9 under with a birdie on the 11th hole, only to make five bogeys over the final seven holes for a 72. Even so, he was only three back. Hovland came into the week in search of his swing, returning to another coach and being willing to take as much time as he needed to figure out where the ball is going. Its working out in his favor so far. Its fun to be in contention, but it is a little bit more stressful when you dont feel super comfortable over the ball, Hovland said. But man, its fun to see some putts go in and still see the ball end up close to the hole and put some good scores up there. 
        
     Echavarria, who won in Japan last fall for his second PGA Tour title, finished well ahead of the final groups and played bogey-free for his 66, remarkably making birdie on all three of the par 3s on the back nine. The Colombian didnt expect to have a share of the lead when he finished, though he knew he would at least have a chance. This is a golf course where you dont have to be one off the lead starting to get the leaders, he said. We have seen that its a hard golf course. You have to drive your ball very well out here. You have to hit the greens. Its tough around the greens. So were going to have a chance tomorrow having a good round. Most impressive was Bridgeman, a second-year player who began the third round by missing a 3-foot par putt. He also took two straight bogeys to finish the front nine and was falling behind. But then he hit wedge to 3 feet for birdie on the 10th and worked his way back. At one point, Bridgeman had seven straight holes without a par. I was just head down and grind the best I could, Bridgeman said. I wasnt hitting it great. I wasnt flustered, I wasnt really freaking out. But I knew if I could get the ball in the fairway I would be fine. He said after the birdie on 10 his caddie G.W. Cable slapped him on the behind and told him, Lets go. And I kept it up, Bridgeman said. Thomas and Spieth teed off some five hours before the leaders, longtime friends who took turns posting birdies. Thomas felt frustrated not to make up much ground until he holed an eagle putt from just inside 30 feet on the par-5 11th hole and was on his way. Thomas birdied the next three holes and at one point was one shot behind. We got on a little four-hole run there and that can be the difference of sparking an entire week or not, Thomas said. So hopefully thats the one that sparks the week. Ricky Castillo had a 68 and was one shot behind. Thomas and Shane Lowry (70) were among five players at 5-under 208, with An and Billy Horschel (69) in the large group another shot behind. Lucas Glover (69) was part of the group with Spieth at four behind. The leaderboard is stacked. Theres probably like 25 guys  30 guys maybe  that can still win this golf tournament, said Jeremy Paul of Germany, who shot 70 and was in the group two shots behind. Trying to put a good round together and see where it puts me. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/valspar-championship-bridgeman-hovland-thomas-innisbrook-148f864f139e50b353009abb6a9668f3,sports
Lynx force Game 5 of WNBA Finals on Carletons free throws to beat Liberty 82-80,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  With their season on the line, the Minnesota Lynx did just enough to stave off elimination and force a decisive Game 5 of the WNBA Finals. Bridget Carleton made two free throws with 2 seconds left, and the Lynx beat the New York Liberty 82-80 on Friday night. The teams will meet Sunday night in New York in the first Game 5 of the Finals since 2019, when Washington topped Connecticut. Last 40 minutes of the season, it could be anywhere, really, it doesnt matter. Were going to be out there together going to war and Im pumped, said Kayla McBride, who led the Lynx with 19 points. Courtney Williams added 15 points for Minnesota, which forced Liberty stars Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu into poor shooting nights. Ionescus heave at the buzzer didnt hit the rim. I think were excited, Napheesa Collier said. Its a Game 5 of the Finals. We have to go out and execute. Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve is no stranger to winner-take-all games. She coached Minnesota in three straight ones from 2015-17, winning two. I dont think about the other ones, Reeve said. I feel very blessed in my career to have a chance to been a part of so many. I havent won them all. ... What Im thrilled about is that this group gets to experience the Game 5. Unlike the first three games of the series, when one of the teams built a double-digit lead, this one was tight throughout. There were 14 lead changes and 13 ties, and neither team led by more than six. 
        
     Its a close-out game. Their backs are against the wall and we are trying to win, said Jonquel Jones, who led New York with 21 points. It was going to be that type of game tonight where we are both trying to claw and both teams are trying to figure out whatever to do to get over the hump. With the game tied at 80-all with 18 seconds left, Williams dribbled to run the clock down and missed a jumper with a few seconds left. Carleton got the rebound in the lane and was fouled by Ionescu. She got the shot off and missed it perfectly for me, Carleton said. We talked about it after. She wanted to get it high and off the rim. The 27-year-old Canadian calmly made both free throws, and Ionescu was unable to duplicate her heroics in Game 3, when she made a 28-footer with 1 second left to give the Liberty a 2-1 series lead. I was pretty confident. Im a confident free-throw shooter, Carleton said. Leonie Fiebich added 19 for New York. Stewart, who scored 30 points in Game 3, had 11 points on 5-of-20 shooting, and Ionescu was 5 of 16 from the floor and scored 10. Minnesota stands one victory away from a record fifth WNBA title, which would break a tie with the Houston Comets and Seattle Storm. The Liberty are looking for their first title and have lost in the Finals five times. The team was one of the original eight franchises when the league began in 1997 and is the only one left of that group not to have won it all. New York lost to Las Vegas in last seasons Finals. Friday night marked the one-year anniversary of the Game 4 clincher last season for the Aces. The Lynx reached the Finals for the first time since 2017, when they won the last of four championships in seven years. Minnesota built a 77-72 lead with 3:14 left on Carletons 3-pointer before New York scored eight of the next 11 points, including a three-point play by Jones with 1:10 left that tied it at 80. Both teams had chances before Carletons free throws. McBride missed a layup with 56 seconds left, but the Lynx forced a shot-clock violation on the other end when Stewarts shot in the lane missed with 18 seconds left. We wanted to get it done tonight. But like (coach) Sandy (Brondello) said, our fans are like no other, and to be able to go into our environment on Sunday, know they have our backs, Stewart said. So whenever there are tough situations, whenever were fighting through all of this adversity, we know we have the crowd behind us. Thats just going to continue to motivate us. Yeah, cant wait for Sunday. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wnba-finals-liberty-lynx-score-a09c2f86b6172dfe2e158234d0dee1e9,sports
Jacob Bridgeman leads Valspar. Hovland goes in search of his swing and finds himself in contention,"PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP)  Viktor Hovland is searching for his swing and found himself in contention Friday at the Valspar Championship, where Jacob Bridgeman has a one-shot lead and a host of others were right behind going into the weekend at Innisbrook. Bridgeman was among several players atop the leaderboard on an unseasonably chilly day until the Copperhead course bit back at some point. He had a two-shot lead until missing a par putt from 4 feet on the 18th hole. That gave him a 2-under 69. Bridgeman was at 6-under 136. Hovland (67), Byeong Hun An (67) and Ryo Hisatsune (66) were one shot back, with a large group at 4-under 138 that included Shane Lowry and Xander Schauffele, who extended without stress his consecutive streak to 60. The surprise was Hovland, which in itself is a surprise considering he won the FedEx Cup two years ago and despite some swing issues still ended last year at No. 8 in the world. Hovland cares about the how more than the how many in golf, and the Norwegian star is willing to search for answers how no matter his scores. The latest search has been most frustrating, evident by the revolving door of coaches. He has gone back a second time to Grant Waite. He will be in the final group Saturday. How far along he is in the process is a mystery even to him. I still dont exactly know where the balls going to start and curve and all that stuff, Hovland said. But if youre hitting solid shots, thats a good start, especially out here when the wind is starting to blow. ... Still doesnt feel quite that great, but at least its improvement. 
        
     He shot 80 in the opening round of The Players Championship, so theres that. This is the first time Hovland has made a 36-hole cut since the Scottish Open last July. Other tournaments were signature events or FedEx Cup playoff events that have no cut. He has played well at times, such as his runner-up finish in the playoff opener last year. He wants to see good shots and then good results. Hell get the occasional good result, and the search continues. You just wake up every day and you stand over the ball, and you just expect the ball to start in that direction and go that direction and end up somewhere close to the hole, Hovland said. Then it starts to not do that, its pretty frustrating. You start thinking things youve never thought before. In front of him at Innisbrook is an opportunity, along with plenty of company. Lowry had a torrid start in cold weather with six birdies on the back nine for a 67, only to finish with seven pars and two bogeys for a 69. Even so, he was two behind along with Schauffele, Kevin Velo (70) and Jeremy Paul of Germany (69). I played that nine holes pretty flawlessly. Didnt really miss many shots, Lowry said. Unfortunately, I wasnt as good on the other nine. But I think 4-under on a day like today, if you had given me that in the locker room this morning I would have taken it. Schauffele has made the cut on the number the last two weeks, his first competition in two months because of a rib injury. He also has shot rounds of 81 and 77 since his return, making his realize the return was a lot harder than he imagined. More than making the cut, his hopes for Innisbrook was to be in touch with the lead. That he is, only two behind and a chance to feel a little weekend pressure for the first time in months. This is one of those places where it can get away from you quick or you can kind of hang in there and your name will be up there on Sunday late in the day, Schauffele said. So Im just trying to play golf. There was plenty of drama on the cut line, which fell at 2-over 144. Among those barely making it was Adam Scott, who birdied two of his last three holes to make it on the number. Then again, Scott and 12 other players would have missed the cut if not for Neal Shipley. He needed par on the 18th hole in the last group for the cut to stay at 1 over. Shipley found a bunker off the tee and missed a 15-footer for par. The difference between last place and Bridgeman was only eight shots.  ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",https://apnews.com/article/bridgeman-valspar-championship-hovland-schauffele-innisbrook-04774924a44786d0bd83c04e340278bd,sports
Dallas Wings fire coach Latricia Trammell after 2 seasons,"The Dallas Wings fired coach Latricia Trammell on Friday. Trammell went 31-49 in two seasons with the Dallas Wings, including 2-3 in playoff appearances. This past season the team went 9-31 and missed the WNBA postseason for the first time since 2020. After an extensive review of our basketball operations department, which included interviews and conversations with stakeholders across our organization, I have made the decision to relieve Latricia Trammell of her head coaching duties with the Dallas Wings, said the teams President and CEO Greg Bibb. On behalf of our entire organization I thank Latricia for her efforts and wish her well moving forward. The Wings will also look to hire a general manager for the first time. Bibb handled the GM duties in the past. As part of our year-end review process, and in conjunction with our organizational long-term strategic planning, I have decided to expand and strengthen our basketball operations through the hiring of a general manager who will oversee the day-to-day operation of our basketball group, said Bibb. The search for this individual has already begun and I hope to have more news on this hire soon. The general manager will lead the search for the next head coach of the Dallas Wings. Trammell is the fourth coach to be let go in the last month. She joined Curt Miller of Los Angeles, Tanisha Wright of Atlanta and Teresa Weatherspoon of Chicago. None of the four had more than three years at the organization. Dallas has the second best chance to win the draft lottery behind Los Angeles and the Wings also own the rights to switch picks with Chicago. The Sky are also in the draft lottery that will be held on Nov. 17. Wings stars Natasha Howard and Satou Sabally are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",https://apnews.com/article/wings-trammell-fired-372b75c52313659c52ad6a003bc63d50,sports
