VP Sara Duterte Takes A Swipe At Her Dad’s Senatorial Line-Up And Close-ins!,https://adobochronicles.com/2025/03/10/vp-sara-duterte-takes-a-swipe-at-her-dads-senatorial-line-up-and-close-ins/,"Ah, the irony! VP Sara Duterte recently lamented Filipinos’ habit of electing actors, comedians, and entertainers—completely forgetting that her father’s political squad has more dance moves than legislative accomplishments. Netizens were quick to remind her of the TikTok-worthy performances of Robin Padilla, Bong Go, Bato dela Rosa, Phillip Salvador, and even the ever-animated Harry Roque. It’s almost like they auditioned for Dancing with the Stars but accidentally landed in the Senate. Who knew that the real qualification for public office wasn’t governance but a well-timed budots routine? And let’s not forget, her father himself won the presidency with his own brand of shock comedy. Maybe VP Sara just had a brief moment of amnesia—or selective memory loss. Either way, if singing and dancing are now disqualifications, the first ones out of office should be the very people she campaigned with.

Diwata: The Thorn Among The Roses Of Panagbenga,https://adobochronicles.com/2025/02/26/diwata-the-thorn-among-the-roses-of-panagbenga/,"Ah, Panagbenga—the grand floral spectacle of Baguio, where the streets bloom with petals, and the air is filled with the scent of celebration. But wait, what’s that rolling down Session Road? A majestic float, adorned not just with flowers but with the unmissable, larger-than-life presence of Diwata of Diwata Pares Overload. Because why settle for a food stall when you can have a full-blown parade float, right? Diwata, now a nominee for the Vendor’s Partylist, clearly missed the memo that politics is a no-go at Panagbenga. But hey, when you’re chasing celebrity status, what’s a little rule-breaking? His float might as well have been a campaign billboard on wheels. Was he aiming to be the thorn among the roses? If so, mission accomplished. And then there was his side gig—Diwata, in full Cordilleran attire, screaming at fans in a manner best described as “gorilla chic.” Was he channeling his inner warrior or simply trying to outdo the local howler monkeys? Either way, the indigenous people deserved better than this cosplay catastrophe. Perhaps it’s time for Diwata to invest in a personal protocol officer—or at least a friend who can whisper, “Hoy, nakakahiya na!”",2025-02-26T18:53:26-08:00,"Entertainment, Festivals, Food, Politics, Social Media"
Vice Ganda’s Larger-Than-Life Wardrobe,https://adobochronicles.com/2025/01/18/vice-gandas-larger-that-life-wardrobe/,"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the fiercest of them all? Vice Ganda, of course! Known for his knack for transforming the ordinary into the outrageously extraordinary, Vice’s wardrobe is less about fashion and more about performance art. Whether draped in feathers larger than life or donning an outfit that could double as a UFO landing pad, Vice doesn’t just dress to impress—he dresses to dominate. Why settle for subtlety when you can wear a chandelier on your head? While his co-hosts try to steal moments of glory, Vice, in his sequined capes and metallic bodysuits, hogs the spotlight with such audacity that even the contestants, co-hosts and fellow actors are left wondering if they’re the side act. It’s not just attention he’s after; it’s the center of the universe. With every outfit screaming, “I woke up like this—fabulous!” Vice proves that normal is overrated and extra is everything.",2025-01-18T15:14:41-08:00,"Entertainment, Fashion, Film and TV, Social Media"
"Exclusive: Vic Sotto, Darryl Yap Kiss And Make Up!",https://adobochronicles.com/2025/01/10/exclusive-vic-sotto-darryl-yap-kiss-and-make-up/,"By The Adobo Chronicles In an unprecedented Adobo Chronicles exclusive, we sat down with comedy legend Vic Sotto and controversial director Darryl Yap to discuss the much-hyped lawsuit filed by Sotto over Yap’s new film, “The Rapists of Pepsi Paloma.” The movie’s trailer, deemed “libelous” by Sotto, had ignited a media frenzy and charges filed. “Ito kasi, Vic,” Yap began, his trademark smirk in full force. “Art imitates life. The film is a nuanced exploration of—” “Nuanced?! Nuanced ba ’yung mukha kong ginawa mong kontrabida sa trailer? Parang pinulot ako sa tambakan ng basura!” Sotto retorted, his comedic timing still intact. “Vic, it’s all creative license! Di mo ba gets? ‘The Rapists’ is a metaphor! Kumbaga, it’s a… what’s the word? Parody!” Yap shot back, air-quoting furiously. “Ah, parody pala ha? Eh parang di naman nagjo-joke yung abogado ko,” Sotto quipped, producing a folder marked Cease and Desist. After hours of heated exchange, the pair surprised everyone by bursting into laughter. “Panoorin mo na lang yung buong pelikula, Vic,” Yap offered. “Sige, Darryl, basta libre tickets ah,” Sotto replied, extending a handshake. They ended the interview with a hug and a photo-op, leaving everyone confused about whether the lawsuit or the movie was the real comedy. Was it all a show?",2025-01-10T16:14:21-08:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, Law Enforcement, Social Media, The Media"
Fact-Checking “Investigative Writer” Raissa Robles,https://adobochronicles.com/2025/01/02/fact-checking-investigative-writer-raissa-robles/,"Raissa Robles, self-proclaimed investigative writer and proud author of one book, recently donned her internet sleuth hat to criticize the girl group Phantom Siita, claiming they were “Filipinos trying to look like Koreans.” The irony? Phantom Siita isn’t Filipino or Korean—the group is Japanese! Yes, Japanese, as in sushi, not kimchi or adobo. One can only wonder if Robles’ investigative skills stopped short of typing “Phantom Siita nationality” into Google. Or perhaps she was too busy plotting her next groundbreaking exposé: “Filipinos Trying to Be Swiss While Eating Toblerone.” This mishap is a gentle reminder that a writer’s most powerful tool is research—preferably done before hitting “post.” If Robles wants to critique cultural appropriation, she might first need a crash course in geography and modern pop culture.

Luis Manzano As Carlos Yulo?,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/09/03/luis-manzano-as-carlos-yulo/,"In a move that’s sure to raise eyebrows and possibly some high-flying flips, Carlos Yulo reportedly wants Luis Manzano, an actor known more for his witty banter than athletic prowess, to portray him in a biopic. Never mind that Manzano stands a foot taller and has a physique better suited for action flicks than a pommel horse. The real question is, will Manzano have to train in gymnastics to accurately portray Yulo? Perhaps he’ll channel his inner Simone Biles, or maybe Yulo will be his own stunt double—though the sight of Manzano gracefully sticking a landing with Yulo’s much smaller frame would be a cinematic miracle. Of course, there’s always the option of CGI or, better yet, letting Artificial Intelligence do the heavy lifting. In any case, we’re in for either a laugh or an Olympic-level performance, albeit one where the judges might need corrective lenses. Lastly, will Vilma Santos, the real-life mother of Luis, play Yulo’s mom, Angelica, in the biopic?",2024-09-03T14:41:58-07:00,"Entertainment, Social Media, Sports"
Viral Frenchman: Pole Or Porn?,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/08/06/viral-frenchman-pole-or-porn/,"In a twist befitting modern times, French pole vaulter Anthony Ammirati faces an unusual crossroads: should he continue to vault towards Olympic glory or embrace the lucrative world of adult entertainment? After an unexpected “reveal” during his latest Olympic attempt, a prominent porn site swooped in with a tantalizing $250K offer for Dupont to showcase his… assets. While millions enjoyed the unintentional peek for free, paying viewers might soon have to open their wallets to see the real thing. Critics argue this move could tarnish his athletic reputation, but let’s face it—pole vaulters aren’t exactly household names. Besides, how many medals can one buy with $250K? Ammirati’s dilemma is a true test of where the real value lies: in gold medals or golden opportunities. As fans eagerly await his decision, one thing is clear: the lines between sports and entertainment have never been blurrier.",2024-08-06T14:09:01-07:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, Social Media, Sports"

Sara Duterte Does A BINI,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/07/24/sara-duterte-does-a-bini/,"In a dramatic twist of fate, the girl group BINI found themselves under fire for obscuring their faces upon arriving at a local airport. Leading the charge was OVP worker and blogger Tio Moreno, whose relentless tirades painted the girls as villains in the latest airport drama. Ironically, his boss VP Sara Duterte pulled a BINI herself when she jetted off to Germany amidst the chaos of Typhoon Carina. Caught on camera, Duterte sported a face mask and a hooded sweater, missing only the “S” emblazoned on her chest – “S” for “Shukran!” Was it a fashion statement, or a desperate attempt to blend in with the crowd? As the nation recovers from the storm, we can only wonder if VP Sara will return donning a new persona, or if Tio Moreno will start his own line of face-obscuring gear. Either way, it seems the art of hiding one’s face is trending this season!",2024-07-24T16:18:37-07:00,"Entertainment, Government, Politics, Social Media, Travel"
“It’s Showtime”Hosts Going Their Separate Ways!,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/07/23/its-showtimehosts-going-their-separate-ways/,"In a shocking twist that rocked the entertainment world, the iconic trio of “It’s Showtime” hosts has seemingly gone their separate ways, each pledging allegiance to rival fast-food chains. The once inseparable Anne Curtis, Vice Ganda, and Kim Chiu have now become culinary combatants in a bizarre battle of chicken and buns. Anne, draped in Jollibee’s signature red, passionately promotes Chickenjoy with the fervor of a starlet defending her Best Actress crown. Vice Ganda, not to be outdone, flaunts golden arches in every Instagram post, sparking rumors of a Big Mac tattoo. Meanwhile, Kim Chiu’s newfound love for ChowKing has her fans pondering if dim sum diplomacy can mend broken bonds.

What’s In A Military Uniform?,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/07/16/whats-in-a-military-uniform/,"What’s in a military uniform, you ask? In the age of honorary titles and political theatrics, quite a lot, apparently. Take First Lady Liza Marcos, recently designated as an honorary Auxiliary Vice Admiral with the Philippine Coast Guard. “Honorary” is the operative word here—an accolade that stirs the pot of public opinion. Critics rage that real service members earn their uniforms through blood, sweat, and sacrifice, while others wear them with less noble intentions, betraying their oaths. Then there are those who join the reserves, either through rigorous training or, let’s be honest, a few well-placed political connections. And who can forget the actors donning military garb for the sake of entertainment? In the end, a uniform is merely fabric and stitching. What truly matters is the person behind it—their loyalty, conviction, and the integrity they bring to the role, honorary or otherwise.

Tio Moreno Tastes His Own Medicine,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/07/19/tio-moreno-tastes-his-own-medicine/,"Tio Moreno, self-proclaimed pro-China and anti-Filipino blogger, recently learned the meaning of poetic justice. After lambasting the Filipino girl group BINI for covering their faces at the airport, even going so far as to mock them with a selfie in ridiculous getup, Moreno must have felt quite pleased with his antics. He described the girls as “not beautiful,” hiding behind their masks. However, BINI, demonstrating wit sharper than Moreno’s misguided satire, arrived for their concert clad in identical hooded sweaters and full face masks. In an ironic twist, they effectively turned Moreno’s critique into a fashion statement. It appears Moreno underestimated the creativity of BINI and the amusement of the public, who watched as his own ridicule turned against him. Moreno’s face might be hidden, but his embarrassment is in full view. Be careful what you ask for, Moreno—satire, like karma, has a funny way of coming back around.",2024-07-19T02:37:43-07:00,"Entertainment, Social Media"
‘Taylor Swift Concert Stadium’ — What If…?,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/07/15/taylor-swift-concert-stadium-what-if/,"What if Clark Airport’s announcement about building a stadium for a Taylor Swift concert in 2028 is actually a masterstroke of strategic planning? Imagine the foresight! Swift, having filled Melbourne Cricket Grounds to its 96,000 capacity, would need an equally massive venue in the Philippines, right? Forget that we already have the Philippine Arena with its 55,000 seats; Clark Airport aims to double that, although it would still not be anywhere near the 132,000-capacity Narendri Modi Stadium in India. But what if—and here’s the twist—the stadium isn’t just for one night with Swift? What if the venue’s real purpose is for a future Pope Francis mass when he visits the Philippines? Imagine the outcry: “Why build a stadium for one mass?” The sensationalism would be off the charts! Or would it? It’s almost as if the Philippines is planning for something bigger, like a multi-use facility for both rock stars and religious icons. But who needs practicality when you can have hype?

Vice Ganda And The Imaginary West Philippine Sea,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/07/01/vice-ganda-and-the-imaginary-west-philippine-sea/,"Vice Ganda’s bold analogy likening LGBT existence to the West Philippine Sea might need a little navigational adjustment. When she said, “Ang ating totoong sarili o pagkatao ay parang West Philippine Sea, hindi nila pwedeng angkinin at baguhin,” she perhaps forgot that the world community doesn’t officially recognize the West Philippine Sea. Much like a mystical island on the horizon, the West Philippine Sea was conjured up by former President NoyNoy Aquino in 2012 through Administrative Order No. 29. Yet, global geographical maps remain unshaken, and the West Philippine Sea endures mainly in the minds of a hopeful few. Unlike this cartographical phantasm, the realities of LGBT communities are vivid and undeniable. Vice Ganda’s comparison is poetic but perhaps misses the mark, because the existence and struggles of LGBT individuals are as concrete and undeniable as the seas that surround us, official recognition or not.",2024-07-01T14:46:19-07:00,"Entertainment, International, LGBT, Politics, Social Media"

With Sara Duterte as president, and her father Rodrigo and siblings Paolo and Baste comfortably nestled in Senate seats, one might wonder if there’s room for anyone else. Enter Kitty Duterte, the 19-year-old black sheep of the family. While her kin are busy crafting laws and steering the nation, Kitty has chosen a different path: the glitzy world of entertainment. Known more for her rhinoplasty, jawtox, and lip fillers than for any legislative ambition, Kitty eschews the political circus for the glamour of the runway. Perhaps she dreams of joining the ranks of Vice Ganda, Heart Evangelista, and Pia Wurtzbach, leaving the heavy lifting of governance to her more politically-inclined relatives.

Thank God It’s Fried Day!,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/06/20/thank-god-its-fried-day/,"“Thank God It’s Fried Day” is here again, folks, and boy, what a feast we have! Harry Roque’s sizzling bromance with Mister Supranational Philippines 2016 has everyone asking if the real contest was for the biggest bromance blunder. Rendon Labador and Rosmar, now persona non grata courtesy of Coron, Palawan, seem to be taking “fried” a little too literally after their spat with the mayor’s staff, and for reportedly refusing to pay for food they ordered from a vendor. Roque strikes again, claiming VP Sara Duterte is now the opposition leader, only to be promptly skewered by the Liberal Party’s spokesperson—Leile de Lima herself — ouch, that burn’s going to need some ointment. Diwata’s performance at the Santacruzan turned a religious tradition into a farce, leaving devotees questioning if they should start praying for divine fashion intervention, or simply sulk in a bowl of pares overload. And then there’s Vice Ganda, who apparently thinks the nation hasn’t had enough of his face and antics on TV, announcing yet another show.

Vice Ganda Is No American Idol,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/06/18/vice-ganda-is-no-american-idol/,"In a move sure to redefine global entertainment standards, ABS-CBN has announced the export of its wildly original TV show, “Everybody Sing,” hosted by the inimitable Vice Ganda. This groundbreaking program, which bravely mimics the American hit “Don’t Forget the Lyrics!”, invites contestants to display their lyrical prowess for a chance to win… well, something far less than $1 million. While America and Britain export cultural behemoths like “American Idol” and “Britain’s Got Talent,” the Philippines graciously offers its homespun tribute act. Surely, global audiences will be spellbound by this karaoke-like contest. But let’s be honest—perhaps the country would be better off shipping out its exquisite capiz shell crafts or mouthwatering canned adobo instead. These unique cultural exports are far more likely to capture the world’s imagination and showcase the true richness of Filipino heritage, rather than a karaoke night in TV form.",2024-06-18T13:28:56-07:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, Social Media"

Ganda now epitomizes the “non-apology apology” after he retracted his intention to apologize to the aggrieved contestants. *And the award of “Best Credit Grabber” goes to Maisug and SMNI (it’s a tie!) for claiming that the annual New York City Philippine Independence Day parade was their “rally” when in fact, their small contingent was a last-minute addition to this non-political event. *It’s no longer the DDS vs. the Loyalists when it comes to Philippine politics.  More and more Dilawan — from Leni Robredo to Antonio Carpio to Koko Pimentel — are joining the bandwagon for a new “UniTeam.” Even Maria Ressa and Leila de Lima have thrown in their support for Bongbong Marcos, all but endorsing his approach to the country’s foreign policy.

Is GMA finally fed up with the reign of wigs and wit? Could they be plotting a revolution of bland predictability? Surely, the network isn’t daring enough to think viewers can endure noon without Vice’s comedic chaos. Maybe they believe that the show can survive on charm and charisma alone—or perhaps they’re preparing us for a host so average that Vice will look even more indispensable by contrast. Either way, this move could be GMA’s attempt at high-stakes entertainment, with viewers glued to their seats, not by the usual gags, but by the sheer suspense of wondering, “What on earth are they thinking?” Stay tuned, folks.

This raises eyebrows faster than a toddler with a marker near freshly painted walls. One wonders: has the baby secretly been binge-listening to the artist’s discography during naptime?

It’s hard to imagine a child whose vocabulary likely consists of “goo-goo” and “ga-ga” being an avid follower of any celebrity.

As popcorn sales skyrocket with the signing of the ABS-CBN-GMA contract, another spectacle is set to unfold on the Senate Channel, where a different kind of “showtime” awaits viewers. With Senate President Migs Zubiri signing an arrest warrant for Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, it’s a crossover event that even the most imaginative scriptwriters couldn’t concoct. Amidst the glitz and glamour, political intrigue takes the stage, blurring the lines between reality TV and real-life drama. As the audience eagerly awaits the next episode, one thing is for sure: in Philippine showbiz, the show must go on, even if it means tuning into the Senate Channel for the latest blockbuster showdown.",2024-03-20T14:03:21-07:00,"Entertainment, Law Enforcement, Politics"
National Artist?,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/03/24/national-artist/,"In a world where national artistic recognition resembles a popularity contest more than a celebration of genuine talent and cultural contribution, the true essence of being a “national artist” seems lost in a cacophony of commercialized jingles and catchy monikers. Merely churning out a perennial Christmas earworm (Jose Mari Chan) or boasting concocted titles like “Asia’s Songbird” (Regine Velasquez) or “Star for All Seasons” (Vilma Santos) does not an artistic legacy make. Yet, amidst the clamor for chart-topping hits and box office or concert successes, the subtlety of true artistic mastery is often drowned out.  It’s like Taylor Swift being awarded a Pulitzer Prize. Should we then bestow the esteemed title of national artist upon those who merely excel in slapstick films or command large fan bases? By that logic, we might as well nominate Vice Ganda or the comedic trio Tito, Vic, and Joey for this prestigious honor. In this age of superficial acclaim, let us not confuse fleeting fame with enduring artistic brilliance, lest we risk reducing the title of national artist to nothing more than a hollow accolade.",2024-03-24T16:17:10-07:00,"Arts, Entertainment, Film and TV, Music"

His recent escapade of trashing Jollibee might have elicited chuckles, but his unkempt appearance invites more scrutiny than his antics. One wonders what Selena Gomez saw in this disheveled figure, with hair resembling uncooked spaghetti dipped in fish sauce, and a face that screams “I haven’t seen a shower in weeks.” Perhaps she has a fondness for projects in dire need of a makeover. While Blanco may spew foul language with gusto, one can’t help but imagine his breath follows suit, especially after all the foods he ingests in his videos. Jollibee’s sweet spaghetti, despite its polarizing reception, looks positively appetizing compared to the spectacle of Benny Blanco. Let’s hope Selena steers clear of any hair caressing during intimate moments, for fear of encountering a tangled mess ripe with mystery odors.",2024-03-09T02:27:00-08:00,"Entertainment, Food"

With a kennel bursting at the seams with a whopping 200 dogs, the sisters have pivoted from harmonizing on stage to orchestrating a cacophony of barks in their neighborhood. Claiming their fur-filled menagerie began innocently with a few pups gifted by fans, questions arise about their ability to manage such a sizable pack. Now, facing complaints from sleep-deprived neighbors, the sisters seek funds to create a haven for their four-legged companions. As netizens, both canine enthusiasts and skeptics, raise eyebrows at their plea for financial assistance, parallels are drawn between their purported irresponsibility with pets and their perceived struggles in the music industry.

Even the legendary Dolly Parton, adorned in anonymity, fell victim to the whimsy of appearance.

And now . . . Catriona and Sam. It’s as if the nation collectively holds its breath every time a famous couple posts a cryptic Instagram story or is spotted without their significant other. But why this fascination? Perhaps it’s because Filipinos see celebrities as demigods, their love lives a mirror to the mortal masses’ desires and insecurities. When KathNiel breaks up, it’s not just a breakup; it’s a national tragedy, complete with memes and think pieces. As ordinary folks navigate their own tumultuous love lives, they look to celebrities for guidance, projecting their hopes and fears onto the glossy pages of showbiz magazines.

I’m just a mere mortal with a filmography longer than a CVS receipt,” she chuckled, as if blissfully unaware of her own cinematic prowess.

He seems to have taken a swipe at Filipino American comedian Jo Koy whose hosting of the Golden Globes was marred by a joke on the NFL courtesy of Swift. It seems Swift has become the unofficial yardstick for measuring a host’s worthiness, as if her approval rating is the ultimate litmus test for comedic genius. Forget about timing, wit, or originality – the true hallmark of hosting success is now measured by how many Swift-related quips you can avoid. In this era of delicate sensibilities, where hosting gigs are a delicate dance around Swift-shaped landmines, we commend Liu for valiantly steering clear of the pop princess. Perhaps we’ve entered a new epoch where the true measure of a host’s prowess lies not in their ability to entertain but in their careful avoidance of Swiftian wrath.

The clash between Noranians and Vilmanians, the nation’s cinematic Hatfields and McCoys, takes a bizarre turn as politics intervenes. Superstar Nora Aunor, the icon synonymous with melodrama, is labeled a Marcos loyalist, while Vilma Santos, the eternal Star for All Seasons, finds herself on the Pinklawan side. Enter President Bongbong Marcos, who, in a plot twist worthy of an award-winning screenplay, appoints Santos’ husband, Ralph Recto as the new Finance Secretary. The Pinklawans, traditionally Santos’ staunch supporters, now face a dilemma.

Not content with merely conducting her son Richard’s career, she dives into the murky waters of his marriage with Sarah, treating their private affairs like an off-Broadway drama with the world’s worst reviews. But the curtain doesn’t stop there; it’s lifted to reveal the unsuspecting grandchildren, tossed center stage in a distressing display of familial dysfunction. In this grotesque circus, common sense becomes the elusive unicorn, as innocent children are thrust into the limelight, their faces plastered on social media like tabloid confetti.

Now, Ms. Ho is suddenly an authority on seizing opportunities? The only opportunity she seized was to tarnish the image of the Asian Games host nation.

GMA To Preempt One Hour Of “It’s Showtime” To Give Way To Lorraine Badoy And Ka Eric,https://adobochronicles.com/2023/12/22/gma-to-preempt-one-hour-of-its-showtime-to-give-way-to-lorraine-badoy-and-ka-eric/,"In a surprising twist, GMA 7 (GTV) has announced a compassionate act of solidarity with suspended SMNI News Network by preempting one hour of its popular noontime show, “It’s Showtime,” to make room for Jeffrey Celis (Ka Eric) and Lorraine Badoy’s SMNI News program. This decision comes after the National Telecommunications Commission suspended SMNI News for 30 days due to alleged violations of its franchise. GMA’s benevolent move is seen as a gesture of support for media outlets facing tough times, reminiscent of a sitcom storyline where rivals become allies. The network emphasized its empathy with SMNI, also citing the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board’s 24-day preemptive suspension of Celis and Badoy for purportedly spreading fake news on their TV program. This comes on the heels of the MTRCB’s 12-day suspension of “It’s Showtime” over lewd episodes courtesy of hosts Vice Ganda and Ion Perez. GTV’s move all but proves that in the world of Philippine television, solidarity knows no bounds—even if it means sacrificing a dancing Vice Ganda an hour each day for a month.",2023-12-22T12:50:16-08:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, Law Enforcement"

Senator Win Gatchalian finds himself unwittingly cast as the victim in this farcical soap opera, where every screenshot and alleged leak becomes fodder for the hungry online masses. The supposed leaked message from actress-beauty queen Bianca Manalo, desperately seeking rendezvous with actor Rob Gomez has fueled the flames of gossip. The irony that Win is in a relationship with the actress adds a dash of spice to the already sizzling concoction. Meanwhile, social media speculations have us believing that Rob might be juggling not just political dramas but also affairs with co-star Herlene Budol.

Meanwhile, Miles Ocampo and Elijah Canlas may have exchanged more goodbyes than Christmas gifts. It’s a star-studded separation party as Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla bid adieu, Richard Gutierrez and Sarah Lahbati uncouple, and Kim Chiu and Xian Lim give a new meaning to “Jingle Bell Rock.” It seems the allure of breaking free during the holidays is irresistible—perhaps mistletoe is replaced with the spirit of independence.

Yet, even if Dee had answered with the wisdom of a sage, one can’t help but wonder: who is Whang-od, and does anyone outside Abunda’s inner circle care?

Is Broadway fatigued with the Marcos saga, or have theater-goers rejected the notion of a theater experience without plush seats? Perhaps the Great White Way isn’t ready for a show that challenges the hegemony of cushioned comfort. Could it be that American audiences, accustomed to Les Misérables-style epics, find “Here Lies Love” a bit too shallow and a tad too brown?

Did her icy dismissal freeze the enthusiasm of potential theatergoers, leaving them colder than a New York winter?

Are the Gonzaga-Soriano duo staging a coup against the Marcoses, or is this just another ingenious marketing strategy?

This incident caused quite a stir, with Vice Ganda venting his frustration on social media, demanding to be treated like the star that he is.

The reason? A photo posted by the noon-time show’s cast showing Vice Ganda and others licking ice cream while vacationing in Hong Kong. “They never learn,” the MTRCB declared, shaking their heads in dismay. This latest suspension comes hot on the heels of the previous one, which was imposed after an episode featured Vice Ganda and Ion Perez indulging in the outrageous act of licking cake icing.

"Sharon, Sharon, What’s Inside Those Orange Boxes?",https://adobochronicles.com/2023/10/25/sharon-sharon-whats-inside-those-orange-boxes/,"Philippine showbiz sensation Sharon Cuneta has once again taken the Internet by storm with her latest social media post. The image, featuring her beloved pet dog sitting on a blue chair in a room filled with bright orange boxes, has left the nation puzzled. The burning question on everyone’s mind: what on earth is hiding inside those mysterious boxes? Conspiracy theories are running rampant, and some can’t help but draw parallels to her infamous 2022 presidential campaign video. In that eyebrow-raising moment, Cuneta appeared to offer a Rolex watch while VP candidate Leni Robredo was addressing the nation. Was this another cunning marketing tactic to promote her secret Rolex black market operation? Could it be that Cuneta is secretly amassing a horde of Rolex watches for a shadowy resale empire? Perhaps she plans to finance her own space exploration program or build a secret underground lair. Or maybe, just maybe, those boxes contain her vast collection of Oscar snubs. It’s anyone’s guess. Sharon Cuneta and her orange boxes have become a national enigma, leaving us all to ponder life’s greatest mysteries, one Rolex at a time.",2023-10-25T03:16:31-07:00,"Entertainment, Social Media"

This decision was reportedly influenced by the unexpected rapture that the audience displayed during the replacement show, proving that life beyond Vice Ganda and “It’s Showtime” does indeed exist. It seems ABS-CBN executives have seen the light, or perhaps just a pot of gold, at the end of their noon-time rainbow. The enthusiastic viewer feedback was so overwhelming that it left ABS-CBN executives wondering if Vice Ganda had been keeping the network hostage with high-energy antics all these years. “It’s Your Lucky Day” showcases ordinary people winning prizes and doesn’t rely on over-the-top humor, celebrity appearances, or dancing hosts – a real game-changer in the world of Filipino noontime entertainment. The audience’s newfound love for a less extravagant show has opened the doors to greener pastures for ABS-CBN, making us wonder what other surprises they have up their sleeves.

Speculation is rife that his absence may finally pave the way for movies that don’t solely rely on wardrobe changes, slapstick humor, and a swarm of backup dancers. Some optimists suggest that without Vice Ganda’s trademark wigs, glitter, and melodramatic punchlines, audiences might actually notice that there’s more to Philippine cinema than gender-bending comedies.

Cruz, Manila on Wednesday afternoon. The drag performer, whose real name is Amadeus Fernando Pagante, is reportedly being held at the Santa Cruz Police Station. Religious group Philippines for Jesus Movement earlier sued Vega for his rock rendition of “Ama Namin,” or the Lord’s Prayer, which was denounced by many as “blasphemous.” Pagante was charged under Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code provides the penalty for “immoral doctrines, obscene publications and exhibitions and indecent shows.” It wasn’t clear whether Pagante would be posting bail for his temporary freedom.  What’s clear is that he’s fighting back! In a message sent directly to The Adobo Chronicles, Pagante said he is counter-suing the religious group, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines and Parish officials of Quiapo Church for immoral doctrines, idolatry and grave threat to public safety.  This is connection with the annual Traslacíon celebrating the feast of the Black Nazarene. “When I performed as Jesus, I was merely practicing my craft as an entertainer.  No one was physically hurt during my performance.  Nothing immoral about that,” he said. Pagante added: “What could be more immoral than a public display of idolatry, parading the Black Nazarene like a rock star, and putting the lives and safety of devotees at great risk?

The disappointment among Noranians and Filipino film enthusiasts is palpable, as they were eagerly awaiting a rare opportunity to witness the magic of Philippine cinema’s true superstar. It’s quite the cinematic paradox when a festival that claims to celebrate the best of Filipino cinema manages to exclude one of the most iconic figures in the history of Philippine entertainment. It’s as if they’ve decided to hold a Lechon Festival without the actual lechon. How can we possibly have a meaningful discussion about the true queen of Filipino cinema without considering the astounding contributions of Nora Aunor? Instead, we are presented with a selection that includes the likes of the “Star for All Seasons” Vilma Santos and the “Mega Star” Sharon Cuneta. Now, don’t get me wrong; Vilma and Sharon have had their moments of glory, and they’ve given us some fantastic films over the years. But let’s not kid ourselves; they are but mere mortals compared to the celestial presence of Nora Aunor. It’s like hosting a “Who’s the Greatest Actor of All Time” contest and omitting Meryl Streep while throwing in a few Hollywood newcomers. Nora Aunor is not just an actress; she’s a national treasure, a legendary performer who has transcended generations. Her contribution to Philippine cinema is nothing short of monumental. The exclusion of “Pieta” from the festival is a blatant injustice, a cinematic crime of epic proportions. Nora Aunor is a national artist, for heaven’s sake! She deserves a spot at any cinematic gathering, especially one that claims to showcase the best of the best. Leaving her out is akin to hosting a fiesta without the lechon, a halo-halo without the leche flan. But fear not, fellow Noranians and cinema enthusiasts. We know the true queen of Filipino cinema, and her reign transcends awards and festivals. Nora Aunor’s legacy will continue to shine, casting its brilliant light on the hearts of those who truly understand and appreciate her remarkable talent. So, let the Metro Manila Film Festival have its moment in the spotlight with its other offerings, but let’s not pretend that it’s the definitive yardstick for measuring greatness in Filipino cinema. Nora Aunor, the Superstar and National Artist, will forever be etched in our hearts and in the annals of Philippine film history, regardless of any festival’s myopic decisions.",2023-10-17T02:12:12-07:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV"

Some have said it would be a honor just to carry the baby of one of the most famous celebrity couples.

Why bother the President for the mischief of the show hosts? Perhaps a more effective approach would be for Senator Revilla to ask the hosts of the show, particularly the wealthy Vice Ganda, to dip into their deep pockets and ensure that the workers receive their wages during the suspension.

With hosts prancing around in outrageous costumes, dancing to the same tired tunes, screaming, and laughing hysterically at their own jokes, these shows are a caricature of entertainment. They feed the masses a steady diet of shallow content, promoting mediocrity as the new normal. The obsession with celebrity gossip, love teams, petty drama and occasional insensitive and offensive banters overshadows the more pressing issues facing the country. While some argue that these shows offer an escape from daily struggles, they inadvertently foster a culture of ignorance. The incessant product placements and commercialism only serve to enrich the networks while viewers are left intellectually bankrupt. In the end, these shows might offer momentary amusement, but they also contribute to the long-term dumbing-down of the Filipino population.

The airing comes at a time when Filipinos are panicking over the continued spread of the coronavirus in China and other countries. The PCOO order would mean the temporary shutdown of ABS-CBN so that it would not be able to continue airing the films which could only exacerbate the fear already being felt by the Filipino people. It wasn’t clear how long the quarantine period will be, but the worst case scenario is that the order will last until March 20 when ABS-CBN’s media franchise expires. In that case, the quarantine will be forever. Who says “walang forever?” (There is no forever).",2020-02-10T00:59:23-08:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, Health & Medicine, Media"

Today, she filed a Senate resolution calling for the partial renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise which expires this March. The divisive issue pits those who are for the non-renewal of the franchise against those who are for renewal. Poe wants to renew the entertainment portion of the franchise while cancelling the broadcast network’s news operations. ABS-CBN, besides being cited for tax evasion and violation of labor laws, is also accused of being a purveyor of fake, biased news. ”We must continue our crusade against fake news, but we also need to seriously consider the feelings of millions of Filipinos who follow the long-running FPJ’s “Ang Probinsyano” and other teleseryes and variety shows on ABS-CBN,” Poe told The Adobo Chronicles.",2020-01-20T16:11:37-08:00,"Business, Entertainment, Government, Media, Politics"

So today, NoyNoy Aquino imposed a gag order on his younger sister Kris Aquino, after the former TV talk show host went on a rampage, berating fellow TV host Korina Sanchez who happens to be the missus of former presidential candidate Mar Roxas, NoyNoy’s chosen one to succeed him. Not only did Kris ‘accuse’ Sanchez of slapping her in the face for airing a feature video about her ex-husband James Yap; she also practically told the whole world that Rodrigo Duterte deserved to be elected president. Kris’ rant on her Instagram Account was not only embarrassing to NoyNoy, Roxas and Korina but to all members and supporters of the Yellow Opposition. So to prevent further spillage of Liberal Party and Opposition secrets, PNoy all but put masking tape over the mouth of Kris. Informed sources told The Adobo Chronicles that PNoy was afraid Kris would divulge more damaging and incriminating information in connection with the 2016 elections which, among other things, could jeopardize the case of Vice President Leni Robredo in the ongoing recount of votes in the 2016 Vice Presidential elections.",2018-04-23T02:04:11-07:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, Government, Politics, Social Media"

Ang Larawan” is based on the play “A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino” by National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin, and features music by Ryan Cayabyab and lyrics from Rolando Tinio. It garnered 7 of the festival awards. In a statement, MMFF said that it “cannot in conscience recognize a film with all the major awards when it has not even been shown widely in theaters. Many mall and other theaters pulled the film just a day after the festival opening because it wasn’t attracting crowds just like other top-grossers, mostly slapstick and cast appeal movies like those featuring Vic Sotto and Vice Ganda. ”Come to think of it, how can a movie be considered a film festival entry when it is not even being shown starting with Day 2,” MMFF said.

Maybe, the MMFF should consider bringing back double feature screenings during the festival so that a quality film can be shown in the same theater as another of mass appeal.  Two for the price of one.

The Philippines justified its drug test requirement for Bieber by citing a similar demand for Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao prior to his fight with Floyd Mayweather. Filipinos and others attending Bieber’s concert will also have to provide a certificate or notarized pledge that they are drug-free.

FilAms Who Attended FASO Gala In Los Angeles Want A Refund,https://adobochronicles.com/2017/06/21/filams-who-attended-faso-gala-in-los-angeles-want-a-refund/,"LOS ANGELES, California ( The Adobo Chronicles, Los Angeles Bureau) – Many Filipino Americans living in Los Angeles coughed up big bucks (translation: U.S. dollars) to be among the selected few to witness a performance of one of the most revered cultural/dance traditions of their homeland — the ‘Rigodon de Honor.” The Rigodon is a traditional dance from the Philippines that evolved from dances brought to thePacific islands by Spanish settlers in the sixteenth century. Historically, the dance is meant to represent a certain sense of elevated status among those who take part in it, and is often performed at galas, balls and other formal occasions celebrated by the rich and powerful. It was supposed to be a highlight of the fundraising gala sponsored by FASO, the Filipino American Symphony Orchestra Foundation, billed as a night of music, dance and culture. But alas, what invited guests witnessed was a Rigodon de Dishonor, highlighted by the presence of Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo who turned the prestigious cultural event into a laylayan political event. Nobody in the audience wanted to listen to her lies about the Duterte government, Martial Law in Mindanao, the Philippines’ war on drugs and her supposed fundraising for the victims of the Marawi City terrorist siege. But Robredo was oblivious to the evening’s purpose. And so, as she took to the podium (actually a music stand) to deliver her packaged speech prepared by Georgina Hernandez and her socmed staff, the guests walked out in disgust. Now, FASO has been deluged with letters, phone calls and emails demanding for refunds of the cost of tickets paid by the invitees who were so looking forward to witness the Rigodon de Honor. It must be a dishonorable next few weeks for FASO.  But it should be a lesson learned.

Film Plot Nick Young, the heir apparent of an extremely wealthy old-money Singapore family living in New York City and working as a professor goes home for the first time in years to attend his best friend’s wedding. He decides to bring his girlfriend with him, Rachel Chu, who has no idea about the enormity of his wealth, and who is unprepared for immersion in an overwhelming world of wealth that doesn’t welcome her. Astrid Leong, Nick’s cousin, the subject of Singapore society coverage, also known as “The Goddess”, seems to have it all: good breeding, astonishing beauty, massive wealth, great fashion sense, complete with a couture collection that rivals the Sheika of Qatar’s, and an attractive ex-army husband. Astrid discovers disturbing signs of a possible secret mistress as she comes to understand her husband’s insecurity about his own success compared to her vast wealth. Aquino Fails In Personal Interview Sources close to The Adobo Chronicles have confirmed, however, that Aquino did not land the role following an in-person interview with the producers and casting director in Hollywood.  Could it have been because of Aquino’s English skills?

Producer: Tell us more about why you want to take on this role in what could be your first Hollywood film. Aquino: Oh wait lang ha.  I have to make bahing (Achoo!).  Grabe, I’m not used to the weather here in L.A.  In Manila, it’s so so hot, you make pawis right after you’ve taken a shower.  Okay, well you know, it’s always been my ambition to be a Hollywood star.  I’m qualified naman, di ba?  As a matter of fact, I’ve starred in a lot of Filipino films, thanks to my little bossing who is not that little na. Casting Director: What makes you best qualified for this role? Aquino: Well, since this film is about rich Asians, I can relate to the role very well.  You see, my family is very rich.  In fact, we own a big hacienda in the Philippines.  I also went to an exclusive school in Manila, plus I’ve spent some years living in an upscale neighborhood of Boston.  I’m probably more rich and famous that Jeane Napoles, you know, the daughter of the Pork Barrel queen.  Besides her wealth came from illegal sources.  Mine is through my hard work.  Plus, don’t you think I look like the perfect Asian face?  Thanks to the unbelievable whitening cream I use every day. Casting Director: Is it true you wore the seized necklaces and jewelry of Imelda Marcos? Aquino: Naku naman, that’s a very unfair question.  They are rumors lang.  Not true. Producer: How would you feel if you didn’t land the role in this film? Aquino: Hahaha. I love your sense of humor.

Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar today unveiled the format of Duterte’s show, which in reality, is a game show.  The title? “You Ask Me One, I’ll Ask You Two!” During the commercial-free TV show, Duterte will field questions from the television audience, and for each question he answers, he will ask two questions. Andanar said that Duterte was very confident his answer to each question will embarrass the questioner, while the answers to his two questions will find the questioner totally in agreement with the president. For the game show’s premiere episode, Duterte’s guests will be representatives from the United Nations, United States and European Union.

ABC has given a 10-episode order for this new version of the irreverent talent show competition, which is being executive produced by Will Arnett. A gong is an African, East and South East Asian musical percussion instrument that takes the form of a flat, circular metal disc which is hit with a mallet. It has its origins in China and it spread to the rest of Southeast Asia, including many sacred Temples in the region. It is therefore not surprising that Asian Americans are not happy with the objectification of the gong, calling it racist and offensive. Free speech advocates, on the other hand, say that the concept of the show violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which guarantees the freedom of speech. “No matter how bad a speech (or act) is, no one has the right to silence the speaker or actor by hitting a gong,” they said. This is the second network controversy in just the past week. Earlier, NBC cancelled a new show, “Mail Order Family,” after Asian Americans and women’s groups protested the perpetuation of racist and misogynist stereotypes.  The show was supposed to be about an American widower who takes a Filipina mail-order bride to help raise his two kids.",2016-10-03T15:02:26-07:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, International, Politics, Race Relations"

It’s not gonna happen under the Duterte administration. Change has come. In January, 2017, when the Philippines hosts the Miss Universe Pageant, there will be no rounding up or hiding of Metro Manila’s street children.

At the pageant finals, each of the beauties will be escorted by a street child during the parade of nations.  The children will come as they are: some barefoot, others wearing torn t-shirts and shorts, and still others with dilapidated flipflops.

Then, there’s Texit — conservative Texans plotting to secede from the United States.  Now, there’s Philexit. Loyal followers of outgoing President NoyNoy Aquino and the Yellow Party (Liberal Party) can’t fathom their devastating defeat in the May presidential elections that saw a landslide victory for Davao City Mayor Rod Duterte. So they’re plotting to separate themselves from the incoming government . While defeated LP presidential candidate Mar Roxas has been quiet since the elections, celebrity fans led by Cynthia Patag, Jim Paredes, Carlos Celdran and Leah Navarro have drafted a petition seeking to leave the Philippine Republic and form their own autonomous government. They will soon post the petition and are asking concerned Filipinos to sign online. The quartet was encouraged by Duterte’s decision to make Davao City the seat of his administration. “We can then make Manila the seat of the Yellow government,” they said. The Philexit was obviously inspired by this week’s historic referendum in the United Kingdom in which majority voted to leave the 26-member EU . Philexit’s goal is to gather 25 million signatures, after which the petition will be submitted to Congress to pass a law approving the secession. Roxas and aquino are the same establishment thieves , dirty is communist . Boy some choice the filippines has . One wants to break it the other wants to bury it .

And no, he is not talking about Vice Presidential-elect Leni Robredo. Rather, he is referring to showbiz personality Vice Ganda. Duterte’s announcement finally ends all speculation about whether or not he will appoint Robredo to a Cabinet position as is the usual practice by incoming administrations. Robredo ran as the VP candidate of the opposing Liberal Party. She won over five other candidates, including Duterte’s running mate, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano. Vice Ganda, who has earned the respect and trust of Duterte during the presidential campaign period, will be designated the LGBT Czar, a Cabinet-level position that will serve as the administration’s liaison with the country’s gay and lesbian community. “I can only appoint one Vice to my Cabinet, and I have chosen the one that I trust most and who has supported my campaign,” Duterte said, referring to the television host. Vice Ganda’s appointment has not been reported in the media because local reporters have been banned from attending Duterte’s public events and press briefings. Ironically, the local media were urged to boycott Duterte’s press briefings after he was quoted as saying that murdered journalists — particularly the “son-of-a-b*****s,” deserved their fate.

What’s important is what you did with your life.” With these words, former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas shed the signature yellow -t-shirt of the Liberal Party and donned a Batman suit. Roxas’ statement came during last night’s third and final Philippine presidential debate after  fellow candidate Miriam Defensor-Santiago questioned him about being elitist. Roxas’ new image is a last-ditch attempt to appeal to Filipino voters who will troop to the polls on May 9 to elect their next president. Since the start of the presidential campaign period, Roxas has been trailing behind revials Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, Senator Grace Poe and Vice President Jejomar Binay. The Roxas campaign has acknowledged that the party’s “Daang Matuwid” message has not resonated among Filipino voters who have been clamoring for a radical change in their economic life and personal security as well as an end to continued government corruption. By portraying himself as a superhero out to save the Philippines from “the gates of hell,” Roxas hopes to play catch up with the frontrunners in the presidential race. President Aquino’s ‘anointed one’ says that in the remaining days of the campaign, he will focus on earning the trust and support of the country’s young voters and comic book fans. Shame on you Marimar who had a lot of opportunities to prove to us that you indeed care for the poor. However, your actuations are reflective of your being an elite who was and will be protecting only yours and their interests.

(Because we are a family-oriented site, we chose not to include a link to the video, but you can always Google it!) “I’m sorry, sexual harassment,” the singer added. “You can do the same to me. Good luck,” she said, pointing to her cinched costume. Australian authorities told The Adobo Chronicles that no one — not even an international celebrity like Madonna — is above the law.  “Her act constituted a violation of laws against indecent exposure, sexual assault, and violating a minor,” the authorities said. “It was same-sex assault, but an assault nevertheless,” they added. Madonna’s spokesperson said that the whole thing was an accident, some “wardrobe malfunction which the young girl seemed to enjoy.” The singer has been released after posting a $1 Million bail, which to her is a mere spare change. As a result of the incident, Madonna is now forever banned from entering Australia, the second country to impose such restriction. Madonna is also banned from entering the Philippines, after she disrespected the Philippine flag during her ‘Rebel Heart’ concert tour in Manila last February. The singer is filing an appeal before the United Nations asking that both Australia and the Philippines rescind the ban against her, citing artistic freedom and freedom of speech.",2016-03-20T15:58:47-07:00,"Entertainment, International, Law Enforcement, Music"
"After Failing To Tax Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach’s Miss Universe Crown, BIR’s Kim Henares Goes After AlDub",https://adobochronicles.com/2016/03/14/after-failing-to-tax-pia-alonzo-wurtzbachs-miss-universe-crown-birs-kim-henares-goes-after-aldub/,"QUEZON CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) – AlDub, the popular noontime TV love team of Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza—has become the country’s hottest endorser of consumer products. In just seven months since its debut on TV in July 2015, AlDub’s combined earnings have reached P200 million—based on conservative estimates by sources interviewed by Inquirer Lifestyle. The revelation caught the attention of the Philippines’ chief tax woman, Commissioner of the Bureau Internal Revenue (BIR) Kim Henares who is known for her tough stance in going after celebrities for the purposes of taxing their earnings. Among Herares’ celebrity pursuits is Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao. When Miss Universe Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach first returned to Manila after winning the pageant, Henares wanted to tax the $300,000 crown worn by the Filipino queen. Naturally Henares was unsuccessful because Wurtbach’s crown was just “on loan” for the duration of her reign as Miss Universe. So when Henares learned of the advertising earnings of Richards and Mendoza, the BIR commissioner wasted no time in issuing a summons to the two celebrities, asking them to appear in her office with certified true copies of their earnings statements so that she could accurately calculate the taxes owed by the couple. The timing of the summons was questioned by some of the presidential candidates who hinted that the Aquino administration’s candidate, Mar Roxas, needed some campaign funds infusion for his weak showing in national polls. But The Adobo Chronicles could not independently confirm whether Henares’ move was related to Roxas’ campaign.",2016-03-14T15:16:08-07:00,"Entertainment, Government, Law Enforcement, Politics"
AlDub Fans Not Happy About Pope Francis’ New Instagram Account,https://adobochronicles.com/2016/03/19/aldub-fans-not-happy-about-pope-francis-new-instagram-account/,"BAGUIO CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Baguio City Bureau) – Today, Palm Sunday, is the official start of the Roman Catholic Church’s Holy Week, culminating next Sunday, Easter. Baguio City, the nation’s summer capital, is starting to get really crowded as people from the lowlands — including politicians and celebrities — troop to this mountain resort to escape the scorching heat and enjoy Baguio’s cool weather. Just in time for this solemn season, Pope  Francis has just announced that he has entered the world of Instagram. This, in addition to his existing Twitter account.  It was welcome news for many Catholics visiting Baguio. In just under twelve hours, Francis’ Instagram account generated more than 1 Million likes and is expected to equal, if not surpass his Twitter likes of 26 Million. And guess who’s not happy about all this? AlDub (the sensational love team of Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza, stars of the kalye serye on the noon-timle show ‘Eat Bulaga.’) Although AlDub is credited for a record 39 Million tweets, thrashing the 35.6 Million record of the 2014 FIFA World Cup slemi-final match bvetween Germany and Brazil, their “likes” on both their Twitter and Instagram accounts have a lot to be desired. Depending on which AlDub site you’re following, the couple’s (and their fans’) Twitter page likes is anywhere between 88,000 and 350,000.  Their Instagram page likes is about 230,000.  Both are a far cry from the Pope’s Twitter record and expected Instagram following. Well, AlDub fans, you can’t have it all.

The Adobo Chronicles learned that the network is about to announce a casting call for Filipino domestic helpers who want to train in the Housemaids Academy and earn a contract to work in Hong Kong or Singapore. Housemaids Academy is for real.  It is a government-run training center for domestic helpers to prepare them for work abroad. It is located on Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City.  At the center, Filipinos are trained to properly clean, cook, use the washing machine (always separate whites from colors), and perform other tasks that domestic helpers are expected to do by their prospective foreign employers. With more than 96,000 women leaving the Philippines each year to work abroad as maids, domestic helpers are the second largest overseas Filipino workforce behind merchant seamen, according to government statistics. The top 10 destinations for Filipina maids are Hong Kong, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Singapore, Bahrain, Oman, Cyprus, and Italy. Now, back to the reality show. It is patterned after a similar show on GMA-7 called ‘Pinay Beauty Queen Academy’ where beauty queen aspirants are selected to compete for the top spot with the guidance of professional mentors, all of them previous beauty title holders.  Contestants are eliminated one by one until the last woman standing. “Housemaids Academy” will also involve an elimination (voting out) process, and the last contestant remaining will be declared the winner, bagging a contract plus free round-trip airfare to the country of her new employment.

It is a packed schedule for the new Miss Universe, ranging from press conferences, television shows, a ticker-tape parade and many other public appearances. One thing that’s not going to happen, however, is a previously scheduled exclusive interview with Wurtzbach on Kris Aquino’s morning show, Kris TV . It was supposed to be the first one-on-one television interview with Wurtzbach in the Philippines. Kris, the sister of President NoyNoy Aquino, announced today that she had disinvited Miss Universe from her scheduled appearance on her show. The talk show host, who claims to be the “Queen of All Media,” said her decision to snub Wurtzbach came immediately after the new Miss Universe was interviewed on a live radio show in New York where she was asked about the rumors that she was dating the Philippine president. “That is so no. It’s so funny,” Wurtzbach said during the radio interview. That response by Wurtzbach hurt Kris, who just months earlier, interviewed the then newly-crowned Miss Philippines-Universe.  During that interview on the show, “Aquino and Abunda,” Kris asked if Wurtzbach was dating her brother.  She then promised Wurtzbach that she would be a good “sister-in-law.” “I cannot believe Pia would embarrass me and my brother,” Kris said. “From now on, I will not have anything to do with her.  I am canceling my exclusive interview with her on my show.” When The Adobo Chronicles informed Wurtzbach about Kris Aquino’s decision, the ever-graceful Miss Universe simply said, “I understand how she feels, but I’m not going to lie. I wish her all the best.” She is just jealous with Pia. She can’t and will never achieve being Miss Universe even in her younger days hahahahaaha Like Like Pia is became Miss Re-uniVerse by disinviting her. Yahooooo!

Nieto, 49, and Trudeau, 43, were seen Wednesday night in Manila where they are attending the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit meeting, garbed in barong tagalog, the traditional formal attire for Filipino men. The two leaders became an instant sensation, with the media and Manila’s fashion afficionados commenting that they wore the barong much better than Philippine President Aquino himself. The barong brought out the sexiness and youthful look in them, many commented. People’s editors agreed and so they revised their decision and opted to name all three — Beckham, Nieto and Trudeau — as this year’s sexiest men alive. Meanwhile, barong designers and vendors in the Philippines reported a sharp increase in orders for the male attire — from Paris to Hollywood and from Beijing to Sydney. The barong business may have been the one Philippine economic endeavor to benefit from the APEC meeting, thanks to the sexy duo from Mexico and Canada.",2015-11-18T16:23:35-08:00,"Entertainment, Fashion, International"

The young world leader wowed Filipinos — women and men — with his youthful good looks during his Manila visit to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.  He was mobbed by adoring fans wherever he went, and his photograph wearing the traditional Filipino men’s attire, the barong tagalog, put the Philippines’ top models to shame, literally. One of the country’s top film production companies, Viva Films, has reportedly offered Trudeau an exclusive contract to appear in at least three Filipino movies in 2016 — opposite actress, TV host and presidential sister Kris Aquino. The first film is about a woman (Aquino) who falls madly in love with a visiting foreigner who happens to be a married man (Trudeau).

In one number, Cyrus appeared on stage at The Riviera Theater practically topless with a prosthetic penis protruding from her bottom front. While most of the audience members went wild and cheered her on, a woman who came to the concert with teenage daughters called 911 to complain about the nudity and sexual content of the show. Chicago police responded immediately and tried to stop the concert. Rather than ruin the entire show and disappoint adoring fans, concert producers asked Cyrus to cover up. The closest thing to a cover-up that stage managers could get hold of was an iPad Pro that belonged to one of the musicians.

The younger sister of President NoyNoy Aquino is known as the ‘Queen of All Media’ and the ‘Oprah Winfrey’ of the Philippines (or so she wished). Her newest accolade came just days after she publicly revealed details of her botched romantic relationship with former child actor and now mayor of Quezon City Herbert Bautista. In a post on her blog titled “The State of My Heart,” Aquino described how after a few months of being in a relationship, a “tired” Bautista popped “the least romantic proposal a woman has ever received.” She apparently said ‘yes’ to Bautista’s marriage proposal . Aquino is known as a celebrity who can’t seem to keep her personal life in wraps. Previously, she made public what she described as her abusive relationship with a married politician, Joey Marquez,  and accused him of giving her a sexually-transmitted disease. Recently, amid rumors that her president brother was ‘dating’ Miss Philippines-Universe Pia Wurtzbach, Aquino promised — during a live broadcast — that she would make for a great sister-in-law.

She made the comment while protesting the fact that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump  whom he described as a “racist, sexist and incestuous man, ” will be returning to the late-night show as host for the second time on November 7. When asked which Asian American personality should be invited as SNL host, Cho said, “Me, of course!” When others pointed out to Cho that in fact there had been two previous SNL hosts who were Asian American —  Fred Armisen, a quarter Japanese and  Rob Schneider, half Filipino– she replied: “People come at me and say, ‘Oh, Fred Armisen is a quarter Japanese, Rob Schneider is half Filipino.’ Yeah, that makes three-quarters of an Asian-American, not even in one person, in 41 years.” Cho, was born in America to Korean parents.  So that, in effect, makes her part American and part Korean. “If I am invited to host SNL, then that would make for a total of one and a quarter Asian American hosts for the show in 41 years” she added.

But sources close to the Canadian singer who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Bieber will cut short his concert tour after his performance at the Oakland Oracle Arena on March 18, virtually cancelling his two scheduled concerts at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on March 20 and 21. Instead, Bieber, who has had many encounters with U.S. law enforcement because of his behavior, will proceed to San Francisco to seek refuge from U.S. Immigration officials. Bieber has repeatedly been charged with misdemeanors and violations including driving under the influence (DUI), resisting arrest and drag racing. In 2013, the then 19-year-old Bieber was caught on camera urinating in a mop bucket as he and others raced through a New York City restaurant kitchen. Before exiting, Bieber sprayed a photograph of Clinton and dropped the F-bomb in reference to the former president. The Department of Homeland Security’s Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) is reportedly monitoring Bieber’s activities and is planning to revoke his work permit.

That’s exactly what Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal did on Thursday as he unloaded on Donald Trump, calling him “insecure,” “weak” and “dangerous.” Jindal also said of Trump: “Just because a lot of people like watching Kim Kardashian — we wouldn’t put her in the White House, either.” In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Jindal said that Trump and Kardashian are in the same league, being both products of reality television. “Like Kardashian, Donald Trump is a narcissist and egomaniac.

The musical, penned by librettist W.S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan ( Pirates of Penzance, H.M.D. Pinafore) premiered at The Savoy Theatre in 1885. The play is set in the fictional Japanese town of Titipu. Many modern-day critics and Asian American groups have called for the re-writing of the play and demanded that Asian actors play the characters in new productions. The cancellation of the New York production is regarded as a victory for political correctness in the increasing diversity of societies worldwide. But as BroadwayWorld’s Michael Dale wrote in his column  titled, “Is It Time to Rewrite THE MIKADO?” :  “It’s unlikely that Gilbert had meant THE MIKADO to be taken as a serious attack on insensitive white people appropriating another culture for their own entertainment. He was more concerned with lightheartedly satirizing his countrymen’s foibles.” THE MIKADO controversy is giving theater production groups some chills and they are being proactive in making sure that their stage productions will not be dealt with similar protests and controversy. For starters, future productions of ‘Miss Saigon’ (where Filipino musicians have dominated the casting) will now only feature Vietnamese actors playing Vietnamese characters.

Marvel Comics revealed Friday that the Hulk in its new Totally Awesome Hulk comic is teen genius Amadeus Cho. Marvel teased the identify of the character over the past month, though speculation about Cho being the new Hulk started much earlier in the summer. But Marvel has now officially confirmed this, and in doing so, makes history: this is the first Marvel series with an Asian-American lead character. Amadeus Cho, also known as Mastermind Excello, is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Greg Pak and artist Takeshi Miyazawa, the character first appeared in Amazing Fantasy vol. 2 #15 (January 2006). He usually appears as a supporting character or sidekick in books featuring The Avengers, or individual members of that group, such as Hulk or Hercules. So the next big question is, who will  play the role of The Hulk in the new film version that Marvel Pictures and Universal Studios will be filming starting this fall? Someone to replace Edward Norton who played The Hulk in the previous film. Of course, it has to be someone who’s Asian or Asian American. Several names have been floated around including John Cho (Star Trek), Harry Shum, Jr. (Glee) and Randall Park (Fresh Off The Boat).  But Universal and Marvel thought none of them have the muscular build required of the Hulk character. So it was decided that Filipino actor Sam Milby be given the role. Milby has been making films in the Philippines and has been trying to break the ice in Hollywood to no avail.  Well, his time has come.

The outrage and outpouring of emotion over Cecil’s death have quickly spread worldwide. The incident has gained much more attention than the killing of unarmed black men by police in America, or the extrajudicial killings happening in many countries with repressive regimes. The incident has produced a new meme and hashtag, ‘LionLivesMatter,’ a take-off from ‘BlackLivesMatter.’ ‘The Lion King ‘ is a musical based on the 1994 Disney animated film of the same name with music by Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice along with the musical score created by Hans Zimmer with choral arrangements by Lebo M. Directed by Julie Taymor, the musical features actors in animal costumes as well as giant, hollow puppets. The musical debuted July 8, 1997, at the Orpheum Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the  same state in which the killer dentist, Walter Palmer, holds his practice.

Trinay ko lang na i-emphasize the halaga of learning our national language, di ba? Feel ko na I have a responsibility as a celebrity to make tawag to all our bagets to seriosohin our language. There is nothing mali about admitting that naka gets ako ng failing grade in Filipino. After all, I grew up in the States and didn’t have too many friends that I could make tsismis with. I hope my critics can move on na!” How would you grade her statement?  Pass or fail? buti nga si Kris may grade pa na 74 eh..nung high school ako kahit magaling ako sa Filipino binagsak ako ng teacher  ko.. 1st to 4th grading umattend ako ng subject na yun..may grades ako every kuhaan ng card at the end burado na lahat at failed nakalagay..o diba..lakas ng trip ng teacher ko noh.. but that was 13years ago.. 🙂 at naka move on na ako sa kanya..

SINGER CHRIS BROWN INVITED BACK TO THE PHILIPPINES,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/07/30/singer-chris-brown-invited-back-to-the-philippines/,"MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles ® ) – After just ten days since his sold-out concert in Manila, Grammy Award-winning singer Chris Brown has been invited back to the Philippines. Brown is currently in Israel as part of his concert tour. The unprecedented invitation came from no less than Leila De Lima, Secretary of the Philippines’ Department of Justice (DOJ).  It came in the form of a subpoena. DOJ has issued a subpoena against Brown for allegedly defrauding a Christian church out of $1 million after he canceled a performance at a New Years Eve event and failed to return the money. Brown’s name appears on the subpoena along with Canadian promoter John Michael Pio Roda after a $1 million estafa complaint was filed due to the singer skipping a scheduled musical performance for the Church of Christ in the Philippines, which is called Iglesia ni Cristo, on Dec. 31, 2014, at the Philippine Arena. Brown and Roda were reportedly paid $1 million in advance and canceled without paying any of the money back. Ahead of the subpoena being issued, Brown, 26, was performing in Manila and was initially barred from leaving the Philippines on July 21 because of the complaint that was filed. While he was finally cleared to leave the country by the Bureau of Immigration on July 24, Roda was not. Roda is planning a return concert for Brown as soon as he arrives back in Manila.  The concert will be held at the Philippine Arena. Concert proceeds will help fund the court case that will ensue as a result of the DOJ invitation. It remains to be seen whether or not the upcoming concert will be able to raise the $1 Million that Brown owes Iglesia Ni Cristo, and then some.",2015-07-30T05:10:04-07:00,"Entertainment, Music, Travel"
FOREIGN CONCERT ARTISTS UNITE TO BOYCOTT THE PHILIPPINES,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/07/23/foreign-concert-artists-unite-to-boycott-the-philippines/,"LOS ANGELES, California  ( The Adobo Chronicles ® ) – Foreign concert artists continue to run afoul of the Philippines’ strict moral and other standards, and they are uniting to skip the country for their world music tours. In 2012, a Lady Gaga Manila concert attracted widespread protest due to supposedly anti-Christian lyrics in one of the singer’s hits. And earlier this year, two members of One Direction paid bonds of roughly $4,500 before their performance in Manila, due to their casual admission of marijuana use in a video released last year. This week, Grammy Award winner Chris Brown was barred from leaving the country after a one-day concert in Manila because of fraud charges brought against him by an influential church group. The charges stemmed from the singer’s non-appearance at a New Year’s Eve concert at the Philippine Arena, owned by the Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church of Christ). Earlier today, Madonna, who had just announced she has chosen the Philippines as the only country in Asia that would be included in her Rebel Heart Tour, said she decided to cancel her February 2016 concert at the Mall of Asia in Manila, in solidarity with Brown. The boycott could either deprive Filipinos of the chance to see their favorite international artists, or possibly enhance the careers of local singers and performers.

Brown was in Manila Tuesday for a sold-out concert . The 26-year-old R&B artist had been stuck in Manila after running afoul of a corporation, run by an influential religious group, Iglesia Ni Cristo,  that filed a fraud complaint against him for a cancelled New Year’s Eve gig. He and his Canadian promoter were paid a $1 Million advance for the New Year’s Eve concert. The delay meant he missed a performance in Hong Kong that was scheduled for Wednesday evening. But when it rains, it pours. When Brown arrived in Hong Kong Friday, he was not allowed by authorities to disembark from his chartered plane and was asked to leave immediately. Chinese immigration and customs officials barred the American singer from entry because of the missed concert Wednesday night. Many fans were terribly upset that the Hong Kong gig was cancelled. Although concert ticket purchasers were given refunds, they still complained that the cancellation caused them great irreparable emotional distress. Many took a leave of absence from their day and night jobs just to be able to attend Brown’s concert.

Brown was barred from leaving the Philippines because of a contract dispute, the official Philippines News Agency reported Wednesday. Brown was stopped Wednesday morning while preparing to depart on a private jet from Manila’s international airport on his way to Hong Kong for a concert, the news agency said. The Philippine Department of Justice said that an order had been issued Tuesday night to stop any attempts by Brown, 26, to leave the country. Brown performed in a Manila concert that evening as planned, but the order was put in place to compel him to pay back money that promoters said was owed to them after he failed to appear for a previous appearance scheduled for last New Year’s Eve. Encouraged by the departure hold order, promoters of the New Year’s Eve concert amended their complaint against Brown, asking the Department of Justice that they not only be paid what was owed to them but an additional 50% interest compounded monthly.(We’re not good at math but we suspect that with now almost six months since Brown incurred the “debt,” it could mean lots and lots of money for the aggrieved promoters.) The promoters have the full backing of Bureau of Internal Revenue Commissioner Kim Henares whose agency is sure to benefit from taxes that will be collected from promoters if and when they get paid by Brown. Rumors are circulating that Brown is currently detained in an airport holding cell and is being fed rice and chicken adobo three times a day. He had earlier requested for a McDonald’s cheeseburger but the request was denied.

Philippine social media was abuzz with rumors that a youthful member of President NoyNoy Aquino’s cabinet took advantage of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) Monday night to propose to presidential sister Kris Aquino. The rumors all began with a photo posted on Facebook, showing Joel Villanueva, director general of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), down on his knees and seemingly begging the actress and television host to marry him. Aquino was quick to deny the rumors, but admitted she felt a little kilig ( to tremble in a flirtatious way) by the photo. After all, Villanueva used to be a basketball player like her ex-husband James Yap. TESDA is the government agency tasked to manage and supervise technical education and skills development in the Philippines. It was created by virtue of Republic Act 7796, otherwise known as the “Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994”. Villanueva was appointed by the president in 2010. The director general position carries with it a cabinet rank. Aquino is known to be a celebrity who can’t keep her personal life and romantic encounters under wraps. She has previously gone public with her relationship to a married politician who was also a former professional basketball player, Joey Marquez.  Aquino accused Marquez of domestic violence and giving her a sexually-transmitted disease. She has also been romantically linked to Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista, a former child actor.  No, he was not a basketball player. We are often told that pictures don’t lie.

After his disparaging remarks about Mexicans during his announcement for a bid to become the Republican nominee for president, Trump lost both Univision and NBC Universal which were home networks for the live television coverage of the pageants. Luckily, Trump found an ally in the little known Reelz cable network which agreed to air the Miss USA pageant live from Baton Rouge, Louisiana on July 12. But then, five co-hosts of the Miss USA pageant all dropped out from their duties, including Thomas Roberts, Cheryl Burke, Roselyn Sanchez, Cristian de la Fuente and Jeannie Mai. Luck comes twice in a row so to speak, when the Philippines’ self-proclaimed queen of all  media and presidential sister Kris Aquino agreed to co-host the Miss USA pageant this weekend. “It has always been my dream to be the host of the Miss Universe Pageant,” Aquino said, “and I hope hosting the Miss USA pageant is a stepping stone towards that dream.” CNN’s Don Lemon is rumored to be Aquino’s co-host for Miss USA. What is left for Trump is to deal with the fallout from participating Miss Universe countries. Mexico, Panama and the Philippines have  dropped out of the Miss Universe pageant, and other Latin American countries are expected to follow suit. But perhaps with the prestige that Aquino brings to the pageant, the boycotting countries might very well change their minds.

NEWLY-CROWNED MISS PHILIPPINES WOWS JUDGES WITH ANSWER TO FINAL QUESTION ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/06/01/newly-crowned-miss-philippines-wows-judges-with-answer-to-final-question-on-same-sex-marriage/,"MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles ) – The Philippines crowned yet another beauty queen last night when it named Angelia Gabrena Ong, 24, of Manila, the 2015 Miss Philippines-Earth. She will represent the country in the Miss Earth pageant later this year. Rarely do beauty pageant judges get totally impressed by contestants’ answers to the final question but this time they absolutely did. The moment Ong began to speak into the microphone to answer her final question, the panel of judges knew it had a winner. Ong’s question from celebrity judge Zsa Zsa Padilla was the most difficult one that evening: “Do you believe in same-sex marriage?” Her answer: “I think it really depends on the person if he or she believes in sex marriage but as for me, if the person feels that he or she needs to be married to show his or her love the I don’t mind having sex marriage.” The Adobo Chronicles could not reach Ong to ask her if, by her answer, she meant ‘same-sex marriage,’ ‘sex before marriage,’ or ‘marriage for the sole purpose of sex.’ Watch the video clip of that defining moment in the pageant: Reblogged this on Denal's Mind and commented: what! sex marriages?

Binay remains the frontrunner in national polls on who should succeed President NoyNoy Aquino after the latter’s term expires in 2016.  However, in recent weeks, Senator Grace Poe has steadily climbed in the polls, inching closer to Binay. Too close for comfort. Wanting to capitalize on the popularity of Aunor, Binay promised that if the multi-awarded acrtress endorsed his candidacy for president, he would name Aunor as a national artist during his first year as head of state. (Aquino had previously snubbed Aunor by refusing to name her as national artist despite strong recommendations by the national nominating committee.) It is too late for Binay: Aunor has just endorsed Senator Poe as her choice for president in the 2016 elections. Political analysts have said that with Aunor’s endorsement, Poe will likely overcome Binay’s lead in the polls as early as next week.

Last night’s announcement of the grand winner — El Gamma Penumbra, a shadow performing group — made Filipinos extremely proud.  The winning act is from the Philippines, but so were three other acts that made it to  the grand finals.  The other Filipino grand finalists were classical singer Gerphil Flores, ten-year-old singer Gwyneth Dorodo, and hip-hop dance group Junior New System. Completing the nine grand finalists were dancers Gao Lin and Liu Xin (China), musicians Khusugtun (Mongolia), dancers Triqstar (Japan), young rock stars The Talento (Thailand), and tap dancers Dance Thrilogy (Singapore). But as Filipinos were celebrating the success of their contestants, the other 13 countries signed and sent a petition to Fremantle Media and Sony Pictures Television — the show’s producers — demanding that the next season of “Asia’s Got Talent” be made off limits to Filipino contestants. The petitioners stated that their respective countries were put at a serious disadvantage in the competition because of the number of amazing acts that represented the Philippines in the first season.  “We just cannot compete with the Filipinos,” they added. The petitioners concluded by threatening to pull out of the competition next year if the Philippines were not excluded. In order to save the extremely popular show, the producers agreed to ban Filipino talents from competing, at least for the next season. The ban will be revisited in 2017. We filipinos are talented and they would like to show to the world our talent even our country faces Serious Problem what a Childish reason??? Like Like Anyways, love the adobo chronicle Like Like Would people really act so childish? Bad sportsmanship! Satire c: Like Like LOL LOL LOL….I am speechless…..they just made themselves dumber… Like Like why not limit the contestant to just 1 representative from each country? so each country will conduct beforehand, a talent show locally and send the winner as its representative …just like in beauty contests… this is fair Like Like funny how most people react without understanding that this is just a satire article… Like Like If we say that Mayweather is undefeated and cannot be defeated… so other boxers will no longer compete because of that? In competitive sports, some countries in Asia are very dominant in particular sports.. but no country petitioned to exclude them…. AGT is a challenge against any talents from around Asia and only one wins… the best voted talent… from where? it’s still uncertain for the next Season…. Like Like It’s a good feeling that they are intimidated by Filipinos, but banning Filipinos in the competition is unfair to us. That is what the competition is about, showcasing your talents. If you are intimidated by that, that only shows your weakness. The show wants to find the best of the best in Asia, what’s the point of the competition if the whole world knows that an Asian country is ban from “Asia’s got Talent”.it’s not Asia’s Got Talent anymore. They are scared that the competitors pull out? we are competitors too. if they want to win that badly, then search for your best talents and send them to compete. those Filipino talents don’t even get support from our government but they do everything to win, you can’t just ignore those hardships they went through. if it’s inevitable, then let’s agree on one condition, they should change the title to “ASIA, EXCEPT PHILIPPINES, GOT TALENT” or “ASIA’S SISSIES GOT TALENT” Like Like the eff? just because they’re intimidated by filipinos doesn’t mean that they should ban us. it’s not the Philippines’ fault that were basically a hot pot of talents. if they do continue on with the ban and then lift it in 2017 they should expect more filipinos because they didn’t get to join last time:P just saying.. but meh… Like Like SATIRE 🙂 Like Like My personal opinion is quite simple.. i felt honored by knowing that we are feared by other countries in Asia at this level of competition,,,” WE JUST CANNOT COMPETE WITH FILIPINOS” Wow! that is a manifestation of our excellency in arts! My fellow compatriots let us not be sadden but instead humble our selves bye giving them a chance to excel,, and in less time as they become competitive as we are,, we will step back in. Like Like it’s not right to ban a country from entering a talent show just because of their fear of losing in a competition… if you were meant to win, you will win no matter what… loser people likes to make a rule for their own benefit… if you’re not a loser, then don’t control ones right…. Like Like This is a satirical article in a satirical website. Like Like I don’t know how true this is but it’s ok for me to give a break for the other contestants. I mean what is 1 year anyway? Take it as a hiatus or rest period. However if the producers decide on a second ban the following year then that is totally unfair. I find it amusing that the petitioners say, “We just cannot compete with the Filipinos,” ….. Hahaha ….. Just shows how talented Filipinos are against the rest of Asia. Cheers!

The presidential sister and talk show host wants to be the first to interview ‘Asia’s Got Talent’ finalist Gerphil Flores — win or lose. Flores is one of nine finalists who could be the grand winner in the mega-reality show being held in Singapore.  Four Filipino acts and five  others from Singapore, Japan, Thailand, China and Mongolia are competing for the title ‘Best Talent in Asia.’ “Let bygones be bygones,” Aquino said, referring to the incident in 2010 when she and fellow ‘Pilipinas Got Talent” judge Ai-Ai de las Alas, voted out Flores, then a teenager contestant in the show, because they thought the classical singer should be singing songs that the audience and her peers could relate to, like songs that Charice would sing. Aquino left for Singapore early Monday morning and is desperately seeking to meet with Flores before Thursday’s announcement of the grand winner of the talent show. She is also reportedly trying to schedule an interview with internationally-acclaimed composer and producer David Foster who is head over heels for the talented Flores.  When informed about Aquino’s attempt to schedule an interview with him, Foster said, ‘Kris Aquino who?’ Aquino plans to be in Singapore all this week to tape segments of her show, “Aquino & Abunda Tonight.” Will she score the exclusive interview with Flores? Everyone knows this is satire, right. As in, a lengthy joke? 😀 Like Like I don’t think it’s right to judge Ms. Kris Aquino’s competency as a person or as a judge for voting to eliminate Gerphil Flores in PGT a few years back. For me, her comment was valid because a lot of singers and auditioners fail in competition for choosing the wrong songs. While I understand that Gerphil is trying to make her own icon as a classical singer, maybe she could have picked a different classical song that the difficulty level is really really high. I listened to her sing and she has great potentials even back then at PGT. I happen to be a Christian and that song she sang Via Dolorosa was a great song and she did a perfect job and I like that she sings from the heart. What Kris said was not to insult her but just a suggestion to sing different songs that would capture your audience. You know what, if she sang that song in Europe/US it would have been a different story because its a different audience. Long story short, Gerphil is an excellent singer. She is blessed by God right now at Asia’s got talent because of her humble spirit and just pure talent. For Ms. Kris Aquino, I really don’t believe that she said what she said before to insult Gerphil or belittle her abilities that was just her personal opinion during PGT. In fact, Ai-Ai’s comments didn’t even makes sense and really no solid basis. More power to Gerphil Flores! I know she will win this! i believe it! Like Like Your very long comment still bias. To judge on the basis of heart is bias.Kris base her judgement on interest/ likes which totally showed her that her intellect got no talent in judging music talent.

Another Filipino act, El Gamma Penumbra, was announced as the winner of the grand finals. Many of course are aware that Flores was voted off the semi-finals in the 2010 “Pilipinas Got Talent” by celebrity judges Aquino and de las Alas because they thought the singer, then just a teenager, should sing songs that the audience (and her fellow teens) could relate to. After being voted off, Flores promised she would continue singing songs in her chosen music genre.  The rest is history, leading up to “Asia’s Got Talent.” Other celebrities who made it to the top ten list include superstar Nora Aunor, actor DingDong Dantes, Manny Pacquiao, and Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago. The exclusion of Aquino and de las Alas from this important list could significantly jeopardize their product endorsement appeal, meaning they will lose millions of pesos in advertising contracts as spokespersons or models for product billboards; radio, TV and newspaper ads; product labels and packaging, among others.

But years ago, when Flores was a teenager trying her luck in the local edition of the reality show (‘Pilipinas Got Talent’), two celebrity judges ousted her from the finals because they thought she needed to sing songs that the “audience can identify with” (songs that young singers like Charice would sing). Nevermind, that the young man whom the two judges picked didn’t quite hit his high notes during his final performance. The two celebrity judges, we all know, were talk show host Kris Aquino, and self-proclaimed comedienne Ai-Ai de las Alas. Many felt they didn’t have any business sitting in the judges chairs for a talent competition, especially when it comes to music. Well, Flores chose not to follow the advice of Aquino and de las Alas.  Good for her.  She is not only a strong contender to be Asia’s best singing talent, but she has caught the eyes and ears of famed composer, musician and producer David Foster who has worked with talents like Barbra Streisand, Mary J. Blige, Natalie Cole, Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera, Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, Josh Groban, among many others. The success of Flores in ‘Asia’s Got Talent,’ and a very bright future that awaits her because of her voice and the songs that she chooses to sing seem to have boomeranged as far as the celebrity judges that misjudged her are concerned.

Flores’ accomplisment has brought back to the spotlight the local version of the reality talent competition (‘Pilipinas Got Talent’) where, in 2010, Flores, then a teenager, was ousted from the show’s finals by two of the judges, Kris Aquino and Ai-Ai de las Alas.  The talk show host and comedienne both voted out Flores because they said she should be singing songs that the audience can relate to, and that the classical singer would be better off singing songs appreciated by those in the same (young) generation. Finally, Aquino and de las Alas — in a rare show of unity —  issued a joint statement in response to widespread criticism that they had no credentials for judging a talent (singing) competition. The statement said that, as a matter of fact, they take credit for Flores’ success. “If we had voted for Flores to stay in the PGT competition, she could have won and turned professional which would have disqualified her from joining ‘Asia’s Got Talent,” Aquino and de las Alas said. “Flores should be thanking us,” the statement added. Meanwhile, upon learning that ‘American Idol,’  and by extension, ‘Philippine Idol’ will be ending in 2016, both Aquino and de las Alas have been aggressively campaigning that they be named judges for the final year of ‘Philippine Idol.’ “It would be great to end our judging careers on a high note,” they said. GMA television network, the home of ‘Philippine Idol’ has not returned our calls requesting for comment. What a dumb statement from these two “experts”.

THE ADOBO CHRONICLES’ PREDICTION FOR “ASIA’S GOT TALENT”: IT WILL NOT BE UP TO THE FILIPINOS,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/05/08/the-adobo-chronicles-prediction-for-asias-got-talent-it-will-not-be-up-to-the-filipinos/,"SINGAPORE ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Who will be the winner in the grand finals of ‘Asia’s Got Talent?’ Before you start flooding the inbox of The Adobo Chronicles with angry email, read on. We’re not saying the Filipinos will not win. On the contrary, one of the Filipino acts will be the winner! It will be up to the voters to choose their favorite act from nine finalists: dancers Gao Lin and Liu Xin (China), musicians Khusugtun (Mongolia), dancers Triqstar (Japan), young rock stars The Talento (Thailand), tap dancers Dance Thrilogy (Singapore) and the rest from the Philippines: Ten-year-old singer Gwyneth Dorodo took her flair to the next level when she carried through a moving interpretation of Sia’s “Titanium” in her final performance. Taking the Super Bowl to the stage, hip-hop dance group Junior New System in football-inspired costume danced along a mashup of a bevy of songs and even waved the Philippine flag proudly. Embodying the true meaning of a “diva,” classical singer Gerphil Flores delivered a spine-chilling rendition of “The Impossible Dream” from the musical “Man of La Mancha.” Wearing a golden dress, Gerphil literally stood on a pedestal as she belted out high note after high note, leaving the audience in awe and wanting more. Judge David Foster, who pressed the Golden Buzzer for Gerphil during the auditions, was left ecstatic. “I promise you, the world is gonna know about you. That’s a promise.” Ingenuity and inspiration were what shadow play group El Gamma Penumbra exemplified when they showcased an arresting presentation about conservation of Mother Earth.Performing to “Pocahontas” theme song “Colors of the Wind,” the group showed the ways people destroy nature like hunting, dynamite fishing and littering. But they didn’t forget to give a lesson on how to take care of the planet. So back to how the final winner is chosen: by viewer voting. It just makes sense that voters from China, Singapore, Japan, Mongolia and Thailand would vote for their respective candidates. And so will the Filipinos. But with four acts in the grand finals, the Filipino vote would be split, four ways or what not. In the past, where Internet voting determined the winner of international competitions — like the Miss Universe Photogenic award, the Filipino candidate ended up winning, almost 100% of the time. Talk about Internet and text-savvy Filipinos — all 100 Million of them! So while we predict the winner of ‘Asia’s Got Talent’ to be one of the Filipino acts, it will be determined not by the Filipino vote alone but votes from other Asian countries. But then, miracles happen in the Philippines, so maybe, just maybe, the Filipinos will unite to vote for a single Filipino act. OUR PREDICTION We’re really torn between El Gamma Penumbra and Gerphil Flores. Both acts are teeming with talent — so impressive, so endearing.  We’d like for AGT to declare a tie but what are the odds of votes being split equally between the two? So, we are going to predict that El Gamma Penumbra will win.  While we’ve seen similar acts in other versions of the show, like ‘America’s Got Talent’ or ‘Britain’s Got Talent,’ Penumbra’s act stands out because their artistry is consistently coupled with universal messages like peace, love, tourism and protecting the environment. But don’t feel bad for Flores.  She is already a winner.  Expect David Foster to take her under his wing, like he did with Charice. This will not be the last time you see — and hear — Flores. While we wait for the final results, we would like to conduct a poll on who among the Filipino acts you would like to win AGT:",2015-05-08T14:06:50-07:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, International, Social Media"

The show, starring Randall Park and Constance Wu, was considered the first family sitcom featuring Asian Americans in almost 20 years. It received tremendous support from the Asian American community when it launched in the fall, with viewing parties organized in major cities. The sources said that although the show did relatively well in terms of ratings, ABC wanted something else that would shoot up the roof in terms of sustainable viewership. In place of FOB, the network will pick up ‘Too Manny Things,’ a new comedy written and directed by Filipino boxing champion Manny Pacquiao, based on his true-to-life story as a boxer, basketball playing coach, singer, actor, congressman and potential presidential candidate. FOB’s Randall Park also stars in the the Pacquiao sitcom, along with Marques Ray who plays the role of the boxer, and Tess Paras who plays Manny’s real-life wife, Jinky. Taking advantage of Saturday’s boxing bout between Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, ABC released the premiere episode of ‘Too Manny Things,’ on YouTube. By doing so, the network hopes to generate worldwide interest in the sitcom which starts this fall. “We are confident that Manny’s sitcom will break all ratings considering his worldwide popularity,” ABC executives said. http://youtu.be/QXhPXtUMtac",2015-04-30T10:17:14-07:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV"

POLL: ACTOR DINGDONG DANTES THE OVERWHELMING CHOICE FOR PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT IN 2022,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/04/29/poll-actor-dingdong-dantes-the-overwhelming-choice-for-philippine-president-in-2022/,"MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Manny Pacquiao might be heavily favored by the Filipinos to win in this Saturday’s (Sunday, Philippine time) welterweight boxing championship against American Floyd Mayweather, but the Filipino boxer’s chances of becoming president is very slim. Actor Dingdong Dantes is the overwhelming choice among likely voters in the 2022 Philippine presidential elections. Last week, The Adobo Chronicles reported that Dantes is being groomed to be the Liberal Party’s standard bearer in 2022, while Pacquiao has been anointed the presidential candidate for the opposing Nacionalista Party. In a scientific poll conducted by the Chronicles, Dantes, 34, leads Pacquiao, 36, by almost 3 to 1. An overwhelming 71.15% of respondents said that they will vote for the actor, compared to only 28.85% who said they will vote for the boxer. (Both are under-age to qualify for the 2016 elections.  The minimum age to run for Philippine president is 40.) When it comes to politics, Filipinos seem to look up to their screen heroes over their sports heroes.

Dantes, who recently married fellow actor Marian Rivera in what was billed a ‘Royal Wedding,’ is 34 years old and is ineligible to run for president in 2016. The miniimum age to run for president is 40. Aquino was the Best Man during the Dantes-Rivera wedding. The actor is on the short list of the Liberal Party’s senatorial slate for 2016. Champion boxer Manny Pacquiao, 36, had previously announced his intention to run for president. Like Dantes, Pacquiao is not qualified to run in 2016 because he is under-age. But the boxer is already an elected congressman, representing his province of Sarangani. He ran under the banner of the Nacionalista Party. Fast forward to 2022.

"IN THE PHILIPPINES, A ROYAL BABY WATCH BEGINS",https://adobochronicles.com/2015/04/28/in-the-philippines-a-royal-baby-watch-begins/,"LONDON, England ( The Adobo Chronicles) – The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge is now four days past her due date. Kate Middleton, 33, and husband Prince William were scheduled to welcome the second royal baby on Thursday, April 23, but the day came and went with no sign of another little one. This would be their second child.  Prince George was born on July 22, 2013. In the Philippines, another royal baby watch has begun. Actors Dingdong Dantes and Marian Rivera have both confirmed that they are expecting a child.  Although not exactly royalty, the couple are looked upon as Prince and Princess after their wedding last December was billed as a “Royal Wedding.” The wedding was the most talked about, expensive and paparazzi-filled event, rivaling that of the British royalty in terms of the wedding gown, bridal car, church ceremony (officiated by eight bishops and seven priests), and life-sized wedding cake, among others.  The Best Man was none other than the president of the Philippines. Filipino netizens have started to get involved in the baby naming process, suggesting names for the royal child.  An overzealous fan of the couple even created a website that has ‘pictures’ of what the baby boy or baby girl will look like.

"SAN FRANCISCO BANS WILD AND EXOTIC ANIMALS FROM CIRCUSES, FILMS AND TV",https://adobochronicles.com/2015/04/22/san-francisco-bans-wild-and-exotic-animals-from-circuses-films-and-tv/,"SAN FRANCISCO, California ( The Adobo Chronicles) – For the longest time, it has been the ‘elephant in the room’ in circuses, films and television shows: wild and exotic animals used commercially for public amusement. This week, the ultra radical San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance banning performances by these animals in circuses and on film. It takes effect in 30 days. Passage of the measure, opposed by the circus and motion picture industries, makes San Francisco the largest city to adopt such a sweeping prohibition on the commercial use of wild animals for public amusement. The ordinance does not apply to domesticated animals, such as dogs, cats, horses and other livestock or pets. Educational activities or exhibitions accredited by certain zoological and museum organizations are also exempt. It does bar any public showing, carnival, fair, parade, petting zoo, ride, race, film shoot or other undertaking in which wild or exotic animals “are required to perform tricks, fight or participate as accompaniments for the entertainment, amusement or benefit of an audience.” Wild and exotic animals are defined as any nondomestic or hybrid creature, whether or not it was bred in captivity. That means elephants, tigers, lions, apes, monkeys, snakes, deer, politicians and right-wing conservatives. It wasn’t clear whether films like ‘Planet of the Apes,’ filmed in the San Francisco Bay Area (including the Golden Gate Bridge) will be banned from being shown in local theaters and television, or rented out through Netflix.

JUSTIN BIEBER ASKS POPE FRANCIS TO INTERCEDE ON ARGENTINIAN ARREST WARRANT,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/04/12/justin-bieber-asks-pope-francis-to-intercede-on-argentinian-arrest-warrant/,"TORONTO, Canada ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Justin Bieber has appealed to Pope Francis to intercede after an Argentine judge issued an arrest warrant for the Canadian singer for failing to respond to summons related to allegations he ordered bodyguards to attack a photographer in 2013. Judge Alberto Julio Banos ordered the “immediate detention” of Bieber and bodyguards Hugo Alcides Hesny and Terrence Reche Smalls. Bieber is accused of sending the bodyguards to attack photographer Diego Pesoa outside a Buenos Aires nightclub. Bieber never returned to Argentina to respond to questions about the incident. Under Argentine law, Bieber would face from one month to six years in prison if convicted on a charge of causing injuries. After being informed of the arrest order, Bieber immediately asked Pope Francis to convince the judge to cancel the warrant. The singer, who previously had been in trouble with the law many times in the U.S., made his appeal on social media, posting the following message on the Pope’s Facebook page: “Your Excellency (sic) , please help and use your Argentinan (sic) influence to convince Judge Banos to cancel the warrant for my arrest. With my busy schedule of concerts and recordings, I don’t have the time to fly to Buenos Eres (sic) to appear before the judge. I promise to go to confession and receive Holy Community (sic)  when I come visit The Vatican this summer. I will even stage a free concert at St. Peter’s Square.” As of presstime, the Pope has not replied to Bieber’s post. Reblogged this on Global Web Updates .

"SHARON CUNETA, KRIS AQUINO LEAVING THE PHILIPPINES FOR GOOD",https://adobochronicles.com/2015/04/07/sharon-cuneta-kris-aquino-leaving-the-philippines-for-good/,"LOS ANGELES, California ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Speaking to reporters while vacationing in Los Angeles, Filipina megastar Sharon Cuneta revealed plans to leave the Philippines for good and spend her retirement years in America. Cuneta, who just made a recent comeback on the ABS-CBN television network, blamed the scary and unstable conditions in the Philippines which she said won’t be good for her family’s future. Not to be outdone, presidential sister and TV host Kris Aquino followed suit, announcing that she, too, would like to permanently leave her showbiz life in the Philippines and retire in Massachusetts, her family’s home state during the self-imposed exile of her dad, the late Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr. “I’m just sick and tired of being the butt of jokes in the Philippines,” Aquino said, and I am looking forward to a quiet life of retirement in Boston, far from the madding crowd and the glaring spotlight of show business.” ‘I realize that I will not  be the Philippines’ queen of all media forever, and I know — especially when my brother is no longer president — that my legions of fans will eventually diminish,” she said. It seems quite ironic that Aquino made the announcement just days after one of her long-running shows, ‘The Buzz,’ was cancelled by the ABS-CBN network.  She indicated to reporters that she has strong feelings that the next show to get the ax is her mainstay show, “Abunda and Aquino Tonight.” Asked about how she wants to spend her retirement in America, Aquino said, “I’d like to establish several Chowking franchises in the U.S. East Coast,” referring to the Chinese-style Filipino fast food restaurant that’s gaining popularity in America . She already owns one such franchise in Manila. Reblogged this on Denal's Mind and commented: The soonest this becomes a reality the better for the country I think.
