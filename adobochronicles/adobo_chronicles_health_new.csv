"Senator Bato, Be A Man And Apologize!",https://adobochronicles.com/2025/02/08/senator-bato-be-a-man-and-apologize/,"Senator Bato dela Rosa, the ever-reliable defender of discipline and decorum (when convenient), has once again graced us with his brand of leadership—this time, by mocking someone’s post-stroke condition. Perhaps he mistook a medical reality for a punchline, or maybe the years of dodging accountability have dulled his sense of basic decency. Either way, his remarks against Akbayan Representative Perci Cendana weren’t just a cheap shot at one person but an insult to every stroke survivor who has fought to regain dignity and normalcy. An apology isn’t just warranted—it’s the bare minimum. Senator Bato, with all his tough-guy rhetoric, should find it in himself to do what real men do: own up to his mistake. Unless, of course, he believes that cruelty is a mark of strength. If so, maybe he should spend less time making jokes and more time reflecting on why the joke is now on him.",2025-02-08T03:08:20-08:00,"Health & Medicine, Politics, Social Media"
Pro-Duterte Camp Crosses The Line?,https://adobochronicles.com/2025/02/09/pro-duterte-camp-crosses-the-line/,"Ah, the fine art of statesmanship in the Philippines—where our esteemed leaders, instead of engaging in meaningful debate, now resort to slapping threats and medical condition mockery. Truly, a masterclass in parliamentary decorum! Senator Bato dela Rosa clearly inspired by the highest principles of governance, has decided that the best way to prove a point is through a slap, because why use logic when you have the sheer force of your palm? And as if that weren’t enough, the latest stroke (pun intended) of genius from the pro-Duterte camp is hijacking the acronym AIDS—an illness that has caused immense suffering worldwide—just to score political points. Brilliant. What’s next? A rebranding of cancer to mean “Critics Against the Regime”? At this rate, satire will become obsolete because reality itself is doing the job. Shamelessness isn’t just a trait anymore; it’s an entire political platform. Bravo!",2025-02-09T04:51:10-08:00,"Health & Medicine, Politics, Social Media"
Wanted Dead Or Alive: Dengue-Carrying Mosquitoes!,https://adobochronicles.com/2025/02/17/wanted-dead-or-alive-dengue-carrying-mosquitoes/,"by Melchor Vergara, AC team member Ah, the Barangay—the pinnacle of Filipino ingenuity! Where else can you find government programs that mix public service with a game show-like twist? Enter Mandaluyong’s “May Piso sa Mosquito” campaign, where citizens are rewarded for capturing Dengue-carrying mosquitoes. A noble cause, but one that immediately raises some hard-hitting investigative questions. First, how exactly will Barangay officials confirm a mosquito is a Dengue carrier? Will there be a rapid test kit for bloodsucking insects? A mosquito interrogation chamber? Second, what if the mosquito was smuggled in from another Barangay? Will we see an underground mosquito trafficking ring? Third, are all mosquitoes eligible—dead or alive? Because if so, expect an army of entrepreneurs reviving the dried-up mosquitoes from their electric zappers. At this rate, Barangays may soon reward citizens for catching potholes, loose electrical wires, and uncollected garbage. Who needs taxes when you can crowdsource governance one peso at a time?",2025-02-17T02:16:09-08:00,"Health & Medicine, Local News, Social Media"

His latest crusade? Declaring war on lechon, the star of every Filipino noche buena. According to the good doctor, a slice of crispy pork belly is a one-way ticket to a PhilHealth-less future. It’s a bold statement, considering most Filipinos would probably trade a lifetime of health coverage for one bite of perfectly roasted skin. But Dr. Leachon didn’t stop there—he also found himself lost in translation regarding an Iglesia Ni Cristo rally, hilariously misinterpreting its purpose. Imagine promoting a religious event like it’s a cholesterol-awareness campaign! Maybe he thought they were gathering to fast for health reform? While his passion for health is admirable, his penchant for drama and confusion has turned him into a sitcom character.

It’s like a plot twist straight out of a reality TV show: Survivor: Drug Test Edition. One wonders if she’s aware that the real intrigue here isn’t which candidate has the cleanest follicles, but rather, who’s daring enough to call her bluff. To those who say VP Sara’s enthusiasm for these follicular deep dives would be more convincing if she herself underwent a drug and psychiatric test, I say—perhaps her father could join in on the fun! Imagine it: Rodrigo Duterte, the comeback king of Davao City politics, throwing his hat (and follicles) into the ring. After all, given his own history of fentanyl use, shouldn’t he lead by example? Just to make sure that he’s, you know, fully in control and free from any, shall we say, extra help? (Fentanyl is 50x more potent than heroin and when misused the consequences can be fatal.) Ultimately, it’s quite the hair-raising affair. But will it give voters the insight they truly need, or merely add to the circus?

Imagine the disbelief on Bato’s face when drug labs confirm that, yes, even those with shiny domes can be tested—just not from the head. Apparently, body hair, whether it’s from arms, legs, or other areas (ahem), is just as reliable for testing. You could almost see Bato picturing the lab techs awkwardly plucking chest hairs. Bald men everywhere now breathe a collective sigh of relief or disappointment as the case may be, knowing their lack of locks won’t exempt them from scrutiny.

Instead of these futile hearings, Congress should turn its attention to the recent revelation about the Trump-era Pentagon’s clandestine operation to spread anti-vaccine sentiments in the Philippines. According to credible sources, a secretive campaign aimed to harm Chinese interests has specifically focused on the Philippines. Could this have cost thousands of Filipino lives during the Covid-19 pandemic? Now, wouldn’t it be more productive to investigate what could be considered a crime against humanity?

In a stunning display of dedication, she has morphed into a master of manufactured intrigue, conjuring health crises where none exist. The audacity to question President Bongbong Marcos’ well-being—citing some archaic legal provision—is comedy gold. Unlike her idol Duterte, who vanished from the public eye with Houdini-like flair, Marcos remains a visible and vibrant leader. Yet, Pineda’s political machinations masquerade as medical and legal concerns. One might suggest she choose between her Hippocratic Oath and her political fervor, but alas, such a duality seems beyond her grasp. Instead, she tramples on principles of privacy and confidentiality, desperately seeking a scandal.

A recent survey shows that 73% of students feel their views are undervalued by politicians, and with 89% registered to vote and 87% intending to do so, their discontent could critically impact election outcomes. To address this, the Conservatives might consider more progressive policies, such as the legalization of recreational marijuana. While medicinal marijuana has been legal since 2018, the U.K. lags behind many regions that have embraced broader legalization. Adopting such a policy could resonate with younger voters and mitigate the backlash against compulsory service. The issue underscores the importance of engaging with and valuing the perspectives of the younger electorate, whose priorities could significantly shape the political landscape.",2024-05-29T18:24:48-07:00,"Government, Health & Medicine, Legislation, Politics"

Moreover, such names could spark creative public health campaigns. Instead of drab, clinical terms, we could have a gallery of colorful, memorable names that resonate more deeply with the populace.

The estimated cost of Sinovac is P3,629.50 per two doses (according to figures released by Senator Sonny Angara’s office).  A 100% decrease in price would make the vaccine free.

Today, Duque, who co-chairs the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases, announced that the Philippines, under his able leadership, has fattened the curve after almost six months of lockdowns in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking with The Adobo Chronicles, Duque said that the foresight and continued efforts to impose various levels of community quarantine has resulted in Filipinos gaining weight because of the lack of exercise, mobility and nutritious food. “Weighing scale numbers and BMIs (Body Mass Index) have shot off the roof,” the Secretary said, adding that “this only shows that the government has done the right thing to combat the coronavirus. In the latest Senate hearing, Duque told the legislators that the reason he was unable to monitor the financial mess at PhilHealth was because he was very busy with his tasks at DOH and the IATF. ”I hope that with this fattening of the curve” I will be exonerate me from the allegations lodged against me regarding PhilHealth,” Duque said.",2020-09-03T01:52:21-07:00,"Government, Health & Medicine"

Filipinos are worried that the government will eventually require them to always carry a measuring tape in order to accurately calculate the required measurement for physical distancing.

In his latest televised address to the Filipinos, President Rodrigo Duterte said a vaccine for Covid-19 is just “around the corner.” But first, some history: In the spring of 2016, Dengvaxia had a high-profile launch in the Philippines, as the country  became the first in the world to access the live recombinant tetravalent vaccine. The Department of Health spent $67 Million on Dengvaxia and kicked off a mass immunization program with the aim of vaccinating a million students by the end of the year. The immunization program was launched even before completion of the required Phase 3 of the clinical trials. ( Almost all newly-approved drugs would also usually go through a Phase 4 after it is made available in the market to further study their safety and efficacy in the population at large.) It turns out the Philippines may have jumped the gun on the vaccine after numerous reports of children dying as a result of the immunization. Dengvaxia’s manufacturer, Sanofi, also issued a rejoinder later, saying that their vaccine poses some risk to those who have never had a history of Dengue. Fast forward to 2020. The availability of a vaccine has become the Duterte administration’s main mantra in its policies and strategies to curb the spread of the novel coronovirus among the Filipino population. So, one can understand why Duterte and his brilliant Secretary of Health Francisco Duque  are more than ready to jump the gun on the first available Covid-19 vaccine from candidate developers in China and elsewhere. So, is the Philippines poised to repeat history?  Maybe, with some difference. In 2016, the “guinea pigs” for Dengvaxia were school children.  In 2020, Duterte has prioritized the following for the government’s Covid-19 vaccine : (In no particular order) No mention if Duque will be getting the first dose of the new Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available.",2020-07-31T14:57:25-07:00,"Government, Health & Medicine, International"

Throughout the ceremony, the bride and groom will stand, sit or kneel six feet apart. 5. The bride and groom must disinfect with alcohol or sanitize each time they hold hands during the ceremony. 6.

PCOO Quarantines ABS-CBN,https://adobochronicles.com/2020/02/10/pcoo-quarantines-abs-cbn/,"MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) – For once, the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) is doing something in the service of the Filipino by issuing a quarantine order for the ABS-CBN Network. The quarantine order stems from the network’s airing of the movie, “Contagion,” as well as its locally-produced telserye on 24/7 — both dealing with the subject of a virus spread. The airing comes at a time when Filipinos are panicking over the continued spread of the coronavirus in China and other countries. The PCOO order would mean the temporary shutdown of ABS-CBN so that it would not be able to continue airing the films which could only exacerbate the fear already being felt by the Filipino people. It wasn’t clear how long the quarantine period will be, but the worst case scenario is that the order will last until March 20 when ABS-CBN’s media franchise expires. In that case, the quarantine will be forever. Who says “walang forever?” (There is no forever).",2020-02-10T00:59:23-08:00,"Entertainment, Film and TV, Health & Medicine, Media"
Philippine Catholic Churches To Use Thermal Forehead Scanners On Ash Wednesday,https://adobochronicles.com/2020/02/18/philippine-catholic-churches-to-use-thermal-forehead-scanners-on-ash-wednesday/,"MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) – On Ash Wednesday, millions of Catholic Filipinos will flock to their churches to receive holy ash on their foreheads —a ritual that kicks off the observance of the annual Lenten season. But as part of the Catholic Church’s precautionary measures in connection with the coronavirus threat, some changes will be implemented this year. In Caloocan, Bishop Pablo Virgilio David has suggested that instead of marking a cross, dry ash will be sprinkled on people’s foreheads. However, for the protection of priests and other clergy, only church attendees wearing N95 facial masks will be given the sprinkled ash. Elsewhere, the marking with ash will be totally scrapped in favor of using thermal scanners on people’s foreheads to check for temperature that could be a sign of infection with COVID 19. Those with temperature will be immediately referred to the Department of Health for investigation and possible quarantine.  Ambulances will be on standby outside the churches. A spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines told The Adobo Chronicles that the measures are but part of the Catholic’s commitment to do its share in preventing the spread of the coronavirus.

Effective Ways to Do Your Homework While Depressed,https://adobochronicles.com/2020/02/17/effective-ways-to-do-your-homework-while-depressed/,"(Editor’s note: Occasionally, The Adobo Chronicles publishes guest articles on serious and important topics that we feel will benefit our readers.) ************* First of all, and it is essential for us to start with this information, if you are clinically depressed , you have to be supervised by your doctor. It doesn’t mean that you mandatory should take medication, but it certainly implies the Internet should not be the only source of information for you now. However, if you are already dealing with this state and need some more tips on how to operate your life right now, or you are just feeling down, without any specific diagnosis, this article can be useful. Imagine that you are driving a stick in cold weather, and you need to get to the hill. You cannot go too fast — as there is a hill, and you cannot stop the engine completely, because it will be extremely hard to make it work again. So, you need to move slow and steady and maintain the pressure. You cannot expect your brain to be very productive by itself while you are depressed; it needs manual actuation. What is even more important, you have to do at least something productive daily. Otherwise, you will feel into a guilt-trap, which provoked more procrastination, which provokes more guilt, and it provokes not doing anything at all. So, don’t make huge plans, but follow the small ones you make. Let’s say so if you are truly depressed, you cannot prioritize homework. You can prioritize other things, which will help you to have enough energy for homework or at least its part. Some of those things are healthy eating, fresh air, and exercises. Healthy eating is not for your shape, it is for your blood sugar level, which should not jump there and back, as it can only make the situation worse. Less processed food, fewer sweeteners, no energetic drinks, dark chocolate instead of bars, more vegetables, and protein — this should be your nutrition plan. It may sound rather boring, but we are not magicians here, you have to work to get results. Exercises have multiple effects. First, they maintain the level of cortisol — the neuromodulator responsible for stress. Second, they help you to live the cycle of stress to the end. In our society, showing emotions is not the most common practice, and often we collect small unresolved stresses in our head. It is bad because we don’t have closure with negative situations. Sports, especially running and other active types, gives us that closure, and it helps to clear your mind very well. Online and offline, there are lots of support groups full of people who temporarily experience the same difficulties as you. You can communicate with them, share your anxiety, offer help to others, and receive some assistance yourself. It is always very good to talk to people who understand what you are going through. If at some point you realize that you cannot deal with all the assignments on your own, don’t hesitate and ask for help. A simple “ write my homework ” request sent to a reliable writing service can solve many problems. You can find recommendations and feedback about such companies in support groups and just online. Of course, it should not become a common practice, but you can use this option from time to time to improve your situation with homework. Yes, it is not the most inspiring thing to read, but positive psychology doesn’t work in every situation. You should realize that if you are in a bad mental, psychological state right now, your goal cannot sound like “stellar educational results and perfect marks.” It is unrealistic and will only make you more sad and discouraged. Your goal right now should be “to cope with the situation and my education process at a sufficient level. Sufficient level doesn’t sound like something bad or intimidating. When you lower the bar, you can clearly see it and plan your activities more adequately. Of course, it doesn’t mean you should allow yourself just to be lazy, or not to be attentive in class. In the case of depression or any other bad psychological state, you should not neglect to address professionals for help.",2020-02-17T10:25:19-08:00,"Education, Health & Medicine"

Sanofi has admitted that Dengvaxia could cause severe effects for those who have not had Dengue previously.  Also, because Dengvaxia is a ‘live’ (attenuated) vaccine, it could bring about serious, adverse affects for those with autoimmune disorders like lupus, HIV/AIDS or even rheumatoid arthritis.

Kagaya rin ng bigas yan PAB: Hindi ka puwedeng magbenta ng bigas kung wala kang lisensiya mula sa NFA (National Food Authority). Kagaya rin ng restaurant yan: Hindi ka puwedeng magbukas ng restaurant kung wala kang lisensiya and kung hindi ka papasa sa mga health and safety standards ng gobyerno. “Good Faith” kamo? Aba, eh kung puro good faith na lang ang paraan ng pamamalakad ng gobyerno, malalason na lahat tayong mga Pilipino! Ang vaccine at (legal) na droga ay hindi parang inihaw na pusit na binebenta sa mga kanto kanto. Ito ay may malaking impact sa kalusugan at BUHAY ng mga mabibigyan nito. Sa ibang bansa, aabutin ng hangang labin-lima or higit pa na taon bago ang isang droga ay maaprobahan ng gobyerno. At ito ay matapos lamang ng maiging pagsusuri sa iba’t-ibang phases ng clinical trials. Good faith ba kamo na aprobahan ni PNoy ang Dengue vaccine kahit wala pang rekomendasyon ng World Health Organization? Ang tunay na good faith ay ang pagtiwala ng mga magulang ng mga batang nabigyan ng Dengue vaccine. Nagtiwala sila sa gobyerno ni PNoy na ang vaccine ay makakabuti sa kanilang mga anak. Yon pala, tinurukan ang mga bata ng maaaring ikamatay nila. Huwag na muna nating pag-usapan ang bilyun-bilyong piso na sangkot sa vaccine na ito. Ibang istorya din yan. Hindi ko alam kung may anak ka or mga batang pamangkin, PAB, pero masasabi mo ba sa mga magulang at kamag-anak ng mga batang naturukan ng Dengue vaccine na “Buhay pa naman sila, di ba?” Sincerely, Rene Astudillo, Politikal Pinoy",2017-12-03T15:13:49-08:00,"Government, Health & Medicine, Politics, Social Media"
Senator Trillanes To File A Complaint With ICC Against PNoy For ‘Crimes Against Humanity’,https://adobochronicles.com/2017/12/02/senator-trillanes-to-file-a-complaint-with-icc-against-pnoy-for-crimes-against-humanity/,"MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) – We all remember when Senator Antonio Trillanes and Representative Gary Alejano travelled to The Hague in The Netherlands to personally file a complaint against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte before the International Criminal Court (ICC). The couple accused Duterte of committing “crimes against humanity” for his deadly war on drugs. Well, it seems that Trillanes is a true warrior fighting for justice and human rights. And it’s nothing  partisan. Today, the Senator told The Adobo Chronicles that he will leave shortly for The Hague, this time to file a complaint against ex-President NoyNoy Aquino and his administration officials for giving the go-signal to vaccinate Filipino school children against Dengue in early 2016. The vaccine manufacturer has now aknowledged that the vaccine could cause serious Dengue disease to those who received the new drug but were not previously infected with the Dengue virus. All in all, it is estimated that some 700,000 Filipino children were vaccinated with the drug at a time when it has not yet been approved for distribution by the World Health Organization. ”This is worse than Duterte’s war on drugs,” Trillanes said.  “It’s tantamount to genocide.

We now know that the Dengue vaccine — as admitted by the manufacturer — has the potential of causing more serious Dengue disease among those who had not had a previous Dengue infection.

The scientists believe that memory loss is the result of the human brain reaching its full capacity.  The older one gets, the more information is stored in the brain, and just like with a computer, when its memory becomes full, it starts to slow down. The solution, they said, is to implant a chip or computer RAM (Random Access Memory) into the brain. This can add gigs of memory to the slowing human brain. “It’s just like implanting a pace-maker for the human heart,” the scientists said. “We have both the medical and technological capability to do the brain implants.” Today’s announcement sent the value of computer chips skyrocketing at the Philippine Stock Exchange, especially those of companies engaged in computer trade with China.

Despite being an agricultural country, the Philippines still imports rice and pork because local production can’t keep up with demand. One senator just has the perfect solution towards rice self-sufficiency: ban white rice.  She unveiled her proposal as she chowed down a plateful of macaroni and breaded fried fish (see photo). Cynthia Villar believes that Filipinos should eat less, and shift to brown rice.  So she wants to ban white rice altogether. In the interim, she wants Filipino restaurants to stop offering “extra” or “unlimited” rice on their menu. “Hindi na uso ang mestiza,” villar says, referring to the Filipino aversion to fair skin, as opposed to brown complexion, known in the local dialect as “kayumanggi.” The reality is, brown rice is more nutritious so Villar might have a point there, but it is also more expensive. When asked by The Adobo Chronicles what she plans to do about the country’s short supply of pork, she said that senators and representatives should be able to continue receiving DAP funds (Disbursement Acceleration Program) so that they can help their respective constitutents cope with the high cost of pork, and of brown rice for that matter. DAP is more popularly known as pork barrel, previously ruled by the country’s Supreme Court as unconstitutional. More healthy? Makes me laugh. She’s a politician.

Why Incidence Of Hypertension Is Highest Among Devout Catholics In The Philippines,https://adobochronicles.com/2017/04/06/why-incidence-of-hypertension-is-highest-among-devout-catholics-in-the-philippines/,"MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) – A still to be released study shows that in the Philippines, the incidence of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease is highest among devout Catholics. And it has to do with Fridays and Lent. We are in the midst of the holiest of seasons, which culminates on Easter Sunday.  Each Friday during Lent, Catholics are expected to abstain from meat. But the more devout Catholics have made every Friday throughout the year as “fish Friday.” So what has that got to do with high blood pressure? Many Filipinos don’t have easy access to fresh fish, or where it is readily available, the cost is prohibitive.  So they turn to dried fish 🐟 which is fairly inexpensive: tuyo, tinapa, dilis. Problem is, dried fish has a very high sodium content, as high as 166% of daily nutritional values. (See nutritional chart for dried fish) In most people, the kidneys have trouble keeping up with the excess sodium in the bloodstream. As sodium accumulates, the body holds onto water to dilute the sodium. This increases both the amount of fluid surrounding cells and the volume of blood in the bloodstream. Increased blood volume means more work for the heart and more pressure on blood vessels. Over time, the extra work and pressure can stiffen blood vessels, leading to high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. It can also lead to heart failure. There is also some evidence that too much salt can damage the heart, aorta, and kidneys without increasing blood pressure, and that it may be bad for bones, too. High blood pressure is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease. It accounts for two-thirds of all strokes and half of heart disease. Imagine consuming high amounts of sodium every Friday, assuming one doesn’t eat dried fish on other days of the week.  Overload! So, we’re calling on the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines to grant all Filipinos a special dispensation from abstinence so that we may be able to significantly reduce hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the country. Either that or Catholic Churches should give out free fresh fish to their congregation on each Friday of the year. That’s a good way to unload and liquidate their financial investments.",2017-04-06T23:34:18-07:00,"Economy, Food, Health & Medicine, Religion"

( The Adobo Chronicles, Washington Bureau) – No one knows exactly how many Filipino nurses are working in the United States. But if the state of California is a window to America, then the answer is: a lot. It is estimated that 20% all the registered nurses in California are Filipino, a considerably large percentage since Filipinos number only 2.3 million (officially 1.2 million) out of a state population of 38 million. What is the future of Filipino nurses seeking employment in the U.S., given President Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policy and his campaign against both legal and illegal immigration? Well, there’s good news and bad news. First the good news: The Trump administration, realizing the high demand for nurses in the United States, has not closed to door to extending immigrant visas specifically to Filipinos.  As more and more baby boomers age, requiring skilled nursing services in and out of clinics and hospitals, America definitely needs more licensed nurses. The bad news: In addition to passing the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) in order to be able to work in the U.S., Filipino nurses applying for immigrant visas must either prove that they intend to marry a U.S. citizen within six months of their arrival in America or that they are already engaged to be married to a U.S. citizen. (Donald Trump sees this as consistent with his America First policy.) Acceptable documentation could include email correspondence between the visa applicant nurse and his or her U.S. citizen partner explicitly showing a romantic relationship. More points will be awarded to nurse applicants who can show an engagement ring received by mail from the U.S. citizen partner. For now, and until the Trump administration voids same-sex marriage in the U.S., same-sex partner relationships will be recognized in the visa application process.",2017-03-01T14:51:21-08:00,"Government, Health & Medicine, Immigration, International"

The document, a certification from Trump’s personal physician, shows that he is suffering from psychosinusitis-XL. There are only about three hundred people worldwide suffering from this condition. Psychosinusitis-XL is a mental condition which affects a person’s brain. It alters the normal function which allows a person to determine right from wrong, truth from falsehood and childhood vs. adulthood.  The illness manifests itself through the sinuses — the reason it is called psychosinusitis.

The researchers found that high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in humans causes weight gain, and sometimes, obesity. Researcher Lars-Georg Hersoug stumbled on a weird anomaly while studying cardiovascular health and obsesity. Over a 22-year period, both thin and fat people put on weight, and the increase was proportionally the same. CO2 appears to make our blood more acidic, which influences our brain to want to eat more. Hersoug surmised that excess CO2 in the atmosphere might be affecting hormones in the brain known as orexin neurons. Orexins stimulate eating, wakefulness and energy expenditure. Danish researchers at the University of Copenhagen conducted further testing. Under controlled conditions, men with the greater amount of CO2 in their blood ate 6 percent more food than men in climate rooms with less CO2. The Danish findings prompted Weight Watchers and other diet experts to throw out the popular low-carb diet and replace it with low-carbon diet. The low-carbon diet does not involve any special food intake or avoidance of any food items or ingredients.  Rather, it promotes the use of surgical face masks , 24 hours a day, to avoid exposure to excessive amounts of carbon dioxide, which ultimately will reduce food cravings.

( The Adobo Chronicles, Washington Bureau) – If you consume wine and coffee or eat chocolates on a regular basis, you no longer need to feel guilty about it. In a stunning announcement today, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has reclassified wine as fruit and coffee and chocolate as vegetables. This means that it will now be much easier for Americans to follow the government’s nutritional guide, MyPlate, released in June, 2011. MyPlate is the current nutrition guide published by the USDA — a pie chart depicting a place setting with a plate and glass divided into five food groups. It replaced the USDA’s MyPyramid guide, ending 19 years of USDA food pyramid diagrams. MyPlate is divided into sections of approximately 30 percent grains, 40 percent vegetables, 10 percent fruits and 20 percent protein, accompanied by a smaller circle representing dairy, such as a glass of milk or a yogurt cup. MyPlate is supplemented with additional recommendations, such as “Make half your plate fruits and vegetables.” USDA says that it just makes sense to classify wine as fruit since it comes from grapes, and to consider both coffee and chocolate as vegetables because they come from plants.

"NOT SO FAST ABOUT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, THEY CAUSE CANCER TOO!",https://adobochronicles.com/2015/10/29/not-so-fast-about-fruits-and-vegetables-they-cause-cancer-too/,"LONDON, Great Britain ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Consumers the world over abruptly abandoned bacon, hotdogs and processed meat in their diets and quickly turned to eating fruits and vegetables.  This, after the World Health Organization confirmed last week that processed meat causes cancer. But wait, are fruits and vegetables really safe? Not according to a new study by researchers at Glasgow University. They have linked increased use of nitrate fertilisers — used in the production of fruits and vegetables  — to an alarming rise in gullet cancer in Britain. The disease – which affects three times more men than women – kills more than 3,000 people in the UK every year, a threefold increase over the past 20 years. It is more common than stomach cancer. The increase has puzzled researchers. But Glasgow University researchers, led by Professor Kenneth McColl, have discovered a link between nitrates in fruit and vegetables and gullet cancer. ‘It appears that the mass production of vegetables in the Western world since the last world war may be the underlying factor that has led to such huge increases in this form of cancer,’ he added. McColl said it was unlikely that organic food would be any healthier, because it also contained substantial levels of nitrate, some of which came from natural fertilisers such as manure. His research has so far revealed that green and root vegetables contain the highest levels of nitrate. Following the release of the Glasgow study, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that people stop eating meats, fruits and vegetables altogether and stick to a liquid diet — like purified water and beer. WHO also suggested that if people can’t survive on liquids, then they should go on a paleo diet, one that is based on how stone age humans ate and survived.",2015-10-29T18:14:02-07:00,"Food, Health & Medicine"

Now, all of Hawaii is protesting against the international organization for one reason: SPAM musubi. SPAM, of course, is the canned processed meat manufactured by Minnesota-based Hormel Foods.  Like all other processed meat products, SPAM is preserved by using a carcinogenic ingredient known as sodium nitrate, which WHO says is responsible for causing cancer. SPAM musubi is a popular snack and lunch food in Hawaii composed of a slice of grilled SPAM on top of a block of rice, wrapped together with nori dried seaweed in the tradition of Japanese omusubi. Inexpensive and portable, SPAM musubi are commonly found near cash registers in ABC stores, refrigerated sections of supermarkets and hole-in-the-wall food outlets and trucks all over Hawaii.

Edgardo de la Cruz, president of the National Association of Longganisa and Tocino Makers (NALTM) said his group disputes the WHO findings, saying that Filipinos (and Filipino expatriates) have been eating their products every morning for many decades without any reports of increased cancer incidence. “It is unfair to single  out processed meat among the many food products and beverages that do, indeed, cause cancer,” de la Cruz said, adding, “We demand that WHO retract its statement because it will have a very serious impact on the longganisa and tocino business.” NALTM is afraid that the WHO announcement will cause heart attack among small business owners who depend on longannisa and tocino- making, much more than processed meat will cause cancer.",2015-10-26T06:15:35-07:00,"Food, Health & Medicine"

"CITING CANCER LINK, USDA BANS CURED BACON",https://adobochronicles.com/2015/10/24/citing-cancer-link-usda-bans-cured-bacon/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Imagine breakfast without bacon. Now you don’t have to. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has banned the production and sale of cured bacon in the country because of its link to cancer. Bacon is either cured or uncured while all bacon is soaked in brine to give it flavor and prevent botulism. It is traditionally cured using a mixture of salt, water and synthetic sodium nitrite that acts as a preservative and made by mixing Nitrates, a naturally occurring compound in plants, with certain bacteria. The USDA ban does not cover uncured bacon. Uncured bacon uses natural nitrates found in juice, sea salt and celery powder to achieve a similar taste, so uncured bacon does not have potentially harmful chemicals akin to sodium nitrite. Soon after the  surprising USDA announcement, the National Association of American Chefs (NAAC) filed papers in court seeking an injunction to stop USDA from implementing the ban. “This will end the culinary career,” a spokesperson for NAAC said. “Bacon is to hotels and restaurants just like butter is to Julia Child and Paula Deen!” Consumers nationwide are joining the NAAC in supporting the injunction. In fact, a million march is being planned in Washington, D.C. the Sunday before Thanksgiving to demand the reinstatement of cured bacon as the beloved miracle ingredient in home cooking and holiday meals. Meanwhile, big box stores like Costco and large supermaket chains like Safeway have reported that their freezers have practically been emptied in the last 24 hours by customers panicking about the soon-to-disappear cured bacon.",2015-10-24T07:00:42-07:00,"Food, Government, Health & Medicine"

GUACAMOLE SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/08/11/guacamole-shortage-in-california/,"SAN FRANCISCO, California ( The Adobo Chronicles ® ) –  From Safeway to Whole Foods to Trader Joe’s, avocados have disappeared from grocery shelves, and the situation has created a severe shortage of guacamole  in California. Taquerias have been serving salsa with their corn chips, minus the guacamole. The Chipotle restaurant chain has set a limit of one teaspoon of guacamole on the side for each of their popular menus. Subway has crossed out ‘avocado’ from their menu marquee. So what’s happening? Well, it turns out that the guacamole shortage began shortly after a new study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association concluded that contrary to popular belief, avocados help reduce cholesterol. Many people avoid avocados, thinking they’re too fattening and  that they raise blood  cholesterol. Though avocados are high in calories for a fruit (110 to 180 per half, depending on the variety), that doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily gain weight if you eat them. And though it’s true that avocados have a lot of fat (10 to 15 grams per half), the fat—like that in olive and canola oils—is predominantly monounsaturated fat, which doesn’t raise blood cholesterol. In fact, avocados may actually help reduce cholesterol, according to the study. As a result, heart-healthy Californians have been buying avocados in bulk from Costco, Safeway and other grocery stores. Consequently, Walgreens, Rite-Aid and other pharmacies have noticed a significant decline in customers filling their prescriptions for lovastatin and othe cholesterol-lowering drugs. Governor Jerry Brown has called for an emergency meeting in Sacramento this morning to address the guacamole shortage. Among the measures Brown is expected to announce is the plan to increase the state’s avocado imports from Mexico. Expect Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to oppose the importation.

Today, the Ohio State University released a study which all but confirms that selfie taking and posting on the Internet is, indeed, a psychological disorder. In the study, men who posted more photos of themselves online scored higher in measures of narcissism and psychopathy. The researchers asked 800 men between the ages of 18 and 40 to fill out an online questionnaire asking about their photo posting habits on social media. The survey included questions about how often they posted photos of themselves on social media, and about whether and how they edited photos before posting. The participants were also asked to fill out standard questionnaires measuring anti-social behaviors and self-objectification (the tendency to overly focus on one’s appearance). The researchers found that posting more photos was correlated with both narcissism and psychopathy. Editing photos, however, was only associated with narcissism, and not psychopathy. Narcissism measures inflated self-image (often motivated by underlying insecurity), while psychopathy involves a lack of empathy and impulsive behavior. themselves online scored higher in measures of narcissism and psychopathy. The study focused on men, but it is common knowledge that women outpace men in terms of taking self photos, editing them and posting them on the Internet. Consequently, many social scientists and mental health professionals wonder whether selfitis symptoms are more prevalent and severe in women than in men. That would be the subject of the next study.

NEW ALLEGATION: DID MAYWEATHER TAKE BANNED SUBSTANCE IN HIS LOCKER ROOM BEFORE FIGHT WITH PACQUIAO?,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/05/13/new-allegation-did-mayweather-take-banned-substance-in-his-locker-room-before-fight-with-pacquiao/,"LAS VEGAS, Nevada ( The Adobo Chronicles) – There is no stopping the controversies following the May 2 ‘Fight of the Century’ between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather. A new, serious allegation has just surfaced: that Mayweather took prohibited drugs in his locker room at MGM Grand just before he entered the ring to face the Filipino boxer. According to a news report , multiple bottles of the pill Muscle Rev were found in Mayweather’s locker room. While the steroid-like pill is legal, many sports federations, including the World Boxing Association, have banned its use by their athletes. If proven, the allegation could overturn the judges’ unanimous decision declaring Mayweather the winner of the controversial fight. But Mayweather fans can breathe a huge sigh of relief. Singer Justin Bieber has come forward to announce that those pill bottles were his, not Mayweather’s. Bieber is a known fanatic of Mayweather, always standing beside the boxer  at ringside and in the locker room. Reblogged this on mmm1mmm2good and commented: What about us Bieber fans, left to wonder why the singer took multiple bottles of pills immediately before the fight or whether he took a reasonable amount of pills, only to save the empty packaging to discard in Mayweather’s locker room on the eve of the largest payday of any boxer’s career?

According to a group of microbiologists in New Mexico, the rancid bacteria that beards collect could be putting owners’ health at risk. Microbiologist John Golobic, of Quest Diagnostics, swabbed a number of beards searching for bacteria for the study and found that some of the bacteria “are the kind of things that you find in feces.” Quest Diagnostics was named in the lawsuit, along with all media companies and Internet sites that carried stories about the study. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is representing the bearded men. “As a result of the poop stories, bearded men have experienced discrimination at work, in public places, even within their social circles,” the ACLU said.

NEXT ON INDIANA LEGISLATURE’S AGENDA: BAN BIRTH CONTROL PILLS,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/03/30/next-on-indiana-legislatures-agenda-ban-birth-control-pills/,"INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Now that Governor Mike Pence has signed the legislation giving Indiana citizens the right to discriminate against gay men and women on the basis of religious belief, the Indiana State Legislature is busy preparing for its next major agenda: to ban birth control pills. Oddly enough, the new proposed legislation is not based on religious belief. Rather, it is based on science and the environment! As reported in The Washington Post, an alarming number of fish in rivers and oceans has been found to be gender-bending — making them unable to reproduce. This, according to scientists, will eventually wipe out the world’s supply of fish. The culprit for this phenomenon? The birth control pill. Flushed down toilets, poured down sinks and excreted in urine, a chemical component in the pill wafts into sewage systems and ends up in various waterways where it collects in fairly heavy doses. That’s where fish soak it up. A recent survey by the U.S. Geological Survey found that fish exposed to a synthetic hormone called 17a-ethinylestradiol, or EE2, produced offspring that struggled to fertilize eggs. The grandchildren of the originally exposed fish suffered a 30 percent decrease in their fertilization rate. Immediately after the news came out, the Republican members of Indiana’s Legislature convened a caucus to draft a bill that would totally ban birth control pills as a way to protect the fish population. Governor Pence vowed to sign the bill as soon as it comes to his desk. “This is no longer a matter of religious belief,” Pence said. “Rather, it is a matter of protecting the environment.” “We’re not necessarily a fan of gender-bending,” Pence added. fyi  some people need to take birth control pills for other reasons than birth control!

The head of Microsoft and his wife, Melinda, were reportedly in Los Baños, Laguna — south of the capital, Manila — to visit the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Gates is the biggest donor of the Institute, contributing $18 Million dollars annually. Reports also indicate that the billionaire couple spent some R&R in a plush resort in Palawan, a fast-growing tourist destination in the Philippines. A spokesperson for Malacañang Palace (the presidential residence) confirmed that back in November, Gates requested for a courtesy visit to President NoyNoy Aquino, but that the request was subsequently withdrawn by Gates himself. No reason for the withdrawal was given by the Palace. Many Filipinos are comparing the snub to the time of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos, when then First Lady, Imelda Romualdez Marcos was stood up by the visiting Beatles , and failed to show up for their scheduled appointment at Malacañang. A source close to Gates told The Adobo Chronicles that the reason the billionaire cancelled the request was because he was later informed that Aquino is a chain smoker.

Effective March 15, 2015, the state of California will impose a comprehensive ban on all pork imports from the Philippines. The ban covers livestock, frozen meat and packaged pork-based food items. The Manila government immediately criticized the move, saying that California is merely retaliating for a recent ban on chicken imports from California imposed by the Philippines.  The chicken ban was a result of confirmed cases of Avian or Bird Flu found in several chicken farms in California. But California Governor Jerry Brown told reporters that the state’s decision to ban Philippine pork imports was the result of a series of serious considerations which began after Filipino business people and senators were accused and jailed for the pork barrel scandal which defrauded taxpayers of some Ten Billion Pesos. The pork barrel money allegedly went into the pockets of the individuals accused of the massive scam. “We’re simply taking precaution to make sure that our state government, especially our state legislature, will not engage in similar pork scams ” Brown said. The price of pork in the world market currently averages $198.00 per barrel. U.S. imports of agricultural products from the Philippines totaled $991 million in 2013 alone.

The appointment comes on the heels of the growing number of cases of measles which many believe have been precipitated by unvaccinated children. Over the last decade, many Americans have made the difficult decision not to vaccinate their children against communicable diseases like measles and hepatitis for fear the vaccinations have adverse, damaging consequences. Obama appointed Paul after the senator, an opthalmologist, made an impassioned statement on live TV regarding vaccinations. He argued Monday that debate over whether to allow parents more choice in the vaccination of their children was a matter of “freedom,” citing personal knowledge of kids “who wound up with profound mental disorders” after receiving immunizations for diseases like Hepatitis B and measles. “I don’t think there’s anything extraordinary about resorting to freedom,” the potential 2016 presidential candidate, said in an interview with CNBC. “We sometimes give five or six vaccines all at one time,” he said of immunizations of newborns for Hepatitis B. “I chose to have mine delayed….Do I think it’s ultimately a good idea? Yeah. So I had mine staggered over several months. I’ve heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children, who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.

UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES RESEARCHERS DISCOVER A CURE FOR JETLAG,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/02/15/university-of-the-philippines-researchers-discover-a-cure-for-jetlag/,"QUEZON CITY, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles) – It happens to many world travelers. They cross the International Dateline and arrive at their destination jetlagged, sometimes for days. Now the good news: researchers at the University of the Philippines (U.P.) Medical School have finally found a cure for jetlag and all along,  it has been in the market for many decades. We’re talking about San Mig Light, the 100-calorie version of the Philippines’ signature premium beer, San Miguel. Just a 330 ML bottle of San Mig Light instantly makes jetlag go away, depending on the severity of one’s affliction. For severe cases of jetlag, it could take up to three bottles of the poplar beer to be effective. The U.P. research study involved 500 mildly to severely jetlagged travelers arriving in Manila from countries in Europe and North America. Ninety percent of those who were mildly jetlagged got instantly better after consuming just one bottle of San Mig Light. Ninety three percent of the severely jetlagged got better after three beers. The researchers also experimented with other beer brands as well as the regular San Miguel beer, but did not have the same results, “so there must be something in San Mig Light that’s doing the trick,” they said. Immediately after the results of study were released, stock prices of San Miguel Corporation, makers of San Mig Light, more than tripled at the Makati Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the Manila-based University of Santo Tomas Medical School, considered the oldest Catholic University in all of Asia, announced it was launching a clinical study to find out whether San Mig Light can cure insomnia. I had such a horrible experience with jet lag last year. I thought I’ll never travel again however when I found JetLagFX, I enjoy my vacation experience again. It’s a organic supplement that treats all the stress and tiredness I felt everytime I travel. Like Like",2015-02-15T14:34:39-08:00,Health & Medicine
CNN FIRES ANCHOR DON LEMON OVER SELFIE,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/02/03/cnn-fires-anchor-don-lemon-over-selfie/,"ATLANTA, Georgia ( The Adobo Chronicles) – A half-naked Don Lemon, news anchor at CNN, took a selfie and posted it on social media. He was immediately fired by CNN. Many saw it coming. Lemon has earned a controversial reputation as news anchor, asking African American kids to pull up their pants, suggesting the missing Malaysia Airlines plane was kidnapped by a higher power, and asking a Muslim guest on his show if he supported ISIS.  Oh, and did we mention he smelled marijuana while covering the Ferguson protests? Today, Lemon posted a photo of his half-naked body on his Twitter account showing his scar from the measles vaccination he got as a child. It was meant to promote his prime-time show in which he invited medical experts to discuss the growing controversy over child vaccinations. CNN, in a prepared statement, said Lemon was fired not because of his half-naked selfie, but for showing his scar from his measles vaccination. There was a big problem with Lemon’s tweet. Measles shots do not leave scars. Lemon’s scar was from his smallpox vaccination.

NEW STANFORD STUDY SAYS CUSTOM BREAD TOASTER CAN CURE SELFITIS,https://adobochronicles.com/2015/02/02/new-stanford-study-says-custom-bread-toaster-can-cure-selfitis/,"PALO ALTO, California ( The Adobo Chronicles) – Researchers at Stanford University Medical School have found an unusual cure for selfitis, a mental disorder defined by the American Psychiatric Association as “the obsessive-compulsive urge to take photos of one’s self and posting them on social media.” It is estimated that 250 Million people worldwide suffer from selfitis. The new cure is in the form of a ‘selfie toaster’ which imprints personalized selfie photos on bread slices. The kitchen appliance is manufactured and distrubuted by Vermont Novelty Toaster Corporation . The Vermont-based company is the same manufacturer of the ‘Jesus toaster’ and the ‘Virgin Mary toaster.’ For just $75, you can now order a custom image toaster that will brown your face, or any other image you submit, into toasted bread, said company owner Galen Dively. The Stanford researchers  studied 500 individuals suffering from chronic selfitis and provided them with customized selfie toasters. After just six months of tracking the study participants, researchers found that 75% were cured of selfitis and have totally stopped taking selfies. “We believe that the daily routine of ‘consuming one’s self’ for breakfast creates a subconscious resolve to keep the ego in check,” the researchers concluded. So much for the saying, “You’re toast!” Now we can say, “You’re cured!” Of selfitis.",2015-02-02T06:10:16-08:00,"Business, Health & Medicine, Human Interest, Technology"

LOUIS, Missouri ( The Adobo Chronicles) – A new study from the University of Missouri confirms what botanists have long suspected: plants and vegetables have feelings just like humans and animals. The research shows that plants can sense when they are being eaten and send out defense mechanisms to try to stop it from happening. The study was carried out on thale cress, which is closely related to broccoli, kale, mustard greens, and other siblings of the brassica family and is popular for science experiments. According to the research study, the thale cress produces mustard oils that are mildly toxic when eaten and sends them throughout its leaves to try to keep the predators away. The research also revealed that when the plants feel or hear “munching vibrations” from caterpillar and other plant-eating organisms, they send out extra mustard oils. This new finding is greatly disturbing to vegans and vegetarians, most of whom practice this lifestyle because they cannot fathom the thought of animals being killed or butchered for food. “Now what alternative do we have if we can’t eat meat or vegetables,” said one practicing vegan living in San Francisco’s Haight District. Meanwhile, Catholics around the globe are anxiously awaiting a pronouncement from Pope Francis, who, in just the last several weeks, said that all animals go to heaven.  The question they want answered by The Vatican is: do plants and vegetables go to heaven too? uhmm, lol?

The Moscow government believes that transsexual and transgender people have mental disorders and should not be allowed to drive because they cause too many accidents. In addition, Fetishism, exhibitionism and voyeurism are also included as “mental disorders” now barring people from driving. In San Francisco, members of the transgender community, the leather community, BDSMs, exhibitionists, voyeurs and others who identify with certain fetishes — in short, those who attend the annual Folsom Street Fair — have vowed to boycott travel to Russia and promised to refrain from buying goods and services that have the Russian label on them. This is not the first Russian boycott in San Francisco.  In 2013, when the Putin Government made “promoting non-traditional lifestyles” illegal, many gay bars in San Francisco and elsewhere boycotted Russian vodka.  That boycott quickly fizzled out mostly because the boycotted vodka that is sold in the West, Stoli, is made in Latvia, not Russia. Mikhail Strakhov, a Russian psychiatric expert, told the BBC that the definition of “mental disorders” was too vague and some disorders would not affect a person’s ability to drive a car safely. However, a Putin spokesperson said that transsexuals and transgenders cannot concentrate on their driving because their eyes are constantly wandering, looking out for cute Russian guys or gals on the road.  He added that exhibitionists can distract other drivers, while those with fetishes are always dreaming about their previous or next encounters. “The roads are just not safe if we allow these people to drive cars,” the spokesperson said.",2015-01-08T16:56:43-08:00,"Health & Medicine, Law Enforcement, Travel"

( The Adobo Chronicles) – Ron Klain, the Democratic power broker and Washington attorney appointed by President Barack Obama in October to manage the America’s response to its isolated Ebola outbreaks, is set to leave his newly created job on March 1. Klain was appointed in October 17 last year as the Centers for Disease Control and other government agencies grappled to contain the public’s jitters over several Ebola infection cases. He is set to return to his previous job in the private sector. Not so fast. In an announcement today that suprised many, Klain included, The White House said Obama is appointing the Ebola Czar as the new Measles Czar.  The action came in the wake of the recent outbreak of measles cases, largely traced to the Disneyland theme park in Southern California. Once thought to have been eliminated in the U.S., the highly contagious disease is back with a vengeance, thanks to world travel and the growing movement against vaccinations in the U.S. Dozens of confirmed measles cases have been reported in recent weeks.  In contrast, one can count confirmed Ebola cases in the U.S. with less than five fingers,  with only one recorded death from the virus. In an interview with Klain, the lawyer informed The Adobo Chronicles that he was inclined to accept the nomination primarily to make up for the salary he received doing practically nothing as the country’s Ebola Czar. “This would be a great way to give back,” Klain said of his new nomination.

Tolentino also encouraged people , including priests, nuns, seminarians and the elderly who will wait for hours to see the pope to also wear diapers. He said that there won’t be enough portable toilets for the millions of people expected to see Pope Francis hold an open-air mass at the seaside Rizal Park on 18 January. “If you attend an event that will last for 24 hours, you cannot go around looking for a [portable toilet],” Tolentino said. Our investigation confirmed that the MMDA purchased all available adult diaper supplies from the big box stores in the U.S. in order to meet the demand during the Pope’s visit. Filipino Americans were also seen buying the adult diapers in bulk to send via Balikbayan Box (Tax-free shipping boxes) to their relatves planning to participate in the papal visit activities in Manila.

The announcement came in Stockholm just minutes after the United States has been officially declared ‘Ebola-free.’ In the last three months, about 1,000 people were being monitored by health officials for possible exposure to the deadly virus. Several schools in Texas and Ohio shut down because of a single patient who boarded a plane. A cruise ship was refused permission to dock in Cozumel, off Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. The governors of New York and New Jersey sought to quarantine incoming airport passengers suspected of carrying the virus. Polls showed a majority of Americans were concerned that Ebola would spread out of control in the U.S., thanks to the scare-mongering politicians and the ratings-hungry media. On Tuesday, a fully recovered Dr. Craig Spencer, the last remaining U.S. person being treated and monitored for Ebola, was released from Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. The U.S. is now Ebola-free, and much of the credit goes to Klain for his outstanding work as Ebola czar.  While no one knows exactly what he did to eradicate Ebola in the U.S., he is nevertheless being honored by this Nobel Prize nomination. “No single individual anywhere in the world has so effectively wiped out a pandemic in just a few months,” President Obama said, “but Klain did it.”",2014-11-12T06:56:44-08:00,"Health & Medicine, International, Politics, Science and Environment"

Exit polls confirmed that voters went for Republican candidates because of this.

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER VIRUS THAT CAUSES STUPIDITY,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/11/10/scientists-discover-virus-that-causes-stupidity/,"New York, New York (The Adobo Chronicles) – U.S. scientists have identified a virus that attacks human DNA and causes stupidity in human beings. Those infected become less intelligent with the virus impairing brain activity, learning and memory. Researchers from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the University of Nebraska have identified traces of an algae virus, known as ATCV-1, in throat swabs drawn from healthy volunteers which appeared to lessen their mental capacity. The researchers, led by Dr. Robert Yolken, had originally been working on an unrelated study into throat microbes when they unexpectedly located traces of ATCV-1 in human DNA samples. ATCV-1 typically infects a species of green algae found in lakes and rivers, and has not previously been known to infect humans. According to the study, those infected with the virus performed around 10% worse on tests analyzing visual processing speeds, and were slower to draw a line connecting a sequence of numbers randomly distributed on a page than their uninfected counterparts. The researchers also found that the presence of the virus was linked to lower attention spans and decreased spatial awareness, and a “statistically significant decrease in the performance on cognitive assessments of visual processing and visual motor speed”. The U.S. discovery seems to explain why politicians in the Philippines seem to be exhibiting extremely high levels of stupidity.  The presidential palace, Malacañang, sits on the banks of the Pasig river.  It is the official residence of President NoyNoy Aquino. It is also a frequent venue for meetings between the president and members of his Cabinet as well as of Congress. The Pasig River is notoriously a polluted body of water constantly flowing with trash, debris and algae. No doubt, ATCV-1 lurks in the waters of the Pasig and has surely infected the occupants and frequent guests of the presidential palace. It is time to clean up the palace and Congress, as well as the Pasig River.",2014-11-10T19:11:32-08:00,"Health & Medicine, Science and Environment"
SF GIANTS QUARANTINED FOR 21 DAYS; FRIDAY’S VICTORY PARADE CANCELLED,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/10/30/sf-giants-quarantined-for-21-days-fridays-victory-parade-cancelled/,"San Francisco, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – Friday’s victory parade for the World Series champs has been cancelled, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee announced this morning. The San Francisco Giants beat the Kansas City Royals in Game 7 Wednesday night to clinch its third World Series title in five years. The announcement came after Lee received a call from from Kansas City Mayor Sly James that the entire San Francisco team has been quarantined for 21 days and barred from flying. The state of Kansas has declared a new viral outbreak that’s highly contagious, more so than Ebola. The outbreak seemed to have started during Game 6 of the World Series. Tens of thousands of baseball fans, many of whom came in direct contact with the Giants, exhibited severe symptoms of euphoria, nervous breakdown, intoxication, inflammation of the vocal cords and hypertension — all of which were traced back to Game 6. By Game 7, the new contagion tripled, causing the state of Kansas to declare a health emergency. A new symptom — depression — developed overnight but strangely enough, only the Royals fans are exhibiting it. Upon consultation with the Feds, notably the Centers for Disease Control, Kansas imposed a mandatory 21-day quarantine on all who attended Games 6 and 7 of the Word Series at the Kauffman stadium. Unfortunately, that includes the Giants team. Mayor Lee asked for calm in San Francisco and promised that the victory parade will be rescheduled immediately after the Giants are released from quarantine. Madison Bumgarner, who is widely credited for his role in clinching the World Series title for the Giants, tweeted from Kansas: ‘Bummer!’",2014-10-30T05:42:09-07:00,"Health & Medicine, Sports, Travel"
PHILIPPINE ARCHBISHOP: ‘YOGA IS AN INVITATION TO THE DEVIL’,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/11/01/philippine-archbishop-yoga-is-an-invitation-to-the-devil/,"Manila, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – If you practice yoga or attend yoga classes as part of your health and fitness regimen, listen up. You are inviting the devil into your body, according to a Manila archbishop. Msgr. Jay Bandojo, who has special permission to perform exorcisms, said in a recent talk that “When you practice yoga, you are told to ‘empty your mind’ while saying [the mantra] ‘om,’ so you can feel relaxed. But when you empty yourself, you’re opening yourself to demonic possession. You have to be careful because demons might take advantage of this empty vessel of your soul and possess it.” The belief in occult practices, feng shui, lucky charms, amulets, fortune-telling, astrology, horoscope, transcendental meditation and similar practices also allow demons to have a claim over a person, said Bandojo. In a predominantly Catholic country like the Philippines, this statement from a church official can have a devastating impact on its citizens. It can change lifestyles and bring about massive unemployment.  Think about the yoga instructors, architects, fortune tellers, astrologists and trinket vendors who will lose their jobs. Asked what alternative fitness activity Catholics can engage in, Bandojo recommended Zumba, the dance fitness craze that has recently taken the country by storm. In fact, the Philippines just broke the Guinness world record for the largest single Zumba class. “You see, in Zumba, both your mind and body are constantly in motion. Even if the devil tries to take over your person, it will always be shaken out as you go through your dance routine,” Bandojo said. So, let go of your ‘oms.’ Instead, practice saying ‘Shake it, shake it’ and sign up for a Zumba class near you. Got this from my Inbox. It quoted an Archbishop as the source. Not sure how true.

Yesterday, business magnate Donald Trump was put under a mandatory 21-day quarantine. Trump was quarantined as he arrived at Newark Airport in New Jersey on a flight from Florida where he conducted a site inspection of the venue for the next Miss Universe Pageant in Miami. The states of New York and New Jersey have implemented a mandatory quarantine for  people suspected of carrying the Ebola virus or who are considered at ‘high risk.’ New Jersey Goveror Chris Christie said that Trump’s quarantine was imposed out of an abundance of caution. “Trump is known to be a frequent world traveler and it is quite possible that he has been in direct contact with Ebola patients or healthcare workers who have been treating patients,” Christie said. Upon his arrival at Newark Airport, Trump complained of a slight fever. Lately, he has also exhibited lapses in memory, hair loss, foul mouth and irrational thoughts.  Although these are not necessarily the known symptoms of Ebola, the New Jersey Health Department wanted to be proactive about ensuring that potential spread of the deadly virus is nipped in the bud. Everyone who had been in close contact with Trump (except on his Twitter page) in the last few weeks are advised to voluntarily quarantine themselves for 21 days and to watch out for possible symptoms like fever, vomiting, diarrhea or bleeding. “Also, if you are experiencing Trump-like symptoms, call 911 immediately,” Christie said. his hair xD Like Like",2014-10-25T05:56:36-07:00,"Health & Medicine, International, Politics, Travel"

Donald Trump wanted to ban all incoming flights from Africa.  Ann Coulter called the U.S. doctor who treated Ebola patients in West Africa “idotic.” The states of New York and New Jersey implemented a mandatory quarantine for anyone arriving at their airports  suspected of carrying the Ebola virus. Maine had deployed state police to monitor symptom-less nurse Kaci Hickox when she arrived in the state after spending time in a quarantine tent in New Jersey. Republicans in Senate battleground races including Kansas, North Carolina and Colorado have called for travel restrictions against countries where the Ebola virus has spread in West African countries.

Paul, an opthalmologist, said that it is much easier to catch Ebola than to be infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, contrary to what the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have been saying. Today, speaking at a political fundraiser in his home state of Kentucky, Paul had some sound advice for Halloween revelers this weekend: wear hazmat suits. “The suits are not only cool costumes but they will protect revelers from being infected with the Ebola virus,” he said. Hazmat suits are protective clothing and gear used by healthcare providers and first responders when treating patients with Ebola and other infectious diseases or dealing with hazardous situations. The junior senator said that he was very concerned that many revelers will be dressing up as zombies and that it would be very difficult to tell whether or not they will be splattered with paint, makeup or real blood and other bodily fluids. “It’s better to be safe than sorry,” he added. The Ebola virus is known to spread through direct contact with an infected  person’s blood, saliva, vomit, urine, feces, semen and other body fluids. Paul’s statement today was consistent with his party’s scare tactics and irrational stance on the Ebola crisis in West Africa, aimed at winning votes during next month’s midterm elections. Meanwhile, hazmat suit and other industrial protective gear manufacturers have seen a tremendous increase in sales since the first case of Ebola was confirmed in the U.S. and stock shares have gained more than 40%.",2014-10-27T05:26:30-07:00,"Health & Medicine, Politics"

In Greece and Egypt, goats are worshipped in goat and phallic form. It is therefore no surprise that when a biotech company announced that it was developing a new drug to treat erectile dysfunction using horny goat, it was met with worldwide criticism and protest. The company, Plandaí Biotechnology, Inc. said it will begin testing and developing a new drug whose primary active ingredient is icariin, extracted from horny goat. It is similar to the active ingredient in another E.D. drug, Viagra. Pickets were scheduled this week in front of the company’s headquarters in Seattle as well as its offices in Europe. A spokesperson for Plandaí told The Adobo Chronicles that it was all a big misunderstanding and acknowledged that its marketing department did not do a good job in promoting the potential new drug. “Icariin is an extract from the plant Epidemium which is also called horny goat weed.

Supervisor Scott Wiener who represents the predominantly gay Castro district has announced that he has been taking the one-pill-a-day pre-exposure prophylaxis believed to prevent HIV infection. It is known as PrEP (brand name Truvada). Wiener, who said he was HIV negative, said that abstinence from sex is still the best way to prevent infection. “Since I don’t want to abstain from sex, I have to find a way to keep my HIV-negative status. Condoms are not 100% effective,” he added. Other community activists criticized Wiener’s decision to come out about PrEP, pointing out that Truvada — unlike condoms –does not protect people from  sexually-transmitted diseases other than HIV.

So in catering to Western whims, many Asian restaurants are fooling themselves for the sake of better business and patronage by eliminating MSG from their menu offerings. “No MSG” is a message that has kept these restaurants competitive as far as the eating out crowd is concerned.

CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE PHILIPPINES TO START COLLECTING ‘SIN TAX’,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/08/21/catholic-church-in-the-philippines-to-start-collecting-sin-tax/,"Manila, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – The influential Catholic Church in the Philippines can learn a thing or two from the country’s civilian government, especially around taxes. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) is closely monitoring developments within the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) which recently announced that tax collection this year has increased because of the sin tax. The sin tax is collected from sales of alcohol and tobacco. According to BIR Commissioner Kim Jacinto-Henares, there has been a 29.7 percent increase in excise tax collections in just the first semester of the current fiscal year.  This growth was driven by a 44.44 percent increase in collections from tobacco products and 11.62 percent increase from alcohol. In an emergency meeting convened last night by CBCP president Archbishop Socrates Villegas, the country’s top prelates strategized on how to deal with the declining church revenue from the Sunday collection baskets. Citing the success of the BIR’s sin tax collections, Villegas proposed that the church institute something similar. He proposed that instead of asking people to pray Hail Marys or the rosary as part of their penance when going to confession, priests will ask repentants to contribute money to the church, much like a sin tax.  Priests will be given the authority to determine how much sin tax to impose, depending on whether the sins confessed are mortal or venial sins. Special collection boxes will be installed beside confessional boxes in all churches in the country for this purpose. The CBCP expects to increase its collections by 200 percent once this proposal is implemented. Villegas said CBCP will ask Pope Francis’ blessing for the sin tax when the head of the Roman Catholic Church visits the Philippines next January. Reminds me of indulgencia. Hehe.

Thousands have accepted the challenge by dousing themselves with a bucket of ice and posting a video on social media. They then challenged others  to do the same within 24 hours or make a donation to the ALS Association (or both).

"WALMART, TARGET, COSTCO RUN OUT OF PLASTIC BUCKETS",https://adobochronicles.com/2014/08/18/walmart-target-costco-run-out-of-plastic-buckets/,"Bentonville, Arkansas (The Adobo Chronicles) – The country’s top giant retailers — Walmart, Costco and Target — have all reported that they have fully run out of plastic buckets in their stores and outlets. An independent investigation by The Adobo Chronicles has confirmed the disappearance of the 3, 4 and 5 gallon containers from the retailers’ store shelves across the country. A spokesperson for the Arkansas-based Walmart said that their inventory of buckets began diminishing two weeks ago when the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge started to trend on social media. “Now, our supply is down to zero,” he said. Costco, on the other hand, appealed to its members to stop calling customer service inquiring about the availability of plastic buckets. “There is absolutely nothing to go around and no delivery expected from our suppliers for the next six months,” it said in a statement from its corporate office in Seattle, Washington. Estimates place the number of Ice Bucket Challenge videos posted on the Internet at 1.2 Million. “That’s 1.2 Million buckets purchased in just the last two weeks,” a spokesperson for Target said. That, of course, is assuming each video involves just one individual. Hardware stores are worried that they may also run out of tin buckets very soon.",2014-08-18T20:21:32-07:00,"Business, Health & Medicine, Technology, The Media"
SAN FRANCISCO SEEKS TO BAN SUGAR AND WHIPPED CREAM IN STARBUCKS COFFEE,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/07/27/san-francisco-seeks-to-ban-sugar-and-whipped-cream-in-starbucks-coffee/,"San Francisco, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – Buoyed by an earlier approval to include in November’s ballot a proposed two-cent tax per ounce of sodas, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed another measure in its war against sugar. The new measure, which passed 6-4, will ask San Francisco voters to approve a new city law that would ban Starbucks and other coffee outlets from serving or offering sugar or whipped cream with their coffee.  Tall, grande or venti, only black coffee will be be sold at these outlets, and no sugary enhancements, according to the proposed regulations. “We want San Francisco to take the lead in the fight against obesity and diabetes,” said board president David Chiu. Asked by The Adobo Chronicles how far the city is willing to go in this healthy obsession, Chiu said: “This is just the beginning.

PHILIPPINE TOBACCO LAW PUT ON HOLD: GRAPHIC WARNING ON CIGARETTE PACKETS TOO GRAPHIC,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/08/07/philippine-tobacco-law-put-on-hold-graphic-warning-on-cigarette-packets-too-graphic/,"Manila, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – A new law requiring that graphic warnings showing the harmful effects of smoking be placed on all cigarette packs sold in the Philippines has been put on hold. The reason: Filipinos consider the graphic photos too graphic. The new law, signed by President NoyNoy Aquino last July,  was supposed to be in effect this month, but it has been postponed until May of 2016, to the delight of the powerful tobacco-growing industry. The proposed graphic warnings feature gruesome photographs of the ill effects of smoking, including skin and throat cancer as well as emaciated bodies of smokers. Soon after the proposed graphic designs were made public, tobacco companies initiated a petition to put the new law on hold until less offensive, less repulsive and less nauseating photographs are used on cigarette packs.  The petition drew more than 1 Million signatures, prompting officials to suspend the law’s implementation. In an exclusive interview with The Adobo Chronicles, a spokesperson for the Inter-Agency Committee on Tobacco (IAC-T) said that the committee has decided to replace the graphic photos with a picture of President Aquino smoking a cigarette. “Because of the growing unpopularity of Aquino, having his photograph on cigarette packs would encourage smokers to quit while discouraging young kids from starting to smoke.” The new graphic warning on cigarette packs won’t be rolled out until May of 2016, just weeks before the president’s  six-year term as president comes to an end. “That way, there will be no conflict of interest or impropriety when Aquino receives compensation and royalty from the tobacco companies for the use of his photograph,” the spokesperson said. This will be the photo that will be used in the graphic warnings on cigarette packs:",2014-08-07T12:54:49-07:00,"Business, Economy, Health & Medicine, Human Interest, Law Enforcement, Politics"
U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVES NEW PILLS TO CURE SELFITIS,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/08/04/u-s-food-and-drug-administration-approves-new-pills-to-cure-selfitis/,"Washington, D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles) – The. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced the approval of a new pill that would cure selfitis, the obsessive-compulsive urge to take photos of one’s self and posting them on social media. Recently, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) officially classified selfie-taking as a mental disorder with three levels of the disease: borderline, acute and chronic. The FDA announcement unveiled three color-coded pills that doctors can prescribe to their patients: green for borderline, blue for acute and red for chronic selfitis. In clinical trials conducted prior to the FDA approval, the pills showed an efficacy rate of plus or minus three percent. The new pills are similar to FDA-approved drugs that fall under the category of SSRI, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, used to treat depression and anxiety. The new pills’ manufacturer, Actavis which recently acquired Forest Laboratories, said the new drug will be marketed under the brand name selpram . Forest Laboratories owns the brand name Celexa (citalopram) which is prescribed for depression. The FDA announcement came as a huge relief to selfie addicts, a population that has grown to  almost 1 Billion worldwide. Equally, Facebook and Instagram users will be spared from the agony of having to deal with their friends’ selfies all too frequently posted on their walls. Selpram will be available in the market starting this fall.",2014-08-04T05:32:52-07:00,"Health & Medicine, International, The Media"
HOT WATER BUCKET CHALLENGE LAUNCHED TO RAISE MONEY FOR SELFITIS CURE,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/08/14/hot-water-bucket-challenge-launched-to-raise-money-for-selfitis-cure/,"San Jose, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – By now, most people with Internet access are familiar with the ice bucket challenge intended to raise funds to help find a cure for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often referred to as “Lou Gehrig’s Disease.”  ALS is  a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS often leads to paralysis. The challenge involves people either dousing themselves with a bucket of ice and posting a video on social media, or making a  donation to the ALS cause.  Unfortunately, many people, including celebrities like Mark Zuckerberg and Martha Stewart chose to douse themselves with ice instead of making a donation.  While the challenge campaign has gone viral, donations were not at levels the campaign organizers had hoped for. In California, Governor Jerry Brown reminded people to consider the state’s water shortage before accepting the ice bucket challenge.  “They should just donate,” he said. Now, a similar campaign has been launched on the Internet to help raise funds to find a cure for selfitis. (Recently, the American Psychiatric Association officially declared the taking of selfie photos and posting them on the Internet a mental disorder ).  Instead of a bucket of ice, the selfitis challenge involves people dousing themselves with hot water, or making a donation.  Most people are choosing to donate. While no official numbers have been released by either the ALS or the Selfitis groups, there is great speculation that more funds have been raised by the hot water bucket challenge. Moral of the story: pick your challenge wisely.",2014-08-14T15:07:20-07:00,"Health & Medicine, Human Interest, International, The Media"
PHILIPPINES TO IMPORT 24K GOLD WHEELCHAIRS FOR ITS HIGH-PROFILE JAIL INMATES,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/07/11/philippines-to-import-24k-gold-wheelchairs-for-its-high-profile-jail-inmates/,"Manila, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – First, it was designer jail cells , now it’s gold wheelchairs. The Philippine government can’t seem to settle down on how to treat its high-profile inmates, namely, ex-presidents, senators and wealthy business persons charged and detained for crimes ranging from plunder to graft & corruption. There appears to be a consistent pattern in which famous inmates — from former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to Senators Juan Ponce Enrile and Bong Revilla, Jr. to  businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles — suddenly become ill upon their arrest, requiring them to be hospitalized and treated for their ailment. Arroyo is under hospital arrest for corruption and plunder while she was in office, while Enrile, Revilla and Napoles have all been named in the pork barrel scandal currently being prosecuted by the Philippine Ombudsman. Also arrested in the pork barrel scam was Gigi Reyes, Enrile’s former chief of staff.  Reyes immediately fell ill after her arrest and was transferred to a local hospital. To cope with the increasing need for mobility among these famous inmates, the government of President NoyNoy Aquino has entered into an import agreement with a foreign manufacturer of wheelchairs.  Not just ordinary wheelchairs, but gold wheelchairs. The 24-karat-gold wheelchairs were designed by Ken Borochov (see photo), the same artist who designed the gold wheelchair of Lady Gaga when the famous singer had a hip surgery earlier this year.  Borochov says that  1.5 ounces of gold were plated on each chair and that his idea was to make them look like thrones. Certainly fit for queens, divas and privileged politicians. The wheelchairs will be paid for from left over pork barrel funds now in the custody of Malacanang, the presidential palace.

This, despite a unanimous nod for Aunor by the national nominating commiittee. Responding to the mounting criticism of the snub, Aquino issued a statement that his decision to exclude Aunor was because of the actress’ drug possession charge in Los Angeles, California years ago. “It is a moral issue,” Aquino said. In a weird turn of events, the nominating committee for the prestigious Nobel Prace Prize informed the Philippine government that Aquino can not be nominated for the prize on moral grounds, particularly his chain-smoking. There is speculation that the Aquino administration wanted the president nominated for this year’s peace prize. “Smoking kills.

Until recently, India was considered the call center capital of the world. Not anymore. With an estimated 400,000 Filipinos working in call centers, the Philippines has displaced India from the top spot, thanks to Filipino nurses. Say what? Nursing has become one of top courses and professions in the Philippines, with local universities graduating anywhere from 80,000 to 100,000 every year. With the very limited number of local hospitals and more stringent requirements for nursing graduates seeking employment in the U.S., it is now estimated that close to half a million licensed Filipino nurses are unemployed or underemployed. But no worries. Filipino nurses are now being hired by the growing number of call centers in the country, and this has attracted many foreign companies to outsource their services to the Philippines. The reason? Customers who are connected to the Philippine call centers get an extra perk: free medical advice.  Calling the centers is like calling Kaiser Permanente or Blue Cross Blue Shield and speaking to an advice nurse. After answering customer queries about their credit card or online orders, Filipino call center representatives will ask, “and how are you doing today, healthwise?” The caller can then proceed to ask health-related questions. So the next time you are connected to a call center in the Philippines, don’t forget to ask about the side effects of your medication or what over-the-counter drug you should be taking for your allergies. Oh, alright, didn’t realize this was a spoof. Nevermind. (“We abide by the highest standards of  creative writing…” – from your about page).

They discovered a mutant gene which they named HTXL-1 which is responsible for a person’s heterosexual orientation. “During the first three months of pregnancy, human genes circulate inside the fetus, trying to claim their proper position in the baby’s overall genetic makeup,” the researchers said. “During this process, a few genes mutate, causing a great imbalance in the genetic makeup. This mutation and imbalance produce right-leaning genes and eventually determine a person’s heterosexual orientaion,” they added.

In soliciting ideas for a new police uniform, PNP asked designers for ideas that would take into account the hot and humid temperature in most cities and towns in the Philippines, as well as the beer bellies characteristic of most police officers. “The PNP pretty much concedes that many police officers are unable to shed off the extra pounds or shrink their mid-sections since accepting bribes or extorting money to help support their beer and appetizer addictions has become the norm,” a PNP spokesperson said. The new design fulfills PNP’s requirements as it uses a cooler cotton material and lighter color while creating the illusion of flat bellies with its untucked design.

Perry’s comments all but confirm his belief that the gay lifestyle is not a choice. “I (may) have the genetic coding (that I’m inclined) to be an alcoholic, but (and) I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way,” Perry said in his San Francisco speech. The governor however refused to reveal a timeline in which he will act upon his gay genes. The Log Cabin Republicans, the lgbt group within the GOP, immediately praised Perry and vowed to fully endorse his candidacy should he decide again to run for president in 2016. The San Francisco Pride Committee convened an emergency meeting last night and unanimously voted to make Perry an honorary grand marshall at this month’s pride parade and celebration.",2014-06-14T06:12:26-07:00,"Business, Health & Medicine, Human Interest, International, LGBT, Politics, Religion, Same-sex Marriage, Science and Environment, The Media"
PRESIDENT AQUINO INCREASES FUNERAL BENEFITS FOR FILIPINOS,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/06/04/president-aquino-increases-funeral-benefits-for-filipinos/,"Manila, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – He would not increase the minimum wage, but Philippine President NoyNoy Aquino is raising funeral benefits for both public and private sector workers. Aquino issued Executive Order 167, which he signed last May 26, directing the Employees’ Compensation Commission (ECC) to implement the new law since the current rates “for both private and public sectors are no longer sufficient to cover funeral costs.” Aquino increased the funeral benefits for both sectors from P10,000 to P20,000 effective immediately. “We can’t afford to increase wages because most of the money in the public treasury has been spent on ghost projects and shady deals by senators, congressmen, private businessmen and members of my administration,” Aquino said,  referring to the 10 Billion pork barrel scam that has all but paralyzed the government. “We owe it to the Filipino people to at least provide them with decent last rites and resting place, especially since many of our countrymen are dying of hunger and unaffordable or no healthcare because of low wages,” Aquino told The Adobo Chronicles. The Aquino administration hopes that through this executive order, the funeral parlor business will flourish, creating more jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers, and eventually helping grow the economy.

NEW GENETIC STUDY MAY EXPLAIN WHY SOME HUMANS ACT LIKE DOGS,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/05/24/new-genetic-study-may-explain-why-some-humans-act-like-dogs/,"Detroit, Michigan (The Adobo Chronicles) – Ever wondered why some humans act like dogs? The answer seems to be in the genes. A new study finds that certain dogs, just like certain humans, carry a gene mutation that causes albinism — a condition that results in little or no pigment in the eyes, skin and hair. The study by researchers at Michigan State University identifies the exact genetic mutation that leads to albinism in Doberman pinschers, a discovery that has eluded veterinarians and dog breeders until now. Interestingly, the same mutated gene that causes albinism in this dog breed is also associated with a form of albinism in humans. While the study was limited to the ‘albino gene,’ many behavioral scientists were quick to conclude that dogs are not only humans’ best friend; humans and dogs share a generic makeup that explains why dogs act like humans ans humans act like dogs. Encouraged by this new genetic study, researchers from major scientific institutions are embarking on follow up studies aimed at identifiying other genes shared by humans and dogs. We may soon find new meaning, and truth, to the human expeession, ‘wag the dog.’ Reblogged this on Pescao Seco. .

STUDY: 70 PERCENT OF THE WORLD’S POPULATION REMAINS THIN,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/05/28/study-70-percent-of-the-worlds-population-remains-thin/,"London, Great Britain (The Adobo Chronicles) – Almost a third of the world is now fat, and no country has been able to curb obesity rates in the last three decades, according to a new global analysis. Researchers found more than 2 billion people – or 3o percent of the world’s population – are now overweight or obese. “It’s pretty grim,” said Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who led the study. He and colleagues reviewed more than 1,700 studies covering 188 countries from 1980 to 2013. “When we realized that not a single country has had a significant decline in obesity, that tells you how hard a challenge this is.” The good news is that 7o percent of the world’s population is still thin. Murray said there was a strong link between income and obesity; as people get richer, their waistlines also tend to start bulging. The study then concluded that in order to maintain the “thin-ness” of the world’s population, governments and private employers need to keep incomes low. The new report was paid for by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and published online Thursday in the journal, Lancet.

"A SATIRE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY, RESEARCHERS FIND",https://adobochronicles.com/2014/05/07/a-satire-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away-researchers-find/,"San Francisco, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – Researchers at the University of California in San Francisco (UCSF) have just released an earthshaking study that links satire to better health and longer life. Satire is a centuries-old type of literature that uses humor and imitation to attack and ridicule individuals’ moral and character flaws, such as vice, unfairness, stupidity or vanity. The study involved a large group of self-proclaimed netizens, half of whom admitted to reading news satire at least once every morning and the other half (control group) professed no interest at all in this art form while limiting their news reading to legitimate, traditional media sources. The results showed that the satire group sought medical attention for health issues on an average of once a year, the bulk of which was for their routine annual checkup. The non-satire group saw their doctors anywhere from six to ten times a year for serious health conditions ranging from hypertension and high cholesterol to sleep deprivation and depression.  The satire group tended to be more mature, age-wise, leading the researchers to conclude that satire readers live a longer life. The satire group also prefers to watch television shows like ‘The Daily News,’ ‘ The Colbert Report,’ and ‘ ‘Saturday Night Live’ over CNN, FOX and MSNBC News. The study recommends that people add satire to their daily dose of fruits, vegetables, protein, Olive oil , 2 glasses of wine and a morning cup of freshly-brewed coffee. Not surprised. Most people who use satire, sarcasm and think positively have the personality where they are more relaxed, less stressed and live longer.

Not so in the Philippines. White is better, especially among women who aspire to be on film, television, or to become beauty queens. Whitening soaps have become priced items in the Philippines that many local and foreign soap manufacturers have invested millions of dollars to come up with products that promise whiter skin.

(The Adobo Chronicles) – Republican strategist Karl Rove publicly questioned Hillary Clinton’s health last week, raising concerns about the damage she sustained during a fall in December 2012 that doctors say resulted in a blood clot. According to the New York Post’s Page Six, Rove insinuated that Clinton suffered from more than a blood clot while onstage at a conference. The Post reported that Rove said, “Thirty days in the hospital? And when she reappears, she’s wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what’s up with that.” Today, the former chief of staff during George W. Bush’s presidency, apologized to Clinton who is the Democratic frontrunner for the 2016 presidential nomination. Rove admitted that he, not Clinton, has brain damage, citing episodes ranging from memory loss and impeded analytical ability to erratic dancing. Many will recall that in 2012, Rove kept on insisting on FOX News that Mitt Romney, not Barack Obama, had won the presidential elections. Rove also made news in 2007 when he was caught on video rapping and dancing like a runaway robot during a broadcasters’ black-tie dinner. In his public apology, aired on CNN, FOX and MSNBC, Rove asked for Clinton’s pardon and wished her well in her  “quest to clinch the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination from Barack Obama.” (See what Rove means about memory loss?)

In a press briefing, Dr. Lyndon Lee, spokesman for the DOH clarified that the mandatory HIV screening they have been pushing would not be for the general public. “There are talks going around that mandatory HIV screening means requiring all Filipinos to submit themselves to test, we don’t mean it that way,” he said. Lee said the proposed mandatory testing will only be for heterosexual Filipino married men who he said are at the highest risk for HIV because of  their secret rendezvous during their out of town ‘business trips.’ “In our ‘macho society,’ ” Lee said, “it is the male heterosexual Filipino men who least practice protected sex with their spouses, mistresses and out-of-town flings because they feel they are less vulnerable to HIV exposure than the traditional high-risk groups like men who have sex with men, injection drug users and sex workers.  Lee added that these men are the least likely to use condoms for fear that if they do, their spouses would suspect that they are cheating on them or are having an extra-marital affair. Meanwhile, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, still feeling betrayed by the passage of the Reproductive Health (RH) Law, has refused to comment on the DOH proposal.  The RH law provides for the distribution of condoms and birth control devices at government clinics.",2014-05-15T18:48:42-07:00,"Health & Medicine, International, Law Enforcement"

While Philippine farms produce rice quite extensively, the country often resorts to rice importation to supplement local demand. It is therefore not surprising that Filipinos are alarmed at recent reports and studies showing the presence of arsenic (poison chemical) in rice and rice products. (See latest article from The New York Times). To appease the growing anxiety among the population over arsenic-tainted rice, Philippine lawmakers have moved quickly to make pan de sal the new national staple in place of rice. The wheat-based delicacy is the Filipinos’ choice of breakfast bread or dinner roll. While lawmakers realize that their action will cost the country millions of pesos in wheat importation, they said that the health and safety of the citizens are of greater concern.  Wheat is not produced locally and the Philippines imports 100% of its wheat and flour requirements. The Philippines is one of the top destinations for U.S. wheat exports. The lawmakers are confident that the Filipino people will adjust easily to the change in staple from rice to pan de sal because the latter goes well with many Filipino dishes like adobo, pancit, dinuguan, menudo and queso de bola.

Her lawyers argued that remaining in the prison suite will only make matters worse for their client and asked the court to grant the petition on humanitarian grounds. The Supreme Court is compelled to take up Napoles’ petition because there has been a precedent of hospital arrest.

Then there’s big brother, reading your emails, tracking your whereabouts, warning against vitamin supplements but licensing drugs with potential fatal side effects, taxing your every purchase and what meager income you earn. Now, the Food and Drug Administration is waging the biggest war since we first learned to say “war on terror.” The new war is against trans fat — not against transgender people or fat people — but the artery-clogging substance that FDA says is the major cause of heart attacks. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday proposed measures that would all but eliminate artificial trans fats from the U.S. food supply. Under the proposal, the agency would declare that partially hydrogenated oils, the source of trans fats, were no longer “ generally recognized as safe, ” a legal category that permits the use of salt and caffeine, for example. That means companies would have to prove scientifically that partially hydrogenated oils are safe to eat, a very high hurdle given that scientific literature overwhelmingly shows the contrary. The Institute of Medicine has concluded that there is no safe level for consumption of artificial trans fats. A coalition of fast food restaurants, backed by a grassroots organization calling itself  “Leave My Food Plate Alone,” immediately lambasted the FDA proposal, saying that it is really a “war to promote hunger.” A quick scan of various commercially-available food groups and items by The Adobo Chronicles came up with this partial list containing trans fats: Cookies, crackers, cakes, muffins, pie crusts, pizza dough, hamburger buns, stick margarine, vegetable shortening, pre-mixed cake mixes, pancake mixes, chocolate drink mixes, fried foods, donuts, French fries, chicken nuggets, hard taco shells, chips, candy, packaged or microwave popcorn , frozen dinners, frozen chicken and noodles, refrigerated crescent rolls, Oreo cookies, Wheat Thins, Triscuits, Fig Newtons, Nilla Wafers, cinnamon rolls, apple pie, hotcakes, pancakes, quarter pounder with cheese.

Now, the City by the Bay, considered the most environmentally-conscious in all of the U.S., has imposed new restrictions on these designated days.  The new rules prohibit residents and transients alike from bringing certain aromatic foods on board MUNI and BART trains and buses. Included in the banned items are bagoong, the fermented fish or shrimp paste used in popular Filipino dishes like kare-kare; any kind of curry dishes; kimchee; and even Sriracha, the much-loved hot red chili sauce that almost disappeared from the market lately. Only unopened, sealed bottles of Sriracha will be permitted. (It will be recalled that last November, a California judge ordered a partial shutdown of Huy Hong Foods, makers of Sriracha, because residents complained of spicy smells the Irwindale factory was producing.) Pizza was originally included among the banned items but the powerful lobby representing  San Francisco Italian restaurants and pizzerias was able to convince city officials to strike it off the list. Train and bus riders caught violating the new rules will be charged with a misdemeanor and will be stripped of their riding privileges for up to 30 days.  Additionally, repeat violators will be fined $19.99. Private employers are also reportedly considering a similar ban in employee breakrooms.",2014-01-11T07:29:52-08:00,"Food, Health & Medicine, Law Enforcement, Science and Environment"
U.S. GOVERNMENT:  “DIET WATER ESSENTIAL TO HEALTH AND NUTRITION”,https://adobochronicles.com/2013/08/29/u-s-government-diet-water-essential-to-health-and-nutrition/,"Washington, D.C. – Every 5 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) jointly issue “Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” aimed at providing authoritative advice about consuming fewer calories, making informed food choices, and being physically active to attain and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and promote overall health. The latest edition of the guidelines came out in 2010.  A year later, the USDA and HHS revised what Americans have always been taught about nutrition through the “food pyramid,” replacing it with the “food plate.”  Largely based on the 2010 guidelines, the food plate focuses on food groups and portions of each group as part of a healthy diet.  One-half of the plate consists of vegetables and fruits, and a quarter each of proteins, grains and dairy. Today, the USDA and HHS presented a preview of the next guidelines that will be released in 2015.  They pretty much are the same as the 2010 guidelines except for the addition of diet water.  Government researchers have concluded that diet water is essential for good nutrition. Over the years, millions of Americans have turned to bottled water as part of their daily nutritional intake, thinking that bottled water greatly contributes to a healthy diet. “However, Americans have been drinking the wrong kind of bottled water,” the USDA and HHS pointed out.  “They should be drinking diet water instead.” “Americans should follow the example of the Japanese,” HHS said. “They are among the healthiest people in the world, living up to their centenarian years. This is because of the healthy foods they eat and the diet water they drink.” So far, diet water is produced and bottled only in Japan, but other countries have begun to establish diet water plants in anticipation of a surge in demand, especially upon learning of the impending 2015 Dietary Guidelines from the U.S. government.",2013-08-29T22:25:39-07:00,Health & Medicine
IMPOSTER FOSTER FARMS CHICKEN SICKENED BY SALMONELLA,https://adobochronicles.com/2013/10/10/imposter-foster-farms-chicken-sickened-by-salmonella/,"Atlanta, Georgia – For the second time this year, federal officials have warned the public about Salmonella infections associated with Foster Farms chicken. In the latest outbreak, officials have confirmed nearly 280 cases, according to a public health alert issued Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In July, the Centers for Disease Control noted that nearly 135 illnesses were reported in a separate outbreak that started last year. To add insult to injury, Foster Farms has acknowledged that the two Foster Farms imposter chicken used by the company in its popular series of TV commercials, have also been sickened by salmonella.  The chicken, portrayed in the commercials as claiming to be corn-fed and always fresh, were photographed in a doctor’s office in Portland, Oregon, waiting to be examined and evaluated for salmonella poisoning. The popular imposters have gotten into and out of some crazy scrapes: stopped by cops, choked in a tattoo parlor, driven in a beaten sedan filled with ice, attempted alleyway liposuction, marinated in a kiddie pool, wrapped in plastic, basted into a washing machine, crashed a Yoga session, busted in a motel room, binged on junk food, and much more.",2013-10-10T14:24:43-07:00,"Film and TV, Health & Medicine"
PRINCE HARRY DIAGNOSED WITH RARE FORM OF DEPRESSION,https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/21/prince-harry-diagnosed-with-rare-form-of-depression/,"London, U.K. – Most everyone is familiar with postpartum depression which affects 10-20 percent of childbearing women.  But doctors at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine have discovered a rare form of depression that afflicts individuals other than the women giving birth. Amid the frenzy over the impending birth of the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, doctors announced that the first patient they have ever diagnosed with this rare depression was no less than Prince Harry. Doctors are calling this disease “prepartum depression,” apparently caused by panic or anxiety over an impending birth of a child.  Hospital records show that Prince Harry has been suffering from this condition for 9 months now.  It began immediately after the announcement that the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant. The Senior Psychiatrist at the Centre, speaking to paparazzis camped outside the facility, said that Prince Harry’s depression was caused by the fact that the younger brother of Prince William has been “deposed” from his spot in the ascendancy to the British throne.  Prior to the pregnancy of Kate Middleton, Prince Harry was 3rd in line to inherit the throne, next to Prince Charles and Prince William. Prince Harry was reportedly resorting to drugs and alcohol, as well as behavior not befitting of royalty, since he learned of the arrival of the Royal Baby. Doctors are closely monitoring Prince Harry’s condition, but would not confirm whether the Prince’s depression would automatically convert to postpartum depression once the Royal Baby is born.",2013-07-21T18:11:59-07:00,"Health & Medicine, International"
YMCA SHOCKED BY RESULTS OF ITS MEMBER SURVEY,https://adobochronicles.com/2014/01/27/ymca-shocked-by-results-of-its-member-survey/,"Chicago, Illinois – There was a time when YMCA was the top fitness and health club in the United States.  Over the last decade, however, YMCA’s ranking has been slipping, thanks to aggressive marketing strategies pursued by newer clubs like 24 Hour Fitness, Club One, Fitness 19 and Bally Total Fitness. Unlike its top competitors, the “Y” has been slow to resort to social media in its membership campaign. This could very well be the reason that the club is not reaching the younger generation of gym enthusiasts. As part of its efforts to revitalize its club facilities nationwide, YMCA has enlisted the support of its current members to recruit family and friends, offering financial incentives for every new member they sign-up. To launch this membership campaign, YMCA has sent a survey to all its existing members asking them how they learned about the club, as a way to determine the best medium to advertise for new recruitment. As completed surveys started pouring into the national headquarters in Chicago, YMCA’s communications and marketing departments could not believe what they are seeing in the survey. On the question “How did you hear about the YMCA,” a whopping 65% of respondents said “Village People.” The “Y” is reportedly considering to hire the 70’s American disco group to headline its new advertising campaign. The campaign’s meme? “It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.”",2014-01-27T16:55:17-08:00,"Health & Medicine, Sports"
