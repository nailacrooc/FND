Around 11:30 p.m. that night, truck driver Solomun Araya failed to stop his 18-wheeler along I-35, before crashing into stopped traffic ahead.
The accident impacted 17 cars and resulted in the deaths of three adults and two children.
Araya, 37, said he was not
intoxicated
, and a breathalyzer revealed he had a Blood Alcohol Concentration of 0.00.
Yet Araya displayed all the signs of intoxication, including bloodshot eyes, mumbled speech and swaying as he walked. He also failed a field sobriety test, according to
KVUE-TV in Texas
.
He now faces five counts of Intoxication Manslaughter and two counts of Intoxication Assault.
American Truckers shared a video on X of a man confronting Araya moments after the accident.
The man claimed to be a truck driver and berated Araya for his alleged
recklessness

“You know there’s two people dead over there? And possibly two more? Possibly four? They’re dead,” the man said to Araya, who wore flip flops and spoke broken English.
Araya seemed shocked and started to make a call.
“Who are you calling? Brother, they’re finna lock your a** up. … That’s manslaughter, bro; they’re f****** dead,” the man said.
At some point Araya walked away.
When police arrived, the man told them Araya was trying to get away, and an officer took off running in that direction.

Small Town Pastor Lured to City Hall and Arrested,https://dailyheadlines.net/small-town-pastor-lured-to-city-hall-and-arrested/,"Presbyterian church leader Christopher Willett was charged with statutory rape, sexual battery, unnatural intercourse, computer luring of a person, and child pornography, according to
WLBT-TV
in Mississippi.
Police lured Willett to City Hall under a different pretext to avoid a confrontation at his house, where Willett was known to have
firearms
.
“There was no fight, no refusal, no struggle. We put the handcuffs on him, brought him to the police department and put him in the interrogation room where he refused to talk,” said Crystal Springs Police Chief Robert Thomas, according to the
Clarion Ledger
.
Thomas said a 19-year-old woman and her psychologist visited the police station on March 7, claiming the pastor had molested her since she was 15.
Police executed multiple
search warrants
, searching Willett’s home, vehicles, laptops and cellphones before eventually filing charges.
“This is only accusations. He is not proven guilty of any of this, but the evidence we have against him is pretty substantial,” Thomas said.
Willett was later taken to Copiah County Jail, where he was held without bond.

Willett was a pastor at First Presbyterian Church in Crystal Springs, a town of fewer than 5,000 people, according to the Clarion Ledger.
The
church’s website
currently lists him as its only pastor.
“Chris is an ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA),” Willett’s bio read. “Before moving to Crystal Springs to become the Senior Pastor in October of 2020, he held the offices of Pastoral Intern and Assistant Pastor at Pinewood Presbyterian Church in Middleburg, Florida for 5 years. He then served as the Senior/Solo Pastor of Columbia Presbyterian Church in Columbia, Mississippi for 3 years.
“Chris served in the
U.S. Air Force
as a Weather Forecaster and earned a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies (Humanities, Communication, and Business Management) from New York Institute of Technology and obtained his Master’s of Divinity at Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando. In 2000 he married his wife Jennifer and they have one daughter, Lindsay.
“When he is not studying for and writing sermons, planning ministries, or working around the church and home, he enjoys watching shows with his wife, playing board games and video games with his daughter, reading (fiction, comics, and non-fiction), all things Star Wars, and being a Stormtrooper,” his bio read.
In an unrelated but recent case, another Mississippi
church pastor
and a deacon were recently arrested for embezzlement.
The pastor and deacon worked at Galilee Missionary Baptist Church in Mt. Olive, Mississippi.

Former Hollywood Stuntwoman Charged with Using Her Professional Skills for Elaborate Fraud Scheme,https://dailyheadlines.net/former-hollywood-stuntwoman-charged-with-using-her-professional-skills-for-elaborate-fraud-scheme-3/,"indictment
unsealed last month by the Department of Justice.
Vanessa Motta, a former stuntwoman who is now a personal injury lawyer working in
New Orleans
, Louisiana, her disbarred attorney fiance, Sean Alfortish, and several professional drivers allegedly “staged automobile collisions in the New Orleans metropolitan area and submitted fraudulent insurance claims based on the staged collisions,” per the indictment.
The attorneys involved in the scheme then filed
fraudulent
lawsuits in both state and federal courts on the basis of those apparent accidents.
Motta and another lawyer, Jason Giles, would represent the plaintiffs in those cases.
“The members of this conspiracy also obstructed justice and made material misrepresentations in court cases to prevent detection of their scheme by law enforcement and members of the judiciary,” the indictment added.

Beyond the allegedly staged collisions, one of the “slammers” who crashed the cars into semitrucks named Ryan Harris has been accused of killing Cornelius Garrison, his former partner in the scam.
Garrison had worked for several years with Motta, Alfortish, and Giles before he started cooperating with federal investigators, but he was fatally shot in September 2020, according to a Monday
report
from Nola.com.
Motta dabbed her eyes with apparent emotion as she was arraigned and ultimately pleaded not guilty, the outlet said.
She was released by United States Magistrate Judge Karen Wells Roby on a $25,000 unsecured bond, while Giles was released on a $100,000 bond.
“If these accidents were in fact staged, my client was also a victim and taken advantage by others,” Sean Toomey, a lawyer for Motta, previously
told
Nola.com.
Alfortish, however, remains in prison pending trial, since prosecutors believe he sought to silence Garrison by offering to pay him or to move him to the Bahamas.
Harris is nevertheless the only
conspirator
who has been charged over the death of Garrison.
Motta has previously worked as a stunt double for actresses like Vanessa Fertilo in “NCIS New Orleans,” Jodi Balfour in “Quarry,” Natalie Martinez in “Under the Dome,” Daniella Alonso in “Revolution,” and Shay Mitchell in “Pretty Little Liars,” according to her

Watch: Jennifer Aniston Has Opened Up on Barack Obama Cheating Rumor,https://dailyheadlines.net/watch-jennifer-aniston-has-opened-up-on-barack-obama-cheating-rumor-2/,"In an October 2024 interview with left-wing comedian
Jimmy Kimmel
, Aniston flatly denied that anything ever happened and noted that she has only met Obama once.
Kimmel had asked Aniston about the rumor, flashing a copy of “InTouch” magazine with a headline that read, “The Truth About Jen and Barack!”
“Of all the calls you get from your publicist, where you’re just like, ‘Oh no, what’s it going to be?’ … and then it’s that? I was not mad at it,” Aniston said.
“Does your publicist ever go, ‘Is there any truth to this?’” Kimmel asked.
“No, that is absolutely untrue,” Aniston said. “There is no truth.”
Aniston added that while she has met
Obama
once, she knows former First Lady Michelle Obama “more than him.”
The rumor originated in January 2014, when The Economist published a
satirical piece
about Obama having an affair with Aniston, among other prominent women, according to
The Daily Beast
.
Obama’s “affairs” also included former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton
and journalist Katie Couric.
The humorous piece was nothing more than that, and the two names weren’t connected again until August 2024, when InTouch published the
Obama-Aniston story
mentioned earlier.
InTouch had used the celebrity gossip podcast “Who? Weekly” as its source, according to The Beast.

“The goss is … Michelle and Barack are living separate lives, and Barack is f***ing Jennifer Aniston,” host Lindsey Weber reportedly said during the episode.
She also claimed that although the rumor came from “reliable sources,” it “obviously could be made up.”
Rumors of divorce began orbiting after the first lady didn’t show up to the late
President Jimmy Carter’s funeral
or to
President Donald Trump’s inauguration
.
The late Sen. John McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain, further fanned the flames as she
echoed divorce rumors
on her podcast “Citizen McCain” on Jan. 22.
“I have been hearing this rumor that the Obamas are getting a divorce by reputable people,” McCain said.
“I’m not talking about TMZ. I’m not talking about Perez Hilton, although I love him, he’s my friend,” she added.
“I’m talking about like very serious journalists telling me that they’re hearing that the Obama divorce rumors are true.”"

.
The user,
Usual-Guava-8899
, said he’d been a customer with AT&T for more than a decade and usually bought unlimited plans, which normally cost him about $250 – $266.
So when he learned his Dec. 15 bill was $6,223.60, he figured there must have been a mistake.
But when he spoke on the phone with
AT&T
, the customer service representative insisted the bill was only $205, not the astronomical figure the user suggested.
Usual-Guava-8899 then visited the corporate store in Dallas, Texas, hoping for a solution.
The issue had to do with the user’s having recently switched to
FirstNet
, AT&T’s nationwide network designed for
first responders
, which the user reportedly said he was.
When his account shifted over to FirstNet, AT&T inadvertently placed him on a pay-per-use plan for a single day.
On that day he used 3,097 megabytes of data and was charged accordingly.
The issue hadn’t been fully resolved quite yet, however.
A store associate told him he’d have to wait for a resolution from the company president’s office.
So, the wait began, during which the user posted numerous updates.
“I was told the office of the president sent it back to the store to take care of. Not sure if this is good or bad but a store manager is working on it from what I hear,” Usual-Guava-8899 wrote on Dec. 16.
Another update followed.
“I was contacted by AT&T help here on
Reddit
. They told me I should hear from somebody in 24 hours. I will keep everyone updated,” he wrote.
“Also wanted to clarify i have not traveled internationally or been on a cruise during this pay period. Thank you,” he added.
On Dec. 17 he posted yet another announcement about the troublesome mishap.
“resolution update!! I just got off the phone with the office of the president. The gentleman I spoke with was excellent and told me they have credited my account and I should see a 0 balance in 24-48 hours,” he wrote. “Thank you to everyone who showed an interest in this. I am convinced without the Reddit community I would still not have a resolution.”
The issue was ultimately resolved and Usual-Guava-8899 gave one final update about the conundrum."

news anchor
Nancy Grace
invited a man named
Charles Bothuell IV
onto her show. The father was seeking the public’s help in finding his missing son,
Charles V
, who had disappeared from their family home in Detroit, Michigan, for over a week.
Charles IV
made an emotional plea on the national television show, telling the audience that he had no idea where his son could be, and that he was desperate for any leads or information. To help in the search efforts, the hashtag
#FindCharlie
began circulating on social media, and the story captured the attention of the nation.
During the live interview with
Nancy Grace
, she received a breaking news report from her producers, announcing that
Charles V
had been found. The news anchor informed
Charles IV
that his son had been found in the family’s basement, where he had been hiding for eleven days straight.
However, instead of relief,
Charles IV
appeared more worried than happy. He expressed shock and disbelief that his son could have been hiding in their home the whole time, as the basement had been thoroughly searched by the family, the FBI, and the Detroit Police Department.
Nancy Grace
asked
Charles IV
if he had checked his cell phone, which he had not. She then informed him that the police chief was heading to their home to investigate the situation.
Reporters followed
Charles IV
home and interviewed
Charles V,
who revealed a shocking truth. He had been hiding in the basement because he was terrified of his father and stepmother,
Monique Dillard-Bothuell
.
Charles V
said that his father had beaten him with a PVC pipe, and he feared for his life.
Authorities immediately took
Charles V
to the hospital to examine his body for injuries, which confirmed his story.
Charles IV
and
Monique
were both arrested and charged with torture and second-degree child abuse.
The case sent shockwaves throughout the country, and people were outraged that a father could be capable of such heinous acts towards his own son. In 2016,
Charles IV
pleaded guilty to fourth-degree child abuse and was ordered to attend anger management classes and serve 18 months of probation. He also lost custody of his son, who was placed in the care of his biological mother.
The case of
Charles V
was a tragic example of child abuse, and it highlighted the importance of protecting vulnerable children from those who should be their caretakers. It also served as a reminder that sometimes, the people we trust the most can be capable of unspeakable acts, and we must always be vigilant and speak up when we see signs of abuse.

are the bane of our e-commerce existence, but one certainly had a bad day and it was all caught on video.
The karma train came quickly for a
porch pirate
who tried to grab a package from someone’s doorstep. Trying to make a quick getaway was not in the cards for him! His car got stuck in the snow as he attempted to flee. Then police removed him from his car and hauled him off to jail.
These videos will have anyone who has had a package stolen cheering. Immediate justice was served up without losing whatever was in the box.
This went down in
Ontario, Canada
. The homeowner was wise to film it as many people are enjoying the instant karma and now police have documentation of the crime as well.
The clip, posted to
Reddit
recently, shows a house door being thrown open to what looks to be a person attempting to snatch a package from the front porch of a home in Mississauga.
The alleged thief jumps quickly back into their
Toyota Yaris
, yelling what sounds like
“so sorry, man”
to the person with the camera.
But that apology isn’t the most Canadian part of this exchange, it’s what happens immediately after. The suspected crook throws the car into reverse, cranks the wheel, and nearly instantly gets stuck in a snowbank.
The driver of the car hops out and tries to push their way off of the snowbank, but it doesn’t seem to be working. In an extended version of the clip, the camera operator offers helpful tips for getting out of the snowbank, including a sarcastic offer of a shovel.
“That’s dumb, you’re dumb!”
the homeowner shouted at the porch pirate.
The best part, though, is that we get to see how this one ends. A pair of units from Peel Regional Police respond to the alleged crook, who is then arrested.
Police said that a Brampton man was arrested and charged with one count of theft and one of fraud.
According to AWM, folks online shared hundreds of comments on YouTube.
“This feels Canadian on so many levels. The thief is wearing a mask to slow the spread of the pandemic. The victim is offering advice and lending him a shovel.”
“This might be the video of the year already.  This video catches the guy in the act, shows him making a ridiculous blunder, has him periodically begging, has the homeowner giving hilarious advice to him, and then we even get to see justice served at the end. This is a very rare video.”

"When They Saw What She Wore Into The Water Park, They Had No Choice But To Ask Her To Leave…",https://dailyheadlines.net/when-they-saw-what-she-wore-into-the-water-park-they-had-no-choice-but-to-ask-her-to-leave-5/,"“I don’t…understand?”
The young lifeguard sneered at her and gave her a disgusted look before ordering her to immediately leave the water.
It all began as a fun family outing. That’s why it was so shocking that she was humiliated and mistreated on the same day. The small children playing in the area were not the issue. The water park’s expensive tickets and food were also not an issue. This was a much more serious problem. This woman had only been in the water for a few minutes when she was ejected from the park. To say she was enraged would be an understatement.
Madelyn Sheaffer
decided to swim in a bikini at the Adventure Oasis Water Park in Independence after working hard to lose weight. Employees, she claims, discriminated against her by asking her to cover up or leave.
Sheaffe
was a dedicated mother from Odessa, Missouri, who always put family first and went to great lengths to ensure her children were taken care of.
One day, as she leaned over to take a bath, she slipped and fell into the tub. Emergency personnel arrived, but Madelyn was in too much pain to be moved, so she turned them away. She spent three days unable to leave; She realized then that she had neglected herself while trying to care for her family. This was a wake-up call that made her realize it was time to make a change because her lifestyle had been severely harming her body.
It served as Sheaffer’s cue to start making efforts to lose weight, which she duly did. She was more concerned about her health than she was about how people might perceive her. She successfully lost a significant amount of weight (nearly 100 pounds!) as the years passed, and she also became healthier.
Sheaffer took her kids to the water park for some fun in the sun. Or at least, that was her intention. Unfortunately for the Scheaffer family, things rapidly turned sour.
Instead of a day full of thrilling water rides, laughter, and decadent amusement park treats, Sheaffer was judged, ridiculous, and humiliated just a few moments after she arrived at the park. To make things worse, she was told to leave the facilities. But Sheaffer decided to stand her ground and fight for her right to be there just like everybody else.
It all started when
Sheaffer
had made the decision to try something she had never thought of doing before earlier that day: she took a long-forgotten swimsuit out of its box. She grinned at her image in the mirror because it was so accurate!
She decided to wear her bikini. However, she never expected the day to end with shame and an epic battle for her rights.
When
Sheaffer
walked to the pool and took off her dress, she became aware of all the eyes burning a hole into her back. Why was everyone suddenly staring at her?
Feeling a bit self-conscious, she sat down again and covered herself with a towel. However, she looked around and noticed that both men and women, young and old, were still gawking at her.
It wasn’t long before she realized that two female teenage employees were giving her the side-eye at a distance. Out of her comfort zone but determined to enjoy herself, she cracked her warmest smile at them.
She then noticed that the two employees started whispering to each other. She couldn’t understand why they would keep on looking at her so smugly, but she chose not to make a big deal out of it. After all, she didn’t want her family day to be spoiled! It was too late for that, though.
Sheaffer
mentally prepared herself and dropped her towel again. Looking around, she sat down and slid into the cool water. She closed her eyes and focused on the sensation of the cool water swirling around her and began to relax.
However, a few seconds later, after smirking back at
Sheaffer
, the employees approached her and said something that left her speechless.
Apparently, some people had complained that her bikini was too revealing. Even though she had mentally prepared for this, she was still furious when those girls came right out and said it.
Towering over the mom in the pool in a display of power, the young girl facetiously told her that her bikini bottoms were “too small” and that they were “inappropriate”. “This is a family park”, they added. Sheaffer’s face flushed. Could they really kick her out just because they didn’t like her bikini?
Sheaffer
felt mortified, but then she stopped herself. She knew that she was wearing “full” bikini bottoms, how dare they say otherwise! She looked around in confusion at all the other girls at the water park.
Her blood began to boil when she saw that most of them were showing a lot more skin than she was. There was something very wrong with this picture. She wasn’t buying it.
Sheaffer’s emotions ran wild, fighting each other on her face. She felt a profound sense of shame and embarrassment that the young employees were commenting on her body. She felt totally violated. But then, she stopped herself. Now, she was angry. She knew exactly why they were picking on her.
“I was embarrassed for a second, and then it was no, no way,”
she said. It was time to fight.
“My body is different than the young girls that were walking around in their bikinis, but why should I be made ashamed of my body?”
She said.
“
I am comfortable in my bikini. I am happy with who I am. My first reaction was why are you singling me out? They said that my bottoms were inappropriate. That was funny to me because they are full-size bottoms.”
Sheaffer
turned to face the staff members who were still looking her up and down, accusingly. If the incident at the water park had happened years before, she said, the normally shy woman may not have had the courage to stick up for herself.
But she knew she had to take a stand. She was clearly being singled out.
“Well I am not covering up,”
She said, enraged.
“And if you expect me to leave, you had better call the police and have them escort me out.”
The officers however arrived, and to Sheaffer’s dismay, booted her from the waterpark!
“
Fifteen minutes later the police did arrive and said that while they did not agree, they had to do their job. “We can’t actually say anything,” they said as we walked outside… but I hope from the expressions on our face you can tell how we feel,”
Madelyn wrote on her now-viral Facebook post.
“They were compassionate. They, too, thought it was ridiculous.”
“I am a 43-year-old woman who did not have the confidence or the body, to put on a bikini until [I was] 40 years old,”
She continued in her post.
“I will not be discriminated against because I look too good in one.”
She continued:
“
This was not a thong. It was a standard, summertime, two-piece, string bikini… the same as everyone else, who felt confident enough in their body to wear one.”
“I felt like it was both age and body discrimination and I felt like I could look around me and I could see a handful of other girls half my age, wearing the same size swimming suit and not being singled out and told to put on clothes or leave,”
Sheaffer said angrily.
“I have a hundred and one messages for women,”
Sheaffer added, saying,
“My top message to women would be to say don’t let anyone tell you that you are not good enough. Take time to honor yourself. Women should be comfortable in their skin and be comfortable with the way they look. Imperfections are what makes us all beautiful.”

In the most recent episode of Bill Maher’s “Club Random Podcast,” openly gay former CNN host Don Lemon sounded like a man standing on the precipice of irrelevance with one foot on a banana peel as he related two strange stories of women who allegedly sexually harassed him during his time at the establishment network.
Lemon began by describing an incident in the
CNN
cafeteria long ago.
“This woman — young lady — tweaked my nipples and said ‘Oh, it’s cold in here,’” Lemon said in a viral clip posted to the social media platform X.
“And I said, ‘OK, you realize [that] if I did that they’d be walking me out the door right now? But I didn’t care to go to HR. I didn’t say anything because it’s like, it’s a double standard,” he added.
At that point, Maher clearly recognized small potatoes when fed them.
“Good for you, because who giv — ” the host began to say before Lemon interrupted him.
Then, the former CNN host told a cryptic-sounding story about a divorced female co-worker who allegedly harassed him. But he did not say how.
“And she knew I was gay,” Lemon added.
Of course,
Maher
sounded confused at the lack of detail.
“What constituted this harassment?” the host asked.
Again, Lemon provided no details. Having mentioned the incident, he apparently preferred to remain vague.
Don Lemon opened up on Bill Maher about his experience of being harassed by a woman while at CNN. He shared that he chose not to report it to HR because he feared he wouldn’t be believed.

In April 2023, amid controversies and record-low ratings for Lemon’s show,
CNN
parted ways with the longtime anchor.
Then, Lemon tried to restart his career with a show on X, sponsored by the platform. In March 2024, however, X owner
Elon Musk
, not yet an ally of President Donald Trump, announced that X would not, in fact, sponsor Lemon’s show, for it reeked of CNN-style propaganda.
Meanwhile, Lemon has shown signs of increasingly bizarre behavior. Late last month, for instance, a clip he posted to TikTok showed him
interacting strangely
with random subway riders.
Even
Maher
more than once has mocked or rebuked Lemon for playing the race card. It
happened again
during this most recent podcast.
In other words, Lemon does not look or sound like someone who has his life on the right trajectory. Already an unserious person, he appears determined to try to cling to relevance by doubling down on the very things that have brought him to the precipice of irrelevance.
As for his specific — if one can call them that — accusations of sexual harassment, two possible conclusions leap to mind.
First, Lemon loves attention and thinks himself important. Thus, the first incident he described — the nipple tweak — undoubtedly has percolated in his mind as a grievance ever since.
Of course, one should use caution before attempting to analyze a woman who goes around tweaking men’s nipples. But it hardly requires Jungian analysis to suggest that the woman who allegedly tweaked Lemon’s nipples might have done so not because of inexplicable sexual aggression toward a gay man but for precisely the opposite reason: she deemed him harmless.
One might venture other explanations, but the scant evidence
Lemon
provided hardly allows for more plausible ones.
Second, and far more important, Lemon’s claims of sexual harassment, which neither Maher nor any reasonable viewer would characterize as such based on the details Lemon provided, illustrate the core modern liberal principle that victimhood, even if merely alleged, confers status, virtue, and moral authority.
Lemon and other woke liberals trade in stories of victimization as if they amounted to currency.
Maher knew it. Like most smug liberals he hates Trump. Unlike most smug liberals, however, he also
despises far-left wokeness
. Hence his underwhelmed response to the sexual harassment accusations."
"He Sat At A Waffle House For HOURS, Then When The Bill Came His Waitress Broke Down In Tears…",https://dailyheadlines.net/he-sat-at-a-waffle-house-for-hours-then-when-the-bill-came-his-waitress-broke-down-in-tears-9/,"Michael Carsley
is a 32-year-old salesman at Parsons Roofing in Atlanta and just like several people, he takes part in an NFL fantasy football league with 11 of his friends.
Also like most fantasy football groups, they had a bet placed on whoever was to finish in last place. The league member that came in last had to spend 24 hours in a Waffle House. With the provision that for every waffle eaten, one hour would be removed.
Carsley
lost and have to spend the consequence on January 3 at a Waffle House near Atlanta. Two of his fellow fantasy players sat with him and they live-streamed fun moments. During the live stream, people were offering up to pay for his waffles. But
Carsley
thought that was silly, so instead, he said anyone who wanted to give to his Venmo, could donate and he would give all the donations to his server.
He started doing an eating challenge, attempting to eat 21 waffles so he could get his punishment down to only 3 hours of staying at the Waffle House. The eating challenge prompted more viewers to the live stream and naturally, more donations to his Venmo.
After eating 18 waffles and sitting at Waffle House for 6 hours, Carsley’s tab came to $49. And he had over 90 tip donations totaling
$1,040.
As promised,
Carsley
tipped all of the money to his server
Mosammat Shumi
who was overcome with emotion. In the video, Shumi says,
“Oh my God! Really? Are you for real? I cannot believe it! Thank you!”
With the help of his friends,
Carsley
was able to make the server’s week, giving her some extra cash during an extremely difficult time for restaurant workers.
More details from AWM:
The server was so happy to receive the staggering amount of money from the generous donors via the live stream. She was in utter shock that she had been given such a large tip from the young man who was sent into the Waffle House restaurant to eat his way to freedom.
The gesture meant so much to the server that she shed a few tears. The video caught her covering her face as the fact sunk in that she had been handed a $1,040 tip from a fantasy football fan."
The Final Text She Sent Before They Found Her Burned In A Ditch Is Bone Chilling…,https://dailyheadlines.net/the-final-text-she-sent-before-they-found-her-burned-in-a-ditch-is-bone-chilling-9/,"Debbie Collier
, 59, is believed to have wired her daughter more than
$2,000
via
Venmo
on September 10 and warned,
“They are not going to let me go.”
Collier
was found dead on Sept. 11 in a ravine in Habersham County near a burned tarp and a tote bag. She was partially naked and her clothes were burned when the body was found.
Deputies said
Collier
vanished from her Athens home on Sept. 10. Her husband told police he’d last seen his wife around 9 p.m. the night before when she went to bed. He said her rental van was still in the driveway when he left for work, so he assumed she was at home.
Now her daughter has come forward to claim that her mother suffered from mental health problems.
Collier’s daughter,
Amanda Bearden
, told police that around 3 p.m. on Sept. 10, her mother sent her $2,385 via Venmo and the following message:
“They are not going to let me go love you there is a key in the house in the blue flower pot by the door (SIC).”
Bearden
said she tried calling her mother, but she didn’t answer.
Bearden
said her mother only took her debit card and driver’s license with her.
On Sept. 11, police tracked Collier’s rental van to Habersham County using her satellite radio service.
Deputies found a Chrysler Pacifica pulled over on the side of a wooded area along State Road15 near Tallulah Falls with no one inside. The van was more than 60 miles from Collier’s home.
Bearden
arrived at the scene after her satellite radio service notified her that the car had been found, and told deputies her mother had a bad back and couldn’t walk far.
Steve Collier
, the husband, told investigators that he last saw his wife at 9 pm on September 10. He said her car was still in the driveway when he left for work the following morning.
Days later, the Habersham County Sheriff’s Office released surveillance video from a Family Dollar in Rabun County showing Collier buying items similar to those that her body was found with.
At a news conference in September, deputies said they were investigating Collier’s death as an act that
“was deliberate and personal.”
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation Medical Examiner’s Office has determined that
Collier’s
cause of death was inhalation of superheated gases, thermal injuries, and hydrocodone intoxication.

This Gymnast’s Scary Routine Is Going Viral For All The Right Reasons…,https://dailyheadlines.net/this-gymnasts-scary-routine-is-going-viral-for-all-the-right-reasons-9/,"The sheer power, determination, and grit of gymnasts leave one breathless. Their bodies, taut and primed, bend and flex in ways that defy the imagination. Strength, agility, and grace converge in a dazzling spectacle, particularly in college gymnastics, where female athletes must master four distinct disciplines: the balance beam, uneven bars, vault, and floor exercise.
Imagine the adrenaline rush, the pounding heart, as a gymnast sprints down a runway, catapults off a springboard and soars through the air for the vault event. Like a human missile, she spins, twists, and tucks, defying gravity and pushing the boundaries of physical potential. The grand finale? A perfect landing – no wobbles, no stumbles – the embodiment of the phrase
“sticking the landing.”
The balance beam, a narrow strip of focus and precision, presents another challenge. The gymnast’s world narrows to this slender platform as she flips, pirouettes, and dances between vertical and horizontal. It’s a precarious balancing act, where the smallest misstep can lead to failure.
In the realm of uneven bars, another thrilling spectacle unfolds. The gymnast swings, spins, and launches herself between bars of varying heights in a dizzying display of agility and strength. Each movement, each catch, each release is a testament to their control and precision. Not all routines require aerial feats; sometimes, the most breathtaking moments occur while clinging to a single bar.
The floor exercise presents an arena of boundless possibilities. Here, the
gymnast
performs a balletic symphony of leaps, tumbles, and spins, all choreographed to music. This routine turns the entire floor into a stage, a canvas upon which the gymnast paints a moving picture.
In the video below, one such captivating performance unfolds.
Gracie Kramer
, a 21-year-old UCLA gymnast, leaves the audience spellbound during her floor routine. The commentator dubs her performance as
“dark”
and
“foreboding,”
as it begins with moody music and slow, deliberate movements. Then, in a blink, the rhythm shifts, and Gracie’s routine transforms, her energy sparking a remarkable metamorphosis.
After the stunning performance,
Gracie
waits for the judges’ verdict. A hush falls over the room. And then, they declare it –
a perfect score.
Ten out of ten.
Jubilation spreads across Gracie’s face. This is her first perfect score in her collegiate career.
Reflecting on her achievement, Gracie said,
“It felt like a normal routine, but with the icing on the cake. I’ve felt like I’ve delivered ’10’ performances before, and I knew it in my heart, even if the judges didn’t always see it that way. But this time, the feeling was tenfold because everyone else felt it too. It was an incredible accomplishment for me.”

"A Fake Cop Tried To Pull Someone Over, And Who It Was Is True Karma In Action….",https://dailyheadlines.net/a-fake-cop-tried-to-pull-someone-over-and-who-it-was-is-true-karma-in-action-7/,"Christian Katan Mansoor
, an audacious 18-year-old, ended up pulling over the worst possible person for his fraudulent scheme – a real police officer. Authorities are eager to hear from others who may have been unlawfully targeted by
Mansoor
, shining a light on the growing audacity of criminals under an administration that seems more interested in defunding the police than backing them.
Mansoor
, a resident of Macomb Township, Michigan, concocted a ludicrous scheme in his quest for female attention. Operating a
silver BMW
equipped with deceptive red and blue flashing lights, he paraded around pretending to be an officer of the law.
However, his reckless ruse came to an abrupt halt on the evening of April 3, as reported by the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office. The faux officer unknowingly picked an off-duty
Waterford Township
police officer in
Rochester Hills
as his next target.
Mansoor’s ill-fated attempt to conduct a fraudulent traffic stop led to his ultimate downfall. The off-duty officer, already suspicious of his behavior on the road, complied with his request to pull over. But as he approached her vehicle, she was ready to turn the tables.
Poor guy has a dead raccoon on his head. What? That’s his hair?
Are you kidding me? Yikes!

April 7, 2023
The tables quickly turned on
Mansoor
, who began to unravel when faced with the off-duty officer’s probing questions. Rather than asking why she had been pulled over, she demanded to know his precinct and identification, flipping the script on the impostor.
Feigning authenticity,
Mansoor
asserted that he was from
“the 12th precinct,”
an unlikely story akin to a sitcom plot. Much like an underage teenager trying to buy alcohol, he offered a feeble excuse for not having his ID handy, claiming it was in his car. In a predictable turn of events, he made a hasty retreat.
However, the off-duty officer was not fooled by his antics. She trailed him to a trailer park in
Shelby Township
, where he seemed oblivious to her pursuit.
The off-duty officer promptly alerted her on-duty colleagues, who arrived as
Mansoor
was in the process of swapping license plates between his
BMWs.
This would-be cop impersonator was given a first-hand experience of the booking procedure and an introduction to the local judiciary.
Mansoor
was fortunate that his encounter with the female officer didn’t escalate into a more dangerous situation. As Sheriff
Michael Bouchard
of the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office pointed out, the potential danger posed by individuals impersonating officers makes all law enforcement vigilant. The threat to public safety and the undermining of legitimate law enforcement by such actions cannot be overstated.
Despite the serious implications of his actions,
Mansoor
was charged with only a single misdemeanor and released on a
$5,000 bond
. This lenient treatment is a reflection of the soft-on-crime approach favored by the
Democrats
, fostering a sense of impunity among potential offenders.
Sheriff
Bouchard
is asking locals to come forward if they have experienced a similar incident, as it is possible
Mansoor
had impersonated an officer before. This case serves as a stark warning of the dangers posed by police impersonators, and the urgent need for our society to bolster, not defund, our law enforcement agencies."
USAID Helped Dems Steal 2020 Election by Funding Wuhan Lab That Created COVID…,https://dailyheadlines.net/usaid-helped-dems-steal-2020-election-by-funding-wuhan-lab-that-created-covid/,"From the small but inexplicable ($32,000 for a
transgender comic book in Peru
) to the larger and more problematic (funding a supposedly independent journalistic non-profit referenced by a CIA analyst whistleblower responsible for catalyzing the first Trump impeachment
as a reason to suspect the president of wrongdoing
), USAID has had its fingers in plenty of pies it shouldn’t have.
However, what if I told you that USAID played a part in the catastrophic pandemic that helped the Democrats dramatically (and illegally) overhaul election laws — and thus, it could be said, helped steal the 2020 election for Joe Biden?
I know, I know: I sound a bit like a slightly unbalanced Morpheus handing Neo
the red pill
. Breadcrumb it all back, however, and it begins to make a lot more sense than you’d think.
On Jan. 25, the Central Intelligence Agency announced that it believed the COVID-19 virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. While they asserted this with “low confidence,” according to
The Wall Street Journal
, it was a major shift for an agency that had long refused to take a position in the matter, particularly when most U.S. intelligence agencies favored a natural origin.
The CIA now believes, however, “that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting.”
This comes as a surprise to virtually no one with a functioning brain. The virus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 was not found naturally near Wuhan, nor was any original host animal found, nor were any bats — the source of that family of coronaviruses — ever found being sold at the wet market supposedly responsible for the outbreak.
There was, meanwhile, an institute of virology hundreds of meters from where the outbreak began. There were numerous safety issues documented there and
public evidence
of a mishap there in October of 2019, around the time when scientists believe
the virus
would have begun to spread.
While this can’t be said to be dispositive for a lab leak, the balance of the evidence is pretty clear — and despite their best efforts, even the Chinese Communist Party can’t come up with a plausible theory regarding animal-to-human transfer five years in.
To make matters worse, the research being done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was — despite Anthony Fauci’s verbal prestidigitations in denying it — so-called “gain of function” research, which is to say it took viruses (in this case, bat coronaviruses), and looked at ways they could become more transmissible or deadly.
This was done at a research facility where, again, security concerns existed
going as far back as 2009
. (No, I’m not missing a one somewhere in that number.)
One of the most controversial aspects of the research going on at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was that some of it was done by EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. non-governmental organization which received millions grants from the government for, among other things, a program known as “PREDICT.”
And here’s where that darned red pill begins to take hold.
From EcoHealth’s
website
: “In an effort to identify and respond to new zoonotic diseases before they spread to humans, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) established its Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program. The EPT program consists of four projects: PREDICT, RESPOND, IDENTIFY, and PREVENT. The PREDICT project seeks to identify new emerging infectious diseases that could become a threat to human health. PREDICT partners locate their research in geographic ‘hotspots’ and focus on wildlife that are most likely to carry zoonotic diseases – animals such as bats, rodents, and nonhuman primates.” [Emphasis ours.]
Not only that,
documents show that Dr. Anthony Fauci’s
National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases knew about both the bat coronavirus gain of function research EcoHealth Alliance was doing and the safety risks at the
Wuhan Institute of Virology
.
USAID and the U.S. government continued to fund their work. And while there’s no evidence that EcoHealth Alliance specifically worked on the virus that intelligence services now believe leaked from the lab. What is known is that USAID continued the spigot of funding and refused to raise alarms publicly about the WIV.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump was riding a strong economy and, despite the aforementioned impeachment over Ukraine funding (which seems positively quaint now), seemed in good shape to win re-election.
All of a sudden, he was taking the blame for both not shutting the country down hard enough and for the economic effects of a country shut down pretty darn hard.
Any mention of the “
China virus
” — as to emphasize its origins and curious fact it had originated from the same city where it just so happened bat coronaviruses were studied at a major research facility — was deemed to be racist and downplaying the origins of the virus, which we were told
ad nauseam
were completely, totally, absolutely the result of natural spillover from bats. Shut your trap about that pesky WIV, or EcoHealth Alliance — you
conspiracy theorist!
Election rules were changed
en masse
,
often illegally
. Mail-in voting became the norm. Soon, low-information voters were being served ballots on a platter at the same time they were being told their president was a quack who believed
injecting bleach
into your veins would kill the virus. (As opposed to the
very scientific prophylactic
of wearing flimsy disposable masks, which would absolutely stop things if you just
wore like six of them
, and
put on a face-shield, too
.)
And, who would have thought: Joe Biden won! Fair and square, too — no thumbs on the scale, nosiree. The Freest and Fairest Election Ever™.
Mind you, Biden was clearly unable to do the job mentally when he was elected, just as much as he was when he was kicked to the curb for Kamala Harris last summer. The media certainly helped him over the finish line with that. He did no better on containing COVID — and arguably
did far worse
— than Donald Trump did. The national press covered for that, too.
That doesn’t erase the fact that a very predictable lab leak from an institution which received USAID funding through EcoHealth Alliance upended the 2020 election and allowed all of this to happen. Trump took all the blame, including for not discounting the lab-leak theory.
Meanwhile, a phalanx of U.S. government organizations — USAID among them — washed their hands of the responsibility of not just facilitating gain of function research, but doing it at an institution they should have blown the whistle on a decade prior. They shut up and pointed their fingers at the president, then propped up a senescent puppet.
No, that’s not stuffing the ballot boxes or
hacking voting machines
or any crazy notion like that. It’s stealing an election the good ol’ fashioned way: by massive deceit. And it was all subsidized by your tax dollars.
We’re now being told to swallow the blue pill: USAID, the Democrats tell us, is nothing more than an aid organization helping the poorest of the poor lift themselves out of destitution. EcoHealth Alliance? Wuhan Institute of Virology? What are those? Crazy talk.
Or, swallow that red pill and realize that, far from its original mission, USAID has become a taxpayer-to-NGO money transfer service that played a role — and however small or large you want to believe that role is, it’s still a role — in creating the conditions for upending the 2020 election,
among other outrages

"Woman Arrested After Over 50 Dead Animals Discovered, Starving Horse Found Twisted Into Disturbing U-Shape",https://dailyheadlines.net/woman-arrested-after-over-50-dead-animals-discovered-starving-horse-found-twisted-into-disturbing-u-shape-2/,"Jan Johnson of Clements was arrested Wednesday and booked into the San Joaquin County jail on charges of animal cruelty, threatening a public official, criminal threats, and possession of a short-barrel
shotgun
, according to the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office.
The case was first announced Wednesday on the department’s
Facebook post
, which initially put the number of dead animals at roughly 27.
But a follow-up story Friday by Sacramento NBC outlet
KCRA-TV
said additional properties were searched over the next several days, resulting in dozens more dead animals being found, including 53 horses, one cow, and a dog.
Another 13 horses had to be
euthanized
, in addition to a donkey and a bull, according to the report.
One of the photos published by the sheriff’s office depicted a horse that appeared to be suffering from severe
lordosis
, or swayback, but there was no word on whether it was one of those that was euthanized.
WARNING: The following post contains images that some readers may find disturbing.
KCRA quoted SJSO spokeswoman Rita Long as saying, “There was no hope for them unfortunately.”
Oakdale Equine Rescue reported on its
Facebook page
that it had taken in “a grand total of 101 animals with a breakdown of 89 mares, yearlings, weanling colt, geldings, 4 stallions, 4 donkeys, 3 llamas and one molly mule.”
The post added, “With that said, we would like to share photos, which are rather disturbing to give people that are questioning this seizure an idea of why this is taking place.
“This has been going on for sometime, this does not happen overnight.
“The number of deceased
horses
, including a dog and a cow that are visible on the ground not to mention the bones sticking out of the ground of this huge burial [site] is disturbing.
“There are no excuses for this no matter how you spin it.”
Oakdale Equine Rescue added thanks “to all that have supported our Rescue and the donations that have been coming in” since the news of the abuse investigation broke. They said their donation site uses a
QR code
on their Facebook page and warned that scammers have set up phony donation sites on GoFundMe and Venmo.
They said they have had hundreds of texts and phone calls regarding adoption of the horses, but said the animals are actually the property of San Joaquin County Animal Control.
The
Lodi News
reported that Johnson, 63, was released from jail the day of her arrest.
Authorities told KCRA the neglect was first reported in August, “But when animal services tried to make contact with property owner Jan Johnson, she
threatened
the officers.”
On Jan. 4, deputies responded to a report of a rooster fight at one of Johnson’s properties, according to the TV news outlet. “In that case, 30 dead roosters were found along with 65 live roosters. Following that incident, the sheriff’s office was able to obtain a search warrant for her home and other associated properties.”
“This is not the first time Johnson has been arrested on abuse or
cruelty
charges,” the Lodi News reported. “In 2006, she was arrested on suspicion of 42 charges of financial elder abuse after she began taking care of an 83-year-old woman three years prior."

Colorado Springs Police Department officers were dispatched to E Cache La Poudre Street outside of Colorado Springs after reports of an
“unknown call-for-service,”
according to the document.
“Upon our arrival, residents at the apartment advised there was a naked male in the parking lot that needed help,”
the affidavit states.
“Officers located [the victim] who was naked and appeared to be bleeding from a laceration on his left arm.  [He] was also actively backing away from the suspect . . . Dooley . . . who appeared to have blood smeared on her arms and hands. [The victim] exclaimed that Lauren tied him up and cut him.”
The 911 operator could hear a man, later identified as the victim, on the open line saying he was bleeding and telling someone “because you cut me” and “you’re going to kill me,” according to the affidavit.
Dooley
and the victim were engaging in a sex act on the couch before she proceeded to duct tape his wrists and ankles together, the victim told officers, according to the document. He
“found it odd, but consented to it.”
Dooley
then ordered him to go into the bedroom, threatening him with a kitchen knife, the victim reportedly told police.
“Fearing Lauren would harm him with the knife, he obeyed and got into her bed. Lauren climbed on top of him and proceeded to use the knife to cut his left shoulder,”
the affidavit says.
“When officers conducted a cursory sweep of [the] unit . . .  to see if there was anyone else that needed medical assistance, they observed a kitchen knife near the bed, several blood soaked rags and blood all over the bathtub,”
the document adds.

The Truth About Lab Grown Meat Has Been Exposed And It Is Absolutely Ghoulish….,https://dailyheadlines.net/the-truth-about-lab-grown-meat-has-been-exposed-and-it-is-absolutely-ghoulish-10/,"While some of us may laugh this off as another leftist pipe dream, many experts believe that in about 20 years, lab meat will be the only “meat” available to eat.
Granted, 20 years seems like a long time, even for evil globalists, but I agree that if we don’t take this seriously and stop them, they will eliminate meat. And once you hear what’s in this “lab-grown meat,” I believe you’ll understand why it’s critical that we fight back against this abomination.
On this subject, there is a very interesting
Substack
. Igor Chudov, a math wizard and businessman, wrote it, and he explains how this creeptacular lab meat is made from cancer cells.
Here is more from
Igor Chudov:
The CNBC article explains that “lab-grown meat,” that is, cell cultures grown in giant stainless vats, is not the same as “fake meat” made of soy or pea protein:
Vegetarians have long touted the ethical and environmental problems with meat production and consumption. Start-ups such as MosaMeat, JUST and Memphis Meats are tissue-engineering meat in a lab to allow people to enjoy being a carnivore without any of the environmental or ethical hang-ups.
Dubbed clean meat, the efforts are distinct from “fake meat,” like the soy protein “chicken” you can find in your grocery store today. Unlike Morningstar or Boca Burgers, clean meat really is meat; it just grows in a lab instead of being part of an animal.
Okay, but what kinds of cells is that lab meat grown from?
Folks, this is where it begins to veer into “Frankenstein” territory…
Igor Chudov
continues:
Lab-Grown “Meat” is Made of “Immortalized” Cancer Cells
This excellent Bloomberg article (paywall-free link) clarifies that all lab meat is grown as immortalized tumor cells. As the article explains, these same cells are used to produce traditional vaccines.
Thank the biotech revolution. Under the right conditions, animal cells can be grown in a petri dish, or even at scale in factories full of stainless-steel drums. For decades, companies such as Pfizer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson have cultured large volumes of cells to produce vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and other biotherapeutics. Now the idea is that we might as well eat these cells, too.
What are these cells?
The big honking asterisk is that normal meat cells don’t just keep dividing forever. To get the cell cultures to grow at rates big enough to power a business, several companies, including the Big Three, are quietly using what are called immortalized cells, something most people have never eaten intentionally. Immortalized cells are a staple of medical research, but they are, technically speaking, precancerous and can be, in some cases, fully cancerous.
The article puts a “human face” on some of these cell lines, for example, the “HeLa line” made from the cervical cancer of Henrietta Lacks:
That’s where immortalized cells come in. They’ve been used in medical research since the early 1950s, when the first and most famous immortal cell line—derived from the cervical cancer cells of a woman named Henrietta Lacks—was successfully grown in a lab.
This is just a small sample of what Igor has to say. You MUST read about how these cells are going to react and mutate inside of your body over time.
Lab meat companies really are planning to sell us tumor cells to eat… Read the full article
