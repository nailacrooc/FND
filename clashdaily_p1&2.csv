SPLASHDOWN: Dolphins Greet Stranded Astronauts As SpaceX Brings Them Home Again,"A Corporate Government partnership left them stranded in space… a scrappy startup brought them home again.
In a moment where so much of our attention is spent at tearing each other’s throats out over politics, here’s a moment were we can appreciate the safe return — from the hostile environment of space — some astronauts whose original ride was giving them them some serious trouble.
It FEELS like we’re celebrating an event. And we are. But at the heart of that story are a couple of real people, who were facing an uncertain fate. 
Welcome home Suni and Butch! 
Thank you Space X, NASA, and Elon Musk! 
— Mr. Nasty Tesla (@TeslaQuirk) 
 
People who were a long way from home and completely out of the reach of any medical care. We were receiving conflicting reports on just how big a toll being in space was having on their bodies — reports range from tolerable risk to life-threatening.
Welcome home to Terra Firma!
The Boeing/NASA rocket that first brought them to space was fraught with technical glitches. There were concerns about whether it could take them home safely again. In hindsight, they could have survived the trip, but when you’re gambling with human lives, there’s a kind of maybe that pushes us just a little too far.
The White House posted it on social media as a promise kept:
PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. 
Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to 
, 
, and 
!

And did you notice that the video (courtesy NASA, possibly?) described the splashdown in the Gulf Of America. 
NASA posted footage with a surprise appearance of a pod of dolphins:
The unplanned welcome crew!
Crew-9 had some surprise visitors after splashing down this afternoon.🐬 
— NASA's Johnson Space Center (@NASA_Johnson) 
 
As a kid who just barely missed the Space Race — and who watched the rise and fall of the Shuttle program — I have to admit to having a soft spot in my heart for stories like this one.
Especially when we hear former astronauts saying that Elon’s little company that could may have just saved the US space program.
Former NASA astronaut Charles Camarda just gave HUGE props to Elon Musk for what he's done in the space industry:
""Elon Musk saved the U.S. space program.""
""If it weren't for Elon Musk, we would not be able to fly U.S. Astronauts from U.S. soil to the International Space…

Kinda of a big deal, no?
But go ahead leftists. Go and rage at the man because you don’t like his politics.
We already assume you hate the GOP more than you love your country.
All you are accomplishing is proving us right.",,1
YIKES: PressSec Numbers Put NeverTrump Lawfare Into STUNNING Historical Context,"Karoline Leavitt put on a master class: she just beautifully reframed the key issue of the day, bringing it up to the 30,000 foot view. Instead of getting lost in the daily grind of bad news, she sets it in historical context.
Suddenly the drip-drip-drip of Bad Orange Man news looks completely different when we see it compared against the shockingly few times judges have made similar rulings to kneecap the efforts of prior administrations.
.
: “67% of the injunctions by partisan activists in the Judicial Branch have come against President Donald Trump, and 92% of those have been from Democrat-appointed judges. This is a clear, concerted effort by leftists who don’t like this president and are trying to slow… 
— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) 
When you realize that if we count back a century ago, we’re talking about the days since Calvin Coolidge was president without a Veep… BEFORE the 1929 collapse of Wall Street, the Great Depression, or World War II. That’s counting back to the time when Lenin was still the head of the Soviet Union… and even with THAT timeline, almost 60% of the rulings have been made against ONE president?
We are left with only two conclusions: one, that Trump is so off-the-rails contrary to proper use of his powers as expressly spelled out within the four corners of the Constitution — OR — that We The People are the target of a coordinated effort on the part of the Status Quo elite power brokers to stop Trump and his appointees from doing the very thing he was sent there to do: to reign in an obscene litany of abuses involving the abuse of various powers whose point of origin all lead back to Washington DC.
Not a tough call to make for any of us who haven’t been sleepwalking through the last 20 years.
Are we REALLY supposed to believe the people who told us that Russiagate was real, that Hunter’s laptop was not, that Trump was losing his mental faculties during COVID, but Joe Biden was ‘sharp as a tack’, that the Jab works but naturally immunity does not, that the lab leak theory was a ‘hoax’, that the ‘border was secure’ under Kamala, but that the GOP posed threats to national security is suddenly telling us the truth NOW?
Call it ‘drain the swamp’, or ‘bringing accountability’, ‘MAGA’, or even going back to the Constitution… under any name you give it, the conflict is pretty simple. The reason the left is pushing anti-Trump lawfare stories so hard is patently obvious: the MAGA agenda is a threat to the establishment’s power bases. All of them.
They didn’t have the integrity to return the billions stolen by Sam Bankman-Fried and donated to Democrat causes — because doing so would hurt their chances of holding and gaining power in the future.
For the very same reason, they don’t have the integrity to let these various steps of accountability proceed normally… it’s a question of power and who gets to wield it.",,1
AUTOPEN: Could This Be A Critical Clue In Their Plot To Hide The Decline?,"Naturally DC is buzzing. How could it not be with Trump declaring many of Biden’s pardons Constitutionally invalid because they were signed with an autopen? But that part of the story just scratches the surface.
They protected Joe from public appearances, they rigged the game in press conferences, and limited direct access to the President himself… but if they were going to keep his decline a secret, there was still one glaring problem staring everyone in the face that they absolutely HAD to solve.
Let’s return to the beginning, before Joe became the presidential candidate.
Questions about Joe being corrupt and compromised were already part of the conversation. Authors had written books about it. Joe was caught red-handed — in his own voice — holding up a billion dollars in Ukrainian aid unless he got what he wanted, which just so happened to be exactly what his son’s benefactor Burisma ALSO wanted.
But that ‘perfect phone call’ where Trump put a pause on Ukraine funding for 30 days? The pause that let him verify that money was going where it was supposed to in one of the world’s most corrupt countries? That was ‘impeachable’.
The web of Biden lies has been laying in plain sight for so long, it’s easy to forget the strands from which its woven.
We have long since taken for granted that Hunter’s incriminating laptop was ‘forgotten’ at a repair shop while Feds were already investigating some of shady business associates at the very moment his father was launching a presidential bid was just an astonishing coincidence. Do NOT call it a sloppy attempt at destroying evidence in a way that results in plausible deniability until it ran into a legally blind repairman who chose NOT to wipe the contents and resell the hardware.
Heavens, no. Not that.
And let’s not look too carefully into any lingering questions about what in the HELL was going on with that creepy as all get-out sound-stage replica of the White House.
 
This one: 
It was complete with a green-screen window loaded with *whoops* a scene from the wrong time of year.. Details matter.
Even leaving all of that aside, we’ve got an exchange between Keith Ablow (Hunter Biden’s shrink) and Hunter Biden in January of 2019 discussing dear old dad’s … wait for it… dementia. This was BEFORE he launched his presidential campaign.
Pages 143-144 Texts between Hunter Biden and Dr. Keith Ablow, from Hunter’s now confirmed to be authentic laptop, in January of 2019, MONTHS before Joe announced he was going to run in 2020, seemingly confirm his dementia. 
 WHO WAS RUNNING THE COUNTRY for 4 years? 
— 🔴 P𝕠𝐔𝔫Ⓒ𝓔г (@bloodless_coup) 
The dementia was known, at least by the inner circle, very early in the game.
We will pick up the data point of the signature on Hunter Biden’s pardon. We have, at this point, no reason to doubt the authenticity of the signature on Hunter’s pardon. Barring any reason other than the autopen question that its validity would be challenged, that pardon is likely to stand, even if others are successfully negated.
Look carefully at the difference between the two signatures, not just the style, but their quality.
By definition, dementia, in any of its forms, is a progressive disease. One of the ways that progress manifests itself is in a visible deterioration of handwriting quality. Notice how he struggled to write the ‘B’ in his own signature, and how different the faltering childlike letters are from the stylized signature captured by the autopen at some undetermined time beforehand.
Now that Biden’s political capital is spent, rival factions can speak freely about things that could not be said while he was in office. Even Jake Tapper, who once defended Joe Biden’s mental state has since written a book exposing just how far gone his decline really was.
It was the worst-kept secret in Washington. But it was still closely guarded until the very minute last June when Joe Biden’s chance of beating Trump was proven to be zero. After rigging the game in Joe’s favor, they rigged it again in Kamala’s. (All in the name of ‘defending Democracy’, of course!)
Anyone who dared tell the truth (before the truth was allowed to be spoken) took a beating over it. Just days before the wheels fell of of Biden’s campaign bus, media types were still trying to gaslight us with words like ‘cheap fakes’.
There’s an upper limit on what they could do to control the mental fitness narrative.
They can control access to him, and hide that. They can limit his speech, and hide that symptom. But some things are hard to fake.
Like when one of the most important and public parts of your job involves signing documents into law. Eventually, someone will look closely at that signature… 
 if there is reason to believe he’s mentally impaired.
Four years is a long time for a symptom like dysgraphia to progress in its decline. Unlike some of the other things that can be controlled for or coached, handwriting really cannot be faked.
That’s why people like yours truly wanted to see Joe Biden draw a clock. Not that we WANTED a Kamala Presidency, we just didn’t think that Joe was really running the show any more than President Wilson was after his stroke.
JOETUS was little more than a blank canvas that political operatives could fill with whatever they wished. He was an empty figurehead. POTUS in name only.
Having watched the lengths these deep-state clowns are willing to go to deceive us, it would be one HUNDRED percent on-brand if that now-infamous Autopen was introduced for the 
 purpose of disguising the impairment in Joe Biden’s handwriting so that we would not have an excuse to force a cognitive test that could result in Dems having to invoke the 25th Amendment.
Invoking the 25th so late in the game would raise far to many of the awkward ‘what did you know and when did you know it’ questions, giving the GOP a chance at power.
And POWER was the one thing these Dems truly care about.
Isn’t it funny that this same autopen could be the one thing that foils their perfect plan?
What’s that old familiar line?

“We could have gotten away with it too… if it weren’t for you meddling kids.”
That sounds about right.

And now, the show is over and the mask comes off.",,1
DOCE: The Department of Church Efficiency,"I love beholding Trump and Elon’s DOGE department waylay ridiculous programs and people. It gives me the warm and fuzzies to watch the wankers on the Left caterwaul when Musk nukes their multimillion-dollar grifts. It’s a simple pleasure, fo’ sho’. That said, and in keeping with the spirit of cleaning house, I think Christians should crank up a similar axe-wielding office called DOCE, The Department of Church Efficiency. Herewith are a few things I believe should go into the ecclesiastical wood-chipper.
This list is obviously incomplete. What else would you add to it to shore up the Body of Christ? Enjoy and share.
The PERFECT Gift For The Art Loving Warrior
Dear Fellow Warriors: My new book just dropped, 
. It’s a full color coffee table compilation of my biblical paintings over the last 20yrs. As you know, I don’t depict the biblical men in this book as sweet bearded women but rough troublemakers who shook all of hell’s habitations. It’s a great gift for the male and female scrappy warriors on your Christmas list. Young kids will love it too. 70+ original paintings. 234 pages with the scriptural inspiration behind each painting. It’s a beautiful book.
RECOMMENDATIONS. “One reason I buy Doug’s priceless art is to make bold statements on the walls of my home. Lively discussions come alive to bring home the Gospel messages behind the brushstrokes gifted to Mr. Giles. Pastor Doug’s creativity in canvassing the Biblical perspective is daring and courageous.”

LIZZO V. DISNEY: How One Learned From Past Mistakes And The Other Never Will,"If woke culture offers judgment without redemption, it’s almost an act of rebellion to cheer on an icon from the ‘other side’ when they learn from a mistake and get something right.
Two stories this weekend offer an opportunity for the political right to better navigate that difficult path of holding moral principles while also leaving an invitation to the path of redemption.
With Disney and Lizzo, we see two very vocal and bellicose icons of movements on the political left, not merely believing toxic ideas, but proudly and loudly insisting others should share in embracing them… to the point of being hostile to anyone who did not bend the knee to their worldview.
News from this weekend gives us an opportunity to revisit that fork in the road, and see how those choices have played out.
For decades, now, the soulless husk of the grand vision of its namesake has been looking for every opportunity to not only abandon the family-friendly values of its progenitor, but to declare war upon them.
Here’s a quote from an LGBT source in early 2024 cheering Disney’s announcement to double down on the woke agenda (in this case, the LGBT flavor of it) rather than responding to parental petitions to leave the gender questions out of the kids shows.
Disney CEO Bob Chapek when intervened by LGBTQ+ activist said that the company will focus on increasing LGBTQ characters and stories.

Chapek said that Disney strongly believes in reflecting the creative content to the majority of audience and that they will have an increased commitment to move forward with the implementation of LGBT in their characters and stories. He said, “We want to tell stories that our audience wants to hear, that reflects their lives.” (
, March 2024)
They’ve done a little backpedaling since then, dropping a trans character from a project, and shoehorning a Christian character into the story as something of an olive branch. But it’s tough to take such overtures seriously when you look at how they’ve handled projects like Snow White.
The title character — whose appearance is literally baked right into the name — has been cast by someone who has been jokingly called by many other names in the vein of “snow tan” or “dirt white” has been blasted a little more on the nose as ‘Snow Woke’ which fits with her now-infamous savaging of the origninal beloved film. “”The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so. There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! Weird! So we didn’t do that this time.”
Fans rightly noted how it was a bad idea for someone who clearly hates the original story to be chosen as the face of the live-action remake.
The big test for what the public thought of this offering would come where people voted with their wallets. It failed that test.
Trouble is a brewin’ for the controversy-laden Snow White, the live-action remake of the iconic 1937 animated film that put Walt Disney‘s film empire on the map.
The big-budget tentpole opened to $43 million domestically, enough for a first-place finish but behind even the most modest of expectations after getting battered by so-so audience scores and underwhelming reviews. That’s even less than Tim Burton’s Dumbo, which came in at $45 million in 2019. Overseas, Snow White took in $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million after hoping to clear $100 million. — 
Many in our audience might be surprised even to read a mention of Lizzo, with a ‘who cares what Lizzo thinks’ kneejerk reaction to news about a personality they don’t follow in a music genre they don’t care about.
But if any of us are serious in our desire to see the culture transformed, we WILL have to interact with the people in it, and that includes influencers.
In this case we see someone who had been leading those who followed her down a dangerous path, has rethought her life choices and is now leading — by here own example, no less — anyone who looks up to her in a much better direction.
It wasn’t so long ago that Lizzo was, in some literal sense, the poster girl for what has been dubbed ‘body-positivity’.
She describes herself as fat and says she wants to normalize and destigmatize larger bodies. Yet, in an interview with People magazine in 2022, she said she’s gotten tired of people constantly talking about her body size. “I know I’m fat. It doesn’t bother me. I like being fat, and I’m beautiful and I’m healthy. So can we move on?” — 
Fast forward to this past weekend, where she was in the news for different reason. We’ll not include the photo of her wearing fishnet stockings. (You’re welcome.) But her update is worthy of notice:
“I did it,” she captioned an Instagram post. “Today when I stepped on my scale, I reached my weight release goal. I haven’t seen this number since 2014! Let this be a reminder you can do anything you put your mind to. Time for new goals!”
In one photo, Lizzo posed in a maroon sports bra and matching leggings. In another, she shared a screenshot of her progress, which showed that her BMI was down 10.5 and that she had lost 16% of her total body fat. — 
The Christian world has a word for this kind of a transformation story: repentance.
Now, let’s not over-hype this. She’s not rushing off to preach the gospel or anything. But in a world that is crying out for answers to an obesity epidemic, an ‘influencer’ like her who was once held up as the big is beautiful archtype has taken ownership of her health and fitness, that’s a win.
Who knows? Maybe there’s an opportunity for her and RFK to work together on crafting a message that will inspire a generation of people who would give greater (ahem) weight to her encouragement to take charge of your life than they would from an old guard from Camelot.
Who knows? In bridging those divides, maybe they will discover some of us aren’t the monsters talking heads on TV have told them we are.
(And even… vice versa.)",,1
ICYMI: Trump Announced Our Next Gen Fighter Jet — Dems Will HATE Its Designation,"While Canada struggles to figure if they will be keeping up with their purchase of the F-35s to replace their ancient fleet of CF-18s, Uncle Sam is moving forward into the 6th Generation.
Here is Trump making the announcement from the Oval Office:
BREAKING 🚨 Donald Trump announces the Next Gen F-47 Fighter Jet “it’s a beautiful number” 🔥
This is EXACTLY what I voted for
The strongest military EVER 
— MAGA Voice (@MAGAVoice) 
Hegseth said this was a big day for the warfighters. Because of this sixth-generation fighter, America will have generations of air dominance.
“[The F-47] sends a very direct, clear message to our allies that we’re not going anywhere and to our enemies that we can, and we will, be able to project power around the globe, unimpeded, for generations to come,” he added.
Hegseth also said he sees the NGAD program as a historic investment in both the U.S. military and the U.S. defense industrial base, which will help to revive the warrior ethos in the armed services.
The ability of NGAD’s fighter jet component to interact with drone technology will allow more lethality and modernized capability than in previous weapons systems, Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David W. Allvin said at the press conference.
“[NGAD] is allowing us to look into the future and unlock the magic that is human-machine teaming,” Allvin said. “We’re going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.”
He added that the way the Air Force has assembled the NGAD program will give the government more control, allowing the platform to be updated and adapted “at the speed of relevance [and] at the speed of technology.”
Additionally, the F-47 will cost less than the F-22, be more adaptable to future threats and “have significantly longer range, more advanced stealth, be more sustainable, supportable, and have higher availability than our fifth-generation fighters,” Allvin said via a press release following the announcement at the White House.  — 
What makes it 6th generation?
Attributes: Stealth, supersensor fusion, AI-technology, laser weapons, increased computing power, “system-of-systems”

[…]
Sixth-generation fighter jets are designed to be a “system of systems” and be something of a flying command center controlling loyal wingman drones and having an incredibly high situational awareness. European countries are skipping developing their own fifth-generation fighters and going straight to sixth-generation projects (Tempest/GCAP being the best example). These jets are planned to feature laser weapons, stealth technology, supersensor fusion, AI technology, and more. They are expected to be produced in low numbers. —",,1
Old Men Will Dream Dreams,"What if there was more to life after sixty than shuffleboard, knitting, cruises, and golf? How would life be different if everyone in the home stretch in life finished strong?
If not ‘everyone’ how about the Christians take God at His Word and live like His promises can be trusted?
In business, we often hear the ‘late start in life’ stories about guys like Colonel Sanders. But what about Christians daring to use the phase of life where you’ve got ‘all the time in the world’ to unleash God’s Kingdom here on Earth?
Maybe it’s a business idea. Or an art project. Or the Great American novel. Maybe it’s mentoring. Or starting a ministry or outreach to people in need. Maybe developing a new skill set so that it can be used to bless others… or using what you already know.
There are as many answers to the ‘what if’ question as there are people to ask it.
Is the God we believe in — REALLY believe in — cut down to size so that he can be squeezed into our comfortable lives? Or are we going to dare the God who can carry galaxies in his pocket to trust us with a plan Worthy of His name… a summit-or-plummet task that is doomed to fail unless HE shows up to keep his promises.
Whoever said that the last chapters in life had to be boring? They can be the greatest adventure of your life.
Before you wave that away as some kind of an over-hyped pep talk, look at what the Word itself has to say about exactly this issue:

WATCH: Trump Signs Education Order In The Trump-iest Way Possible,"He opens with a quote, announcing the 250th anniversary of the famous phrase ‘give me liberty or give me death’.
That anniversary, technically, falls on the weekend. But, close enough.
Then, after greeting some of the various governors who are looking forward to assuming responsibility for administering education in their respective states, and talking briefly about the Executive orders he signed into law earlier in the day he began laying out just how dire the status quo has become for the American public school system.
He talks about how far the educational standards have fallen when compared to other countries, and how nobody pays more per pupil than the American system.
Then he lays out a solution — specifically debunking the left’s favorite talking point about the dismantling of the Department of Education leaving students with disabilities or student loans in the lurch. (About the 8 minute mark.) He brags on how well some of the States are sure to adapt to this new system, and promises to come along and help any states that take longer to get themselves up to speed.
He lingers on what that will look like, breaking into districts, and dropping off an enormous amout of expenses.
At around 11 minutes, he takes a minute to praise teachers and the work they do as immensely valuable.
At 13 minutes, it’s he wind-up. We’re going to sign a very, very important document, on we’ve wanted to sign for years (which, Reagan at least as far back as ’82, if not from the very beginning of his presidency wanted to make this change, but didn’t have control of the House to get it done.
And then he walks over to the desk where he’s going to sign the order itself, where he is flanked by aa bunch of children sitting in school desks ready to sign their own copy of an order just like the original.
They all sign their orders, and hold them up for the camera… getting the children involved in taking charge of their own future, which just ‘happens’ to be a perfect snapshot and soundbite representation of the message he was trying to get across, about shifting the responsibility for education AWAY from the central powers in DC and into the hands of the people who actually have a stake in seeing real results.
Since most lib news outlets are already getting their talking points wrong, we might as well include the full text of his order to correct the record:
Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  Our Nation’s bright future relies on empowered families, engaged communities, and excellent educational opportunities for every child.  Unfortunately, the experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars — and the unaccountable bureaucracy those programs and dollars support — has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.
Taxpayers spent around $200 billion at the Federal level on schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of the more than $60 billion they spend annually on Federal school funding.  This money is largely distributed by one of the newest Cabinet agencies, the Department of Education, which has existed for less than one fifth of our Nation’s history.  The Congress created the Department of Education in 1979 at the urging of President Jimmy Carter, who received a first-ever Presidential endorsement from the country’s largest teachers’ union shortly after pledging to the union his support for a separate Department of Education.  Since then, the Department of Education has entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that Federal control over education is beneficial.  While the Department of Education does not educate anyone, it maintains a public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 million per year.
Closing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them.  Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows.  This year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math.  The Federal education bureaucracy is not working.  
Closure of the Department of Education would drastically improve program implementation in higher education.  The Department of Education currently manages a student loan debt portfolio of more than $1.6 trillion.  This means the Federal student aid program is roughly the size of one of the Nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo.  But although Wells Fargo has more than 200,000 employees, the Department of Education has fewer than 1,500 in its Office of Federal Student Aid.  The Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America’s students.
Ultimately, the Department of Education’s main functions can, and should, be returned to the States. 
Sec. 2.  Closing the Department of Education and Returning Authority to the States.  (a)  The Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.
(b)  Consistent with the Department of Education’s authorities, the Secretary of Education shall ensure that the allocation of any Federal Department of Education funds is subject to rigorous compliance with Federal law and Administration policy, including the requirement that any program or activity receiving Federal assistance terminate illegal discrimination obscured under the label “diversity, equity, and inclusion” or similar terms and programs promoting gender ideology.
Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

 part of choosing a path in life. When you’re deciding between two good choices, THAT is when the decision gets harder.
There’s a simple test you can use to help make those decisions a lot simpler.
But we should warn you: if you use it, you might discover you no longer have any convenient excuses to hide behind when it comes to actually pulling the trigger on the choice you really want to make.
This will help you identify the path you really want to follow. But the courage to act on it?

Journo Asks The ‘Old Law’ Question To Homan… Instantly Regrets It,"Journos keep following the old scripts, trying to scare Republicans into complacency. They haven’t yet gotten the memo that the game has changed completely.
Tom Homan is nothing like the sort of GOP appointee journos of yesteryear set up with ‘do you still beat your wife’ trap questions.
The media flunkies are the same old stale routine. They still ask the questions that are intended to scare the interviewee into complacency, intimidate them into rubbing the rough edges off of a ‘contoversial’ policy (‘controversial’, of course, as deemed by the standards of the coastal chattering class).
But something has changed since Trump came down that golden elevator. Instead of just a few stalwarts like Ted Cruz going toe to toe with media and beating them at their own game, Trump set a precedent of publicly humiliating them on their own turf again and again and again.
The press are no different than the Wizard of Oz. The SEEM to have the power to destroy their victims, but in reality, they have no more power than such power as we give them.
Not only did he stand up, he has inspired a whole crew of other voices to do the same. Better still, he went looking for people who were already wired with that temperment, and put them in positions of responsiblity. They are exactly the kind of people who cannot be bullied by media types.
When some journo picked up the ‘zombie law’ talking point about Trump using a 200yo law to send foreign-born criminals off to El Salvadore, where both countries benefit from the transaction, Tom Homan doesn’t get panicky. He doesn’t break a sweat.
He looks the journo right in the eye and gives him a pitch-perfect answer that no serious person can refute.
Reporter: ""That law is 200 years old!""
Tom Homan: ""Well, the Constitution is a lot older than that and we still follow it""

PLANNED PARENTHOOD: Baby Parts Whistleblowers Get Last Laugh Over Manhattan Abortion Mill,"Think back — WAAAY Back — to just one month after Trump made his famous appearance on the golden escalator. The big story was a hidden camera video exposing Planned Parenthood as discussing the sale of intact baby parts for use by medical research.
His story became a real scandal to Planned Parenthood. The GOP was starting to wake up not just to the fact that they were taking a lot of their federal funding, and dumping it back into the political campaigns that would get Democrats elected.
Worse than their abuse of tax dollars to flip elections was the way they flaunt laws governing what can and cannot be done in an abortion process. Under people like Rubio, these videos were being used to energize a movement that would put Planned Parenthood under the microscope and prompt changes in law.
Enter Kamala Harris, California’s AG, who went out of their way to criminalize that reporting, slapping them with 15 indictments, raiding their apartments and seizing footage, including some that had not been released. It wasn’t until January of this year — a decade later — that California dropped the charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, despite a Texas court ruling that these videos were in no way ‘deceptively edited’ as the Planned Parenthood people would have claimed.
Fast forward to March of 2025, and the same Manhattan Planned Parenthood site that was featured in the baby parts videos, and you see THIS news:
Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, amid mounting financial pressure, is looking to sell its SoHo building and shutter the clinic there, a move that will leave the nonprofit with no services in Manhattan, the reproductive health care provider told Gothamist.

[…]
“It is a building that requires more and more expensive maintenance, and it’s not designed to support the health care needs of the future,” Stark said of the SoHo building. Planned Parenthood moved into the site in the early 1990s. It once bore the name of the organization’s founder, Margaret Sanger.
The move comes amid financial troubles that have already forced Planned Parenthood to shut down four clinics across the state in recent months, including one on Staten Island, and cut some services. The nonprofit stopped providing abortions after 20 weeks at its Manhattan health center and discontinued the option of deep sedation for IUD placements. — 
This announcement was not lost on David Daleiden, as evidenced in the post he attached to the Gothamist story cited above.
Here is the caption


And here is the video.
Planned Parenthood is shutting down its flagship abortion factory in NYC where it killed and sold preemie-age babies up to 6 months.
Its lead abortionist giggled about selling the livers for $1,500 each—

— David Daleiden (@daviddaleiden) 
Planned Parenthood is closing a ‘high-volume’ location because they can’t afford the upkeep? Good.
As for Sanger, they should be happy to be distancing themselves from a building bearing her name.
After all, if past connections with slavery are reason enough for being ‘cancelled’ and drummed out of polite society, how much more so would a bigoted Eugenecist like Sanger who saw abortion as a means to social hygeine that would help rid the world of unfit children.
[…]Sanger also embraced eugenics. Although she did not make her eugenicist arguments in explicitly racist terms, she nevertheless worked with those who did, including Klansman and Nazi sympathizer Lothrop Stoddard, author of The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy.
Before World War II, Stanford University itself had close ties to the eugenics movement, with vocal advocates among faculty members Lewis Terman and Elwood Cubberley as well as Stanford President David Starr Jordan. In the 1930s, the Nazis in Germany relied on California eugenics research and policy to develop their own programs. — 
Oh right.  Klansman AND Nazi.

A lot has changed since the Summer of 2020, not only are the tactics of the militant mobs losing their persuasive force and becoming tiresome… the risks they take in playing them have completely changed.
You’ve seen all those stories about people targeting the one car on the market with the most cutting edge tech features… keying the cars, shoving their hands into their butt crack before then wiping it on the car, shooting at them and setting them on fire. Only to discover they’ve been filmed with the car’s own hi-definition camera while it waited in sentry mode.
You’ve heard of the websites organizing and encouraging acts of violence. Owners being doxxed and threatened. Charging stations and dealerships being targeted for acts of vandalism and violence.
The chickens have not taken long to come home to roost for such people, resulting in felony charges, some of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. All 3 in this post used an incendiary device, which puts you squarely in the terrorist category. Don’t go looking for THIS Veep to help you raise bail money on that one.
Reduce their bravado to ridicule, and make them wear the consequences of their choices around their necks like an albatross.
Similar story with the rash of SWATing calls that have brought calls of bogus dangerous situation calls that mobilized available police against one conservative influence after another. It’s organized. And it’s a crime.
On one side, we’ve begun to catch at least SOME of the people inciting violence against political targets. But what about people on the receiving end?
Should they cower in fear, like some Tesla owners have already begun to do? If terrorists have used fear to intimidate people into compliance to accomplish one political goal or another, this response guarantees the bad guys will win.

Rumors Swirl Around Claims Of US Sinking Important Iranian Ship In Red Sea… Here’s What We Know,"Fog of war. That’s the term describing the difficult task of sorting fact from fiction in the midst of a conflict… and there’s plenty of fog in the Middle East at the moment.
With Iran’s proxies kicking into high gear in the region — especially the Houthis who have declared open season on US vessles — Trump has made it clear that Iran will be held personally responsible for any escalation on the part of its surrogates.
With Iran chasing a nuke, and Trump trying to keep them from getting there, we’re fast approaching the ‘find out’ phase of this international conflict, with neither side apparently willing to blink.
Yemen has announced that it is willing to fire on American ships passing through the Red Sea. America has a role in keeping international shipping lanes open. Piracy is not a threat that Trump can easily ignore. Historically, fighting with a militant Islamist nation over issues of piracy is among the earliest martial memories America has as a nation, one memorialized every time we hear the words ‘shores of Tripoli’ sung in the Marines’ Hymn.
With the Houthis forcing our hand again, Trump is directing his attention to the wellspring on which the Islamists have relied… Iran.
Not only have they been working with groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others to destabilize the region and subvert their rivals giving them access to gear and expertise they could not manage on their own (helping Hamas coordinate the October 7 massacre, for instance), Iran has a history of helping coordinate their efforts, including intel. Even the UN admits this in 
.
It was during action in the Red Sea in January 2024 that 
 bound for the Houthis.
There have been claims of attempted strikes by Yemeni Houthis against American targets, including, this past week, 
. (Unsuccessful.) American forces have struck at Houthi targets, including JPost reports of successfully taking out Yemen’s Security Chief.
The rumor being reported on some social media channels — and some of the news sites that lean heavily on such reports — is that the Americans have sunk a critical new addition to Iran’s fleet… the Zagros. (Examples: 
, 
,   
Launched only in January of this year, the Zagros is an important addition to the navy of a country like Iran that relies so heavily on cyber warfare and disposable guerrilla proxies fighting at arms’ length.
According to information published by Tasnim on January 15, 2025, the Iranian Navy has officially commissioned the Zagros, a combat reconnaissance destroyer, into its fleet. The Zagros destroyer is designed to perform both combat and intelligence missions.

[…]
Intelligence ships, often called spy ships, are specialized naval vessels designed to gather intelligence through sophisticated electronic surveillance and data collection. Operated by navies or intelligence agencies, these ships play a crucial role in national security by intercepting signals, monitoring communications, and gathering information on foreign military operations.
Equipped with advanced technologies, intelligence ships house state-of-the-art antennas and communication systems to intercept a broad range of electronic transmissions. Their satellite communication links enable real-time data sharing with command centers, enhancing situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. While primarily focused on intelligence gathering, these vessels also carry defensive systems for self-protection, ensuring operational safety in contested waters.
Operating in international waters, intelligence ships position themselves strategically to monitor sea and air activity, intercept signals, and observe military exercises. They provide a more focused and sustained intelligence-gathering capability compared to satellites, offering an invaluable asset in modern defense strategies. Many of these ships are camouflaged as civilian vessels to minimize detection and suspicion, blending seamlessly into their environment while performing critical tasks. —
We at ClashDaily will continue to treat this report as an ‘unconfirmed rumor’ until either confirmed or disproven. Unless and until there is confirmation that it has been sunk, we will treat this as another ‘fog of war’ rumor.
That said, the rumor itself is important to the larger story about this conflict. With Trump promising to escalate and make Iran pay a heavy toll, he may take a page from Ronald Reagan’s playbook. Especially if he uses their history of piracy as a justification. Specifically, we are referring to, Operation Praying Mantis, where Reagan sank Iran’s entire navy and bases after an American ship hit an Iranian mine.
If Trump wants to hold back a little so that he’s still got room to escalate, turning a shiny new intelligence gathering ship like this one into a hole in the ocean would go a long way to sending a message that we’re getting a little tired of the Iran regime’s bull***t — especially after Iran hired people to murder Trump before he could take office.
As for escalation? It’s a little difficult for a totalitarian regime like Iran to pay for terrorism from their oil field profits if the entire oil infrastructure has been blown to atoms… isn’t it?
Is that outcome sure to happen? No.
Is it on the table and under consideration?
You could bet your bottom dollar that it is. And a regime whose hold on power in their own country is as shaky as Iran’s has GOT to be running the math on those odds.
Say what you will about the disadvantages of his negotiating style, THIS is where Trump’s unpredictability is a force multiplier in negotiations. It doesn’t have to be a strong possibility that Trump’s wild enough to do it… just that there is SOME possibility.
Exactly the opposite situation that risk-averse Joe Biden had when HE tried to bluff foreign powers, and they wouldn’t so much as answer the phone when he called.",,1
"Hacktivists, The Russia-Ukraine Conflict, X, And The Possibility of WW3","The world of geopolitics is already a minefield of diplomatic tightropes, military posturing, and economic chess games. Add hacktivism to the mix, and suddenly, it’s less a well-orchestrated game of global strategy and more like trying to defuse a bomb while blindfolded—using chopsticks.
The recent 
, originating from a Ukrainian IP address, has set off alarm bells. Is this the work of rogue Ukrainian actors furious about peace negotiations? Or a classic Russian false-flag operation? Or maybe, just maybe, it’s an entirely unrelated third party stirring the pot for their own reasons? Either way, it’s yet another reminder that in the digital age, wars aren’t just fought with bullets and bombs—they’re waged in cyberspace, too.
Since Russia rolled into Ukraine in 2022, hacktivism has become an unofficial front in the war. Ukrainian-aligned groups like the 
 have been launching attacks on Russian infrastructure, hitting everything from government websites to financial institutions.
Meanwhile, 
, the infamous decentralized hacking collective, declared “cyber war” against the Russian government, claiming responsibility for various leaks and service disruptions. These groups operate outside traditional chains of command, driven by ideology rather than state orders. And as peace negotiations tiptoe forward, there are bound to be factions—on both sides—who see compromise as betrayal.
Which brings us to the cyberattack on X. The attack was traced back to a Ukrainian IP, but let’s not kid ourselves—that doesn’t tell us much. Cybersecurity experts know that IP addresses can be spoofed as easily as a high schooler faking a doctor’s note. The 
, which has historically focused on targeting Israeli and NATO-linked organizations, took credit for the attack.
That’s interesting because, on paper, they have little direct stake in Russia and Ukraine’s peace talks. But this is where things get tricky: could Dark Storm be acting as a proxy for another power? Could this be a Russian effort to frame Ukraine? Or an entirely separate party using an ongoing geopolitical crisis as a smokescreen for their own agenda?
Regardless of who’s behind it, the implications are dangerous. A single cyberattack, especially one that disrupts communication or infrastructure, could tank already fragile negotiations. It’s the digital equivalent of lobbing a grenade into a peace summit.
If we’ve learned anything from modern cyber warfare, it’s that false-flag operations are standard practice. Russia has a well-documented history of using cyber tactics to create confusion and misdirection. Their state-sponsored hacker groups—often referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)—are notorious for operations that masquerade as hacktivism. 
, a GRU-linked hacking unit, has a long rap sheet of digital sabotage, including attacks on the U.S. Democratic National Committee and European governments. The goal? Sow discord, destabilize narratives, and create plausible deniability.
If Russian actors wanted to slow down or derail Ukraine’s negotiations with the West, launching an attack from a Ukrainian IP address would be a brilliant (if not predictable) move. Western governments, wary of cyber aggression, might second-guess their support for Ukraine if they believed Kyiv was behind a high-profile cyber assault. And if this attack on X isn’t the last—and it won’t be—expect more digital smokescreens designed to confuse, divide, and inflame tensions.
Now, let’s zoom out. The world isn’t just dealing with a Ukraine-Russia cyber problem. Hacktivists, cybercriminals, and state-sponsored cyber terrorists like 
 are thriving in this chaotic environment. And the damages are not limited to public sector, as the recent 
, for example, is just one of thousands of phishing schemes targeting individuals.
Cryptocurrency markets, which President Trump has recently championed, are also under siege, with scams like the
 draining digital wallets faster than you can say “blockchain.” Meanwhile, ransomware gangs like Black Basta are holding businesses hostage, exposing the internal workings of cybercrime syndicates that operate more like Fortune 500 companies than rogue groups of hackers.
This is the new reality: cyber threats aren’t just hitting governments and corporations—they’re trickling down to everyday people. If a hacker group can compromise a major social media platform, imagine what they can do to financial institutions, healthcare systems, power grids, or even small businesses. Cyber warfare is no longer an abstract, futuristic concept. It’s here, it’s happening, and it’s evolving at breakneck speed.
With hacktivism on the rise and geopolitical tensions playing out in cyberspace, here are some possible remedies:
 – Countries need stronger digital forensics capabilities to track and expose real culprits. Without definitive attribution, false flags will continue to muddy the waters.
 – Just as nuclear weapons have strict international oversight, cyber weapons need better global regulation. We’re way past the point of treating these threats as mere “hacker problems.”
– If you think cyber warfare is just a government problem, think again. Businesses and individuals need to be educated on security basics, from avoiding cyber threats to securing digital assets and leveraging online technical support options.
 – The West, and particularly Ukraine, must bolster its cybersecurity infrastructure. Governments should treat cybersecurity as a frontline defense mechanism, not an afterthought.
Hacktivism is no longer just about rebellious teens defacing websites with digital graffiti. It’s a geopolitical weapon, one that can shift narratives, derail peace efforts, and wreak havoc on global security. The recent attack on X is a prime example of how murky the cyber battlefield has become—was it an internal Ukrainian protest, a Russian false-flag, or an unrelated rogue actor? The terrifying answer is: it could be any of the above.
As the world tiptoes toward a resolution in Ukraine, the cyber war will rage on. And unless governments, businesses, and individuals take cybersecurity seriously, we might all find ourselves caught in the crossfire of the next digital attack. Because in the world of hacktivism, peace is just another vulnerability waiting to be exploited.

Why ENORMOUS Judgment Against Greenpeace Should Have Dem Dark Money In A Cold Sweat,"This should be especially bad news for any of the dark-money groups that have quietly been ramping up violence against politically expedient targets — say, Tesla, for example.
What could a North Dakota jury judgment handed down against Greenpeace over a pipeline have to do with dark money politics-for-hire across the country? Quite a lot, actually.
At issue were the pipeline protests in North Dakota like the one where environmental activists cared so DAMNED much about the land that it took a state of emergency and the Army Corps of Engineers to avert an environmental catastrophe:
“Warm temperatures have accelerated snowmelt in the area of the Oceti Sakowin protest camp … Due to these conditions, the governor’s emergency order addresses safety concerns to human life as anyone in the floodplain is at risk for possible injury or death,” said the statement.
However, “the order also addresses the need to protect the Missouri River from the waste that will flow into the Cannonball River and Lake Oahe if the camp is not cleared and the cleanup expedited,” the statement read.
…Just how much waste and trash did the environmentally conscious DAPL protesters leave? “Local and federal officials estimate there’s enough trash and debris in the camp to fill about 2,500 pickup trucks,” reported AP. — 
Not surprisingly, months-long protests are chosen because they can cause both damage and harm, depending on the group, the tactics, and their intent.
The owner and operator of the pipeline, who lost an enormous contract as a result of their actions, took the protesters to court. They suffered serious financial harm and those who caused it should bear the responsibility for making them whole. Modern notions of protest notwithstanding, that’s how the court system was designed. When they took Greenpeace and the Red Warrior Camp (who the plaintiff claimed was their proxy) to court on exactly this principle, the jury agreed.
After two days of deliberation, the New York Times reported, the jury returned the verdict. Energy Transfer, the owner and operator of the pipeline, filed the lawsuit in North Dakota state court against Greenpeace and Red Warrior Camp, which Energy Transfer claimed was a front for Greenpeace, and three individuals. 
The lawsuit alleges that Greenpeace had engaged in a misinformation campaign with mass emails falsely claiming that the Dakota Access Pipeline would cross the sovereign land of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. In court filings, Energy Transfer claimed protesters engaged in a campaign of “militant direct action,” including trespassing on the company’s property, vandalizing construction equipment, and assaulting employees and contractors. —
This comes at a very bad time for violent leftwing activists. For years, the establishment left has been somewhere between indifferent to, or even happy to see violence on the streets, so long as that violence aligns with causes on the political left.
You never hear the kind of breathless language they establishment use when describing, for example ‘the Proud Boys’ when they describe, say, Antifa, BLM, Jayne’s Revenge (violent abortion activists), Palestinian Protesters, trans extremists, or (now) anti-Tesla crowds embracing forms of violence ranging from rioting on the streets, storming a building and threatening a young woman inside it, holding universities hostage, or vandalizing/firebombing Christian pro-life institutions, threatening churches, or most recently attacking anyone or anything with a Tesla connection.
The one thing so many of these movements including the current organized attacks against Tesla — have in common is copious amounts of financial backing. Efforts like what we have seen in DOGE, not to mention an FBI interested in prosecuting such crimes instead of helping them raise bail money — will be a game-changer on the investigation side of this problem.
AG Bondi, and those working with her have made it clear that investigating these firebombings (and the SWAT-ings) will be treating the use of incendiary devices under statutes listing such actions as a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
If the logic of this Greenpeace case is extended to culpability of the Dark Money orgs who have been using third-party agitator groups as arm’s-length shock troops for hire that give them a plausible deniability…
… this North Dakoto ruling may set a precedent that says otherwise. One that other groups who have been harmed by political activism over the last number of years might play ‘follow the money’ with in seeking the redress of their harms.
Elon seems to think the breadcrumbs for a lot of the dark money issues will take us back to familiar names like ‘Act Blue’ or ‘Arabella Advisors’. If the early clues at DOGE, and the mayhem unfolding at Act Blue are any indicator, he could be on to something there.
It would take some imaginative thinking to come up with deterrents to a purely mercenary cause-of-the-day agitator group than the twin prongs of drying up the money supply and dropping the perpetrators in a hole where they can be completely forgotten about by society for a decade or two.
And if the feds draw the same inference with criminal culpability that the jury in North Dakota just did? Those media establishment types who were publicly giddy about Biden’s use of RICO statutes to take down Trump will soon be choking on their words and looking to bury records of their public statements cheering the Trump team prosecutions.",,1

How did he do? The ‘come in like a wrecking ball’ promises, to salt the ground from which many worthless, wasteful, and unaccountable government departments spring, and to expose the freeloaders and frauds who have been fleecing the taxpayer for personal gain for who and what they really are. 
Was he able to advance that plan despite the best efforts of the activist left and their friends and allies in the media, deep state, and some courthouses to derail him?
And how do we like what we’ve seen so far, from a Christian perspective?

BEN & JERRY’S CEO FIRED: Cancel Culture Warrior Gets Taste Of Own Medicine,"When culture warriors become literal corporate sell-outs, they shouldn’t be surprised when the laws of economics come and bite them in the ass.
There’s a reason ‘go woke go broke’ has become axiomatic. Even institutions as big as Disney and Bud Light have learned they are not too big to feel the sting of a spurned public returning the favor.
As for politics, there aren’t many corporate political attention whores louder than Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.
Ben & Jerry’s sold their company to Unilever in 2000, with the expectation that they could continue their political grandstanding. It looks like, 25 years later, reality has finally caught up with them.
In a legal complaint filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday night, Ben & Jerry’s alleged that Unilever dismissed chief executive David Stever after he failed to comply with the parent company’s efforts to prevent it from speaking out on political issues.
“Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry’s personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever’s efforts to silence the Social Mission,” the filing read.
“On March 3, 2025, Unilever informed the Independent Board that they were removing and replacing Mr. Stever as Ben & Jerry’s CEO.” — 
A related case, from 2024, detailed the fights over Ben & Jerry’s fighting for the right to push their pro-Palestine, Anti-Israel positions, including donating money to groups like CAIR, who was once named 
The old CEO has now been fired, and the case cited above involves claims that Unilever is attempting to disband the activist group steering B&J’s activism. The subsidiary is taking the case to court. Again.
It said Unilever chastised Stever in a January performance review for “repeatedly acquiescing” to Ben & Jerry’s promotion of social goals, and has repeatedly warned personnel not to defy its efforts to “silence the social mission.”

Ben & Jerry’s also said Unilever’s attacks on its social mission have reached “new levels of oppressiveness.”

It said Unilever blocked it in February from honoring Black History Month, and more recently from supporting the release from detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. legal permanent resident active in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University and who the Trump administration wants to deport. —
He gives a big thumbs-up to using financial pressure to force countries to bend to his will, and it doesn’t occur to this clown that his own obnoxious petulance can trigger the same response against the brand he claims to represent? Or that 25 years of this increasingly radical activism could poison all value of the brand to the company that bought it in the first place, turning it into a potential net-negative for the company’s bottom line?
The are literally aligning themselves with groups and individuals affiliated with designated foreign terror groups.
It hardly a zero-risk association for the parent brand. Especially seeing how little patience the public had with Bud Light.

Trump Unleashing Autopen Nightmare Against Biden’s NeverTrump Cabal,"All that pretending like Biden was cognitively fit to serve as POTUS is about to backfire… Bigly.
There were rumblings in recent days that the Biden Autopen story would set up a constitutional crisis. Now, it has endangered the very people it was intended to protect.
First, it was noticed that the signatures on some of his orders were identical. That’s a problem, pointing to the use of an autopen. Making matters worse, some of Biden’s orders were signed while he was out of town. That’s a pretty serious problem.
Not to mention that Joke Biden was in the Virgin Islands when ""someone"", in Washington DC, used autopen to sign those pardons. 
— Linda Traitz (@LindaTraitz) 
 
The Constitution required the president to be personally involved and present:
Is the ""autopen"" allowed for presidential pardons? NO!
The ""autopen"" is NOT constitutionally protected because it requires the president to be present at the signing of the pardon.
Joe Biden was on vacation in another state when the pardons were signed. 
 Your Move?

Needless to say, Trump has been feeding the memes since this came to light with social media posts like this one.
And getting in on them himself:
All joking aside, this has very serious implications for people who may have been abusing their authority to the detriment of other people. Especially those who may have thought they were free and clear, as explained in

The potential consequences are bad enough for the Biden Crime family, and the bad actors in his administration who thought they need never pay a price for all they have done.
But with today being the day that no less than Dan Bongino is being sworn in as Kash Patel’s deputy, with a LOT of questions he still wants answered about Russiagate, the Jan 6 committee hearings, the pipe bomb, and other questions that had been quietly swept under the rug…
This clip is from Dan Bongino’s Friday show 2/21/25. Which is exactly 2 days and 6 hours before Trump announced he will be the Deputy Director of the FB👁️.

"Nugent, Pressler, And The Critical Importance Of An Overlooked Vote In Wisconsin","Less than 2 weeks out from the vote, it’s time for Conservatives to show they care about the little details that add up to important wins.
The past 2 months have been a masterclass in showing how important it is to have a judge on the bench who isn’t nakedly cheering for the DNC, even when neither law nor precedent support siding with activist Dem lawfare hacks.
What is NOT as obvious to the electorate is how important a Wisconsin vote that is already underway will play in whether Dems can run that exact play in Wisconsin during the lead-up to the Midterm elections.
The electorate is not the only part of Wisconsin that’s split pretty nearly down the middle. Their courts have the same dynamic. Whichever candidate (and therefore party) wins the vote today will hold the majority in State politics there… which can have implications on anything from election rules to the daily aspects of living our lives.
Here’s Ted Nugent’s recent appeal for conservatives to get involved in voting, or persuading their conservative friends in the area to do the same.
Ted Nugent urging Wisconsin to vote for Brad Schimel.
Shame that the liberals ran him off the Wisconsin County fair circuit. Did an epic show in Racine in summer of 2016. Spent the evening riffing against Hillary between songs.

And here’s Scott Pressler — who did heroic work in signing up GOP voters in flipping Pennsylvania red in the last election — giving an update on what the initial results of Wisconsin’s early voting mean for our chances and get-out-the-vote effort there.
Wisconsin, we really need to pick it up in early voting.
Tomorrow, I’ll be knocking on doors & chasing ballots in Waukesha. 
— ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) 
The post he was quote-tweeting (
) goes into details about the turnout numbers favoring the Dems for now… but in a way that leaves optimism for the GOP if we can light a fire under our asses and take this job seriously. Here’s one part of the multi-part message:
The first day of Wisconsin, early in-person voting is in the books, and each candidate has something to like.
🔵Susan Crawford – Turnout for day one was a little light. 34,036 voters showed up, more than double the first day in 2023 but short of what Schimel wants to see. A modest turnout ensures Dane County’s oversized influence and prevents R’s from running up the numbers in the rural.
🔴Brad Schimel – Where the vote came from yesterday was good news for Republicans. Waukesha led all counties in raw vote turnout (a rarity), and Ozaukee + Washington counties led overall turnout rates compared to previous general elections.
If you’re a Republican, you love to see where the early vote comes from. If you’re a Democrat, you love to see that the volume is modest, at best.
Susan Crawford remains in pole position, and early voting continues through Sunday, March 30th.

Dems, still reeling from the curb-stomping they received in November have announced Wisconsin is their first big investment since the election.
DEMS are taking this vote seriously enough to get a phone bank up and running to drive turnout.
The Democratic National Committee is set to announce on Tuesday its earliest-ever new election cycle investment into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, which will see Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate, take on Republican-backed Brad Schimel, a former state attorney general and current Waukesha County judge, ABC News has learned exclusively. —

In his recent appearance on the Eric Metaxas show, he and Doug Giles talked about how to make the church into a place that won’t send men running from it with their hair on fire, how leaders who lost the confidence of the public in the last few years can go about restoring that confidence, the responsibility of the individual believer in holding leadership’s feet to the fire, and an encouraging word for believers who think they’ve ‘missed the window of opportunity’ in being useful to God.

Dems Back Hamas Terror Simp — PressSec Nukes Them From Orbit,"Marco Rubio kicked a hornets’ nest when he made the decision to pull the credentials of the guy organizing violent protests at schools that celebrate the heinous acts of recognized terror groups.
He’s been picked up by authorities and he is being sent back to a country he likes better than this one.
Naturally, the Democrats are incensed.
Senators posted this online:
Followed immediately by this, without even a hint of self-awareness:
Mahmoud Khalil is not mere protester. He’s an organizer. The protests he has been organizing have been the kind that result in property damage and violent clashes. He has shown open support for Hamas, and and their tactics. His group is posting calls to action like this one:
Mahmoud Khalil supports terrorism, supports October 7. His group openly supports the murder of civilians and the, um, overthrow of Western civilization. Or something.
You can insist on this neo-Nazis-marching-in-Skokie debate, sure. It's America. The commitment to free speech… 
 
— Haviv Rettig Gur (@havivrettiggur) 
 
Others have specifically invoked language connected to the October 7th Massacre with an urge to ‘look to the tactics of the Palestinians’.  When an American citizen breaks America’s laws, they face charges. 
When someone from abroad does, they can be removed from the country. Dems have tipped their hand by showing which side of this issue they have sided with in Khalil’s case. That’s exactly the question Trump’s Press Sec addressed in a question about Khalil and charges.
The question that sets up Karoline Leavitt’s reply comes in at the 31:45 timestamp on the original X post that this video comes from.
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt Briefs Members of the Media, Mar. 11, 2025

She knows this question will be coming, and she’s ready for it. She cites the specific authority that grants Rubio to revoke the status of this guy and anyone else who sees fit to pick up where he left off.
The short version of her answer is this: Rubio does not require that a criminal charge be leveled against someone for the Secretary of State to revoke his right to be in the country. Other criteria can trigger such a lawful response, and those criteria were met.",,1
Judge Vs. Trump DOJ In Case Of Deporting Terrorist Crime Syndicate,"The same Dems who spent 4 years denouncing the courts as hopelessly corrupt and in need of reform suddenly can’t seem to rush enough cases before their favorite judges.
When they kept ruling against Biden’s unconstitutional mandates, speech infringement, and exercise of extra-legal authority (debt forgiveness and eviction moratoriums) they were ‘bad’. Now that the courts are their only path to exercising any political power at all, they suddenly can’t get enough of them.
And their hand-picked activist judges seem to understand the assignment. In a little more than a month, they have already passed as many or more Temporary Restraining Orders against Trump’s executive action that they passed in the entirety of Biden’s 4 year term.
With their once-reliable bureaucratic firewall being torn down to the studs, Dems are getting desperate. They are suddenly opposed to absolutely everything. This time, it’s the deportation of criminal terrorists in the Tren De Aragua gang.
Here’s the headline summing up the key facts of the issue:
Here’s Bondi’s reply:
“Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump’s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk. The Department of Justice is undeterred in its efforts to work with the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and all of our partners to stop this invasion and Make America Safe Again.”
What does that mean? Well, here’s a hint, from the President of the country to which they were headed:
Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country. They were immediately transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center, for a period of one year (renewable).
The United States will pay a very low fee for them,…

The full text of that tweet, as follows:
Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country. They were immediately transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center, for a period of one year (renewable).
The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us.
Over time, these actions, combined with the production already being generated by more than 40,000 inmates engaged in various workshops and labor under the Zero Idleness program, will help make our prison system self-sustainable. As of today, it costs $200 million per year.
On this occasion, the U.S. has also sent us 23 MS-13 members wanted by Salvadoran justice, including two ringleaders. One of them is a member of the criminal organization’s highest structure.
This will help us finalize intelligence gathering and go after the last remnants of MS-13, including its former and new members, money, weapons, drugs, hideouts, collaborators, and sponsors.
As always, we continue advancing in the fight against organized crime. But this time, we are also helping our allies, making our prison system self-sustainable, and obtaining vital intelligence to make our country an even safer place. All in a single action.
May God bless El Salvador, and may God bless the United States.

What would breaking the Western church’s annoying habit of mediocracy actually look like?
I’m glad you asked, because we’ve got a couple of guys who have already seen what success looks like. And it’s nothing like what so many of the authors with their slick hair would have you think.
The problem with so many of the opportunities God puts in front of us is that it looks an awful lot like hard work. And if you aren’t motivated for the end result the way that Jesus was when he ‘despised the cross but endured the shame’ specifically because of the redeemed people who would be waiting for Him on the other side of His obedience… most of us are going to give up long before we see any real results.
But for anyone who’s serious about getting in the game? We’ve got some stories that can put some steel in your spine and encourage you about what that kind of success for someone who wants to stand with his head up and shoulders back before the Audience Of One can really look like.

HEY LIBS: What Trump Said About Canada’s Conservative Will Melt Your Brains,"The few people paying attention will notice that up in the Great White North, Trudeau is gone, a WEF globalist took his place, and the commanding Conservative lead is up in smoke.
Surely Trump will throw Pierre Poilievre a lifeline to help him out, right? He’s a Conservative, after all.
Trump’s tariff agenda caught everyone in Canada flat-footed, and it’s a big reason Mark Carney (pictured below with Epstein’s girl) rushed in to fill a sudden and unexpected Trudeau vacancy.
In the same way that the Dems have yet to figure out exactly how to unify in their opposition to Trump, as he moves like a bulldozer through so many of their favorite things, Canadians are scrambling to find a response to the existential threat tariffs will cause the Canadian economy. 
Trump may be joking about the 51st state thing. Mostly. But there’s a kernel of truth at the heart of it. Canada’s economy has been characterized by some who know as a house of cards, largely propped up by protectionist trade policy.
Remember the conservative Canuck with the apple who was so popular a while back? He’s the leader of the Conservatives. With an election coming up, and the message of ‘Trudeau is corrupt and can’t lead worth a damn’ suddenly irrelevant with Trudeau leaving, he has to convince a nervous Canadian public that he’s ‘doing someting’.
Leftwing media in Canada (almost oll of it) wants voters to see Poilievere as ‘little Trump’, and uses the same king of ‘pulling his strings’ puppet imagery about their relationship that the Presstitutes try to use in calling Trump subservient to Putin. *Yawn*
Because Canada does not yet see through their lying press, many are believing what they’re being told… which is turning independents away from Pierre, in favor of the shiny new guy from Davos who was just sworn in to replace Trudeau. (Majority Leader gets to be Prime Minister. Just like England. It’s messy, but it’s the system they’ve got.)
Here’s Trump’s chance to set the record straight, to denounce the new guy and smile on Pierre Poilievre, who is a fiscal conservative who believes in many of the same principles that energize MAGA.
Given a chance to make nice with Pierre, what did he do? He said nicer things about the Big Lib than he did about the Conservative who ‘said some bad things’ about him.
Here’s the clip:
WOW! “I’d rather deal with a Liberal than a Conservative”. 
Donald Trump just endorsed the Liberals in Canada. 
I wonder how the radical left will react now 🤔 
— 🇨🇦 Jack (@JackDan110) 
 
Suddenly all of those friends-with-Trump arguments have just boomeranged on Canada’s Libs, and Poilievere is the one Trump doesn’t want. Either he means it, or he’s posturing. And really, with Trump… who can say they’re sure they can tell the difference half the time?
The election just got that much more complicated. Which, in the end, is good for Trump’s bargaining from a position of strength. And he knows it.",,1
COVID Fraud Squad Slaps Criminal Charges On Husband Of AOC’s ‘Squad’ Co-Belligerent,"With COVID fraud numbers so high that they beggar the imagination, you might expect that politicians would want to see the fraudsters get caught, and money clawed back.
There was SOME work in that regard, but maybe you noticed that other than some lip service to the question, getting answers for where the money REALLY went never quite seemed to be huge priority for the political class.
Nobody could have predicted the appearance of DOGE, as it is currently running, to show up on the scene and spot the sort of complicated webs of deceit that are specifically spun to make forensic audits almost impossible to follow. Algorithms can the movement of numbers with a speed and clarity that people cannot. Money is just another kind of number that it’s tracking.
Since DOGE came to town, it has been said that one of the safest bets in the whole process is that there will be close family, business, or romantic connections between the politicians putting a pen to the wasteful policy, and the politicians cashing in on it.
Enter Cori Bush, the former Congresswoman — and member of AOC’s so-called ‘Squad’– whose husband is being charged with misuse of pandemic money.
The husband of former U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, has been charged with defrauding the government after allegedly accepting $20,000 in payments from the pandemic-era Paycheck Protection and Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs, the Justice Department said. 
Cortney Merritts, 46, of St. Louis, falsified details about his purported businesses to obtain loans from the Small Business Administration in 2020 and 2021, federal prosecutors said Thursday. 
He was charged with two counts of wire fraud. —
Isn’t interesting that someone who had ZERO interest in giving people like Trump, the J6 defendants, Kyle Rittenhouse, or Brett Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence will now insist on having that bedrock principle applied to the allegations her husband now faces.
There’s a reason the left is losing. They keep thinking people like her represent their future.",,1
Beware of the DOGE!,"After years of politicians on both sides of the aisle promising to put an end to the waste, theft, and abuse of taxpayer funds at the federal level, you’d think someone is finally making good on that promise.
With DOGE racking up one win after another as they overturn rocks in the DC swamp and find out what’s REALLY been lurking under there, you’d think the DOGE team would be celebrated with a ticker tape parade.
Instead, they’re being hailed as the worst kind of villain. And that makes no sense at all.
Unless, that is, there is something about the waste and abuse they’re uncovering that politicians actually approve of and want to keep hidden from the public eye.

Tulsi’s Syria Prediction Took Just Over One Month To Materialize… Where Are Those ‘Putin Puppet’ Claims NOW?,"It’s easy to talk about toppling a regime… until you’re faced with hard questions of who will rise up to take their place.
Syria’s Assad is a bad guy. No question. He was one of those leaders that CIA types were really excited to depose. Apparently, we haven’t yet learned any lessons about how toppling governments can often make bad situations worse. Remember the video of Hillary laughing about Ghadaffi? There’s a community in the failed state his death left behind you will have heard of: Benghazi.
News sites from October 2016 blamed 
. Earlier that year, 
 for not taking out Assad. Well, now Hillary has her wish. Assad is gone and the side she backed in the conflict has taken power. 
See also ‘Timber Sycamore’, the now-declassified Obama-era CIA program of arming Syria’s rebels, who happened to be aligned with another group, described in the Wiki entry: “and about Timber Sycamore-backed rebels fighting alongside the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front and its allies.”
Al Qaeda, huh? Sounds bad.
Fast forward to 2025. Tulsi Gabbard, who has long since taken a professional interest in that conflict and our role in it, rejected the assurances of American intelligence ‘experts’. The issue 
. As bad as we might think Assad is, this new regime could turn out to be even worse.
Her wording in January: “I shed no tears for the fall of the Assad regime, but today we have an islamist extremist who is now in charge of Syria. As I said, danced on the streets to celebrate the 9/11 attack, who ruled over [unclear] with an Islamist extremist governance, and who has already begun to persecute and kill and arrest religious minorities like Christians in syria.
We haven’t been able to drop in Twitter posts today, so we can’t SHOW you the video of this Jihadi clown in Syria bragging about the murder of 9000 people in 2 days. But the 
 will take you there.
As for the symbol on his shirt, others have noticed it too. We have no explanation.
Here are pleas from the victims, this one 
:
Some courageous Christians are 
, denouncing the fresh evil of the new regime.
Christians are 
, desperate to flee to safety — ironically hoping for protection from the Russian military that has a presence there.
Remember how the Fake News media framed Trump’s position on this exact issue when Trump made the ‘devil you know’ argument about this question all those years ago?
It was 2015, He hadn’t won the primary yet, and wasn’t getting Presidential briefings. And he STILL had this issue pegged.
Any chance they will apologize now? I’m guessing ‘no’.",,2
"CANADA: One Leader ‘Gets’ The Tariff Strategy, Others Are Boarding The FAFO Train","Trump likes the tariffs because they are a direct tool HE can use in high-pressure negotiations where he feels other countries have not been working in America’s best interests.
To bring anyone up to speed on what he’s trying to accomplish, so far as Canada goes, part of the confusion comes from two different stated objectives. One objective is tied to security concerns with a border nation, the other addresses what Trump sees as unfair financial practices.
The border issue is less complicated, so let’s get that out of the way first. Canada has announced a Border Czar. But big deal. As you recall, so did Biden. Trump is taking what might be argued as a Reaganesque ‘trust but verify’ approach to Canada and the border.
Canadian leaders have talked the talk, but 
 making specific statements about the ‘walk the walk’ we are waiting for them to take.
If you follow the link to the video, you will find she’s making specific and clear demands about US access to law enforcement information concerning would-be border-crossers, and specific changes to tighten up the border inspection process.
As for the financial side, long before Trump ever ran for office, he was on record complaining about the trade imbalances, about jobs leaving the country, and about currency manipulation keeping the price of foreign goods artifically low. Add protectionist policies keeping American goods from competing in the other country’s markets and you’ve got a pretty good list of the concerns that have Trump annoyed with Canada.
Remember, when he went on the world stage, telling friendly countries through Europe and the Indo-Pacific that reciprocal tax rates would be assessed and set as reciprocal to foreign countries based on how well they are willing to play ball with America (potentially lowering the tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers in both countries and resulting in a freer market in each direction).
In a sense, he’s throwing the ball in the other country’s court: we have a market to which you want access, do you want it badly enough that you are willing to drop your Anti-American protectionist trade policies?
Alberta is the closest analog Canada has to Texas, rich in oil and natural resources, lots of farmers and ranchers, generally conservative-leaning (except for the cities), and is generally taken for granted by, and at odds with, all the stupid leftwing policies churned out in the national capital after being fleeced by Ottawa for their revenues. As mentioned, basically Alberta’s Texas.
The Provincial Premier understands the game Trump is playing, and cares enough about her province to get on the winning side of that equation. She’s walking a line that keeps meeting Trump’s demands and pushing back to preserve Alberta’s interests in careful tension. The provincial government made a few moves to respond — buy Canadian provisions on government contracts for example — but has come out against retaliatory tariffs:
A sensible middle ground from someone in the country being hammered by tariffs and who is expected to ‘do something’ by citizens whipped up into a froth by various state-owned, or ‘captured’ media outlets.
Of course, many other Canadians would rather treat Alberta as a sacrificial lamb, throwing a bomb into Alberta’s oil economy just to spite Trump with some higher prices.
The newly-minted replacement for Justin Trudeau, Mark Carney, is among them:
He wants to keep tariffs on 
‘. At this rate, that’s going to be a cold day in hell, Mark.
That’s really not how this works, guys.
The Premier of Ontario (the province North of everything from Minnesota through New York State) is doubling down. He wants to put a surcharge on electricity being exported to the US. (Yes, that’s a thing. Yes, there’s a lot of it.)
First off, that surcharge will mainly hurt blue states in the North East. If Canucks want to see blue states actually rally behind Trump and rage against their liberal neighbo(u)rs to the North, that just might do it.
But really, Canada’s economy is far more dependent on Americas than vice versa. The countries are financially integrated, sure. Without Canada, America takes a step backward, adapts, and continues forward. Without America, Canada’s economy is in free-fall.
Trump is well aware of this fact. In fact, he’s using it to squeeze Canada’s politicians.
There’s an easy way and a hard way out of the situation Canadian politicians find themselves in. But the choice will ultimately be theirs to make.
At least SOME politicians have had the good sense not to immolate their own economies just to stick it to Orange Man Bad. Will cooler heads prevail?
Hard to say. These are the guys who

Foreign Hackers Take Responsibility For Attack On Twitter/X Yesterday,"When Kudlow asked Elon about the attack on X, he mentioned a place-name. But let’s not jump to any conclusions yet about what that means.
Anyone with a VPN knows that there is at least SOME possibility of the internet addresses we’re looking at being spoofed. Or that the attacks can come by way of 3rd party computers infected with malware.
We ARE, after all, looking at the shady world of interwebz and hackers, where nothing is as it seems. The IP addresses were traced back to Ukraine. But whether they actually originated from there is another question.
What we DO know is that, on top of Democrat Dark Money groups paying people to harass Elon’s Tesla company — with no clear answers forthcoming on whether those same Darm Money efforts are connected directly or indirectly with violence being taken against Tesla, their company, their chargers, and even some instances of targeting Tesla drivers.

"House Passes Budget Bill… If Shutdown Comes, Blame Schumer (VIDEO)","Dems have done a LOT of talking about how concerned they are about federal employees… let’s see if they walk the walk.
Every last Democrat opposed the CR passed by the House today. While not ideal, it is structured in such a way that it funds border security and allows the massive cuts DOGE has been leading the way on to keep coming.
In other words, as ridiculously high as the budget still is, we will NOT locked in to spending every cent it authorizes. We have some wiggle room to keep cutting the Kudzu spending that has been choking out the actual legitimate functions of government.
Not everything we might have asked for, true. But mistakes made during Trump 1.0 have taught us the dangers inherent in letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Here is Speaker Johnson shortly before the vote, telling us he has the votes (he did) and that the bill was going to pass with or without any help from the Democrats (It passed without.)
He calls out the lies that Dems have been telling about Social Security. It takes 60 votes in the Senate to pass this bill, which means that success or failure of this bill will once again be a decision made by a certain Chuck U. Schumer. Mike has something to say about that, too:
Today, 
 did our job and voted to keep the government funded while 212 House Democrats voted for a shutdown.
Now, Senate Democrats have to decide if they want to do the right thing or if they’ll join House Democrats and shut down the government.

The President is pleased with this vote…
As for what’s in it? Here’s a thumbnail sketch summary:

Criminal COVID Fraudsters Just Got Some VERY Bad News… Time Is NOT On Your Side,"If you’re tired of criminal grifters scamming the government and getting away with it… we’ve finally got a good news story for you.
At least ONE category of criminal grifters will NOT be getting away with it… or at least, now that the DOJ is prioritizing prosecutions of the kind of scams that make political insiders fat and happy, they can’t count on indifferent politicians looking the other way while the clock winds down on the window of opportunity to prosecute.
For the many, many people with their hands in the cookie jar during COVID, that ‘window of opportunity’ just got a LOT bigger.
Remember how testy Dems got when anyone suggested clawing back the unspent COVID money even AFTER the pandemic was declared ‘over’? The states got almost 200 Billion from the Biden/Pelosi/Schumer administration. And there was a LOT of unspent money that hadn’t even been set aside for any particular use:
As of September 30, 2023, the latter group “reported obligating 73 percent ($142.4billion)” of their total and “spending 53 percent ($103.7 billion).”
In other words, state and D.C. governments are sitting on $92 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief money, more than $53 billion of which has not even been earmarked for anything. — 
Dems were eventually shamed into taking back $30B. But that still leaves a lot of money unaccounted for…
We know where some of it went…
Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the $579 billion in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.
“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.” — 
If early indicators in DOGE are what they seem, there is plenty of reason to take a closer look into popup NGOs that grew like mushrooms during the pandemic… and see how many really are what they claimed to be.
As of yesterday, time is finally working AGAINST the pandemic unemployment fraudsters. Running out the clock will no longer be an option.
PASSED!
The House just passed the Pandemic Unemployment Fraud Enforcement Act which will empower law enforcement to continue prosecuting fraudsters for robbing American taxpayers of $135 billion and claw that money back.

GUILTY: United Nations Judge In UK Convicted For Owning A Slave,"A United Nations criminal tribunal judge was just found guilty of violating the Modern Slavery Act. Her sentencing will come on May 2nd. What is the UN actually GOOD for?
Studying for a PhD in Oxford, and claiming she has diplomatic immunity as a Ugandan judge, this lady, a 
 was just convicted for violating the most basic of human rights: slavery.
Lydia Mugambe, High Judge in Uganda, a Criminal Trubunal judge for the United Nations, a student at Oxford, and someone who is listed as a ‘fellow’ at the Institute for the Study of Human Rights, has just been found guilty of one of the more heinous crimes a person can be accused of… a conviction only made worse by the nature of her role in society.
If others look to HER to be the arbiter of justice, to whom shall those she has wronged in the most grievous of ways turn?
Prosecutors said Lydia Mugambe “took advantage of her status” over her victim by preventing her from holding down steady employment while forcing her to work as her maid and provide childcare for free.

The 49-year-old, who is also a High Court judge in Uganda, was found guilty of conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law, facilitating travel with a view to exploitation, forcing someone to work, and conspiracy to intimidate a witness..

She will be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on May 2.
In footage released by Thames Valley Police, Mugambe appeared shocked when an officer said he was arresting her under the Modern Slavery Act.

She then had a conversation with the officer, in which she said: “I am a judge in my country, I even have immunity. I am not a criminal.” — 
Not a criminal? That’s pretty wild for someone who will be getting her sentencing in about 6 weeks.
What else do we know about the case?
The Thames Valley Police produced a 
 that seems pretty comprehensive. Here’s an excerpt.
Following an investigation by Thames Valley Police, a Ugandan High Court Judge and a UN Criminal Tribunal Judge has been convicted of immigration and modern slavery offences in Oxfordshire.
Lydia Mugambe, aged 49, of Lyne Road, Kidlington, has today (13/3) been found guilty by a unanimous Oxford Crown Court jury of:
One count of conspiring to do an act to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law by a non UK national;

One count of requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour;

One count of conspiracy to intimidate a witness.

Mugambe was found guilty by a majority verdict of:
One count of arranging or facilitating travel of another person with a view to exploitation;

On 10 February 2023, Thames Valley Police received a report that the victim in this case, a woman, was being held as a slave by Mugambe at her then address in Brasenose Drive, Kidlington.
A protracted and complex investigation involving a number of partners then ensued, during which Thames Valley Police established that Mugambe had obtained a visa for the victim to work in the UK.
The good news here is that Uganda waived her immunity. She’ll now face the same force of the law as any defendant… not that anyone should have to explain how the law works to such an eminent and educated woman as herself.",,2
UKRAINE: Trump Moves One Step Closer To Keeping That Peace Deal Promise,"Despite what the kinetic side of the conflict might tell us, it looks like Trump finally has prep for the peace negotiations back on track.
Anyone looking at the war reports in the Ukraine/Russia conflict will see they are still trading punches. That’s PART of the story, but not the whole story. Opportunities for peace — however unlikely they might seem to the casual observer, are budding like the first crocus of spring.
Most media types failed to understand the real reason Zelensky’s failed Oval Office visit bothered Trump so much. They chalked it up to ego and personality, when their ‘yass Queen’ hero Zelensky told the big bad Orange bully to pound sand right in his own house.
That wasn’t even CLOSE to what was eating at Trump. He has one goal and one goal only: use the tools at his disposal to keep the Ukraine conflict from spiraling out of control to become the next Archduke Ferdinand scenario, dragging the entire world into a nuclear-enabled Great Powers free-for-all.
We know that’s Trump’s concern. How do we know it? Because he keeps talking about how important it is that we avert WWIII. This is, in all probability, an even higher priority to him than any one preferred resolution of the current conflict.
Trump and Zelensky were SUPPOSED to come out of that meeting as the united voice calling for a path to peace, so that America’s energies could be spent on bringing Putin to the negotiating table.
The fact that Trump has done some very public arm-twisting policy announcements affecting both Zelensky AND Putin has shown that his first loyalty is not to one side or the other, so much as a path forward to peace.
With US military support on hold until Trump is convinced Zelensky is willing to negotiate peace in good faith, it wasn’t very long before Ukraine realized this isn’t a fight they can win without America in their corner.
That was the old story. Now, we’re turning the page to open up new possiblities.
Zelensky has not only sent a written letter of apology for how things played out in the Oval Office (a mistake many still lay at the feet of Democrats who had been quietly urging him to be hostile to Trump), but he has shown himself open to a period of ceasefire while negotiators from both sides look for some kind of an off-ramp from the conflict.
After the fallout and reconciliation, Ukrainian diplomats signaled their willingness to agree to a 30-day preliminary ceasefire with Russia as part of their negotiations with American officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

“Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,” the U.S. State Department said in a joint statement with Ukrainian officials.

After the negotiations, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the effort a “concrete step” from Ukraine and expressed “hope that the Russians will reciprocate.” “We hope that they’ll say yes, that they’ll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court,” Rubio said.–
For anyone with the kind of Pollyanna thinking that Russia will just agree go back to pre-war borders, the burden of proof is on them to show how a plan like that would possibly be enforced short of America putting boots on the ground to personally drive Russia out of the land they now occupy.
But a combination of carrots and sticks, including relaxing some of the punitive trade sanctions that have been in place, might help Russian leaders agree to some kind of a middle ground.
With the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that has guided Trump’s foreign policy thus far, who knows what might come out of it? We might even end up entertaining a creative solution that nobody has been talking about yet, like he did when he mentioned the minerals deal as a way to tie US interests to the region without ramping up the Russian anxieties that claim to see the forward march of NATO as an encroaching empire.",,2
"Commerce Secretary Mocks Wannabe Tough Guy From America’s Hat, ‘Trump Broke Him’ … With A Tweet","For all of five minutes, the leader of one Canadian province decided to talk tough. It did NOT work out how he had expected.

GAZA Protests Escalate In American Colleges… Here’s One Hamas Leader Saying The Quiet Part Out Loud,"With the ongoing conflict in Gaza heating up again, the Pro-Gaza protesters in America are escalating their campus protests again. The results are NOT the same as before.
And old footage from leaders of Hamas themselves are exposing as lies the cornerstone argument we hear in defending the legitimacy of Gazan claims against Israel… a bonus we will add at the end of this story.
Under Joe Biden, none of the particpants in the protests that included property destruction and in at least one instance, kidnapping, had the slightest concerns that they would be bounced out of the country like a sloppy drunk might be bounced out of a bar.
The Trump administration sees a student visa as a privilege — one that can be easily revoked if the person coming here is a detriment to society. The FAFO principle is rolling on, and one of the foreign born student protesters has already moved to the ‘finding out’ phase of that equation.
As Bill Melugin 
:
BREAKING: Per a senior State Department official, yesterday, the State Dept. revoked the first visa for an “alien who was previously cited for criminal behavior in connection with Hamas-supporting disruptions”.
I’m told this person was a university student, and “ICE will proceed with removing this person from the country.”
The official says the State Dept. reviewed over 100,000 visas, and records showed the Biden administration canceled zero visas for pro Hamas activities or associated criminal behavior, despite the wave of protests on college campuses that broke out after the 10/7/2023 terror attacks on Israel.
The student’s name is Mahmoud Khalil.
An administration spokesperson gave some clarifying details:
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, confirmed Khalil’s arrest in a statement Sunday, describing it as being “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.”
Khalil’s arrest is the first publicly known deportation effort under Trump’s promised crackdown on students who joined protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. The administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas.
McLaughlin signaled the arrest was directly connected to Khalil’s role in the protests, alleging he “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.” — 
With schools having their funding yanked, and protesters poised to resume the smash-and-occupy tactics we saw last year, this deportation may be the harbinger of more to come.
The entire basis of the justification of the conflict between Gaza and Israel hinges on questions of legitimacy and prior claim to the land. The pro-Gazan claim asserts that a distinct and unique people living on the land now called ‘Gaza’ have a history going back hundreds of generations. On that basis, they will insist that they have as much legitimacy — or possibly more — than the Jews returning to the ancient homeland.
Jews, obviously, would reply that is their ancient homeland, from which they were displaced by military might of successive invading forces. Their ancient homeland is one where the actual tombs of the patriarchs named in their scriptures can still be found… not to mention the central hub of religious life for Israel: Jerusalem, on which some part of their ancient temple still stands.
What happens to the Gazan claims if the idea of a distinctively Palestinian population is more myth than reality, if even their family names testify against them that their homelands were from many nearby Arab countries, especially Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
You might dismiss such a claim if it were only a Western writer with clear sympathies to the Israeli cause posing such questions. But what about when it comes from a Hamas leader’s own lips… one who himself claims to be of Egyptian descent?
All it took was 46 seconds to torpedo a key claim in the legitimacy of his own cause:
If you’re wondering who this guy is, the 
:
Fathi Hamad (فتحي حماد), born in 1961 in Gaza, has been a member of Hamas’s Politburo since 2017. He was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) in 2006, and appointed as Hamas’s minister of interior and national security in Gaza from 2009 to 2014. He is considered to be a hardliner.
Hamad joined the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1980 and was an active in student politics. He joined Hamas’s internal security force (“al-Majed”) in 1984, and formed the group’s first military presence in the Jabaliyya refugee camp in 1988. He spent six years in Israeli prisons from 1988 to 1994, in addition to being arrested three times by the PA for a total of two years. He helped to establish several Islamic media institutions and charities focusing on prisoners and people with injuries and special needs.
If even members of the leadership of freaking HAMAS are not buying the notion of Palistinians as a ‘Unique local subculture’ with greater natural claim to that land than Israelis… how is it that we in the West are buying it?",,2

"SCHUMER BLINKS: For All His Fiery Bluster, He Folds Like A Lawn Chair When The Shutdown Vote","Not so long ago, Dems knew they could force an issue, blame it on Republican intransigence, and have the media spin public opinion into blind obedience. This is proof that those days are over.
When the GOP took over the House a couple of years ago, responsiblity for drafting the budget fell on their shoulders. The first year, some Senate Republicans signed a Continuing Resolution deal with the Dems that negated any budgetary control the GOP could have in the first year.
Games were played, a leadership change came into place at the most inopportune time, and there was another deal with the devil made that kicked the can down the road. Budgets were being drafted, some even passed by the house… but Schumer refused to even take them up… because the guy who force-fed obnoxiously partisan (and patently deceptive) policy down everyone’s throats at every turn suddenly cared about bills being ‘bipartisan’. More likely, he was just holding out to get another CR stuffed with pork to fund all of the pet projects which just happen to serve as the financial equivalent of a Human Centipede (do NOT look that phrase up) recycling tax dollars into Democrat issues and back into Democrat pockets and/or campaigns.
Trump’s big win spoiled their party. And DOGE shone a light on all the dark places the rest of us were never supposed to see.
With the latests Government shutdown upon us unless federal funding is extended, the GOP took a gamble, passed a CR that fully funded the border wall and deportations (exactly the issue Schumer shut the government down over when Ryan’s budget was ready to pass).
It’s the Biden budget, with a few tweaks, but a LOT of changes are going to happen between now and when the new budget is revealed. We’ll see how the new-look leaner and more efficient Trump administration plays out, how much can be saved, and how big a difference those tariffs and tax cuts make in the economy.
Despite the fact that this CR would be (definitionally!) the same CR budget they passed just a few months ago when BIDEN’s name was on it, they were suddenly deeply opposed to everything in it, openly saying they would gladly shut down the government to oppose it.
Nobody said exactly what was different, there was just a lot of hand-waving and apocalyptic language. One after another they declared their vehement opposition to the Continuing Resolution that would keep the government funded.
Then Social Media — X, Rumble, and Truth Social — did their thing… digging up old clips of these very same Democrats denouncing government shutdowns as cruel, heartless, and unjust… making them own this shutdown and the moral bankruptcy they had already invested such shutdowns with.
They found themselves boxed in by their own words, and it really didn’t matter how cynical and insincere those words might have been when they were uttered, the other guys voted to keep Government open, and the party that was marching — by the dozens(!) — just days ago to protest federal firings at places like USAID is suddenly agreeing to send ALL but the most essential government workers home again.
And since Dems don’t have any levers of power here, they can’t sneak in any poison pills that would make a win or a loss equally useful to the Democrat narrative. Here he is trying to save face for capitulating only one day after taking his bold stand:
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., indicated Thursday he would vote to advance Republicans’ six-month funding bill that passed the House to avert a government shutdown Friday night.
The move is a major concession from Schumer, yielding to the GOP measure just one day after he vowed that Democrats wouldn’t allow it to pass. It means the bill is likely to find enough votes to clear the 60-vote threshold and eventually pass with a simple majority, even as a growing number of Senate Democrats came out in opposition to it Thursday.
“There are no winners in a government shutdown,” Schumer said in a floor speech. “It’s not really a decision; it’s a Hobson’s choice: Either proceed with the bill before us or risk Donald Trump throwing America into the chaos of a shutdown. —

Trump Doubles Down On Canada… They Are In Even Worse Shape Than We Thought,"Anyone who took Trump’s statements about Canada as merely overheated bluster will have to rethink their assessment of him after his latest Oval Office statements.
In one of his classic ‘allow me to unconfuse you’ moments, Trump spells out exactly what he meant when he made his most provocative statements about Canada being absorbed into the United States.
“I’m not going to bend at all.”
‘Canada only works as a state’, he says.
Trump: “Canada Should Be a U.S. State – We Don’t Need Them, They Need Us!”

— Open Source Intel (@Osint613) 
He’s even talking up how great it would be as a state. But the flip side of that coin is simple: Canada, as it is currently being run, cannot continue to exist without being propped up by sales to US markets.
Sure, that’s part of the argument. So is the argument that Canadians have the social programs they like to brag about only because they are standing under the protective umbrella of the US military who has been protecting them through the Cold War.
Without the access they have to US markets, their economy would be in the toilet. That’s the REAL reason Canadians are getting so uppity since Trump came to office. But it’s worse than that.
There have been recent stories detailing the Canadian military as being in dire shape, not only inadequate for cooperative multi-nation exercises with, say, NATO allies (a long-standing problem), but also in the ability to provide the most basic notion of national defence.
I recently had a conversation with Lt.-Gen. Michel Maisonneuve (ret.), and what he told me about Canada’s military was nothing short of alarming. He didn’t mince words—our armed forces are in dire straits. If we don’t act now, Canada will not only be unable to defend itself, but it will cease to be taken seriously by our allies, many of whom are already losing patience with our military decline.
Maisonneuve has seen firsthand what a functioning military looks like. He has served at the highest levels, working alongside our allies in NATO, and he knows exactly what Canada is failing to do. “We are no longer at the table when major defence decisions are made,” he told me. “The Americans don’t ask us what we think anymore because they know we can’t contribute.” That is a stunning indictment of where we now stand—a country that was once respected for its ability to punch above its weight militarily has been reduced to an afterthought.
The problem, as Maisonneuve laid out, is both simple and staggering: Canada doesn’t take its defence seriously anymore. The government has allowed our forces to wither. The Air Force is still flying CF-18s from the 1980s because the long-delayed F-35 procurement is years behind schedule. The Navy, once a competent maritime force, is barely functional, with no operational submarines and a fleet that is nowhere near what is needed to patrol our vast coastlines. Meanwhile, the Army is struggling to recruit and retain soldiers, leaving its numbers dangerously low. “We have an Army in name only,” Maisonneuve said. “If we were called upon tomorrow to deploy a fully operational combat force, we couldn’t do it.” —

HILARIOUS: Trump Just Turned Biden’s Open Borders App Into A Self-Deporting Tool,"Bill Melugin has been in the thick of pretty nearly every immigration story for years. It’s only right that he would be part of the crew breaking this one as it was announced.
The infamous open borders app that Joe Biden’s people used as a workaround to violate the law with impunity has been repurposed to ENFORCE the law.
Better yet, it’s being used for something that for Joe Biden’s people must nearly unthinkable: voluntary self-deportion.
Because when the alternative is criminal prosecution… getting the government to help you make your way back home isn’t so bad… especially now that all of the freebies are being exposed, shut down and starved for cash.
With our usual video sources a not cooperating at the moment, here is a Rumble video where Melugin is explaining what’s up.
If you want a shot at coming back to America legally some time in the future… self-deporting is your best shot. Because if you get caught… you’re done.",,2
"Dem’s Not-So-Secret Funding Weapon, ACTBLUE, Has Been Taking A Beating","Picking a fight with the guy behind DOGE was a serious tactical error on their part.
For years, ActBlue was the secret weapon Democrats used to dominate the GOP in fundraising. But they’ve been taking heat from many directions, and it’s starting to crack.
You know all those stories about Democrats crushing the GOP in fundraising? What if Sam Bankman-Fried wasn’t the only sketchy funding source the Dems have been relying on?
For one thing, DOGE has found a crapton of examples of NGOs acting as little more than a money-laundering racket where taxpayer money gets dumped into partisan projects which will inevitably sund partisan politics downstream of them.
Recent years have turned up all sorts of anomolies with ActBlue giving… including grandmothers who supposedly gave tens of thousands while eking out an existence on a fixed income.
🚨 BOMBSHELL ALERT: Maryland Grandma Exposes ActBlue's DIRTY LITTLE SECRET! 🚨
Cindy Nowe, a sweet senior from Annapolis, MD, supposedly donated OVER 1,000 TIMES to ActBlue in 2022—$18,849.77 total! That’s 3 donations A DAY, EVERY DAY, all year long. But when OMG asked her about…

Then were the various allegations of foreign donors pumping cash into Democrat coffers.
We’ve got supposedly ‘grassroots’ protests being exposed as nothing more than Craigslist protesters-for-hire paid by Act Blue… most recently the Tesla protests:
From LibsOfTiktok:
Anti-Elon protester admits he gets paid to protest outside a Tesla location.
Groups linked to Democrat fundraising platform ActBlue, which is funded by Soros, are paying people to protest against Elon. 
 
— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) 
 
It gets worse…
And Charlie Kirk has something to say about just how bad it’s getting within ActBlue (H/t 
 for the video.)
USAID: Was ActBlue just a money laundering operation to funnel USAID money to Democrats? Why did its small dollar donation evaporate as soon as USAID funding was cut off? Why did the top seven execs just resign?

COVID: State Wins Multi-BILLION Damages Judgment Against China — Here’s The 411,"Trump took a lot of heat for calling it the ‘Chinavirus’ but at least one federal judge sees China as culpable for damages — a LOT of them.
It could be decades before we finally figure out the extent of the ways America and the world were crippled by the Wuhan Wheezer. But one judge has affixed a particularly LARGE figure to the damages… and the State AG is not waiting around for them to pay up.
It began as a lawsuit taken up in 2020 by then-Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt. Cases like this one are not quick in resolving, especially when trying to moved them forward in the middle of a pandemic.
The judgement was not quick in coming, but come it has… with the federal judge ruling in Missouri’s favor. To the tune of $24 BILLION dollars.
The specific complaint concerned the well-documented case of China quietly buying up much of the global supply of Personal Protective Gear while keeping quiet about the true nature and extent of the illness that had already begun its spread from Wuhan China.
A federal judge on Friday ruled in favor of Missouri in the state’s $24 billion lawsuit against China’s Communist Party that accused it of hoarding protective supplies during the coronavirus pandemic.
“This is a landmark victory for Missouri and the United States in the fight to hold China accountable for unleashing COVID-19 on the world,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in a statement.
“China refused to show up to court, but that doesn’t mean they get away with causing untold suffering and economic devastation. We intend to collect every penny by seizing Chinese-owned assets, including Missouri farmland.”  — 
China may have blown off the lawsuit, and refused to attend the hearings. That does not allow them to ignore the ruling. Even if the disagree with the judge and refuse to pay, there are other options at Missouri’s disposal to get the restitution the court has ordered China to pay.
As mentioned in the response of the AG who put the suit in motion:
And of current AG, Andrew Bailey himself:
Missouri’s AG has been busy lately… looking into the relevance of Joe Biden’s mental state in orders and pardons that impact Missouri at the State level… asking DOGE to look into a $5 Billion green energy scam, and now this.
It’s almost as if he’s taking the pace Trump’s second administration is keeping as a personal challenge.",,2
WEF Puppet Trudeau Is Gone… Meet The WEF String-Puller Who Replaced Him,"You know that bait-and-switch game the DNC tried to play with coronating Kamala as Potus without asking Democrats if they accepted that idea? Canada just went through something kinda similar.
It’s a different system that plays by different rules.
Canadian voters have no direct say on which person becomes leader of the country. Like so many countries whose system mirrors that of the UK, each party picks their party leader, and whichever party has the most seats gets to run the country. The leader of the party is, by default, the leader of the country.
Most of the time, votes for a leadership change happen when a party is OUT of power. But Trudeau was on the ropes, and there was a real possibility that a non-confidence vote would have thrown his sorry ass and that of his government out ont its keister. Conservative (by Canadian standards, anyway) Pierre Poilievre was on track to lead the biggest electoral ass-kicking since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Justin Blackface Trudeau had to DO something.
Here’s an 
, riffing off the video of Carney being announced as new party leader:
For those who keep trying to tell me I don’t understand how this all works, allow me to help you understand what’s happened here: There was about to be a be vote of no-confidence in Parliament, which would have forced Trudeau’s resignation and an election, which Poilievre was guaranteed to win. Knowing this and to avoid this, Trudeau froze parliament for two and a half months so he and the party could gin up another “emergency,” which only the Liberals and their new chosen leader, Carney, who shares Trudeau and his team’s agenda, can fight. Trump is their invented enemy, who they are working very hard to paint as exactly like Poilievre. Isn’t that convenient? Anyway, many Canadians have fallen for this and now the Liberals are up in the polls thanks to their plan, fear-mongering, and propagandizing. The party was done, now they’re back, and the economy is about to get even more fucked that it already was because the Liberals care about power, not Canadians.
Carney has not held elected office. Period. And as of today, he will be sworn in as Prime Minister.
Ok, so libs gamed the system in more or less the same way their Democrat cousins wanted to in the installation of what’s her name with the coconut tree branding.
We know that Trudeau was a good little choirboy singing from the songsheet of every globalist initiative around. What do we know about the new guy?
Well, if Trudeau is best understood as a puppet of the WEF, Mark Carney has spent the last decade or so as one of the insider puppeteers.
Here’s a video of him embracing NetZero.
Whoops. That’s a series of photos of him with Jeffrey Epstein’s Co-Conspirator. THIS is the NetZero video.
Canada's new PM, Mark Carney: ""We can't stabilize climate until we get to ZERO NET emissions""
Good luck, Canadians

This guy is all in on the globalist vision.
Kat Kanada found a Jordan Peterson video that gave an absolutely SAVAGE contrast of Justin and his replacement.
Mark Carney is a WEF globalist, post-national state, lunatic Net Zero, and the designer of Canada’s rapid descent into poverty and irrelevance.
SOS 🚨🚨🚨
We are not OK.

"Loose Sex, Impure Acts & Greed","If Christ came and set an example of love and self-sacrifice, what does that mean for the rest of us who say we’re following his lead?
Shouldn’t at least SOME of Christ’s way of life rub off on us? Of course it should, if we’re doing the Christian thing right.
Of course, anything that requires commitment that involves saying yes to one thing will automatically require saying ‘no’ to something else. Join a gym and take it seriously, you won’t be cleaning out the dessert section at the buffet table. Take a job offer across the country, you won’t be living among the friends and neighbors you’re used to.`If you take a spouse, you’re leaving the dating game behind.
Faith is no different. If we’re walking the walk with Jesus, there will have to be some changes in how we live our lives. And since he went to the cross to save us from a sin nature baked so deeply into us that we can’t just shake it like a bad habit, some of those changes go right to the heart of who we are.
There’s good news about those changes. We’re not doing it in our own strength.",,1
Listen to This Before You Get Married!,"You know those ‘controversial texts’ about marriage that so many pastors are afraid to touch? Guess whose jumping into them with both feet?
Before you get too excited about a couple of buzzwords that feminists like to sharpen their knives over, you might want to check out what the list of expectations for everyone ELSE looks like.
It could be that the haters don’t really know what they’re talking about… on top of not having a sweet clue what the text REALLY says.
So, what does it REALLY say that these other clowns keep getting wrong? I guess you’re gonna have to press play and find out.
The PERFECT Gift For The Art Loving Warrior
Dear Fellow Warriors: My new book just dropped, 
. It’s a full color coffee table compilation of my biblical paintings over the last 20yrs. As you know, I don’t depict the biblical men in this book as sweet bearded women but rough troublemakers who shook all of hell’s habitations. It’s a great gift for the male and female scrappy warriors on your Christmas list. Young kids will love it too. 70+ original paintings. 234 pages with the scriptural inspiration behind each painting. It’s a beautiful book.
RECOMMENDATIONS. “One reason I buy Doug’s priceless art is to make bold statements on the walls of my home. Lively discussions come alive to bring home the Gospel messages behind the brushstrokes gifted to Mr. Giles. Pastor Doug’s creativity in canvassing the Biblical perspective is daring and courageous.”

MARK LEVIN: Chief Justice Called Out By NAME With SCATHING Rebuke On Live TV,"Mark Levin is best known for two things — his sharp tongue and his legal mind, especially as it relates to Constitutional Law and the history around it.
When yet ANOTHER lower-court judge tried to interfere in powers that are clearly defined as being within the four corners of the Executive Branch, and beyond the power of a petty potentate judge to decide — going so far as demanding that a plane already in the air and on its way to El Salvadore turn around to satisfy his injunction, Mark Levin had something to say about it.
He ought to, since the relevant precedent requiring a judge to write an order before it becomes binding was successfully argued by Mark Levin’s Landmark Legal in a dispute with the federal government some two decades ago.
Levin and Chief Justice Roberts know each other, and both worked in the Republican administrations in the 80s. Levin does not mince words when it comes to the squishy decisions Roberts makes and how he believes many of those decisions are aimed at pleasing the people who write newspapers and history books so that he will be remembered fondly by them as one of the ‘good’ guys, more than one of the tough-but-fair who was more interested in interpreting disputes by what laws, contracts, and the Constitution itself would indicate as implications of the plain reading of their texts.
Since the barrage of court battles has been unleashed against Trump pursuing his mandate has been unleashed, Roberts has been uniquely positioned as official head of the judicial branch, to tell judges what they ought to do in order to ‘stay in their lane’. 
He his NOT so specially qualified to speak to powers that fall under the elected branches of government, such as the checks and balances members of other branches are permitted to exercise within their official powers. Trump, for example, does not have the power to ‘impeach’ anyone. That’s a power reserved for Congress. But nothing prevents him from urging Congress to make use of their oversight powers, any more than he is prevented from lobbying for appointments to be taken, budgets to be passed, or treaties to be ratified.
Justice Roberts took umbrage at Trump’s call for the rogue and conflcited judge who ordered the plane to El Salvadore turned around (as Trump views him) to be reigned in with the legitimate powers Congress has for exactly such times as judges exceed their just powers. Instead of reigning in a judge, he scolded Trump.
This is where Mark Levin comes into the story, having been invited onto Martha McCallum’s show ever since the issue of low-level judges giving high-level restraining orders came onto the scene. This week, he was able to make the invite work, and he made it count:
🔥HOLY SMOKES: Mark Levin just ROASTED Chief Justice John Roberts:
""It's time to GROW A PAIR, JUDGE!""
""How the HELL are we going to have 680 individual unelected federal judges…all sitting there behind their desks…saying, you know, I don't like this idea!""
""This is EXACTLY… 
— Townhall.com (@townhallcom) 
 
After telling the justice to ‘grow a pair’, he blasted this great assault on the Separation of Powers that makes the Constitution something more than just a dead-letter document.
As he often says on his radio show, ‘There, I said it!’.
That he did.",,1
