as the presidential election continues to get closer and closer i write this article to give filipinos a good idea on what i think is genuinely wrong with the countrywhats somewhat disappointing among pinoys is that we tend to focus too much on individuals and their many wrongdoings rather than what actually pushes them to do what they do truth be told while i am no expert i think that it is no longer individual people that is causing the philippines to deteriorate but the kind of mindset our countrymen tend to possess as i see it the problem lies not in individual filipinos but the dysfunction that is inherent in our culture so no matter who we elect into a position of power as we retain the same counterproductive behavior nothing will ever really changeokay so before we begin let me first mention something from the bibleim sure that most of you are familiar with the story of adam and eve you know the first man and woman in the garden of eden where everything was said to be perfect and everyone was happy then the devil in the form of a snake tempted eve into eating the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil forever dooming the human race to sin god gave the ancestors of humanity a stern talking to telling them that he wouldve given them the fruit anyway and then booting them out of the garden of eden to fend for themselvesokay lets go back a bit to the point where the devil was tempting eve does anyone remember what the devil said to eve well he did say a lot of things but one of the things i remember best was this particular line if you eat the fruit you will become like godyes and there we have it the greatest temptation of all to become like god to gain all the power and knowledge that make god what he is this idea was somewhat explored in the film bruce almighty what with the protagonist gaining the powers of god but not fully understanding the responsibilities that come with being godso what does all this talk about god have to do with pinoy dysfunctionwell the thing is one should take a look at our various authority figures and you get some idea on what im actually talking about see while authority figures are necessary for a society to function well what ive come to notice is that authority figures in the philippines become very abusive of their powers now im not saying theyre all like this but ive encountered my share of cops who use their authority to bully people into doing what they want them to do politicians and government employees who like to extort money out of hapless citizens and there was even this one doctor in olongapo who beat up a student through his authority as a senior member of the ymca at a speech competition the list goes on and onso what is it about pinoy authority figures and why do they all too often like to victimize the people theyre supposed to serveselfentitlementthe thing about pinoy authority figures is they almost always demand peoples respect without first earning it ive seen cops whod rather use the firearms they carry to threaten and bully civilians rather than better protect the local populace from criminals whats worse is that they often work with various criminal organizations to begin with to better hoodwink people out of their prized possessions and destroy the peace in their livesthis all comes down to the simple thought of i deserve better and is not only inherent in authority figures but even some of the common people as well it all boils down to the feeling of being above the law rather than being subject to it which again plays with the concept of being a god even common citizens with guns often feel entitled enough to take other peoples lives simply because of a misguided belief that they deserve better treatment and have every right to do as they please with others because they have the power to end another personlack of respecthere is another infuriating aspect of the pinoy psyche the problem with a lot of pinoys is that they have so little respect for others and even for themselves sometimes they think that the idea of freedom and democracy simply amounts to them being able to do what they want to do regardless of the consequences involvedagain this plays with the idea of us wanting to be gods as many of us simply love the idea of doing things without fear of consequence or retribution notice how when some people are even caught doing something bad they will even insist that they werent doing anything wrong for instance when people are loudly playing videoke and their neighbors tell them to keep it down theyll probably just get angry and even call out their neighbors on ruining their funtaking shortcutsanother thing i cant help but notice is our obsession with shortcuts to success instead of taking the long way which is usually more rewarding and imparts a sense of greatness to a person after all finishing something the hard way can teach one more lessons and give one a better idea of what theyre fighting for rather than simply doing something the easy way note for instance that spending money you worked hard for is a lot more difficult than spending money you acquired easilyin pinoy society getting something the easy way is always preferable to getting things the hard way even if it means sacrificing ones principles or morality indeed many of us equate the idea of good to what is easy or simple and what is bad to what is hard or complex this despite the fact that the philippines is supposedly a christian country and one of the biggest highlights of the bible was the temptation of jesus wherein the devil offered him a shortcut to greatness but jesus instead chose to do what was hard but right and in the end became even greater than what the devil offered him to become,0.44531180981073376,0.8794322134118956,0.9630280689219292,0.6892111020221204,others

who knows the poor bettergovernment social workers or district representativesthe question arose during a highly charged debate at on thursdays budget hearing when social welfare secretary judy taguiwalo faced grilling about her new policy giving less premium on referral letters from politicians endorsing their poor constituents for assistancebut taguiwalo giving tit for tat stood her ground as members of the house of representatives badgered her with questions over who was in a better position to identify and assist the poorshe said she only wished to end politicians sense of entitlement in drawing department of social welfare and development dswd funds for the poor implying that the lawmakers might be thinking they still enjoyed discretionary pork barrel fundshouse majority leader rodolfo farias set the ball rolling when he asked taguiwalo whether she really said politicians should use their own money to give to their own constituents and not public fundsi never said that the former university of the philippines activist professor said explaining she was quoted on her newly issued memorandum circular no  putting safeguards on the dswds processing of politicians referral lettersnot bindingthe circular states that while referral letters from any individual including government officials may be considered they are not binding on social workers or personnel tasked with evaluating the qualifications of beneficiariesfarias reminded taguiwalo that public funds belonged to the people as its their moneyfollowing on that point negros oriental rep arnulfo teves asked taguiwalo who knows the poor more the social workers or us congressmento which an incredulous taguiwalo replied with a laugh who knows the poor more the dswd or lawmakers thats a hard question you are dichotomizingteves however kept up the questioning if social workers are more familiar with the people on the ground then why are there so many mistakes on the list of beneficiaries for ps the governments conditional cash transfer program or cctthe ps program has  million household beneficiaries as of july  according to taguiwalounder the program two types of cash grants are given out to beneficiaries a health grant of p per household every month or a total of p every year and an education grant of p per child every month for  months or a total of p every yearthe families may continue receiving the grants provided they meet certain requirements such as a minimum attendance of  percent in class or getting their children vaccinated and weighed regularlya family may register a maximum of three children for the program which means a household with three children may receive p every month or a total of p every year for five years from the two types of cash grantsrice subsidypresident duterte has instructed the dswd to include a monthly rice subsidy of kilogram bags to ps beneficiariesthe dswd has a proposed budget of p billion for  an increase of almost p billion from the current year appropriation of p billionteves further raised complaints from his constituents about dswd social workers releasing less money to beneficiaries than they signed forbut taguiwalo refused to be drawn into the argument saying it depended on each social workers level of involvementwe have guidelines to follow of course we dont have percent batting average there are some fake documents that reach us thats why we now require government ids she said i dont think its a question of who knows more we have to help each otherno entitlementsshe added the dswd is willing to help legislators but there should not be entitlement like we have p million for you or you have p millionshe said her department wanted to make sure that the old system of the discontinued priority development assistance fund pdaf or pork barrel is no longer in placetaguiwalo also said her department did not tolerate any irregularities on the part of the social workers we investigate we file cases we dont tolerate any corruption thats a clear directive from president dutertebut teves insisted that lawmakers were in a better position to identify the poorest residents than the dswd social workers there should be more check and balance if theres referral from congressmen its because we know who needs help more he saidteves also rebuked taguiwalo for speaking about how social workers involvement differed youre talking of levels but were talking of the same constituencyhe even challenged the cabinet member to a wager i can wager we could go to our barangay where i was a barangay captain for six years and i would be able to identify more of the poor than your social workersto which taguiwalo replied thats ok but its about the work we dothe implementation is still with us based on the coa commission on audit memo we have no argument regarding who knows the poor betterthen she said pointedly the question is about what work we should do the question here is whether you have money with us or notthe last statement drew spontaneous applause from the gallery where many of the people were dswd officialsbut teves tried to put in the last word one last thing the money you have is not yours its the peoplesthe debate was cut short after the appropriations committee chair davao city rep karlo nograles called a suspensionwhen the session resumed davao oriental rep joel mayo almario made a manifestation objecting to taguiwalos mention of pdaf noting that the current budget proposal did not include the word at allsecond the cousin of pdaf the word entitlement were not talking here of entitlement our roles here are as responsible citizens if somebody asks for help we will refer them to the dswd we dont even have to be elected officials he saidcaloocan rep edgar erice also took exception to taguiwalos remarks we are not claiming we have money in dswd we only say that as representatives we make sure theres proportional allocationin

new research has found that brown rice has a higher concentration of arsenic than white rice in the usaffirming decades of similar findings around the toxic metals presence in the otherwise healthy grain for years experts have sounded alarm bells over arsenic levels in brown rice a  study found it was highest in rice grown in certain southern us states while a  consumer reports analysis of the us food and drug administration fda data found worrisome levels of arsenic in both white and brown ricewith a greater concentration in brown because the toxin tends to reside in its two outer layers the bran and the germ that are removed from white rice but while the new study from michigan state university msu and published in the journal risk analysis earlier this year further affirmed brown rices higher arsenic concentration experts point out that arsenic exposure can come from either type of rice arsenic is a known carcinogenic element that naturally occurs in soil and groundwater but it can also be the result of industrial activities including coal mining farming due to some pesticides and construction due to some paint and wood preservatives according to ohio state university because rice is grown in paddies flooded with water any arsenic present in soil can be readily absorbed into the riceat levels  times higher than other grains which are grown differently and this is the case regardless of whether or not rice is organic according to environmental working group senior scientist tasha stoiber arsenic contamination in rice worldwide was discovered over two decades ago stoiber tells fortune in an email and its not just the rice itself arsenic levels are consistently elevated in rice and foods made with rice flour bran and ricebased sweeteners she says the us and other countries have been slow to take action to reduce arsenic concentrationsalso found in drinking water and in foods and beverages including seafood mushrooms poultry infant formula protein powders and apple juicestoiber explains the fda set a nonbinding action level of  parts per billion for arsenic in apple juice the same as drinking water she says but the fda has not set legally enforceable maximum levels of arsenic for many ricebased foods that have higher concentrations of arsenic rice does not inherently need to be flooded to grow though farmers do so to control weeds and because constant irrigation is required for the semiaquatic plant and growing it in dry instead of saturated soil could decrease the amount of arsenic that seeps into the grains stoiber and others say could be a way to reduce arsenic levels new varieties of rice could be bred to take up less arsenic from the soil and water as well she adds the msu researchers emphasized that for the average person eating brown rice would likely not bring dangerously toxic levels of arsenic while we found that choosing brown rice over white rice would result in higher arsenic exposure on average the levels should not cause longterm health problems unless someone ate an enormous amount of brown rice every day for years said senior investigator of the study felicia wu professor at msus college of agriculture and natural resources however researchers did find that there was significant risk for children under  in the us who eat brown rice as they consume more food relative to their body weight than adults longterm exposure to arsenic can cause pigmentation changes and lesions on the skin which can be precursors to skin cancer according to the world health organization who bladder and lung cancers may also result from longterm arsenic exposure the international agency for research on cancer iarc has classified arsenic arsenic compounds and arsenic in drinking water as carcinogenic to humans the who points out other potential adverse health effects that may be associated with longterm ingestion of arsenic including developmental effects diabetes pulmonary disease cardiovascular disease and arsenicinduced heart attacks arsenic is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality exposure in early childhood has been linked to higher mortality in young adults from multiple cancers lung disease heart attacks and kidney failure while several studies have found negative impacts of arsenic exposure on cognitive development iq and memory,0.6847514550741137,0.9621198229382705,0.9017163354722364,0.44316641154854686,health

how many times have we heard the phrase reproductive health care kicked around by the left if this really was about womens health and not about profiting off of the fears of pregnant women shouldnt the people who even want your barber to be credentialed insist that only the most highlytrained medical professionals be permitted to perform such a delicate procedure after all nobody wants a repeat of the abortion slaughterhouse kermit gosnell set up that was every bit as unsanitary and dangerous to pregnant women as the apocryphal back alley coathanger abortions that led to the roe decision in the first place and yet planned parenthood just won a case in alaska where they sued for the right for nondoctors to perform abortions why is this a dangerous precedent because theres a lot that can go wrong in any invasive medical procedure and that risk only goes higher when you have someone with inferior medical training under this ruling nonphysicians can now commit chemical abortions as well as surgical aspiration abortions both most commonly used in the first trimester despite the claim that this is a necessary ruling for women it actually puts them at increased risk a  study from the ryan residency abortion training program at the university of california san francisco abortions committed by nonphysicians are more likely to end in complications than those committed by physicians with aspiration abortions the most common complication was incomplete abortions meaning parts of the preborn baby were left inside the mothers body this can lead to lifethreatening infection and death the abortion pill likewise has been found to be four times more dangerous than first trimester surgical abortions and increases in its rate of incomplete abortions as gestation progresses  lifesite so planned parenthood fought a court case that actually made life more dangerous for their clients in an election that has so much to say about the rights of women this seems like it could be a relevant issue doesnt it,0.44186778701242874,0.9013485355427042,0.9624217109596377,0.6844019056318451,others
it all started as a simple thread in a wellknown spanish forum called forocoches where someone posted the following question if i eat snot will my children have green eyes the post went viral around the world generating discussion thats why researchers at harvard university in boston massachusetts decided to study the effect  expecting to find no correlation their findings turned out to be extremely surprising they concluded that swallowing snot increases  the chances of green eyes for the baby believe it or not we already knew about some benefits of eating your own boogers said dr sam not who headed up the research it actually has health benefits including boosting your immune system what we didnt know was that it directly correlated to eye color in the fetus of a pregnant woman our findings were astounding unfortunately the news broke quite quickly and has since become viral on social media with doctors advocating for snot eating many motherstobe are asking the really tough questions such as does snot contain gluten and if im a vegan can i eat my snot sorry to say that medical science has not quite caught up to those questions yet said dr not,0.693068245025929,0.8930869654792469,0.9624179079031934,0.44454121896279325,others

katrina campins gave an excellent explanation of trump s position on immigration and the press  as an american i feel frustrated because people are losing sight of what donald trump is trying to say what he s saying is people should come to this country legally and i know about that process very well because my husband is going through it right now and it s extremely expensive so there s more incentive for people to come over to this country illegally so all he s saying is let s make the process to come here easier and less expensive so there s more incentive to do that when people cross the border who are not supposed to be here let s make sure they are sent back but what the media is doing is twisting and turning everything that he s saying and what s so frustrating as an american is that the point is not getting across we re so worried about his fights with megyn kelly and jorge ramos now let s talk about the real issues i don t think it s his fault i think it s the fact that everything he says gets misconstrued like this immigration thing  i m a hispanic woman and i m not offended for what he s saying i understood exactly what he is saying no and i don t agree that i m in the minority because the last time i was on cnn speaking about this as a hispanic woman so many hispanic women tweeted me and said  thank you for speaking for the real hispanic woman,0.6903335814860078,0.4491271905106888,0.9625613376033735,0.8863651301628159,others
