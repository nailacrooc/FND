FACT FOCUS: Trump claims the US subsidizes Canada. Experts say the numbers dont add up,"Newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited the White House on Tuesday in search of common ground during an ongoing trade war that has shattered decades of trust between the his country and the U.S. Although the conversation was civil, President Donald Trump repeated erroneous rhetoric about how the U.S. provides Canada with billions of dollars in subsidies. Its hard to justify subsidizing Canada to the tune of maybe $200 billion a year, he said. We protect Canada militarily, and we always will. We not going to, you know, thats not a money thing. But we always will. But, you know, its not fair. But why are we subsidizing Canada $200 billion a year or whatever the number might be? Its a very substantial number. Heres a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: The U.S. subsidizes Canada with subsidies of about $200 billion per year. THE FACTS: This is false. According to the White House, the number is based on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and higher military spending by the U.S., including expenditures associated with the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD. An exact total is difficult to discern because there is no publicly available data on NORAD spending. But even the most generous estimates do not put the total costs anywhere close to what Trump claims.  A trade deficit occurs when the cost of a countrys imports are higher than its exports. Using seasonally adjusted data, the U.S. deficit with Canada for both goods and services was $35.661 billion in 2024. It was higher for just goods, ranging from $63.336 billion to $70.603 billion. 
        
     The White House put the goods and services deficit with Canada at $53.5 billion. This is closer to the figure from 2022  $57.565 billion. Either way, economists agree that describing a trade deficit as a subsidy is wrong. Thats never been the definition of a subsidy, a subsidy is defined as a gift without any compensation in return, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. So whatever the number is, the concept is way off base. Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institutions Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, said a trade deficit occurs based on relative demand in different countries and what they specialize in. In terms of military spending, the White House also pointed to how much the U.S. and Canada spend on their militaries and what percentage of their gross domestic product that is. This appears to be a reference to NATOs investment guideline. Member countries agreed in 2006 to commit to spending a minimum 2% of their GDP on their own defense. Some countries, including Canada, have not yet met that guideline, a lapse which Trump often criticizes. Canada spent $29.3 billion on defense in 2024, which amounted to 1.3% of its GDP. The U.S., which is 13 times bigger than Canada, spent significantly more at $997 billion, or 3.4% of its GDP, exceeding the NATO guideline. Those numbers were slightly lower in 2023  the data cited by the White House  at $27.2 billion and $916 billion respectively, though the percentages of GDP for both were the same. According to the International Monetary Fund, Canadas GDP in 2024 was about $2.241 trillion. This means that the country would have needed to spend $44.82 billion total on defense order to meet the 2% NATO guideline, making it short by approximately $15.52 billion. No, they dont owe us that money, but they arent paying their fair share, and thats a fair criticism. said Mark Cancian, a senior advisor in the Center for Strategic and International Studies defense and security department. Discounting whether they should be deemed subsidies, adding the trade deficit for goods and services in 2024 to Canadas gap in defense spending the same year results in a total of only about $51 billion. Using the highest calculation of the goods deficit only for 2024 pushes the total up, to approximately $86 billion. The White Houses final point was that the U.S. covers about 60 percent of the bill for NORAD. Created in 1954 as a means of defense against possible long-range attacks from the Soviets, NORAD is a bi-national organization jointly run by the U.S. and Canada that is charged with preventing air and maritime attacks against North America. There is no publicly available data on NORAD spending by the U.S. or Canada. The 60% figure cited by the White House refers to a 1985 cost-sharing agreement for the operations and support of NORADs North Warning System that is still in place today. In 2022, then-Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand announced a $4.9 billion (US $3.52 billion) investment in NORAD over six years and $38.6 billion (US $27.72 billion) over 20 years on an accrual basis. Defense economists Binyam Solomon and Ross Fetterly quantified NORAD burden sharing by the U.S. and Canada in a paper first published in 2023 by the journal Defense and Peace Economics titled, Canada and NORAD: Economics and Burden Sharing. The pair found that the numbers change drastically depending on how they are calculated. One estimate found that the U.S. shoulders about 97.6% of the North American defense burden while receiving about 64% of the benefits. Canada, meanwhile, contributes about 2% of the burden while enjoying about 36% of the benefits. But leaving out the variable of Canadas vast exposed border means that the U.S. shoulders the same burden while enjoying 91% of the benefits. In this instance, Canada enjoys just 9% of the benefits. A sizable portion of NORAD warning and control systems are in Canadian territory, according to the paper. Cancian explained that the U.S. needs Canadas help to effectively defend North America from its own land because if air defenses started at the U.S. border, it would be too late to prevent many threats. Even if the Canadians pulled out, wed have to have something like that in place, he said of NORAD. So I would not consider that a subsidy at all. Canadians can make a fair argument that we owe them. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-us-canada-trade-deficit-military-norad-spending-1417673f38f1829334a4e571ea058e03,business
Melinda French Gates reflects on legacy of Gates Foundation as it announces it will close in 2045,"Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates. She petitioned heads of state and convened other billionaires. Along with Gates, she won the trust of one of Americas most admired investors, Warren Buffett, who has given more than $43 billion to the former couples foundation.  French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure.  At an ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, which also launched her new memoir, French Gates said she left, in part, to respond to the U.S. rollback of womens rights. I thought, I want to be much more nimble than this, and I want to be able to set the agenda by myself without having to ask anybody else, and do it with my partners, she said. French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press questions about the foundations 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 2045. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources. Ultimately, though, she wrote, the timeline was Bills decision to make with the board of trustees. The following responses have been edited for length. 
        
     A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundations work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account  and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.  A: I was excited for us to launch the Giving Pledge because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away  and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think its important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.  (As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary  if they were considered at all. Data wasnt collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.  There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women dont have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?  We opened a gender equality division, but not just that  we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.  A: When youre doing this kind of work, it doesnt take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people  especially women wouldnt use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didnt fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women  who account for half of all smallholder farmers  wouldnt buy it, because they didnt want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.  There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible  and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you. A: Its easy for people to forget  or maybe they didnt ever know  how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.  No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.  ____ The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and in statehouses from Melinda French Gates organization, Pivotal Ventures.  ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

US applications for jobless benefits fall last week despite elevated uncertainty over Trump tariffs,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trumps tariffs will impact the U.S. and global economies. Jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 to 228,000 for the week ending May 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. Thats in line with the 229,000 new applications analysts forecast. Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 decimated the economy and wiped out millions of jobs. Even though Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.  On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year. Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central banks dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.  Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.  There have been trade developments this week, with the U.S. and Britain expected to announce the framework for trade deal later Thursday. 
        
     No new deals have been reached with Americas largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Trump has left the highest tariffs in place on China, heightening tensions between the worlds two largest economies. Washington and Beijing are sending officials to Switzerland this weekend for an initial round of trade talks. Trump is attempting to reshape the global economy by dramatically increasing import taxes to rejuvenate the U.S. manufacturing sector. A contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trumps trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trumps massive tariffs went into effect. It was the first quarterly GDP decline in three years.  Like his pledge to institute tariffs, Trumps promise to drastically downsize the federal government workforce has occupied much of the early weeks of his presidency and is still in motion. Its not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency  or DOGE, spearheaded by Elon Musk  will surface in the weekly layoffs data. However, the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area. Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. Last week the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%, however, many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.  Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta. The Labor Department reported that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week gyrations, inched up by 1,000 to 227,000. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of April 26 fell to 1.88 million, a decrease of 29,000.",https://apnews.com/article/unemployment-benefits-jobless-claims-layoffs-labor-a95f2ba4f016b63a1c191ff080f29cf1,business
India and Pakistan dont fight wars like other countries. Heres why,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)  India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars since they gained independence from British India in 1947. Theyve also had dozens of skirmishes and conflicts, including one atop a glacier dubbed the coldest and highest-altitude battlefield in the world. The latest escalation follows a deadly gun attack on tourists that India blames Pakistan for  Islamabad denies any connection. But they dont fight wars like other countries. The dominant factor is their nuclear weapons arsenal, a distinct way of deterring major attacks and a guarantee that fighting doesnt get out of hand, even when the situation is spiraling. Heres how  and why  Pakistan fight the way they do: Pakistan and India have enough nuclear weapons to wipe the other side out several times over, says security analyst Syed Mohammed Ali, who is based in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. Their nuclear weapons create a scenario for mutually assured destruction. Both countries have deliberately developed the size and range of their stockpile to remind the other about the guarantee of mutually assured destruction, he adds. Neither country discloses their nuclear capabilities but each is thought to have between 170 and 180 warheads that are short-, long- and medium-range. Both countries have different delivery systems  ways of launching and propelling these weapons to their targets. The arsenals are a defensive move to prevent and deter further fighting, because neither side can afford to initiate such a war or hope to achieve anything from it, Ali says.

Youszai) Police officers stand guard at an entry point to Pindi Cricket Stadium following the crash of a suspected Indian drone in the parking area, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Thursday, May 8, 2025. (AP Photo/W.K. Youszai) It might not look this way to the outsider, but nuclear weapons are a reminder to the other side that they cant take things too far. But the secrecy around their arsenals means that its unclear if Pakistan or India can survive a first nuclear strike and retaliate, something called second-strike capability. This capacity stops an opponent from attempting to win a nuclear war through a first strike by preventing aggression that could lead to nuclear escalation.  Without this capability, there is, in theory, nothing to stop one side from launching a warhead at the other. India and Pakistan have each laid claim to Kashmir since 1947, when both gained independence, and border skirmishes have created instability in the region for decades. Each country controls a part of Kashmir, which is divided by a heavily militarized border. The two archrivals have also fought three wars over Kashmir, where armed insurgents resist Indian rule. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani governance or as an independent country.  Indian soldiers guard at a market in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan) Indian soldiers guard at a market in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan) Border flare-ups and militant attacks in India-controlled Kashmir have prompted New Delhi to take an increasingly tough position on Islamabad, accusing it of terrorism. In the latest conflict, India punished Pakistan by hitting what it said were sites used by Pakistan-backed militants linked to a gun massacre last month. India is one of the biggest defence spenders in the world, with $74.4 billion in 2025, according to the Military Balance report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Its also one of the worlds largest arms importers.  Pakistan is no slouch, spending $10 billion last year, but it can never match Indias deep pockets. India also has more than double the number of active armed forces personnel than Pakistan does.  While Indias armed forces are traditionally focused on Pakistan, it has another nuclear neighbor to contend with, China, and it is increasingly concerned with maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Those are two factors that Pakistan doesnt have to consider in its security paradigm.  Pakistans long and narrow shape, together with the outsized role of the military in foreign policy, makes it easier to move the armed forces around and prioritize defense. Neither Pakistan or India are in a hurry to announce their military moves against the other and, as seen in the current flare-up of hostilities, it can take a while for confirmation of strikes and retaliation to surface. But both launch operations into territories and airspace controlled by the other. Sometimes these are intended to damage checkpoints, installations, or sites allegedly used by militants.  They are also aimed at embarrassing or provoking  forcing leaders to bow to public pressure and respond, with the potential for miscalculation. Many of these activities originate along the Line of Control, which divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Its largely inaccessible to the media and public, making it hard to independently verify claims of an attack or retaliation. Such incidents raise international alarm, because both countries have nuclear capabilities, forcing attention back to India and Pakistan and, eventually, their competing claims over Kashmir.  The fear of nuclear war has put the two countries at the top of the agenda, competing with the papal conclave, U.S. President Donald Trumps policies, and the Sean Diddy Combs trial in the news cycle.

Chaudary) Pakistan and Indias battles and skirmishes are away from the public eye.  Strikes and retaliation are late at night or early in the morning and, with the exception of the drone attacks on Thursday, they mostly take place away from densely populated urban centers. It shows that neither country has the desire to significantly harm the others population. Attacks are either described as surgical or limited. Neither country is motivated by competition for resources. Pakistan has huge mineral wealth, but India isnt interested in these and, while there are stark ideological differences between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, they dont seek control or influence over the other.  Other than Kashmir, they have no interest in claiming the others territory or exercising dominance.",https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-india-military-explainer-0708bbf29ea81126aeae0d141f5a4026,business
The EU publishes a US product hit list and prepares for WTO action against Trumps tariffs,"BRUSSELS (AP)  The European Union published on Thursday a list of U.S. imports that it would target with retaliatory duties if no solution is found to end U.S. President Donald Trumps tariff war, which could include aircraft maker Boeing. The EUs executive branch, the European Commission, said it also would begin legal action at the World Trade Organization over the reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on countries around the world last month. The EU remains fully committed to finding negotiated outcomes with the U.S., commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. At the same time, we continue preparing for all possibilities. The commission manages trade deals and disputes on behalf of the 27 EU countries. In early April, Trump put a 20% levy on goods from the EU as part of his tariff onslaught against global trading partners. A week later, he paused them for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate solutions to U.S. trade concerns. A blanket 10% tariff still applies to EU imports. The commission drew up countermeasures to target 20.9 billion euros ($23.6 billion) of U.S. goods, roughly the equivalent of what Trump would be hitting in Europe. But it also put them on hold for 90 days to give negotiations a chance. The blocs top trade official has shuttled between Brussels and Washington trying to find a solution, but with little to show, the commission has made public a list of American imports for possible targeting worth 95 billion euros ($107 billion). 
        
     The list is broken down into sectors and broad categories of products rather than brand names. It contains 10.5 billion euros ($11.9 billion) worth of aircraft, 10.3 billion euros ($11.6 billion) in vehicle parts and 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in vehicles. European airlines are big Boeing customers: German airline Lufthansa has unfilled orders for 101 Boeing planes, and Irish airline Ryanair 184, for example. The American aerospace giant and Airbus, its European rival, dominate the global markets for commercial and military planes.  Boeing did not comment on the European Commissions announcement Thursday. CEO Kelly Ortberg told a U.S. Senate committee last month that 80% of Boeings commercial passenger planes go to airlines and other companies outside the U.S.  So its important that we continue to have access to that market and that we dont get in a situation where certain markets become closed to us, Ortberg said. Under the EUs proposed list, around 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in imports of U.S. wine, beer and spirits also could take a hit. European wine producershave been deeply concerned that Trumps tariffs would deal a severe blow to their sector, which relies on the U.S. as its top market. The commission gave interested companies and parties until June 10 to provide feedback, before it decides on the next steps. Boeing is very welcome to make comments on this list, a commission official said, briefing reporters on the list and the rationale for the EUs approach. Also Thursday, the commission approved 5 billion euros in insurance aid for French wine and spirits exports to the U.S. through July 8, after which the sweeping tariffs announced by Trump are scheduled to go into effect. The plan is mean to help protect French exporters from political risks during the next two months.  In parallel, the commission said that it would be taking legal action at world trades governing body, and would soon request consultations with the United States to try to resolve the issue, which must take place within two months. It said that this action would focus on Trumps universal reciprocal tariffs, and duties on cars and car parts. It is the unequivocal view of the EU that these tariffs blatantly violate fundamental WTO rules, a statement said. The commission estimates that 379 billion euros ($428 billion) of EU exports to the U.S. have been hit by new tariffs, including those on pause until mid-July, since Trump took office. It said they are already raising costs for business, stifling growth, fueling inflation and heightening economic uncertainty.",https://apnews.com/article/europe-trump-tariffs-wto-list-products-7ecab3aad84cb108c96cc6b242fcedc8,business
The construction of a road in Brazil draws criticism before first-ever climate talks in the Amazon,"BELEM, Brazil (AP)  In the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference, set to take place in Brazils Amazon in November, the construction of a road is drawing attention, with critics arguing it will lead to environmental degradation. Before the talks, called COP30, the state government of Para is building a 13-kilometer (8-mile) avenue designed to ease traffic on a major highway that runs parallel. The road was planned long before Belem, a metropolitan area of 2.5 million people that sits on the edge of the Amazon, was chosen as conference host. That hasnt spared it sharp criticism, however, because the road is expected to cut across the last remnants of rainforest in Belem.  Road building in the Amazon, which historically has often led to deforestation and development of surrounding areas, also stands in stark contrast to a central aim of climate conferences, and in particular this one: conservation of biodiversity.  Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who has made the slowing of deforestation a central focus of his administration, has frequently boasted that this will be the first such conference in the Amazon rainforest. People look out at the coast of Belem, Brazil, as a boat nears shore, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Jorge Saenz, File) People look out at the coast of Belem, Brazil, as a boat nears shore, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Jorge Saenz, File) The Amazon is key to regulating the climate, because trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that heats the planet when released into the atmosphere.  We will hold the best COP in history because the topic of all the ones held in other countries was the Amazon, Lula said while visiting Belem worksites in February. This one will be in the Amazon. 
        
     An official project map shows a straight line dividing a green area through the citys outskirts. This protected area is slightly larger than Manhattan. It was designated in 1993 to protect two lakes, a river basin and to restore a degraded rainforest. However, its rules allow private properties, government-approved deforestation and public works. Two university campuses are located within its limits. Even with measures to reduce the damage, there are tough issues to address, said Roberta Rodrigues, a professor of architecture at the Federal University of Para. Its hard to imagine a road being built along the banks of the Guama River without it leading to illegal development. It may lead to the end of this protected area. The project dates back to 2020. Construction began in mid-2024, despite criticism over its impact on one of the citys few remaining green areas. The project drew wider attention in March, when the BBC reported that the avenue was being built for COP30. As the story was picked up by news outlets around the world, Brazils government issued a statement saying the avenue wasnt among the 33 infrastructure projects planned for COP30.  In a statement to The Associated Press, the state government of Para said that the avenue, named Liberdade, or Freedom, will be an expressway and development around it wont be permitted.

(AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) The chaotic growth of Brazilian cities, however, suggests its a promise that will be hard to keep. Countless public areas have been occupied for the irregular construction of housing  from modest structures to luxury condos  with the expectation that they will eventually be legalized, which often ends up happening. Belem is the capital of Para, which is run by Gov. Helder Barbalho, a politician from a traditional family who is an ally of Lula. Both support oil drilling in the nearby mouth of the Amazon River, likely a point of contention during COP30. The road is scheduled to be inaugurated just before the conference kicking off on Nov. 10.  ___ The Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Turkey and Iraq reaffirm commitment to work against Kurdish militants and other security threats,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP)  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening security cooperation on Thursday, vowing to work against threats, including Kurdish militants based on Iraqi territory. Al-Sudani arrived in Turkey as the neighboring countries are working to enhance cooperation and mend past tensions.  Relations between Turkey and Iraq were often strained over Turkish military incursions into northern Iraq for operations against the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, and the establishment of Turkish military bases there. Baghdad frequently condemned the incursions as a violation of its sovereignty, while Ankara accused Iraq of not doing enough to fight the PKK.  More recently, however, the two countries have deepened cooperation on security, including addressing the PKK presence in northern Iraq. Last year, Iraq announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization. Erdogan said the two reaffirmed our determination to fight against the Kurdish militants, the Islamic State group and against members of network that Turkey accuses of being behind a failed military coup in 2016.  We once again emphasized that terrorism has no place in the future of our region, Erdogan said.  
        
     Al-Sudani said: What affects Iraqs security affects Turkeys security and vice versa. According to our constitution, we do not allow any group to use Iraqi territory to attack neighboring countries, he said. On Thursday, officials inked 11 agreements, including in trade and defense, to advance cooperation between the two countries.  Erdogan stressed the urgency of resuming oil shipments through an Iraqi-Turkish pipeline. The oil pipeline running from the semi-autonomous Kurdish region to Turkey has been shut down since March 2023, after an arbitration court ruling ordered Ankara to pay Iraq $1.5 billion for oil exports that bypassed Iraqs central government in Baghdad. The sharing of oil and gas revenues has long been a contentious issue between Baghdad and Kurdish authorities in Irbil. Al-Sudani said water supplies to Iraq were also discussed. He said committees were continuing meetings to agree on mechanisms for water management projects.  We emphasized the need for a fair understanding that respects the interests of both sides, in accordance with principles of equity and good neighborliness, the Iraqi prime minister said. In recent years, Iraqi officials have complained that dams built by Turkey are reducing Iraqs water supply. The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which provide most of Iraqs fresh water, originate in Turkey. Experts fear that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing water shortages in Iraq. Our position is that water levels in the dams are at a minimum, and at the same time, Iraq has received very little rainfall this year, al-Sudani said.  The two also discussed steps to rapidly implement The Development Road Project - a large-scale infrastructure plan to connect the Persian Gulf with Turkey by constructing highways and rail links from southern Iraq to the Turkish border. The Iraqi prime ministers visit comes after the PKKs jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, called on his group to dissolve and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey. The group declared a unilateral ceasefire in March and is now expected to hold a congress in northern Iraq, during which it would announce its dissolution, Turkish officials have said.

Scrappy opera company Heartbeat thrives by reimagining the classics,"NEW YORK (AP)  Dan Schlosberg remembers the day 11 years ago when his upstart opera company put on its first performance  in a yoga studio before an audience of 30 people. We did Kurt Weills The Seven Deadly Sins accompanied by an upright piano that we got for free on Craigslist and a violin, recalled Schlosberg, the companys music director and one of its founders. They named their company Heartbeat Opera, from the idea that singers would be feet away from you, Schlosberg said. And so you would be experiencing their voices at arms length and that would make a resonance in your heart. Today, in an era when many opera companies are struggling financially, Heartbeat appears to be thriving, with an annual budget that just passed $1 million. But true to its initial vision, the company still performs in small venues, most with a seating capacity of about 200. Very few small companies take up the ambition to do the fullness of opera on a small scale, said Jacob Ashworth, another founding member and Heartbeats artistic director. We dont do small opera. We do big opera in a small space. And despite its success with critics and audiences  performances regularly sell out  the company has deliberately maintained a modest schedule. Theres typically an opera-themed drag show around Halloween and then two operas staged in New York City performance spaces in the winter and spring. Each work is condensed to 90-100 intermission-less minutes with new orchestrations that require just a few musicians. 
        
     Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, thinks Heartbeat is smart not to expand too quickly  a mistake that has caused some small companies to collapse. Growth itself shouldnt be a goal. Excellence should be a goal, he said. I always prefer companies to plan their trajectory as slow as possible so they dont overstretch and overstep. Unlike some small companies, Heartbeat doesnt focus on new work or on bringing to light neglected old rarities. Instead, its website promises incisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now. Its that reimagining that attracted Sara Holdren, a director, writer and teacher who first worked with the company on Bizets Carmen in 2017. Their approaches to the storytelling feel extremely of our world and about our world, she said, without falling across that line into a sort of trite topicality where you say, Oh yes, I understand a relevant-with-a-capital-R political point is being made here. For Beethovens Fidelio, Heartbeat went to prisons and recorded the voices of incarcerated people, who appeared on video singing the Prisoners Chorus. For Tchaikovskys Eugene Onegin, the two main male characters became lovers, reflecting the composers own sexuality. And for Richard Strauss Salome this season, the teenage title character was dressed in a frilly pink skirt and sneakers; John the Baptist was imprisoned on stage in a cage with transparent sides instead of in an underground cistern; and during the Dance of the Seven Veils, it was a lascivious Herod who stripped off his clothes, not Salome. Heartbeats casting for Salome reflected the premium it places on theatrical values in addition to vocal ability. Baritone Nathaniel Sullivan, who portrayed John the Baptist, recalled that a big part of the audition was just straight acting. And in the rehearsals, there was a real focus on the storytelling. I havent experienced that in a lot of other opera companies to that extent, he said. Soprano Summer Hassan, who was cast as Salome, admits she was nervous at first because I had never done a role like this where I am the title character. I was really doubting myself, thinking how do I make this girl look so young? she said. And they said, your physicality will do that on your own. Make her look confident and you will make her look like a confident child. They gave me the tools to figure out it was within me. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this Salome was the re-orchestration by Schlosberg. Instead of more than 100 players as called for in the original, he took a cue from the opening notes on a clarinet and scored the piece for eight clarinetists (who also played other instruments) and two percussionists. Heartbeats final local offering of the season will be Gounods Faust, to run at the Baruch Performing Arts Center from May 13-25. I had mentioned to Jacob that I really love devil stories, said Holdren, who is directing the production. And I was fascinated with the idea of taking something so big and so weighed down with history and assumptions and seeing how much we could crack it open and blow the dust off. She sees Mephistopheles less as a mustache-twirling villain and more as a figure of hunger and loneliness slipping into the vacuums that human beings create when they are so desperate or disgusted with life that theres an opening for him. Her production will be set in contemporary times, sung in French but with new English-language dialogue, and it will make heavy use of shadow puppetry. Its the first Heartbeat offering for which Schlosberg has not done the re-orchestration. That task fell to Francisco Ladrn de Guevara, a Mexican violinist and composer who has scored the opera for seven musicians, most of whom play two instruments, including Ashworth, who will play violin and mandolin and also conduct. Schlosberg will be back doing the arranging for a rare Heartbeat foray outside the city this summer. The company has been invited to stage a revised version of Samuel Barbers Vanessa at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts. Im really excited by what theyve been doing, particularly in reimagining the classics for contemporary times, said Raphael Picciarelli, co-managing director of the festival. For Heartbeats debut in Williamstown, the festival is setting up a new performance space that should make the company feel right at home. Its in an abandoned grocery store, and there will be seats for just over 200 people.",https://apnews.com/article/opera-heartbeat-small-performances-26194cba45dec032050456301c13c73b,business
Trumps tariffs have launched global trade wars. Heres a timeline of how we got here,"NEW YORK (AP)   Long-threatened tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into trade wars abroad  all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty. Trump is no stranger to tariffs. He launched a trade war during his first term, taking particular aim at China by putting taxes on most of its goods. Beijing responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. products. Meanwhile, Trump also used the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020. When President Joe Biden took office, he preserved most of the tariffs Trump previously enacted against China, in addition to imposing some new restrictions. But his administration claimed to take a more targeted approach. Fast-forward to today, and economists stress there could be greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide under Trumps more sweeping tariffs this time around  and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill. Theres also been a sense of whiplash from Trumps back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation seen over the last few months. Heres a timeline of how we got here: Trump is sworn into office. In his inaugural address, he again promises to tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. And he reiterates plans to create an agency called the External Revenue Service, which has yet to be established. On his first day in office, Trump also says he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1, while declining to immediately flesh out plans for taxing Chinese imports. 
        
     Trump threatens 25% tariffs on all Colombia imports and other retaliatory measures after President Gustavo Petros rejects two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants to the country, accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation.  In response, Petro also announces a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. But Colombia later reversed its decision and accepted the flights carrying migrants. The two countries soon signaled a halt in the trade dispute. Trump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China  10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency  ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking. The action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures. Trump agrees to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, as both trading partners take steps to appease Trumps concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trumps new 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S. still go into effect. China retaliates the same day by announcing a flurry of countermeasures, including new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google. Chinas 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% levy on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S., take effect Feb. 10. Trump announces plans to hike steel and aluminum tariffs starting March 12. He removes the exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, and also raises his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%. Trump announces a plan for reciprocal tariffs  promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that countries worldwide charge on imports for purposes of fairness. Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses. Trump signs an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the materials use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies. Trump signs an additional executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether tariffs on lumber and timber are also needed to protect national security, arguing that the construction industry and military depend on a strong supply of wooden products in the U.S. Trumps 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect, though he limits the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. He also doubles the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%.  All three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate. China, meanwhile, imposes tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of key U.S. farm exports, set to take effect March 10. It also expands the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. Trump grants a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The pause arrives after the president spoke with leaders of the Big 3 automakers  Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. In a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month. Trump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs. His actions also thaw relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government says its suspended a second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion). Chinas retaliatory 15% tariffs on key American farm products  including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef  take effect. Goods already in transit are set to be exempt through April 12, per Chinas Commerce Ministry previous announcement. Trumps new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports go into effect. Both metals are now taxed at 25% across the board  with Trumps order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminums levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes. The European Union takes retaliatory trade action promising new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during Trumps first term. The 27-member bloc later says it will delay this retaliatory action until mid-April. Canada, meanwhile, announces plans to impose more retaliatory tariffs worth Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) on U.S. imports, set to go into effect March 13. Trump threatens a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with its previously-announced plans for a 50% tariff on American whiskey. Trump says he will place a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, in addition to imposing new tariffs on the South American country itself, starting April 2.  The tariffs would most likely add to the taxes facing China, which in 2023 bought 68% of the oil exported by Venezuela, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a number of countries also receive oil from Venezuela  including the United States itself. Trump says he is placing 25% tariffs on auto imports. These auto imports will start being collected April 3  beginning with taxes on fully-imported cars. The tariffs are set to then expand to applicable auto parts in the following weeks, through May 3. Trump announces his long-promised reciprocal tariffs  declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports across the board starting April 5, as well as higher rates for dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the U.S. to take effect April 9. Among those steeper levies, Trump says the U.S. will now charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, 25% on South Korea, 24% on Japan and 32% on Taiwan. The new tariffs come on top of previously-imposed levies, including the 20% tax Trump announced on all Chinese imports earlier this year.  Meanwhile, for Canada and Mexico, the White House says USMCA-compliant imports can continue to enter the U.S. duty-free. Once the two countries have satisfied Trumps demands on immigration and drug trafficking, the White House adds, the tariff on the rest of their imports may drop from 25% to 12%. Trumps previously-announced auto tariffs begin. Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will match the 25% levies with a tariff on vehicles imported from the U.S. China announces plans to impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10, matching Trumps new reciprocal tariff on Chinese goods, as part of a flurry of retaliatory measures. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing says it will also impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products like computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. And the government adds 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls. Trumps 10% minimum tariff on nearly all countries and territories takes effect. Trumps higher reciprocal rates go into effect, hiking taxes on imports from dozens of countries just after midnight. But hours later, his administration says it will suspend most of these higher rates for 90 days, while maintaining the recently-imposed 10% levy on nearly all global imports. China is the exception. After following through on a threat to raise levies against China to a total of 104%, Trump says he will now raise those import taxes to 125% effective immediately  escalating tit-for-tat duties that have piled up between the two countries. The White House later clarifies that total tariffs against China are actually now 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs are accounted for. China upped its retaliation prior to this announcement  vowing to tax American goods at 84% starting April 10. Also earlier, EU member states vote to approve their own retaliatory levies on 20.9 billion euros ($23 billion) of U.S. goods in response to Trumps previously-imposed steel and aluminum tariffs. The EUs executive commission doesnt immediately specify which imports it will tax, but notes its counter tariffs will come in stages  with some set to arrive on April 15, and others May 15 and Dec. 1.  Separately, Canadas counter tariffs on auto imports take effect. The country implements a 25% levy on auto imports from the U.S. that do not comply with the 2020 USMCA pact. The EU puts its steel and aluminum tariff retaliation on hold for 90 days, to match Trumps pause on steeper reciprocal levies. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the commission wants to give negotiations with the U.S. a chance  but warns countermeasures will kick in if talks are not satisfactory. China says it will raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, in response to Trumps heightened levies. The new rate is set to begin April 12. Later, the Trump administration unveils that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, will be exempt from so-called reciprocal tariffs. But in the days following, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signals that this is only a temporary reprieve, saying that sector-specific levies on semiconductors will arrive in probably a month or two. And other, non-""reciprocal tariffs that tax some electronics, notably from China, remain. Trump says he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains. The Trump administration also launches investigations into imports of computer chips, chipmaking equipment and pharmaceuticals  signaling next steps toward imposing tariffs on these sectors. The U.S. Commerce Department posts notices about these probes, seeking public comment within the next three weeks. Separately, the Commerce Department says its withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into fresh tomato imports from Mexico. That termination, set to take effect July 14, means most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff. Trump signs executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts  aimed at easing import taxes for vehicles that are made with foreign parts, but assembled in the U.S.  For one year, the administration says it will provide a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales prices of a domestically-assembled car  a figure reached by putting the previously-imposed 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of that price. And for the second year, the rebate would equal 2.5% of the sales price, applying to a smaller share of the vehicles parts. The latest round of Trumps auto tariffs takes effect. The previously-announced 25% levies now apply to a range of imported auto parts. Trump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, while claiming that the movie industry in the U.S. is dying. It isnt immediately clear how such a tariff on international productions could be implemented, but Trump says hes authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to immediately begin the process. The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses tried to get ahead of Trumpstariffs. Federal data showed an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products. The deficit  which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys  has roughly doubled during the past year. Also, the U.S. government announced that top officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation over the weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Trump sparked a trade war. No country has been hit harder by Trumps trade war than China, the worlds biggest exporter and second largest economy. U.S. tariffs against China are set at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%.  The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged at 4.3%, saying that the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen due to uncertainty about how and when Trumps tariffs might impact the U.S. economy. Chair Jerome Powell underscored that the tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment and that theres currently too many unknowns to be able to predict how the Fed might adjust its monetary policy going forward. The United States and Britain announced a trade deal, potentially lowering the financial burden from tariffs while creating greater access abroad for American goods. The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., which would also streamline the processing of U.S. goods though customs. Trump said final details were being written up. In the coming weeks, well have it all very conclusive, Trump said. Britain said the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10%, with a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. It also eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. Separately, the European Union published a list of U.S. imports that it would target with retaliatory duties if no solution is found to end U.S. President Donald Trumps tariff war. The EUs executive branch, the European Commission, also said it would begin legal action at the World Trade Organization over the reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on countries around the world a month ago.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariff-england-trade-war-e8300b457256d4c23d64928c09ce2b63,business
"Average rate on a US 30-year mortgage holds steady at 6.76%, not far from highest levels this year","The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. held steady this week, not far from its highest levels this year, but below where it was a year ago.  The rate stood at 6.76% for the second week in a row, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 7.09%. Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, eased. The average rate dropped to 5.89% from 5.92% last week. Its down from 6.38% a year ago, Freddie Mac said. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserves interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors expectations about the economy and inflation. After climbing to a just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained above 6.62%, where it was just four weeks ago. It then spiked above 6.8% in the following two weeks and eased last week to 6.76%.  The recent swings in mortgage rates reflect volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield, which had mostly fallen after climbing to around 4.8% in mid-January, surged last month to 4.5% amid a sell-off in government bonds triggered by investor anxiety over the Trump administrations trade war.  The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.33% in midday trading Thursday, up from 4.26% late Wednesday. 
        
     Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices remain affordability hurdles for many would-be homebuyers, key reasons why the spring homebuying season is off to a lackluster start, even as the inventory of homes on the market is up sharply from last year. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in March, posting the largest monthly drop since November 2022.  The median monthly housing payment was $2,868 in the four weeks ended May 4, an all-time high, according to a new report from Redfin. Economists expect mortgage rates to remain volatile in coming months, though they generally call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6.5% this year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left its main interest alone, as was widely expected, even as it noted an increased risk of higher unemployment and inflation. While the Fed doesnt set rates on home loans, its actions can influence the trajectory of mortgage rates. Looking ahead, the Feds wait-and-see approach is likely to keep mortgage rates at a high-6% in the near term, unless major policy developments or economic shifts occur, such as notable outcomes from the upcoming U.S.-China trade talks scheduled for this weekend, said Jiayi Xu, economist at Realtor.com.",https://apnews.com/article/mortgage-rates-housing-interest-financing-home-93b63e9f039dc387b0a8d3f830959d1b,business
White House overhaul of troubled US air traffic control system will cost lots of billions,"The Trump administration on Thursday proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of a U.S. air traffic control system that it said still relies on floppy disks and replacement parts found on eBay and has come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of recent deadly plane crashes  and technical failures.  The plan calls for six new air traffic control centers, along with an array of technology and communications upgrades at all of the nations air traffic facilities over the next three or four years, said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.  We use radar from the 1970s, said Duffy, who compared the proposal with upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone. This technology is 50 years old that our controllers use to scan the skies and keep airplanes separated from one another. President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks with reporters after announcing a trade deal with United Kingdom in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, May 8, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks with reporters after announcing a trade deal with United Kingdom in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, May 8, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) How much it will all cost wasnt immediately revealed. Duffy said hell work with Congress on the details. Its going to be billions, lots of billions, he said.  The plan has an aggressive timeline, calling on everything to be finished by 2028  although Duffy said it may take another year. Demands to fix the aging system that handles more than 45,000 daily flights have increased since the midair collision in January between an Army helicopter and a commercial airliner that killed 67 people over Washington, D.C. That crash  and a string of other crashes and mishaps  showed the immediate need for these upgrades, Duffy said in front of airline officials, union leaders and family members of those who died in the crash near Reagan National Airport.  
        
     The proposal sets out to add fiber, wireless or satellite technology at more than 4,600 locations, replace 618 radars and more than quadruple the number of airports with systems designed to reduce near misses on runways. Six new air traffic control centers also would be built under the plan, and new hardware and software would be standardized across all air traffic facilities.  The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week budgeted $12.5 billion to overhaul the system, but that estimate came out before the Transportation Department revealed its plan. Duffy said the final price tag will be higher. U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, who heads the House transportation committee, called the amount only a down payment.  To build the system quickly, as planned, Duffy said Congress must give the Federal Aviation Administration all the money up front and streamline the permitting process. President Donald Trump speaks at an event for Military Mothers, Thursday, May 8, 2025, in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) President Donald Trump speaks at an event for Military Mothers, Thursday, May 8, 2025, in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The system we have here? Its not worth saving. I dont need to preserve any of this. Its too old, Duffy said.  Trump said Thursday that the plan will revolutionize flying. The new equipment is unbelievable what it does, he said from the Oval Office. He began to say it may even alleviate the need for pilots before adding, In my opinion, you always need pilots. But you wouldnt even have to have pilots. The newly revealed proposal appears to have wide support across the aviation industry  from airline CEOs to the unions representing controllers and pilots  but this is just the beginning and many details havent been revealed. Duffy quickly said the plan will not involve privatizing the air traffic control system, as Trump had supported in his first term. Following the midair crash near Washington, Trump promised to fix what he called an old, broken system and to tackle the nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers while blaming the previous Biden administration for both problems.  But the weaknesses within the air traffic control system have been highlighted for years in hearings before Congress and government reports. The struggles to keep up with increasing air traffic has been recognized since the 1990s  long before either Trump or Biden took office. The Trump administrations overhaul plan will need enough funding to be more effective than previous reform efforts during the last three decades. Already more than $14 billion has been invested in upgrades since 2003 but none have dramatically changed how the system works.  The FAA has been working since the mid-2000s to make upgrades through its NextGen program.  One of the biggest challenges with a massive upgrade is that the FAA must keep the current system operating while developing a new system and then find a way to seamlessly switch over. Thats partly why the agency has pursued more gradual improvements in the past. The shortage of controllers and technical breakdowns came to the forefront in the last two weeks when a radar system briefly failed at the Newark, New Jersey, airport, leading to a wave of flight cancellations and delays. Without the planned upgrades, those breakdowns will be repeated around the nation, Duffy said. Newark has been a prime example of what happens when this old equipment goes down, he said. ___ Associated Press reporter Will Weissert in Washington contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/air-traffic-control-plane-crashes-trump-duffy-8e334139510f395c8ee093e134aae5fe,business
Ontario begins construction of 1st small reactor as it aims to lead in new nuclear technology,"Ontario has begun building the first of four new, small nuclear reactors, as Canada seeks to lead the Group of Seven industrialized nations in developing next-generation nuclear technology. Ontario Energy Minister Stephen Lecce announced Thursday at the site that the government approved Ontario Power Generations plan to begin construction. Behind Lecce, workers were already excavating the land for the first reactor and grading the site for the others. We are protecting Ontario by building the most resilient energy future any country has ever seen, Lecce said. We are taking our true place as a global clean energy superpower and a leader in nuclear innovation and technology. A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Canadas first commercial small modular reactor should be connected to the electrical grid by the end of 2030, Lecce said, putting them ahead of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the U.S., Bill Gates energy company is preparing a site in Wyoming for a next-generation nuclear power plant while the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews its application for a construction permit. Kairos Power is building a low-power demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Russia and China are the only countries that are already operating advanced reactors. Electricity demand in Ontario is expected to soar by 75% by 2050, primarily due to demand from industry and large data centers. Ontario Power Generation picked a boiling water reactor design from GE Vernova for the Darlington New Nuclear Project in Clarington, Ontario. When constructed, each reactor will provide enough electricity to power 300,000 Toronto homes, at 10% the size and complexity of a traditional boiling water reactor, according to GE Vernova. The first will cost $6.1 billion, along with $1.6 billion in costs for systems and services common to all four, Lecce said. The cost is expected to decline with each subsequent reactor. 
        
     Canada has historically been a net exporter of electricity, sending significant amounts of hydropower to the United States. In the fall of 2023, the electricity trade between the two countries became more balanced because of drought conditions that reduced the amount of hydropower available and lower natural gas prices in the United States that made U.S. electricity more competitive, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Now with a trade war and U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly saying that Canada should be the 51st U.S. state, Canadians are feeling like the alliance is broken. Ontarios Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy alluded to that at Thursdays nuclear announcement, saying their traditional relationship with the United States isnt going to be the same and Canada needs new, clean energy. The world economy is changing, he said, and its important that Canada be self-reliant. ___ The Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

California promised to boost mental health in schools. Why one key program is behind schedule,"California made a huge one-time investment in youth mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic as rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders surged among children and teens. One piece of the states plan included a way to keep money flowing for schools that wanted to expand mental health services for students.  It involved allowing K-12 schools and colleges to charge Medi-Cal and private health insurance for behavioral health care provided on campus, a change that would allow them to provide more services and hire additional mental health staff.  But that effort  among the first of its kind in the country  is off to a slow start, delaying dollars and resources for schools to help students with mental health challenges. Only 14 school districts and county offices of education have begun billing for behavioral health services under the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Fee Schedule Program, according to state health officials. Forty six school districts and county offices of education started the implementation process in January 2024 and were supposed to start billing last July. A total of 494 school districts, county offices of education and colleges have signed up to participate in the new billing program.  Some school officials are frustrated over program delays. They say the state was slow to release guidance and necessary training to submit claims for mental health services provided. Officials at schools that hired mental health staff say they may soon have to lay off recent hires because payments for services provided are not coming in as expected. This means students could lose newly gained access to services. There are so many unknowns and the timelines just keep getting pushed, said Trina Frazier, assistant superintendent of student services at the Fresno County Office of Education. And thats really sad because it has so much potential. 
        
     The California Department of Health Care Services, which is overseeing implementation of the program, told CalMatters in an email that while the target was to begin billing in mid-2024, the scale and complexity of implementation required adjustments to provide additional flexibilities to schools. Major reforms of this kind require time, coordination, and phased implementation, the department said in its email. The department said it continues to work with schools to address any outstanding challenges. Its new goal is for that first group of 46 districts and education offices to start billing by the end of the current school year. California and the nation have seen a surge in mental health disorders among students. For example, about 284,000 California children and teens deal with major depression, and two-thirds of them do not receive treatment, according to state estimates.  Despite the slow start for the new school billing program, other mental health efforts are underway through other components of the states $4.7 billion Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative that launched in 2021. That money has paid for mental health apps, education campaigns, and mental health workforce training programs, among a number of other efforts. About $400 million of that money was allotted in the form of one-time grants to education institutions to hire providers and prepare for this new billing program.  In response to delays in the billing program, a group of lawmakers recently sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a letter requesting bridge funding that they say would allow schools to keep building mental health services while the program comes up to speed. The letter does not specify a dollar amount. For the last 30 years and through a separate program, California schools have been able to get reimbursed by Medi-Cal, the states Medicaid program for low-income residents, for certain physical and mental health services. But theres long been a gap for children with private insurance. This new billing program is supposed to address that, as well as allow schools to expand the types of mental health services they can provide and charge for. Mental health experts regard school as an ideal setting for children to receive help. Its where they spend most of their weekdays and generally feel safe. Its also a logistics problem solver because schools resolve some potential barriers to care, like transportation to appointments, said Sarah Broome, a school Medicaid consultant. Also, teachers and staff see children every day and can notice when things are off.  Broome said that the challenges that the state and schools are facing in rolling out this new fee schedule program are somewhat predictable, partly because what California is doing is new. So its not even like you can call your peer states and be like, Hey, how did you guys figure out how to do this? You are creating a lot of this as you go. So theres absolutely real pain there. State legislators are hearing from frustrated local officials about the billing delays. The Fresno County Office of Education filed its first claim for reimbursement on Feb. 28, but as of last week continued to face challenges, according to Frazier.  Frazier told lawmakers in a hearing last week that the program rollout feels like building the plane while flying it. In Santa Clara County, the local office of education established 25 wellness centers across its schools and hired 50 new mental health workers, including clinicians and wellness coaches. But the delays prompted the office to notify its new staff about possible layoffs, Amanda Dickey, executive director of government relations for the Santa Clara County Office of Education, told lawmakers during the hearing. Because we didnt receive reimbursement for a single claim until 15 months after (starting program implementation)  as of March we were forced to pink slip 27 of our staff. So 27 of the approximately 50 that we hired, she said. Dickey told legislators that the state and the third party administrator contracted to process claims, Carelon Behavioral Health, did not give schools access to or training for the billing software used to file claims until late last year. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Office of Education told CalMatters that one of the challenges has been collecting students health insurance information  a new task for schools, and one that requires parents and caregivers to cooperate in sharing information about their health plan. (Mental health care provided at schools under this program should not result in any out-of-pocket costs for families, according to the state.)  Tanya Ward, a project director at the Los Angeles County Office of Education, said her office has yet to file mental health claims under this new program, but expects to do so later this month. The California Department of Health Care Services attributes the delays to a learning curve for both the state and schools.  According to the department, a number of factors contributed to the delays, including the fact that some schools requested edits to the contractual documents to participate in the program and that others expressed confusion about the process and needed additional support. The department said that districts are allowed to submit claims retroactively for dates of service back to July 1, 2024, as long as those claims are submitted by June 30. The 14 districts and education offices that are now able to file claims are starting to do so in larger numbers, Autumn Boylan, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships at the state health department, told lawmakers in last weeks hearing.  This is a significant change for the entire system, and changes of this magnitude take time, Boylan told lawmakers.  There is still work to be done, but I do think we are making progress, she said.  Testifying next to each other at last weeks hearing, Boylan and Frazier from Fresno couldnt agree on how much in claims had actually been paid out to the Fresno County Office of Education. Of the first 40 claims that had been processed for Fresno, 21 were denied, Frazier said. Boylan said that some claims are being denied because they are incomplete or not properly filed. Lawmakers questioned whether schools are filing claims incorrectly because they have not been adequately taught how to do so. This is brand new for schools, Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, said during the hearing. It is imperative on us, as government, to lead them in the right path if we want them to take on something thats completely out of their scope. ___ This story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",https://apnews.com/us-news/mental-health-california-gavin-newsom-school-curricula-health-care-costs-047a4f14fe132374436fcfbe11f4dfc6,business

Founder of crypto platform Celsius Network is sentenced to 12 years in prison,"NEW YORK (AP)  The founder and former CEO of the cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network was sentenced Thursday to 12 years in prison after a prosecutor labeled him a predator who preyed on hope by enticing vulnerable customers to risk their life savings for a supposedly safe investment. Alexander Mashinsky, 59, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, who said a substantial term in prison was necessary for someone who engaged in extremely serious crimes that enabled him to pocket over $45 million while some of his customers lost everything and suffered severe psychological harm. Celsius declared bankruptcy in 2022, exposing risky financial bets Mashinsky had made with some of the $20 billion that thousands of customers poured into the company. He had promised that their money would be safe and secure at Celsius, which pitched itself as a modern-day bank where crypto assets could earn interest. The defense blamed the collapse of Celsius on a cataclysmic downturn of cryptocurrency markets in May and June of 2022 and said in court papers that Mashinskys actions were never predatory, exploitative or venal. He never acted with the intent to hurt anyone. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Allison Nichols cast him as a financial predator, telling the judge Thursday that Mashinsky had deceived customers from the start by exaggerating Celsius ability to build momentum. 
        
     He preyed on hope, she said. Mashinsky knew exactly what he was doing  selling these people hope. She said the customers were not going to be made financially whole regardless of money that can be recovered through bankruptcy proceedings. Before he was sentenced, Mashinsky sobbed several times as he apologized to customers and referenced his difficult past as his family was able to leave a small Ukrainian town in the former Soviet Union with help from the United States when he was 7. The family moved to Israel, where Mashinsky served three years in the Israeli Defense Forces as a fighter pilot before coming to America. Mashinsky said he never meant to hurt anybody here after all this country has done for me. Im truly sorry, he said, describing himself as someone who came from nothing. When he pleaded guilty in December, Mashinsky admitted to misleading customers between 2018 and 2022 by promising their investments were safe even as he fabricated Celsius profitability and put customers funds at the mercy of uncollateralized loans and undisclosed risky market bets. His attorney, Marc Mukasey, said victim impact statements submitted to the court were rather brutal toward his client. We hear the intensity of their pain, he said. Our sympathies are with everyone. Several victims spoke at the sentencing hearing. Cameron Crewes, who serves on a victims committee, called for a harsh sentence, saying nearly 250 victims died before they could see justice served or get adequately compensated for losses. Many people have been wiped out, he said. In a statement, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Mashinsky made tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions. He added: Americas investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong, but it is not a license to deceive. The rules against fraud still apply.",https://apnews.com/article/cryptocurrency-celsius-mashinsky-sentencing-81bdbb8b0b445f1c4077b5eda7a4cc9e,business
Federal officials set timeline for Helene aid to farmers as Georgia enacts tax breaks,"FORSYTH, Ga. (AP)  Georgias governor signed a law Thursday to exempt federal crop insurance and disaster payments following Hurricane Helene damage from Georgia state income taxes, but it could be months more before some federal money starts flowing to farmers in the hardest-hit states. The U.S. Department of Agriculture published a schedule Wednesday to start disbursing disaster aid, part of a $100 billion package passed by Congress in December. The September storm cut a swath from Floridas Big Bend across eastern Georgia and upstate South Carolina before causing historic flooding in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.  Helene is the seventh-most expensive disaster in the United States since 1980, causing an estimated $78 billion in damage and 219 deaths. Officials have estimated that Helene caused billions in property and economic damage to agriculture, including $5.5 billion in Georgia and $4.9 billion in North Carolina.  Federal officials in March began handing out $10 billion designated in the bill for farmers nationwide harmed by low crop prices and high fertilizer prices. But billions more were set aside for farmers harmed by Helene and other natural disasters in 2023 and 2024. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was questioned about the timeframe Tuesday by lawmakers including Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia. He told Rollins that Time is of the essence. 
        
     Ive seen the devastation firsthand, Rollins said. It is heartbreaking to witness it. Some farmers have dipped into savings to pay for losses not covered by insurance. Others have unpaid debts from last year, restricting borrowing to plant 2025 crops. A few have sold equipment or land to generate cash. The schedule shows federal officials will open applications for some aid in stages from May 30 through Sept. 15. But states have to negotiate plans to distribute other aid through block grants. If state and federal officials agree on a plan by May 28, block grants would be finalized by June 13, federal officials said. If agreements can be reached by June 13, they would be finalized by June 30. After that, states must give out the money. Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said Thursday that he didnt know how much money Georgia would get in block grants. He said whether the state made the May 28 deadline depends on how our negotiations go with USDA over the next couple of weeks. Kemp on Thursday signed into law tax breaks for farmers and timber owners harmed by Helene that could be worth nearly $300 million. Farmers operate on extremely tight margins, and to rebuild from a storm of this magnitude could be impossible for some to shoulder, Kemp said at Georgia Forestry Association headquarters in Forsyth, saying Helene was a storm like no other in out state. The tax breaks come on top of $867 million in spending that Georgia lawmakers earlier allotted for Hurricane Helene relief .  The law exempts federal payments to farmers because of Helene from Georgia state income taxes. That could be worth $140 million.  Georgias law also lets private timberland owners claim a credit for damaged timber on state income taxes if they replant trees. The timberland tax break could be worth $83 million to $104 million through 2030, estimates show. Another tax break waives state and local sales taxes on building materials to rebuild chicken houses, barns, and fences.  A fourth program lets counties waive taxes when timber owners cut down trees for 15 months. Any county that waives taxes would refund any taxes collected since Oct. 1. The state could spend $17.4 million to reimburse counties lost tax money. Georgia lawmakers earlier approved $285 million for low-interest loans to farmers and to remove downed trees from private lands so they dont become a fire hazard. Theres also $25 million in grants to nonprofits that are supposed to go to help individuals. In South Carolina, Republican legislative leaders are discussing hundreds of millions in Helene relief as part of the states budget. North Carolina lawmakers agreed to a $524 million supplemental Helene relief in March, in part to provide more funds for agricultural needs. It was North Carolinas fourth Helene aid package.",https://apnews.com/article/georgia-hurricane-helene-farmers-federal-aid-tax-4c45f4398dc8b7d583c40e78bcb031b6,business
"Shohei Ohtani could have landed 15-year deal, agent says, but he didnt want to risk skills decline","INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP)  Shohei Ohtani could have pursued a 15-year contract through age 44, agent Nez Balelo said Thursday, explaining the two-way superstar didnt want to risk a decline in his skills while under the big deal. Balelo pulled back the curtain that shrouds Ohtani a bit when he spoke at Sporticos Invest West conference featuring decision-makers in sports, entertainment and finance at the new Intuit Dome, home of the NBAs Los Angeles Clippers. Ohtanis $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers that he signed in December 2023 was the largest in professional sports. He won his third MVP award and first World Series title in his first season after moving from the Los Angeles Angels. A year later, Juan Soto went even bigger. The left fielder landed a $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in which none of the money will be deferred. We wouldnt do anything different, Balelo said afterward. He won a championship. He went to the right team. No regrets. Ohtanis deal includes $680 million in deferred payments. Those deferrals reduce the net present value of the contract to about $461 million for baseballs luxury-tax system, instead of an average of $70 million a year had there been no deferrals. Ohtani will be 38 when the contract ends after the 2033 season. We could have went to 13, 14, 15 years, Balelo said. But Shohei wanted to always kind of keep the integrity of where hes at as a player. He just didnt want to have the end of his storybook career tail off and then on year 13, 14 and 15, its just like who is this guy? You cant even run down first and hes not a guy anymore. 
        
     Balelo prefers operating behind the scenes and carefully controlling the narrative around Ohtani. But even he couldnt tamp down a cottage industry of rumors about which team would land Ohtani and how much it would cost. It was quite a ride, he said in a discussion moderated by Ben Verlander, MLB analyst for FOX Sports. A social media frenzy ensued when it was reported Ohtani was on a plane to Toronto to sign with the Blue Jays. Well, that was reckless reporting. We actually tried to let the individual know, No, were not on a plane, Balelo said. I felt bad for the country of Canada. I felt horrible for the organization because clearly they knew we werent. Ohtanis goals were to keep his new team competitive by allowing the club money to sign other players and to allow him to win championships and continue to be a two-way player. The Dodgers gave us their word thats what they were going to do, said Balelo, who works for CAA Sports baseball division. Ohtani is MLBs top endorser, with his earnings jumping from $65 million in 2024 to $100 million this year. Yeah, absolutely, those are real numbers, Balelo said. It continues to take on a life of its own. According to Balelo, Ohtani endorses just over 20 brands that are carefully vetted and chosen based on his use or belief in the product and the people behind it. His priority is his on-the-field performance and the training that goes into it. He takes that very, very serious and everything really becomes secondary other than his family, Balelo said. We just have to make sure that we dont overexpose him or put him in a situation where its too heavy of a lift. Balelo first spotted the future superstar as a high school junior in Ohtanis native Japan and followed him closely as Ohtanis pro career began with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. There were some things that that I did differently than I typically would when I recruit, he said, declining to elaborate when asked afterward. It was definitely a battle, thats for sure, but we came out on top and I was very fortunate. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/shohei-ohtani-dodgers-13f40a19b9eeac3202e2546143c57008,business
New charges brought against real estate brothers in sex trafficking case,"NEW YORK (AP)  Additional sex trafficking charges were brought Thursday in a New York court against two luxury real estate brokers and their brother. The charges were contained in a rewritten indictment filed by federal prosecutors against Oren Alexander, Tal Alexander and Alon Alexander. The three brothers are being held without bail in a case in which prosecutors in Manhattan have alleged that they have spoken to more than 60 people who allege they were raped by at least one of the brothers. Oren Alexander and Tal Alexander were already charged with using their wealth and influence that they accumulated while selling high-end properties in New York City, Miami and Los Angeles to make it possible to rape and sexually abuse women from 2002 to 2021. No date was immediately set for the men to be arraigned. They previously had pleaded not guilty. The superseding indictment filed Thursday adds five new charges related to four alleged victims, including one female who had not yet reached adulthood when the offenses allegedly occurred. Attorney Richard Klugh said in an email that the new charges, like the governments first two factually and legally unfounded efforts, show nothing but prosecutorial overreach. It is simply another swing-and-a-miss by a government that has gone off the rails in an overzealous, unwarranted pursuit. Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorneys Office in the Southern District of New York, said: We will decline to comment beyond our filings to the court. This is an ongoing investigation, anyone who may have information related to this case can please contact 1-800 CALL FBI or [emailprotected].",https://apnews.com/article/luxury-real-estate-brothers-nyc-sex-trafficking-c83be9f3a6bf4f8aefeb472c47642c6e,business
Asbestos clinic forced to close in Montana town where thousands have been sickened by dust,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)  An asbestos screening clinic in a small Montana town where thousands have been sickened by toxic dust from a nearby mine has been abruptly shuttered by authorities following a court order to seize the clinics assets to pay off a judgment to the railroad BNSF. The Lincoln County Sheriffs Office closed on Wednesday the Center for Asbestos Related Disease in Libby, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the U.S.-Canada border. The town of about 3,000 people is near a mine that produced asbestos dust for decades, and the clinic has been at the forefront of efforts to help victims. Courts in Montana have said BNSF contributed to the pollution when it brought contaminated material from the mine through town, and the railway separately faces numerous lawsuits from asbestos victims in Libby and surrounding communities. But the Texas-based railway prevailed in a 2023 lawsuit alleging the clinic fraudulently made some patients eligible for government benefits when it knew they were not sick. The railway challenged the validity of over 2,000 diagnoses by the clinic and 337 were ruled false. The railway brought the lawsuit on behalf of the federal government, which provides specialized Medicare services to Libbys asbestos victims. BNSF was entitled to a share of the $6 million judgment against the clinic, and after adding in attorney fees, court costs and interest, the railway says its now owed $3.1 million. 
        
     The judge determined the amount of damages to be repaid, and the process for recovery is set by law, BNSF spokesperson Kendall Kirkham Sloan said in a statement. Clinic Executive Director Tracy McNew said the closure would have a broad impact on public health in the Libby area as fewer people are screened for asbestos-related health problems. CARD remains committed to its patients and the Libby community and will fight to reopen as soon as possible, McNew said in a statement. The clinic for more than 20 years has provided health screenings, monitoring and treatment of patients with problems caused by asbestos exposure. It declared bankruptcy after the judgment in the fraud case was handed down. It kept operating and didnt pay the money under a settlement reached in bankruptcy court with the federal government that included BNSF. CARD bankruptcy attorney James Andy Patten said the railways attempts to collect on the fraud judgment violated the bankruptcy settlement, which was approved by a federal court. Sloan declined to comment on the bankruptcy settlement.",https://apnews.com/article/libby-montana-asbestos-clinic-shuttered-bnsf-87e2e20926916a97da6821d8afe50be4,business
Former Australian test cricketer Stuart MacGill is spared jail time over supplying cocaine,"SYDNEY (AP)  Former Australian test bowler Stuart MacGill was spared jail time and given a community service order when he appeared in court on Friday for sentencing over supplying cocaine. MacGill was convicted of supplying drugs for a deal between his regular supplier and his brother-in-law in April 2021. He appeared at Downing Centre District Court where a statement from former test captain Steve Waugh supported his former colleague. MacGill was sentenced to an intensive corrections order of one year and 10 months. MacGill must complete 495 hours of community service work and undergo drug testing as part of the order, in lieu of a prison term. The former legspinner, who began using cocaine after he retired from cricket, was found guilty in March of supplying an indictable quantity of the drug. A jury determined the 54-year-old MacGill knew about the deal between his regular dealer and his brother-in-law but was oblivious to the fact a one-kilogram (2.2-pound) brick was changing hands. He was acquitted of taking part in a large commercial drug supply. His role in the lucrative cocaine deal led to his alleged violent kidnapping days later. He was shoved into the back of a car by several men and taken to an abandoned building in Sydneys western suburbs, where he was assaulted and threatened before being released. Six days later, MacGill went to police but denied any involvement in the drug deal. He was arrested in 2023. 
        
     Judge Nicole Noman said Friday that MacGill played an indispensable role setting up the cocaine deal. His role was essential to bring the parties together and for the transaction to occur, she said. The offenders colossal lapse of judgment has been causative of a very public fall from grace. MacGills international career from 1988 to 2008 which featured 208 wickets in 44 test matches was largely overshadowed by fellow Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, who is second on the list of all-time leading wicket takers in test cricket. ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",https://apnews.com/article/cricket-stuart-macgill-drugs-b494820be78811f0b10cf9f07f78c480,business
Chinas exports rose a higher than expected 8% in April as new US tariffs took effect,"Chinas exports rose 8.1% in April from the year before, the government said Friday, faster than economists were expecting, though exports to the United States sank more than 20%. Economists had forecast that Chinas global exports would grow about 2% in April, down from a whopping 12.4% year-on-year increase in March. Imports fell 0.2% in April from the year before. The data were released a day before U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other top U.S. officials were due to meet with Beijings lead trade envoy, He Lifeng. The plans for talks in Geneva, Switzerland, could bring a shift in the stalemate over President Donald Trumps hikes in tariffs on Chinese good to as much as 145%.  But the worlds two biggest economies are at odds over a raft of issues, including colliding strategic interests that will likely impede progress in the talks.  Some of the punitive tariffs, including Beijings retaliatory 125% tariffs on U.S. exports, could be rolled back, but a full reversal is unlikely, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report. This means Chinas exports to the U.S. are set for further declines over the coming months, not all of which will be offset by increased trade with other countries. We still expect export growth to turn negative later this year, Huang said.  Chinas politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States was nearly $20.5 billion in April, down from about $27.2 billion a year earlier. In the first four months of the year, Chinas exports to the United States fell 2.5% from a year earlier, while imports from the U.S. fell 4.7%. 
        
     Preliminary data also show that U.S. imports from other countries not subject to U.S. President Donald Trumps 145% tariff on Chinese products have been rising quickly. Exports to the United States form just a part of Chinas trade, and exports to the rest of the world have helped offset that weakness. Exports to Southeast Asian countries were up 11.5% from a year earlier in the first four months of this year. Exports to Latin America also climbed 11.5%. Shipments to India jumped nearly 16% by value, and exports to Africa surged 15%.  Some of the fastest growth was in Asia, reflecting moves by Chinese and other manufacturers to diversify their supply chains outside of the Chinese mainland.  Exports to Vietnam jumped 18% year-on-year, while exports to Thailand were up 20%. Measured on a monthly basis, Chinas total exports rose just 0.6% in April, while imports increased by nearly 4% from March.  ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-trade-exports-trump-1ccca562b7381cd8546263342c640f52,business
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and other US tech leaders testify to Congress on AI competition with China,"WASHINGTON (AP)  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives from Microsoft and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices testified on Capitol Hill about the biggest opportunities, risks and needs facing an industry which lawmakers and technologists agree could fundamentally transform global business, culture and geopolitics. The hearing comes as the race to control the future of artificial intelligence is heating up between companies and countries. Altmans OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.  I believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger, Altman said in his opening remarks about AIs potential to transform society. For that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical. Altman urged senators to help usher in the dual revolutions of artificial intelligence and energy production that will change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways. The witnesses included Altman; Lisa Su, chief executive of semiconductor maker AMD; Michael Intrator, co-founder of AI cloud computing startup CoreWeave; and Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. The four executives unanimously urged lawmakers to help streamline policy for AI-related projects and fundraising. The hearing spanned topics ranging from industry debates over chip performance, jobs, human relationships and power generation to grander questions about the global competition with China and the European Union. 
        
     China aims to lead the world in AI by 2030, said Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. In this race, the United States is facing a fork in the road. Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe? Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AIs ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people. Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administrations sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.  And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Departments national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as a self sabotaging attack. Does anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development? asked Duckworth. But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanitys future.  Look, there is a race, but we need to understand what were racing for, Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. Its not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. Were trying to win a race so that American values prevail. Several of the executives warned against U.S. export controls that could end up pushing other countries toward Chinas AI technology. We totally understand as an industry the importance of national security, Su said. But she added, if not able to have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play. Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said. Altman drew a direct connection between the ability of the U.S. to attract global talent and sell its products globally to national security and its international influence. The leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge, Altman said. We talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think its no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible. Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD. The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidias H20 chips and AMDs MI308 chips to China.  Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months. Still uncertain are additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Bidens administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries, including a number of U.S. allies. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent Chinas sophisticated smuggling operations to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.  The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Bidens overly complex, overly bureaucratic rule with a simpler one but didnt say when. The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power. Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been unbelievable in incentivizing major AI projects. I think that would be a good thing for other states to study, Altman said. He predicted that the Abilene site would be the largest AI training facility in the world. But Altman also later cautioned against a patchwork regulatory framework for AI. It is very difficult to imagine us figuring out how to comply with 50 different sets of regulations, said Altman. One federal framework that is light touch, that we can understand, and it lets us move with the speed that this moment calls for, seems important and fine. While the tech industry has long relied on data centers to run online services, from email and social media to financial transactions, new AI technology behind popular chatbots and generative AI tools requires even more powerful computation to build and operate. A report released by the Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nations electricity.  The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of APs text archives.

Officials plan to revamp the US air traffic control system. Heres a breakdown by the numbers,"The Trump administration on Thursday announced an ambitious three-year plan to replace the United States aging air traffic control system. Officials did not provide an exact cost estimate but said it would require billions of dollars to put in place. They said a $12.5 billion budget proposal that a House committee drafted last week represents a solid down payment on the plan, which was developed after the deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., in January. Here are some of the key numbers of improvements in the plan: The plan calls for installing 4,600 high-speed network connections for data and communications across the air traffic control system at airports and radar control centers and other facilities across the country. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said there is a desperate need to upgrade the Federal Aviation Administrations communications network because part of it still operates on outdated copper wires.  Some of the shortcomings of the current system have been on display at the Newark, New Jersey, airport over the past two weeks. The air traffic control center in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark lost its radar signal for between 30 and 90 seconds on April 28, meaning air traffic controllers couldnt tell where planes were temporarily. The FAA subsequently slowed down traffic at the Newark airport, which forced airlines to cancel or delay hundreds of flights, leaving travelers stranded. It appears that the source of the problem was a breakdown in the lines carrying radar data from a facility in New York to the air traffic controllers in Philadelphia. 
        
     The FAA is already working on replacing those lines with fiber optic ones and training more controllers to improve the situation in Newark. Duffy said that fiber optic lines will be the priority in the upgrades nationwide, but in some cases the government may look at satellite or cellular technology. Duffy said he is agnostic about whether Elon Musks Starlink or any other company should get the contracts and will let the bidding process play out. The plan calls for replacing 618 radar systems countrywide. Duffy said many of the existing radar systems at airports date back to the 1980s or even 1970s, so they need to be replaced. When repairs are needed, some of the antiquated components can be hard to find, so Duffy said the government sometimes resorts to buying parts on eBay to maintain its systems. The plan proposes creating six new air traffic control centers, a significant number since one hasnt been built since the 1960s. Duffy said the goal would be to consolidate hard-to-staff facilities whenever possible. The FAA would build 15 new towers combined with Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities at airports across the country. The FAA relies on aging radio equipment to allow air traffic controllers to talk to pilots. Some of those radios are more than 30 years old.  Newer digital equipment should be more reliable and offer more clarity than the old radios, as well as make the system more secure. The plan to modernize the nations air traffic control system has drawn support from 55 groups across the aviation industry. The new Modern Skies Coalition includes major unions, trade groups, airplane manufacturers and other associations.  Representatives of those groups attended the plans announcement Thursday. Only about 44 of the most complex airports currently have high-tech systems installed to help controllers keep track of where planes are on the ground. Two hundred more airports would get these systems, allowing controllers to accurately track planes positions instead of just using binoculars from the tower window. But even after these upgrades, 200 more airports would remain without these ground systems that help keep taxiing planes from running into each other.",https://apnews.com/article/air-traffic-control-system-replacement-plan-breakdown-606fb7cc9efc6da839b2d888f1d0b3d7,business
Forest and park service worker cuts leave wildland firefighting crews short-staffed,"SEATTLE (AP)  Trump administration funding cuts and a loss of federal workers who help support wildland firefighting continues to make planning for the upcoming wildfire season a challenge, according to forest and fire officials in Washington state and Oregon. The biggest issue theyre facing is a lack of communication from the federal government as the West faces a pretty significant wildland fire season, Washington State Forester George Geissler said Thursday during a press conference hosted by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.  This is the time when we make certain that we have the aviation we need, when we have the personnel we need and that all of our systems check out and are ready to go when the alarm bell rings, he said. Without knowing what our partners are doing or not having a clear understanding of what actions are being taken, we struggle with missing the third leg of the stool that we have. The Forest Service workforce was cut in February during Elon Musks push to reduce federal spending, and at least 1,000 National Park Service workers were let go. A court order to rehire fired workers, along with a public outcry brought many workers back to their jobs, but Murray and fire officials say it wasnt enough. Plus, the lost of experienced, trained workers set the process back. Were hearing that dont worry, we are going to hire frontline people, Murray said. You just let a whole bunch of frontline people go. 
        
     A spokesperson with the Department of Interior, which oversees National Parks and other public lands, said funding is not in jeopardy. Theyre supporting firefighting efforts by increasing pay for federal and tribal wildland firefighters across the U.S.  The administration has refused to release the exact number of fired and rehired workers, but numbers are coming in from individual forests, she said. Ive heard of at least 35 people at Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, 46 at Okanagan-Wenatchee, 21 at Colville, 15 at Gifford-Pinchot, and more at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Olympic National Forest and Methow Valley, she said. Heres the thing, nearly every single Forest Service employee supports fire operations in some capacity. Fire Chief Leonard Johnson, with the McLane Black Fire Department in Washington state, said they may line up aviation support and heavy equipment, but it takes trained firefighters to put the fires out.  We have a high reliance on that workforce out there, he said. Not only at the local level, at the state level, but at the federal level to make our wildfire season successful to deal with those large fires. People are the critical component in all of this. Merkley said Trumps budget proposal cuts forest and watershed management programs that improve forest conditions, eliminates a collaborative forest landscape restoration program and slashes 2,000 National Forest positions, on top of the thousands who left through early retirement, buyouts and layoffs.  Most of those workers may not have the title firefighter but they all hold Red Cards - which shows they have special training to provide essential frontline support to firefighting crews, Murray said. In fact, around three quarters of forest service workers are trained in wild land firefighting, she said. They provide crucial surge capacity when a crisis strikes. Trail maintenance crews ensure the paths are clear for firefighting personnel and equipment, Murray said. Biologists conduct testing to make decisions about prescribed burns and fuel reduction planning.  We are here today to pull the fire alarm, and were gonna set off some sirens, she said. Were going to keep focused on this, and we are gonna keep pushing back. There is just too much at stake to do anything less.",https://apnews.com/article/washington-oregon-wildland-wildfire-firefighting-forest-trump-df90c3da2dae47ecd3f0d3eb319394b4,business
"After Spains blackout, questions about renewable energy are back","MADRID (AP)  FOR FRIDAY 0500GMT The massive power outage that hit the Iberian peninsula on April 28 has reignited a debate in Spain over the countrys plan to phase out its nuclear reactors as it generates more power with renewable energy. As people wait for answers about what caused the historic power cut, which abruptly disrupted tens of millions of lives, some are questioning the wisdom of decommissioning nuclear reactors that provide a stable, if controversial, form of energy compared to renewables, whose output can be intermittent. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez has rejected such criticism, asking for patience while the government investigates what caused the grids disconnection. He said that his government would not deviate a single millimeter from its energy transition plans. Heres what to know about the energy debate:  Nuclear power is a zero-carbon energy source formed from nuclear fission, when the nuclei of atoms are split into two or several parts, releasing energy. It accounts for about 10% of electricity generation worldwide, according to the International Energy Association. Many countries consider nuclear power critical to reaching their net-zero goals. But while nuclear reactors do not emit planet-warming greenhouse gases like gas- or coal-fired power plants, they produce radioactive waste that even advanced economies have struggled to dispose. Spain generated nearly 57% of its electricity in 2024 from renewable energy sources like wind, hydropower and solar, according to Red Elctrica, the countrys grid operator. About 20% came from nuclear power plants. In 2019, Snchezs government approved a plan to decommission the countrys remaining nuclear reactors between 2027 and 2035 as it expands its share of renewable energy even further. The country aims to generate 81% of its electricity by 2030 from renewable sources. Snchez on Wednesday said that the four nuclear facilities that were online the day of the blackout did not help re-power the grid. Batteries and other methods help regulate changes in electricity supply from wind and solar. While the cause of the sudden outage on April 28 is still unknown, the event has raised questions about the technical challenges facing electricity grids running on high levels of solar and wind.  Solar and wind provided roughly 70% of the electricity on the grid moments before Spain lost 15 gigawatts of electricity  about 60% of its supply  in just five seconds. Electricity grids were designed for a different era, according to Gilles Thonet, deputy secretary general of the International Electrotechnical Commission, an industry group. Traditionally, power flowed in one direction: from large coal, gas or nuclear plants to homes and businesses, Thonet said. These plants provided not only electricity, but also stability. Their spinning turbines acted like shock absorbers, smoothing out fluctuations in supply and demand.  In the days following the blackout, Google searches in Spain for nuclear spiked, according to data from Google Trends. Spains nuclear lobby group Foro Nuclear said this week that the government should rethink its plan to decommission its nuclear reactors after the outage. Ignacio Araluce, its president, said the nuclear plants online before the outage provide firmness and stability. Others say it is too soon to draw conclusions about what role nuclear energy should play. We do not know the cause of the oscillations, said Pedro Fresco, director general of Avaesen, an association of renewable energy and clean technology firms in Valencia. Therefore, we do not know what would have allowed them to be controlled. Spains grid operator last week narrowed down the source of the outage to two separate incidents in which substations in southwestern Spain failed. Environment Minister Sara Aagesen said earlier this week that the grid had initially withstood another power generation outage in southern Spain 19 seconds before the blackout. Snchez in his speech to Parliament said there was no empirical evidence to show that more nuclear power on the grid could have prevented a blackout or allowed the country to get back online faster. In fact, the four nuclear facilities online on April 28 before the blackout were taken offline after the outage as part of emergency protocol to avoid overheating. He said that nuclear energy has not been shown to be an effective solution in situations like what we experienced on April 28, and called the debate surrounding his governments nuclear phase-out plan a gigantic manipulation. Gas and hydropower, as well as electricity transfers from Morocco and France, were used to get the countrys grid back online.",https://apnews.com/article/renewables-nuclear-spain-portugal-energy-power-outage-climate-change-c62fbb73e982365d10402323e4fcfcc6,business
China rolls out more stimulus and agrees to trade talks with the US as tariffs hit economy,"BEIJING (AP)  China announced a barrage of measures meant to counter the blow to its economy from U.S. President Donald Trump s trade war, as the two sides prepared for talks later this week. Beijings central bank governor and other top financial officials outlined plans Wednesday to cut interest rates and reduce bank reserve requirements to help free up more funding for lending. They also said the government would increase the amount of money available for factory upgrades and other innovation and for elder care and other service businesses.  Trumps tariffs, set as high as 145% on imports from China, have begun to take a toll on its export-dependent economy at a time when its already under pressure from a prolonged downturn in the property sector. China has retaliated with tariff hikes of up to 125% on U.S. goods and stopped buying most American farm products.  Late Tuesday, China and the U.S. announced plans for talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng later this week in Geneva, Switzerland.  The agreement to talk comes at a time when both sides have remained adamant, at least in public, about not compromising on the tariffs. The U.S. has recently expressed a desire to negotiate with China. This meeting is being held at the request of the U.S. side, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters in Beijing.  
        
     Any form of pressure or coercion against China will not work, Lin said. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate interests and uphold international fairness and justice. Please stay tuned for the specific details of the dialogue. By easing credit, Chinas leaders are providing a policy buffer for exporters as Beijing prepares for the talks, economists at ANZ Research said in a report.  The authorities are prepared to have a protracted negotiation and hold a strong stance against protectionism, the report said.  Both the U.S. and Chinese economies have been showing signs of strain, after a spurt of activity as companies and consumers rushed to beat the tariff hikes.  The meetings in Switzerland could offer an opportunity for both sides to dial down the current prohibitively high level of tariffs, which Bessent has described as unsustainable, while they work on a deal. But the process is likely to take time.  A durable resolution remains elusive, in our view, given the wide scope of issues in the bilateral relationship, Morgan Stanley said in a commentary.  The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in January-March. The Chinese economy grew at a 5.4% annual pace in the first quarter of the year, as factories ramped up production to fill a spike in orders. But economists question the validity of the statistics, and more recent reports show a deterioration in new export orders and business sentiment.  
        
     Among the support measures announced by China on Wednesday:  Peoples Bank of China Gov. Pan Gongsheng said Chinas reverse repo rate, the rate on commercial banks deposits with the central bank, was reduced to 1.4% from 1.5%. The PBOCs lending rate to commercial banks was cut by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5%.  The required reserve ratio, or portion of funds banks must hold in their reserves, was cut by 0.5%. Pan said that would free up 1 trillion yuan ($137.6 billion) in extra cash.  The central bank also reduced interest rates on five-year housing loans.

The news of the extra boost for the economy and markets, plus the plans for China-U.S. trade talks, initially pushed share prices higher in Hong Kong and Shanghai early Wednesday. Shanghais benchmark Composite index built on those gains, but the rally faded in Hong Kong. A key factor dragging on the economy is a lack of consumer and business demand, and easing lending conditions will not necessarily change that, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report, adding that todays moves are no substitute for an expansion in fiscal support.",https://apnews.com/article/china-interest-rate-cut-trump-tariffs-economy-af53caf9d5e41b41423d085faa6c7514,business
Federal Reserve leaves key rate unchanged as it sees risk of higher prices and higher unemployment,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday, brushing off President Donald Trumps demands to lower borrowing costs, and said that the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen, an unusual combination that puts the central bank in a difficult spot.  The Fed kept its rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year. Many economists and Wall Street investors still expect the Fed will reduce rates this year, but the sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump have injected a tremendous amount of uncertainty into the U.S. economy and the central banks policies. During a press conference after the release of the policy statement, Chair Jerome Powell underscored that the tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but have yet to noticeably harm the economy. At the moment, Powell said, theres too much uncertainty to say how the Fed should react to the duties. If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, theyre likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and a rise in unemployment, Powell said. The impacts could be temporary, or more persistent, he added.  Theres just so much that we dont know, he added. Were in a good position to wait and see. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the Federal Reserve is leaving its key interest unchanged for a third straight meeting. It is unusual for the Fed to face the risk of both higher prices and more unemployment. Typically, rising inflation occurs when consumers are spending freely and businesses, unable to meet all the resulting demand, raise their prices instead, as happened after the pandemic. Meanwhile, increasing unemployment occurs in a weaker economy, which usually slows spending and cools inflation.  
        
     
        
     A combination of both higher unemployment and steeper inflation is often referred to as stagflation and strikes fear in the hearts of central bankers, because it is hard for them to address both challenges. It last occurred on a sustained basis during the oil shocks and recessions of the 1970s. Most economists say, however, that Trumps sweeping tariffs do pose the threat of stagflation. The import taxes could both lift inflation by making imported parts and finished goods more expensive, while also raising unemployment by causing companies to cut jobs as their costs rise.  The Feds goals are to keep prices stable and maximize employment. Typically, when inflation rises, the Fed raises rates to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation, while if layoffs rise, it would cut rates to spur more spending and growth.  At the beginning of the year, analysts and investors expected the Fed would reduce its key rate two or three times this year, as the inflation spike that followed the pandemic continued to cool. Some economists also think the Fed should cut in anticipation of slower growth and worsening unemployment from the tariffs. But Powell was adamant that with the economy in good shape for now, the Fed can stay on the sidelines.  Several months ago, many analysts also expected the economy would achieve a soft landing, in which inflation would finally drop back to its target of 2%, while unemployment would stay low amid solid growth.  Yet on Wednesday Powell said that was less likely to be achieved.  If the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels ... then we wont see further progress toward our goals, Powell said. At least for the next, lets say, year, we would not be making progress toward those goals -- again, if thats the way the tariffs shake out. Powell also said the Feds next move will depend in part on which indicator worsens the most: inflation or unemployment. Depending on how things play out, it could include rate cuts, it could include us holding where we are, we just need to see how things play out before we make those decisions, he said.  Krishna Guha, an analyst at EvercoreISI, said the Feds assessment of current conditions likely pushes back the timetable for a rate cut. The combination of the two-sided risk assessment and the characterization of the economy as solid suggest the (Fed) is not looking to tee up a June cut at this juncture. Many economists think the Fed may not be ready to cut until September. Trump announced sweeping tariffs against about 60 U.S. trading partners in April, then paused most of them for 90 days, with the exception of duties against China. The administration has subjected goods from China to a 145% tariff. The two sides are scheduled to hold their first high-level talks since Trump launched his trade war this weekend in Switzerland.  The central banks caution could lead to more conflict between the Fed and the Trump administration. On Sunday, Trump again urged the Fed to cut rates in a television interview. Trump has backed off threats to try to fire Powell, but could reconsider if the economy stumbles in the coming months. Asked at the press conference whether Trumps calls for lower rates has any influence on the Fed, Powell said, (It) doesnt affect doing our job at all. Were always going to consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks, and thats it. If the Fed were to cut rates, it could lower other borrowing costs, such as for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, though that is not guaranteed.  A big issue facing the Fed is how tariffs will impact inflation. Nearly all economists and Fed officials expect the import taxes will lift prices, but its not clear by how much or for how long. Tariffs typically cause a one-time increase in prices, but not necessarily ongoing inflation.  For now, the U.S. economy is mostly in solid shape, and inflation has cooled considerably from its peak in 2022. Consumers are spending at a healthy pace, though some of that may reflect buying things like cars ahead of tariffs. Businesses are still adding workers at a steady pace, and unemployment is low.  Still, there are signs inflation will worsen in the coming months. Surveys of both manufacturing and services firms show that they are seeing higher prices from their suppliers. And a survey by the Federal Reserves Dallas branch found that nearly 55% of manufacturing firms expect to pass on the impact of tariff increases to their customers.  ___  AP Business Writer Alex Veiga in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-powell-rate-inflation-tariff-7b96cf47c986602db51ce87055ca5f24,business
Maryland board OKs plan to start demolition to rebuild Pimlico Race Course shortly after Preakness,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP)  A Maryland board approved a $14.3 million contract on Wednesday to begin the demolition and rebuilding of Baltimores storied but antiquated Pimlico Race Course, home to the second jewel of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.  The vote by the three-member Board of Public Works, which includes Gov. Wes Moore, was made 10 days before the 150th Preakness Stakes, which is scheduled for May 17. It will be the last time the annual horse race will be held with the existing structures in place before the track is rebuilt on the same site. The demolition will begin shortly after this years race. There cannot be a better time to announce the beginning of a transformation that will allow Pimlico to become a year-round hub for economic activity within the Park Heights community, Moore said of the Baltimore neighborhood and longtime home of the race. Under the plan, the Preakness will take place in Laurel Park, located just southwest of Baltimore, in 2026 while the new facility is built, before returning to Pimlico in time for the 2027 race.  Craig Thompson, the chair of the Maryland Stadium Authority which is overseeing the design of the new track, said the plan is to make Pimlico the home of Maryland thoroughbred racing. The track will go from hosting about 15 races a year to well over 100, Thompson said. This is more than just about a racetrack, as historic and important as it is, Thompson said. This is about bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in state investments to Park Heights. 
        
     Thompson also shared a preview of the design plans. They include a new clubhouse with architecture inspired by the Rawlings Conservatory in Baltimores Druid Hill park and the original Pimlico Clubhouse, which included a colonnade and rooftop balconies, Thompson said.  Last year, the board approved a deal to transfer ownership of Pimlico from The Stronach Group to the State of Maryland in order to ensure the Preakness remains in Baltimore. The state has been wrestling with what to do to restore the old racetrack for decades. Aptly nicknamed Old Hilltop, the track opened in 1870. Its where Man o War, Seabiscuit, Secretariat and many others pranced to the winners circle. But its age has long been a concern. In 2019, the Maryland Jockey Club closed off nearly 7,000 grandstand seats, citing the safety and security of all guests and employees.  The horse racing industry and other equine industries have been a cornerstone of Maryland agriculture, as well as an integral part of preserving green space.",https://apnews.com/article/preakness-pimlico-horse-race-course-demolition-rebuild-91f4ff91d019f380bf7062b153ee9390,business
"California regulator weakens AI rules, giving Big Tech more leeway to track you","Californias first-in-the-nation privacy agency is retreating from an attempt to regulate artificial intelligence and other forms of computer automation. The California Privacy Protection Agency was under pressure to back away from rules it drafted. Business groups, lawmakers, and Gov. Gavin Newsom said they would be costly to businesses, potentially stifle innovation, and usurp the authority of the legislature, where proposed AI regulations have proliferated. In a unanimous vote last week, the agencys board watered down the rules, which impose safeguards on AI-like systems. Agency staff estimate that the changes reduce the cost for businesses to comply in the first year of enforcement from $834 million to $143 million and predict that 90% percent of businesses initially required to comply will no longer have to do so. The retreat marks an important turn in an ongoing and heated debate over the boards role. Created following the passage of state privacy legislation by lawmakers in 2018 and voters in 2020, the agency is the only body of its kind in the United States.  The draft rules have been in the works for more than three years, but were revisited after a series of changes at the agency in recent months, including the departure of two leaders seen as pro-consumer, including Vinhcent Le, a board member who led the AI rules drafting process, and Ashkan Soltani, the agencys executive director. Consumer advocacy groups worry that the recent shifts mean the agency is deferring excessively to businesses, particularly tech giants. 
        
     The changes approved last week mean the agencys draft rules no longer regulate behavioral advertising, which targets people based on profiles built up from their online activity and personal information. In a prior draft of the rules, businesses would have had to conduct risk assessments before using or implementing such advertising. Behavioral advertising is used by companies like Google, Meta, and TikTok and their business clients. It can perpetuate inequality, pose a threat to national security, and put children at risk.  The revised draft rules also eliminate use of the phrase artificial intelligence and narrow the range of business activity regulated as automated decisionmaking, which also requires assessments of the risks in processing personal information and the safeguards put in place to mitigate them. Supporters of stronger rules say the narrower definition of automated decisionmaking allows employers and corporations to opt out of the rules by claiming that an algorithmic tool is only advisory to human decision making. My one concern is that if were just calling on industry to identify what a risk assessment looks like in practice, we could reach a position by which theyre writing the exam by which theyre graded, said board member Brandie Nonnecke during the meeting. The CPPA is charged with protecting the data privacy of Californians, and watering down its proposed rules to benefit Big Tech does nothing to achieve that goal, said Sacha Haworth, executive director of Tech Oversight Project, an advocacy group focused on challenging policy that reinforces Big Tech power, said in a statement to CalMatters. By the time these rules are published, what will have been the point? The draft rules retain some protections for workers and students in instances when a fully automated system determines outcomes in finance and lending services, housing, and health care without a human in the decisionmaking loop. Businesses and the organizations that represent them made up 90% of comments about the draft rules before the agency held listening sessions across the state last year, Soltani said in a meeting last year. In April, following pressure from business groups and legislators to weaken the rules, a coalition of nearly 30 unions, digital rights, and privacy groups wrote a letter together urging the agency to continue work to regulate AI and protect consumers, students, and workers.  Roughly a week later, Gov. Newsom intervened, sending the agency a letter stating that he agreed with critics that the rules overstepped the agencys authority and supported a proposal to roll them back. Newsom cited Proposition 24, the 2020 ballot measure that paved the way for the agency. The agency can fulfill its obligations to issue the regulations called for by Proposition 24 without venturing into areas beyond its mandate, the governor wrote. The original draft rules were great, said Kara Williams, a law fellow at the advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center. On a phone call ahead of the vote, she added that with each iteration theyve gotten weaker and weaker, and that seems to correlate pretty directly with pressure from the tech industry and trade association groups so that these regulations are less and less protective for consumers. The public has until June 2 to comment on the alteration to draft rules. Companies must comply with automated decisionmaking rules by 2027. Prior to voting to water down its own regulation last week, at the same meeting the agency board voted to throw its support behind four draft bills in the California Legislature, including one that protects the privacy of people who connect computing devices to their brain and another that prohibits the collection of location data without permission. ___ This story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",https://apnews.com/us-news/gavin-newsom-california-artificial-intelligence-privacy-general-news-9af726479bf65d2b183e88eb985e36d9,business
Washington governor signs rent-control bill into law,"Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a bill into law Wednesday that sets limits on rent increases, making the state among the first in the nation to provide protections for tenants. The rent stabilization measure, House Bill 1217, adds Washington to states like Oregon and California that have sought new ways to curb homelessness.  Bill sponsor Sen. Emily Alvarado, a West Seattle Democrat, said the measure sets common-sense guardrails on the states rental-housing market so that hardworking families and older adults dont get unchecked excessive rent increases. Housing is not a luxury. Its a basic human need, Alvarado said at the bill signing. And everyone in this state deserves a stable and affordable home. The measure caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10%  whichever is lower. The restrictions include single-family homes. The rent-increase cap for manufactured homes is 5%. Lawmakers approved the plan on a 54-44 vote, with five Democrats joining the Republican opposition.  Ferguson praised Alvarado and the many advocates across the state who worked hard to get the bill passed.  It almost didnt make it.  It successfully moved through both houses, but two amendments added on the Senate floor sent it into a conference committee. Those amendments increased the cap from 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted single-family homes. Opponents of the bill argued that developers would leave the state if it became law and said similar policies in Oregon and California added to those states financial burdens instead of slowing the homeless crisis. 
        
     Oregons rent-control bill was passed in 2019 and later updated to cap rent increases at either 7% plus the annual 12-month average change in the consumer price index for the U.S. West, or 10%  whichever is lower. The conference committee got the cap down to 7% plus inflation or 10%  whichever is lower, and restored protections for the 38% of renters who live in single-family homes. With Fergusons signature, its now law. This law is a good beginning. Its long overdue and its urgently needed, Alvarado said. Forty percent of the people in the state of Washington are renters or manufactured homeowners and before today they had no protections over how high the rent can go, leading to pain and to devastating destabilization of families and communities. Ferguson also signed nine other bills to help homeowners and renters. He said when he campaigned for governor, affordable housing was the top issue voters raised, so he supports bills to help make it easier to secure housing. Lets make this the session of affordable housing, he said before signing the first measure.  The other measures included limits on certain provisions in rental agreements, notices for mobile home communities, and property tax relief for disabled veterans.",https://apnews.com/article/rent-control-homeless-rent-79008acf2e1641fda3b05f644903d73c,business
How a Chinese delicacy got caught in the crossfire of Trumps trade war,"SUQUAMISH, Wash. (AP)  For over two decades, Suquamish tribal member Joshua George has dived into the emerald waters of the Salish Sea looking for an unusually phallic clam thats coveted thousands of miles away. George is a geoduck diver. Pronounced gooey-duck, the worlds largest burrowing clam has been harvested in tidelands by Georges Indigenous ancestors in the Pacific Northwest since before Europeans arrived.  In recent years it has also become a delicacy in China, with Washington state sending 90% of its geoducks there, creating a niche yet lucrative American seafood export.  But the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is now crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks, leaving Washington state divers without work, Seattle exporters without business and Chinese aficionados with fewer of these prized clams.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) Suquamish Seafoods diver Joshua George returns to the F/V Carriere on April 21, 2025, after a sample harvest of geoducks to send in for testing on the waters of Puget Sound near Suquamish, Washington. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) Its the first time in 24 years where I dont know when or if well be going back to work or if I have to find another job or what were going to do, George said. U.S. President Donald Trumps tariff-driven economic feud with China, which dates back to his first term in office, swiftly resumed in February within weeks of taking back the White House. By April, Trump had placed tariffs of at least 145% on China, which led China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S. Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since the latest tariffs were imposed, but it is unclear where those talks will lead.  
        
     Enter the geoduck, weighing about 2 pounds and so entrenched in local culture that it is the mascot for Evergreen State College in Olympia. The meaty mollusk is best described as sweet and briny, and its often sliced raw for crisp sashimi out west while China consumers prefer it chewy in stir-fries or hot pot soups. Pre-tariff costs were as high as $100 per pound in restaurants, so its a dish generally reserved for special occasions like Chinese New Year, or to celebrate a business gathering. Unlike other products with long-lasting shelf life and standing inventory, the trade war has had an immediate, direct effect on the delicate geoducks, which are shipped alive the same day of harvest. The whole market, everybody just had to stop, said Jim Boure, general manager of Suquamish Seafoods, an enterprise of the Suquamish Tribe. We started getting phone calls from buyers saying orders are canceled.

       The millions of pounds of geoducks shipped annually to China come from two main sources: wild harvests on tracts of seafloor that are split between the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and Puget Sound Treaty Indian Tribes, and tideland farms. The states share is auctioned to private exporters that often hire contract divers to harvest them.  As of late April, Washington state divers had only pulled about half of the expected harvest from the state tracts, said Blain Reeves, an aquatic resources division manager for the states Department of Natural Resources. Last year, the state and tribes collectively harvested about 3.4 million pounds of wild Washington geoduck for sale. The state generated $22.4 million in revenue for their half of the clams, which went toward paying for aquatic restoration projects locally. The state doesnt track how much is harvested by private farmers.  If only half the pounds that were contracted are harvested, then our revenue is halved, Reeves said. The Suquamish operation has no orders to harvest for at the moment, but it still must keep up with the maintenance to stay ready for business if and when China comes calling.  On a recent April day, Georges team made a quick trip to collect a handful of the clams for state lab testing. When were doing the job, and its not all this other political stuff behind the scenes and everything else, we love this, said George, adding that diving, which takes place early in the day so that the geoducks are on an airplane by evening, has allowed him to watch his kids grow up.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Fellow diver Kyle Purser said he cherishes his underwater job, but now fears its being taken away.  When youre watching your money disappear and youve got families to feed and not knowing when youre going to get your next paycheck, (its) very stressful, he said.   The geoduck import market was already facing weaker demand in recent years due to the Chinese economys struggle to regain post-pandemic momentum. While the tariffs have only exacerbated troubles for geoduck sellers in Washington, theres also been an unintended consequence: The American trade war has inadvertently boosted the Canadian geoduck business, which is facing a mere 25% tariff from China in comparison to the 125% for the U.S. Washington state in the U.S. and Canadas British Columbia province are the two primary places where the wild geoducks grow naturally for commercial harvest. The two countries did healthy business primarily serving Chinese appetites for decades, in part because quantities are limited. Its a labor-intensive and heavily-regulated harvest, as divers must go several feet below the surface to dig for them. They love the fact that it tastes like the sea, said James Austin, president of Canadas Underwater Harvesters Association. Its a product thats really a hit with the Chinese. Its all about the wild coastline. Its really prestigious. Two whole geoducks, left, are displayed with a sashimi preparation of the clam at right, at Chelsea Farms Oyster Bar in Olympia, Washington.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) Austin said he expects there will be 2.75 million pounds of Canadian geoducks harvested in 2025, worth approximately $60 million Canadian dollars ($43.4 million USD) in revenue.  While demand has been relatively low but still steady for Canadians geoducks, Austin said theyre now the leading exporters for China, which has helped them negotiate higher prices as a result. For example, after Canada got hit with a 25% tariff in March, export sale prices dropped to $12 per pound, and after the U.S. got hit with a 125% tariff in April, Canadian geoducks are now being sold for $17 a pound. We have no competitors right now, Austin said.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) We dont care about U.S. tariffs because we can get geoduck from other countries with stable prices, Yang said.  On their first week back to work since the tariff fight brought business to a standstill in Washington state, Derrick McRae and his brother pulled up about 800 pounds of wild geoducks in just one April day.  He donned a full-body diving outfit with an oxygen line tethered to his boat to dive under the cold waters of an inland sea channel west of Seattle. Kneeled on the seafloor, McRae used a water spray gun to move the sand covering the geoducks. In the cloud of sediment, he felt for the neck with his hand, pulling the clam and stuffing it in a net attached to him.  Were just kind of waiting on the edge of our seats to see what happens next, McRae said.  At one of the southernmost inlets, farmer Ian Child said the tariff disruption is not just hurting his bottom line but the entire farming process. He usually places young geoducks in the sand in the summer, but he cant mix new crops with any existing unharvested clams. I think that the demand is still over there for the product, he said of China. I think they still want it. Its just a matter of where the tariffs will land.  ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed from Beijing.",https://apnews.com/article/geoducks-china-us-tariffs-economy-849c8052fd0e679fa421c48d32ed1bc7,business

Long-haul carrier Emirates reports record profit of $5.2 billion as staff get 22-weeks pay as bonus,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Long-haul carrier Emirates reported on Thursday that it earned annual profits of $5.2 billion, with the state-owned firm declaring itself the worlds most profitable airline as global aviation fully returned to flight after the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The profits came as the Dubai-based carrier served 53.7 million passengers out of its hub of Dubai International Airport, compared to 51.9 million passengers in the fiscal year prior. It had aftertax profits of $4.7 billion that same period.  The overall Emirates Group, owned by Dubais sovereign wealth fund known as the Investment Corporation of Dubai, saw annual profits of $5.6 billion, compared to $5.1 billion the year before.  Our excellent financial standing enables us to continue building on and scaling up from our successful business models, said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktom, Emirates chairman and chief executive.  While some markets are jittery about trade and travel restrictions, volatility is not new in our industry, he said. We simply adapt and navigate around these challenges.  About 121,000 workers at the overall Emirates Group separately received word theyd receive a bonus worth 22 weeks of their annual salary. In 2024, they received a 20-weeks bonus. Emirates financial year runs from April 1 to March 31, including revenue from both 2024 and 2025. This past fiscal year marked the first for the company to be charged with the United Arab Emirates new corporate tax of 9%. 
        
     The carrier had revenues of $34.9 billion, compared to $33 billion the year prior. Those revenues put it behind other private carriers, like Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., which led the industry with revenue of $61.6 billion last year.  However, Emirates $5.2 billion in profit put it to the front of the pack. Emirates operates hand-in-glove with Dubai International Airport, flying at all hours from a hub in a country where unions are illegal. Falling crude oil prices also aids its profits, like other airlines.  The carrier said its 260 aircraft fly to 148 locations around the world. It has long relied on the Boeing 777 and the double-decker Airbus A380, though it has also begun introducing the Airbus A350 to its schedule. Its undertaking a multibillion-dollar retrofitting campaign for its aircraft and says it doesnt expect its first Boeing 777-9 until 2027. Emirates serves as a crucial link in East-West travel and is the crown jewel of what experts and diplomats refer to as Dubai Inc.  a series of interconnected companies overseen by the sheikhdoms ruling Al Maktoum family. The Emirates Group accounts for around 15% of Dubais entire gross domestic product in 2023, and includes coffee shops, restaurants, liquor sales and other industries. Emirates is not just a transport company; it is a tool for economic transformation for the UAE, a strategic bridge connecting the worlds continents and a developmental carrier flying us through the skies toward the future, wrote Dubais ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, on the social platform X. The Emirates results track with those for its base, Dubai International Airport. The worlds busiest airport for international travelers had a record 92.3 million passengers pass through its terminals in 2024.  The airport now plans to move to the city-states second, sprawling airfield in its southern desert reaches in the next decade in a project worth nearly $35 billion. A real-estate boom and the citys highest-ever tourism numbers have made Dubai a destination as well as a layover. However, the city is now grappling with increasing traffic and costs, pressuring both its Emirati citizens and the foreign residents who power its economy. As one of seven hereditarily ruled, autocratic sheikhdoms that make up the UAE, Dubai provided Emirates with around $4 billion in a bailout at the height of the pandemic. In its report on Thursday, Emirates said that it had repaid $3.6 billion of that loan.",https://apnews.com/article/dubai-carrier-earns-emirates-2ec4571f18189fc039dc6db4665533ae,business
Toyota reports booming sales but stays cautious on profit because of various costs,"TOKYO (AP)  Japans top automaker Toyota reported record sales for the fiscal year through March on Thursday, but its profit for the latest quarter faltered partly because of a certification scandal. Toyota Motor Corp.s January-March net profit totaled 664.6 billion yen ($4.6 billion), down from 997.6 billion yen the same period a year ago. Quarterly sales totaled 12.36 trillion yen ($85.9 billion), up from 11 trillion yen. Toyota has been strengthening the testing system of its vehicles after acknowledging wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. Akio Toyoda, Toyotas chairman and the grandson of the automakers founder, has apologized. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of vehicles already on roads, which include the popular Corolla subcompact and Lexus luxury vehicles. But the scandal has been a major embarrassment for a manufacturer whose brand has been synonymous for decades with quality and attention to detail. For the fiscal year through March, Toyota reported a 4.77 trillion yen ($33 billion) profit, down from 4.94 trillion yen the previous fiscal year. Annual sales reached a record 48 trillion yen ($333.6 billion), up from 45 trillion yen. Toyota is forecasting sales of 48.5 trillion yen ($337 billion) for the fiscal year through March 2026. 
        
     Its profit forecast was less bullish, citing costs to meet carbon neutrality demands, as well as the impact of President Donald Trumps U.S. tariffs on operating income, which was factored in tentatively at 180 billion yen ($1.3 billion), according to Toyota. That estimate covers April and May, meaning it could grow in coming months.  Consolidated vehicle sales for the fiscal year through March totaled 9.36 million vehicles, down slightly from 9.44 million vehicles the previous fiscal year. Cost reduction and marketing efforts worked as pluses countering the negatives, including the production shutdown spanning several months in the U.S. due to quality issues, Toyota officials said. Toyota also said the portion of electric vehicles it was selling was steadily growing. Sometimes Toyota has been criticized as falling behind in the global move toward EVs, partly because it has an extensive lineup of other kinds of green cars, including hybrids. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama",https://apnews.com/article/toyota-automaker-financials-sales-evs-japan-d3d473cfd03dfd04b487771ca20d14ad,business
"Yes, New Zealand still has more sheep than people. But humans are catching up","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)  The vast number of sheep in New Zealand relative to the countrys scant human population has long been the subject of jokes aimed at New Zealanders abroad. Its true: The country is one of a handful in the world thats still home to more sheep than people. But humans are catching up, according to new figures released Tuesday. With a population of 23.6 million sheep and 5.3 million people, there are about 4.5 sheep for each New Zealander, government statistics agency data showed. Thats down from 22 sheep per person in 1982, when farming sheep for meat and wool was New Zealands biggest earner. Now, years of falling wool prices prompted by a global shift to synthetic fibers have led farmers to change what they do with their land, the sectors biggest lobby group said. By land area, New Zealand is about the size of the United Kingdom, but it has a human population 13 times smaller than the U.K. That means theres plenty of room for sheep. For close to 150 years, the sheep industry was the backbone of New Zealands economy and numbers boomed  peaking in 1982 when there were more than 70 million sheep and just 3.2 million people. Before Lord of the Rings brought waves of tourists to the country, images of green fields filled with placid sheep against backdrops of snow-capped mountains dominated the countrys marketing abroad. But over years of decline for global wool prices since  and despite recent rallies  the national flock has steadily diminished. Now dairy holds the biggest share of New Zealands agriculture and horticulture-dominant export market. 
        
     In 2023, Stats NZ, a government agency, said New Zealand in 2022 dipped below five sheep per person for the first time. The national flock had lost a million more sheep in Tuesdays figures, which recorded livestock numbers as of June 2024. Toby Williams, a spokesperson for sector lobby group Federated Farmers, said sheep farmers have switched to more lucrative pursuits  dairy, or the conversion of land from farming to pine forestry in order to sell carbon offsets. If Im really honest, the wool industry is almost at that tipping point, if not already there, of not having a wool industry anymore, he said. The government has drawn up measures intended to slow the decline, including an announcement in 2024 that they will place limits on the scale of farmland that can be converted to carbon forestry. New government procurement guidelines launched in April urge the use of New Zealand wool products  such as carpets and insulation  in newly constructed or refurbished public buildings. But those measures are not expected to halt declining sheep numbers. Some sheep-farming countries are recording similar trends. New Zealands closest neighbor Australia  the source of most of the sheep jokes about New Zealanders  is also home to more sheep than people, but the national flock is shrinking there too. The gap is slimmer: There are about three sheep per Australian.",https://apnews.com/article/zealand-sheep-people-ratio-farming-wool-prices-cfd80216b660dd3a7c2e8408a98dab53,business
Nintendo promises stronger results with Switch 2 console going on sale in June,"TOKYO (AP)  Japanese video-game maker Nintendo on Thursday reported a 43% decline in profit for the fiscal year through March, but promised a turnaround as its Switch console upgrade goes on sale in June. Nintendo Co.s profit for the fiscal year through March totaled 278.8 billion yen ($1.9 billion), down from 490 billion yen the previous fiscal year. Annual sales slipped 30% to 1.16 trillion yen ($8 billion) from 1.67 trillion yen, according to the Kyoto-based maker of the Super Mario and Donkey Kong games. The fortunes of game companies tend to decline somewhat as time passes after a new game machine goes on sale since many people have already bought the machine, although new hit software helps boost the results. Much anticipation has been building over the rollout of the so-called Switch 2, which goes on sale June 5. Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026. Demand has dwindled for the current Switch, now in its eighth year after its debut. The number of Switch players around the world remains above 128 million people, according to Nintendo. Nintendo said attractive software was coming for the Switch 2 later this year, including The Legend of Zelda games, a Pokemon title and a Kirby game, as well as offerings from outside software companies. Also adding to the momentum is the opening of a Nintendo store in San Francisco and the Super Nintendo World amusement facility opening in Orlando, both set for this month, according to Nintendo. Nintendo is projecting a 300 billion yen ($2.1 billion) profit for the fiscal year ending in March next year, a nearly 8% improvement from the fiscal year just ended, on sales of 1.9 trillion yen ($13 billion), up 63% on-year. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama",https://apnews.com/article/nintendo-mario-japan-games-entertainment-console-7fb2773d7119f14f6c24ecb4580f51d5,business
"From Oval Office blowout to landmark minerals deal, how Ukraines diplomacy unfolded","KYIV, Ukraine (AP)  Last fall, weeks before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy floated a pitch that proposed, among other things,an economic deal that would allow Washington access to Ukraines largely untapped minerals and deepen strategic ties.  Under pressure from Western allies and amid global war fatigue, Zelenskyy saw that the days of Biden administration-era robust military aid might be numbered, and so the pitch was part of the Ukrainian leaders so-called victory plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It was an offer that would appeal to Trumps penchant for transactions-based diplomacy in hopes of ensuring a steady flow of future American support in return.  Seven months later, a landmark deal between Ukraine and the Trump administration on Ukraines mineral resources was inked. But the road in between was paved with mutual recriminations, a historic Oval Office blowout, hundreds of revisions, and finally, a chance meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis funeral. Despite last-minute snags, Ukraine secured a deal thats set to bring closer ties with the U.S. and provide a vehicle for future military assistance. Ukraines parliament voted unanimously to ratify the agreement on Thursday, and other documents pertaining to the deal are being finalized. It seems to me that this is the first time in history that the United States considers Ukraine as a long-term strategic partner, economically, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko told a media briefing in Kyiv on Thursday ahead of the parliament vote.  Heres a timeline of the deals conception and signing:  In response to rising pressure from Western allies and clear battlefield disadvantages, Zelenskyy outlined a so-called victory plan to end the war. The plan sought to strengthen Kyivs negotiating hand and proposed measures to boost its military potential, but also economic partnerships with Western allies. Ukraine is rich in natural resources, including critically important metals such as uranium, titanium, lithium, and graphite. Zelenskyy pitched the plan to the White House during a visit to Washington in late September, and later in a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower in New York.  Giving American companies preferential access to Ukraine would serve as leverage against Russia as most mineral deposits are located very close to front-line areas. Having U.S. companies on the ground, the thinking goes, would cement Washingtons interests in Ukraine and serve as a de facto security guarantee. Critical minerals used to manufacture weapons, aviation and batteries would also give the U.S. access to reserves in a global market dominated by China. Trump appeared captivated by the idea and very soon after his inauguration in January started touting the idea of getting Ukraines rare earth elements. By February, the White House and Ukraine appear to have made significant progress toward reaching an agreement that would provide the U.S. with access to Ukraines rare earth minerals.  On Feb. 12, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent became the first senior Trump administration official to visit Kyiv. Zelenskyy was expected to sign the deal that day amid a push by Washington quickly end the war. But the Ukrainian president decline d, saying elements of the draft didnt align with his countrys constitution. The deal would have given the U.S. 50% rights to Ukraines minerals and mentioned nothing of security guarantees.  I didnt let the ministers sign  because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest, Zelenskyy told The Associated Press at the Munich Security Conference in February.  Bessent later said that Zelenskyy blew up the deal. Zelenskyy shot back, saying Bessents approach had been disrespectful. My colleagues know that if someone taps their finger on an agreement and says, You must sign now  I could only say to him, Stop tapping your finger and lets have a proper conversation, Zelenskyy later told reporters. The two sides agreed to a new draft later in February. On Feb. 28, Zelenskyy arrived in Washington with the intention of signing the revised version of the deal. But Zelenskyy insists on adding explicit U.S. security guarantees to it, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldnt be trusted to comply with a ceasefire deal. A shouting match breaks out in the Oval Office, and Trump berates the Ukrainian president for not demonstrating gratitude for American support. Youre not in a good position. You dont have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards, Trump shouted. Zelenskyy left the White House with no deal and a deeply uncertain future with Washington. Shortly after, the U.S. pauses military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine. According to multiple Ukrainian and Western officials, results from ceasefire talks between Ukrainian and U.S. delegates in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 marked a turning point after the disastrous Oval Office meeting. Ukraine agrees to a U.S. proposal for a full and immediate 30-day ceasefire, pending approval by the Kremlin, which had so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict without accepting any concessions. By piling conditions on both proposals for both full and partial ceasefires, Putin began testing Trumps patience. Meanwhile, technical discussions over the minerals deal resume. But the Trump administration introduced a new clause demanding that Ukraine reimburse the full amount of U.S. aid provided since the start of the full-scale invasion. Trump mentions a $500 billion figure as compensation, an amount many times more than the sum of aid provided. Ukrainian officials continue lobbying for a more equitable structure that respects Ukraines strategic interests and state sovereignty. Zelenskyy spells out three core principles: The creation of a joint investment fund, 50-50 governance and the exclusion of debt repayment. Intensive negotiations continue, requiring Ukrainian and U.S. officials to work across time zones. Each day ushers in proposals and counterproposals. There were likely hundreds of revisions and dozens of draft revisions, a senior European official close to the talks said. Every morning meant a new batch of edits for each side. Svyrydenko said on April 18 that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent before a possible fuller agreement later. A draft, dated April 17 and obtained by the AP, called for creating a joint U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, incorporated as a partnership in Delaware. The draft document was a version marked up by the United States and showed that the Trump administration could be willing to cede on some demands that Ukraine opposed. The draft was notable because it called for the U.S. to make a significant initial cash investment in the fund, in addition to receiving credit in the form of equity that is equivalent to the billions in U.S. military assistance already spent. Earlier versions had the U.S. investing no additional capital in Ukraine while having exclusive rights to the countrys natural resources. A breakthrough moment came on April 26 in the form of a tete-a-tete between Trump and Zelenskyy in St. Peters Basilica at the sidelines of Pope Francis funeral. Zelenskyy described it as a turning point and the best conversation the two leaders have had to date.  The exchange paved the way for the signing of the minerals deal in Washington four days later, he said. In the end, Zelenskyy didnt get explicit security guarantees as part of the deal. Still, the final agreement was considered a victory for Ukraine after months of diplomatic work.  The signed deal crucially doesnt call for Kyiv to reimburse the U.S. for the aid it has already received  a concession from Trump. That concession was  That concession was extracted after Ukrainians argued that recognizing past aid as debt retrospectively would go against agreements that Ukraine has made to obtain that aid with the U.S., European Union, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka said. Instead, Ukrainians argued for future military assistance to count as part of investment into the fund.  Bessent acknowledged that the agreement was a tacit security guarantee because of the economic partnership.  Ukraines Parliament votes unanimously in favor of ratifying the minerals agreement with the U.S., setting the deal in motion.  ___ Illia Novikov in Kyiv, and Matthew Lee and Byron Tau in Washington, contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-mineral-deal-timeline-c2b95464127d4d0327a9088e116e9f47,business
India suspends flight operations and closes 24 airports as Pakistan resumes flights nationwide,"NEW DELHI (AP)  Airlines in India have suspended flight operations from two dozen airports across northern and western regions of the country amid heightened tensions with Pakistan. Indias Civil Aviation Ministry late Thursday confirmed in a statement the temporary closure of 24 airports.  Pakistan, meanwhile, resumed flights nationwide after a suspension at four airports, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. In advisories to passengers, Indias key domestic airlines said their flights would remain suspended until Saturday from airports including Amritsar in northern Punjab and Srinagar in India-controlled Kashmir, bordering Pakistan. Indigo, the countrys biggest domestic carrier, on Wednesday canceled 165 flights, while Air India and Air India Express had a similar number of cancellations. Air India diverted two of its international flights enroute from Amritsar, close to Lahore, to New Delhi, because of the sudden closure of the airport. India and Pakistan are teetering on the edge of a fresh military crisis after New Delhi launched missile strikes inside Pakistani territory Wednesday, targeting what it called terror training camps to avenge last months massacre of 26 Indian tourists in India-controlled Kashmir. India blames Pakistan for backing the gunmen, an accusation that Islamabad denies. Soon after the killings, the two countries swiftly moved to close their respective airspace last month, and India has shut some of its airports. The cancellation of flights has resulted in woes for passengers. 
        
     Rahul, a 32-year-old Indian businessman who goes by a single name, said his flight from Dubai to Chandigarh was canceld on Wednesday after closure of the Indian airport.

GOP centrists revolt against steep cuts to Medicaid and other programs in Trumps tax breaks bill,"WASHINGTON (AP)  When it comes to Medicaid, Rep. Juan Ciscomani is telling fellow Republicans he wont support steep cuts that could hit thousands of residents in his Arizona district  my neighbors, people my kids go to school with  who depend on it. Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the liberal-leaning blue dot of Omaha, Nebraska, is trying to protect several Biden-era green energy tax breaks. Hes warning colleagues that you cant pull the rug out from under businesses that have already sunk millions of dollars into renewable developments in Nebraska and beyond. And for Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, its simple: No Salt. No Deal. For Real. He wants to revive  and bump up  whats known as the SALT deduction, which allows taxpayers to write off a portion of their state and local taxes. Capping the deduction at $10,000 hurt many of his Long Island constituents. Governing is a negotiation, right? said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, another Republican who is also involved in the talks. I think everybody is going to have to give a little. As GOP leaders draft President Donald Trumps big, beautiful bill of some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $1.5 trillion in spending cuts by Memorial Day, dozens of Republicans from contested congressional districts have positioned themselves at the center of the negotiating table. While its often the most conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus driving the legislative agenda  and they are demanding as much as $2 trillion in cuts  its the more centrist-leaning conservatives who could sink the bill. They have been hauled into meetings with Trump at the White House, some have journeyed to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and many are huddling almost daily with House Speaker Mike Johnson. 
        
     And they are not satisfied, yet. To get everybody politically and policy-wise on the same page is going to require more conversations, said LaLota, who is among five Republicans pledging to withhold their support unless changes to the SALT deduction are included. Diving into the gritty details of the massive package, the GOP leaders are running into the stubborn reality that not all the ideas from their menu of potential tax breaks and spending cuts are popular with voters back home. Moreover, their work of compiling the big package is not happening in a vacuum. It comes amid growing economic unease rippling across the country as Trump has fired thousands of federal workers, including some of their own constituents, and as his trade war sparks concerns of empty store shelves and higher prices. Brendan Buck, a former adviser to an earlier House speaker, Paul Ryan, warned in an op-ed Wednesday that all the partys energy is being poured into one bill, with questionable returns.  Many Republicans are hoping that the tax bill can blunt the economic damage caused by the Trump tariffs, Buck wrote in The New York Times, but that is highly unlikely. Democrats are ready for the fight, warning that Trump and his fellow Republicans are ripping away health care and driving the economy into the ditch  all to retain tax breaks approved during Trumps first term that are expiring at years end. What we see from Donald Trump and the Republicans is they are actually crashing the economy in real time, said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Why, the Democratic leader asked, are Republicans jumping through hoops to try to reduce Medicaid and food stamps used by millions of Americans?  Its all in service of enacting massive tax breaks for their millionaire donors like Elon Musk, he said.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Johnson has projected a calm confidence, insisting that House Republicans are on track to deliver on Trumps agenda. The speakers office has become a waystation with a revolving door of Republicans privately laboring to piece together the massive package. So far, GOP leaders have signaled they are walking away from some, but not all, of the steep Medicaid cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the proposals could result in millions of people losing their coverage. Instead, what appears to still be on the table are tougher work requirements for those receiving Medicaid and food stamp assistance and more frequent eligibility tests for beneficiaries.  Thats not enough for the conservatives, who also number in the dozens and are insisting on deeper reductions. Ciscomani, in his second term, signed onto a letter with Bacon and others warning House Republican leadership he cannot support a bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations. Our point is that we understand the need for reform, Ciscomani said. But anything that goes beyond that and starts jeopardizing rural hospitals in my district and their existence overall, then were running into an area where it will be very difficult to move forward. I think its very important they know that. Bacon, Ciscomani and others joined on a separate letter raising concerns about eliminating clean-energy tax credits, including those passed under President Joe Biden, a Democrat.  Go with a scalpel. Go pick out some things, Bacon told The Associated Press. He and the others warned that companies are already investing millions of dollars from the Inflation Reduction Acts incentives to green energy. You just cant do a wholesale throw it out, Bacon said. Democrats are also applying political pressure in Ciscomanis district and beyond.  As Republicans decline to hold town halls on the advice of their leaders, Democrats are stepping in to warn constituents about what could happen to programs they rely on for health coverage and to put food on the table. Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Cory Booker of New Jersey visited Ciscomanis Tucson-based district last month to offer harsh condemnations. Kelly asked how many in the room were represented by Ciscomani, and then he warned about how scores of residents in the district could lose their health care coverage. And for what? It is so Donald Trump could give a big, giant tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. It is not fair, Kelly said. Booker, fresh off his 25-hour speech on the Senate floor, was even more pointed, saying just three House Republicans have to change their mind to upend the GOPs effort in the House, with its narrow majority. I believe one of them has to be in this district right here, Booker said. Either he changes his mind or this district changes congresspeople. Its as simple as that. ___ Associated Press writer Leah Askarinam contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/tax-cuts-medicaid-cuts-food-stamps-tariffs-9adf4640c67535117c71165b106f6379,business
Beckham and Neville part of new ownership group at English soccer club Salford,"David Beckham and Gary Neville are part of a new consortium to have taken ownership of English fourth-tier soccer club Salford City. The club was previously owned by Beckham, Neville and other former Manchester United teammates in its so-called Class of 92  Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville  along with Singapore businessman Peter Lim. A new ownership group, containing Beckham, Gary Neville and other shareholders from the United States, India and England, has bought Salford and have committed to invest significantly in the club, the team and its facilities, Salford said on Thursday. Butt, Giggs, Scholes and Phil Neville are no longer shareholders but will continue to contribute to the next step of this journey with roles in the club, Salford said. Beckham grew up in Salford and said he had such fond memories of my time living there and the place and its people played such an important part in my early life in football. Salford City is at the heart of its community ... it has a rich history and I am delighted to be a part of the next chapter. Beckham also is a co-owner of Major League Soccer club Inter Miami. Neville said the consortium contains a diverse range of minds and expertise, held together by a love of football. Football will come first, however its critical that we drive the club towards sustainability in the next four, five years, Neville said. I cant wait for the next part of this journey. 
        
     Salford finished in eighth place  outside the playoff spots  in League Two this season. Beckham said he has been inspired by Wrexhams rise through English soccer under the ownership of Hollywood celebrities Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney since 2021. Im not saying this is why were doing it because its not, Beckham told The Athletic in an interview. But Ive spoken to Ryan about it so many times now and he said the feeling around the city, the feeling around the club, is so exceptional. Thats the kind of thing that we want to create. Beckham added that the dream was to take Salford to the Premier League. But theres a lot of hard work and a lot of investment to be done up until that point, he said. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/beckham-neville-salford-d215e9251cbd51eb0877000dc30af9d9,business
"Bill Gates pledges his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will close in 20 years","SEATTLE (AP)  Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. Today, that would be worth an estimated $107 billion.  The pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever  outpacing the historic contributions of industrialists like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie when adjusted for inflation. Only Berkshire Hathaway investor Warren Buffetts pledge to donate his fortune  currently estimated by Forbes at $160 billion  may be larger depending on stock market fluctuations. Gates donation will be delivered over time and allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. The foundation already has an endowment of $77 billion built from donations from Gates, Melinda French Gates and Buffett. Its kind of thrilling to have that much to be able to put into these causes, Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.  His announcement Thursday signals both a promise of sustained support to those causes, particularly global health and education in the U.S., and an eventual end to the foundations immense worldwide influence. Gates says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now, which will have positive ripple effects well beyond the foundations closure. It also makes it more likely that his intentions are honored.  
        
     I think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone, Gates said.  Bill Gates speaks during the Global Funds Seventh Replenishment Conference, Sept. 21, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Bill Gates speaks during the Global Funds Seventh Replenishment Conference, Sept. 21, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) The pledge is a welcome bit of boldness, at a time when optimism is in short supply said, Rhodri Davies, a philanthropy expert and author of the publication, Public Good by Private Means. This announcement seems like yet more evidence that norms in foundation philanthropy might be shifting away from a default of operating in perpetuity, he said. The Gates Foundation has long been peerless among foundations  attracting supporters and detractors but also numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.  In addition to the $100 billion it has spent since its founding 25 years ago, it has directed scientific research, helped develop new technologies, and nurtured long-term partnerships with countries and companies. About 41% of the foundations money so far has come from Warren Buffett and the rest from the fortune Gates made at Microsoft.  Started by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2000, the foundation plays a significant role in shaping global health policy and has carved out a special niche by partnering with companies to drive down the cost of medical treatments so low- and middle-income countries could afford them.  The foundation work has been way more impactful than I expected, Gates said, calling it his second and final career. The foundations influence on global health  from the World Health Organization to research agendas  is both a measure of its success and a magnet for criticism. For years, researchers have asked why a wealthy family should have so much sway over how the world improves peoples health and responds to crises. Gates said, like any private citizen, he can choose how to spend the money he earns and has decided to do everything he can to reduce childhood deaths.  Is that a bad thing? Its not an important cause? People can criticize it, he said, but the foundation will stick to its global health work. The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and statehouses from Melinda French Gates organization, Pivotal Ventures. The foundations most prized metric is the drop in childhood deaths from preventable causes by almost half between 2000 and 2020, according to United Nations figures. The foundations CEO Mark Suzman is careful to say they do not take credit for this accomplishment. But he believes they had a catalytic role  for example, in helping deliver vaccines to children through Gavi, the vaccine alliance they helped create. The foundation still has numerous goals  eradicating polio, controlling other deadly diseases, like malaria, and reducing malnutrition, which makes children more vulnerable to other illnesses. Gates hopes that by spending to address these issues now, wealthy donors will be free to tackle other problems later.  The Gates Foundation had planned to wind down two decades after Gates death, meaning todays announcement significantly moves up that timetable. Gates plans to stay engaged, though at 69, he acknowledged he may not have a say. In its remaining two decades, the foundation will maintain a budget of around $9 billion a year, which represents a leveling off from its almost annual growth since 2006, when Buffett first started donating.  Suzman expects the foundation will narrow its focus to top priorities.  Having that time horizon and the resources just puts an even greater burden on us to say, Are you actually putting your resources, your thumb down, on what are going to be the biggest, most successful bets rather than scattering it too thinly? Suzman said, which he acknowledged was creating uncertainty even within the foundation about what programs would continue.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena, file) Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Melinda French Gates smiles as she leaves June 23, 2023 the Elysee Palace in Paris. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena, file) Major changes preceded the foundations 25th year.  In 2021, Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates divorced, and Buffett resigned as the foundations trustee. They recruited a new board of trustees to help govern the foundation, and in 2024, French Gates left to continue work at her own organization.  French Gates said she decided to step down partly to focus on countering the rollback of womens rights in the U.S. At the ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, she said she wanted to leave the foundation at a high point. I so trusted Mark Suzman, the current CEO, she said. We had a board in place that I helped put in place, and I knew their values.  Even as the foundations governance stabilizes, the road ahead looks difficult. Enduring conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, global economic turmoil and cuts to foreign aid forecast fewer resources coming to global health and development. The greatest uncertainty for us is the generosity that will go into global health, Gates said. Will it continue to go down like it has the last few years or can we get it back to where it should be?  Even facing these obstacles, Gates and the foundation speak, as they often do, with optimism, pointing to innovations theyve funded or ways theyve helped reduce the cost of care.  Its incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we cant get them out to everyone who needs them, Gates said. So its going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The Gates Foundations first 25 years: How it changed global health and philanthropy,"SEATTLE (AP)  In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the worlds largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health  an accomplishment that carried both accolades and controversy. Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates had grand ambitions for their foundation, but little experience in global health or philanthropy. They were moved by stories like those written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about children dying from diseases caused by a lack of sanitation. In characteristic Gates style, they tackled these problems with rigor, data and close oversight.  As a result, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  formed in 2000 by the merger of two family foundations and funded by Gates Microsoft wealth and later, by tens of billions from investor Warren Buffett  inserted itself into the architecture of global health.  Along the way, the foundations leaders redefined what it means to be philanthropists. As I was learning about what children die of, you know, HIV and diarrhea and pneumonia, were all things that I was stunned how little was going into helping the poor countries, Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press. He responded in a way few others could, by pouring billions into the foundation, which spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with about half going toward global health. 
        
     Thanks to its largesse, as well as the expertise of its employees, its connections to governments and companies, and the profile of its founders, the Gates Foundation now garners at least the same influence, if not more, in almost any global health forum as many countries.  That era now has an end date. Gates announced Thursday that the foundation will close in 2045, pledging that he plans to donate 99% of his remaining fortune, which would be $107 billion today, to the nonprofit by then. Gates said the foundation can maintain its culture and workforce over that time.  Well be showing that were doing the most we can and give a lot of predictability to the field by (saying,) Well be here all of those 20 years, but not thereafter, he said. The foundations influence over global health policy and its partnerships with companies and other private sector actors have long drawn questions.  Researcher Linsey McGoey, a professor of sociology at the University of Essex, who wrote the book No Such Thing as a Free Gift  about the foundation, asks how charitable it is to give away money to a foundation the donor controls. Others like Anuj Kapilashrami, global health professor at the University of Essex, argue the foundations preference for low-cost treatments and interventions does not inherently help build the capacity of health systems.  We do not tackle the causes, the underlying drivers of what is producing ill-health, but we choose areas and health issues where we can just push these magic bullets: commodities, drugs (and) bed nets, she said. Mark Suzman, who has been with the foundation for 18 years and CEO since 2020, said close supervision of grantees and the foundations data-driven processes are key to its success. We are not a write the check, call us in three years and let us know what it looks like, kind of funder, Suzman said. Well be calling you up probably every week, and well have some opinions. But we want your opinions back. The foundation is proud of the many vaccines, medical devices and treatment protocols it has helped develop. It is optimistic about a pipeline of innovations, including potential vaccines for malaria and HIV, as possible accomplishments in its remaining 20 years. David McCoy, a physician who was then at the University College London, argued back in 2009 that only a small portion of the foundations spending went directly to organizations located in the countries where they work, with most going to international organizations like the World Health Organization or to groups located in the U.S. and Europe.  Suzman said he has been an internal champion of shifting more of the foundations work from Seattle to in-country offices.  The foundations flagship issue, and the main way it measures its success, is in reducing preventable childhood deaths. The Gates Foundation helped establish two major public-private partnerships: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that funds and distributes vaccines for children, and the Global Fund, which, along with governments, funds the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. The foundation says the two organizations have saved tens of millions of lives and are some of the most important examples of its impact. However, Amy Patterson, politics professor at The University of the South, Sewanee, says public-private partnerships like Gavi and the Global Fund diminish the power of civil society groups and citizens compared to public health systems. It certainly has moved us from thinking about health as a state responsibility, which raises questions about accountability and participation, said Patterson, who has researched the management of AIDS in African countries, including the role of civic groups. That is not to discount the millions of lives saved, or children immunized, or women who have access to reproductive health, or the innovations that have brought efficiency, Patterson said. But if you think about the social contract between states taking care of their people, how do we have that same kind of accountability in this type of a system? A huge moment in the early history of the foundation came in 2006 when Buffett pledged to donate a percentage of his Berkshire Hathaway shares annually, almost doubling the foundations resources. Buffett teamed with Gates and French Gates again in 2010 to launch a new commitment for billionaires: to give away more than half their money in their lifetimes or at the time of their death. The Giving Pledge now has more than 240 people agreeing to those terms, far exceeding Gates expectations. However, certainly not every billionaire has. Gates hopes others will surpass his giving.  Id love to be beat in all of this work, he said. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than Ive been. He acknowledged that cuts to foreign aid and health funding under President Donald Trumps current administration, wars, and economic turmoil significantly challenge the foundations hopes of eradicating polio, controlling malaria, and reducing the number of child and maternal deaths in the next 20 years.  The metric that we should be measured against is the success of the whole global health field. Did we draw people in? Did we keep governments engaged, and therefore, do we get childhood death rates down from the 5 million to cut it in half again? he said. I cant promise you we will, because without the partners, thats not doable. And the current trend line is not positive for that. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and in statehouses from Melinda French Gates organization, Pivotal Ventures. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

In his own words: Bill Gates on giving away the remainder of his wealth,"INDIAN WELLS, Ca. (AP)  Bill Gates is pledging 99% of his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will spend it all within 20 years. The funds will be delivered over time and will allow the foundation to spend another $200 billion by the time it closes in 2045. Theres still a little bit more that goes to the kids and some portion that, you know, I wont be wanting for anything for my consumption, Gates said. Even his climate-related investments, all of the profits that come from that work go into the Gates Foundation. In interviews with The Associated Press, Gates spoke about the foundations past work and future goals. His responses have been edited for length.  I hope other people wallop me. Even today, theres probably a dozen people richer than I am, because I dont count the money that Ive already got in the foundation. I have just a bit over $100 billion outside of the foundation. Id love to be beat in all of this work. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than Ive been. I think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone. It will be spent. Hopefully, many of these diseases are eradicated, so nobody even knows, What was malaria? What was polio? in the years ahead. You know, some foundations, if theyve been around 50 or 60 years, who knows how their work relates to the intent of the person who started that foundation? And I do think therell be more rich people in the future than there are today. So yes, it will create a vacuum in 20 years, and were letting people know way in advance thats what this will look like. Its by some measures the most generous gift ever given and a real vote of confidence from Warren, whos a great friend and has always given me phenomenal advice and is very driven by these inequity issues. And that was in 2006, and so its two years later that I give up my full-time work at Microsoft, and I move over. And Ive been full time at the foundation since 2008 for the rest of my life. Its my final, second career. You know, Warren, its hard to overstate the impact hes had on me. 
        
     That was a big hope, that the societal expectation for anybody who has a lot of money would be that they give the majority of it away, and that basically everyone would join into that. Now, were not at that level, but I think year by year, people are saying, Hey, the fairness of this system, the legitimacy of this system really benefits if those who both through skill and luck, the system has rewarded them, that they put a lot of their resources and even, some of their time and energy into improving society. Many things now are making it less clear how much progress well make in these 20 years we have remaining. The donors are being somewhat less generous as they feel squeezed by an aging population and demands for Ukraine, both refugee costs, defense costs, a lot of things. And so telling the story of the success and the moral and geopolitical value of taking 1% of rich country budgets and saying, No, this is to save lives for very, very, very little money. Were going to have to renew peoples understanding and prioritization of these things in order to keep that piece. We have a lot of things were optimistic about because we have new tools, new ways of protecting women from getting HIV, new ways of killing mosquitoes... And so its incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we cant get them out to everyone who needs them. So, its going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need. Melinda has made a phenomenal contribution to the foundation, helping us pick the right people and being in partnerships, traveling the world, bringing her perspective to things. I cant say enough good things about how she got us off on the right track. When we divorced, we hoped  I hoped  that she would choose to stay. She stayed for a period of time, continued to do great work, and then chose to do the philanthropy on her own.  Our work is for saving childrens lives. So its true, if they have other priorities, its hard to influence my commitment to not having mothers bleed to death or kids not dying from malaria. To be honest, the number of civil society actors that are in here trying to influence the work we do is so tiny. Its unbelievable. I mean, I could almost list their names on one piece of paper. Where are these people? We want more people second-guessing our work, criticizing our work. I mean, whats their idea about malnutrition? Whats their idea on how to deal with these funding cuts? What do they want us to do? ____ The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and in statehouses from Melinda French Gates organization, Pivotal Ventures.  ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Orthodox Church leader says faith is humanitys safeguard against the impending robotocracy,"ATHENS, Greece (AP)  The spiritual leader of the worlds Orthodox Christians has said that religious faith should serve as humanitys safeguard amid rapidly advancing technology and what he described as the impending robotocracy. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, 85, said that Orthodox tradition preserves valuable human-centric wisdom essential for navigating a world of accelerating technological change and automation. His comments during an event at Athens University reflect growing concerns across major branches of Christianity  and ongoing dialogue between them  about artificial intelligences potential impact on human dignity and social structures, as well as the dangers posed by autonomous weapons systems. In a world of rapid change, an upheaval of values, and dizzying technological advances  from artificial intelligence to the impending robotocracy  our Church proclaims that there is nothing more sacred than the human being, with whom God Himself shared His nature, Bartholomew said. The patriarch, who is based in Istanbul, Turkey, made the remarks late Wednesday in a speech published on Thursday. Religious tradition, the patriarch said, upholds the absolute priority of the person over systems  and the need for an education that cultivates and supports the spiritual nature of humanity. While not opposing technological advancement, Bartholomew emphasized the need for innovation to remain human-centered. 
        
     The comments echo similar concerns raised by other Christian leaders, who increasingly frame their responses to AI and robotics through theological perspectives on human uniqueness, free will, and spiritual nature. In guidance issued by the Vatican in January, the Catholic Church said applications of AI must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and promote the common good. The head of the Anglican Church traveled to Rome last year to sign the Call for AI Ethics  an initiative backed by the Italian government and supported by tech giants IBM and Microsoft. Bartholomew, who is on a weeklong visit to Greece, met Thursday with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis days after they both attended the funeral of Pope Francis.",https://apnews.com/article/greece-automation-religion-robots-orthodoxy-2d5765621d591fa4e58ac8f60df1a3d4,business
AI-generated video gave victim a voice at his killers sentencing in Arizona,"CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP)  There were dozens of statements submitted to the court by family and friends of Christopher Pelkey when it came time to sentence the man convicted of fatally shooting him during a road rage incident. They provided glimpses of Pelkeys humor, his character and his military service.  But there was nothing quite like hearing from the victim himself  even if it was a version generated by artificial intelligence. In whats believed to be a first in U.S. courts, Pelkeys family used AI to create a video using his likeness to give him a voice. The AI rendering of Pelkey told the shooter during the sentencing hearing last week in Phoenix that it was a shame they had to meet that day in 2021 under those circumstances  and that in another life, the two of them probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness and in God who forgives. I always have and I still do, Pelkeys avatar told Gabriel Paul Horcasitas. The Army dress uniform and photo of the late Christopher Pelkey is shown at his mothers home, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, in Chandler, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York) The Army dress uniform and photo of the late Christopher Pelkey is shown at his mothers home, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, in Chandler, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York) The AI version of Pelkey went on to encourage people to make the most of each day and to love each other, not knowing how much time one might have left.  While use of AI within the court system is expanding, its typically been reserved for administrative tasks, legal research and case preparation. In Arizona, its helped inform the public of rulings in significant cases.  But using AI to generate victim impact statements marks a new  and legal, at least in Arizona  tool for sharing information with the court outside the evidentiary phases.  
        
     Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang, who presided over the case, said after watching the video that he imagined Pelkey, who was 37 at the time of his killing, would have felt that way after learning about him. Lang also noted the video said something about Pelkeys family, who had expressed their anger over his death and had asked for Horcasitas to receive the maximum sentence.  Even though thats what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it, Lang said. This undated image shows Chris Pelkey with a fish at Crystal Lake in Coram, N.Y. (Tim Wales via AP) This undated image shows Chris Pelkey with a fish at Crystal Lake in Coram, N.Y. (Tim Wales via AP) Horcasitas, 54, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10.5 years in prison. Horcasitas lawyer, Jason Lamm, told The Associated Press they filed a notice to appeal his sentence within hours of the hearing. Lamm said its likely the appeals court will weigh whether the judge improperly relied on the AI video when handing down the sentence. The shooting happened the afternoon of Nov. 13, 2021, as both drivers were stopped at a red light. According to records, Pelkey was shot after getting out of his truck and walking toward Horcasitas car. Pelkeys sister, Stacey Wales, raised the idea of her brother speaking for himself after struggling to figure out what she would say. She wrote a script for the AI-generated video, reflecting that he was a forgiving person.  In Arizona, victims can give their impact statements in any digital format, said victims rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, who represented the family.

(AP Photo/Matt York) Stacey Wales, sister of the late Christopher Pelkey, is shown at her mothers home, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, in Chandler, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York) Wales, a software product consultant, took the AI idea to her husband, Tim. He and his friend, who have work experience creating humanlike AI avatars. Using a video clip of Pelkey, they aimed to replicate his voice and speech patterns. They generated Pelkeys likeness through a single image of him, digitally manipulating it to remove glasses and a hat logo, edit his outfit and trim his beard.  Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Ann Timmer didnt address the road rage case specifically in an interview Wednesday. But she said the rise in popularity and accessibility to AI in recent years led to the creation of a committee to research best practices in the courts. Gary Marchant, a member of the committee and a law professor at Arizona State University, said he understands why Pelkeys family did it. But he warned the use of this technology could open the door to more people trying to introduce AI-generated evidence into courtrooms. Theres a real concern among the judiciary and among lawyers that deepfake evidence will be increasingly used, he said. Its easy to create it and anyone can do it on a phone, and it could be incredibly influential because judges and juries, just like all of us, are used to believing what you see. Marchant pointed to a recent case in New York, where a man without a lawyer used an AI-generated avatar to argue his case in a lawsuit via video. It took only seconds for the judges to realize that the man addressing them from the video screen didnt exist at all. In the Arizona case, Wales said the AI-generated video worked because the judge had nearly 50 letters from family and friends that echoed the videos message. Everybody knew that Chris would forgive this person, Wales said. ___ Yamat reported from Las Vegas.

"World Video Game Hall of Fame inducts Defender, Tamagotchi, GoldenEye 007 and Quake","ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP)  The World Video Game Hall of Fame on Thursday inducted four honorees, paying tribute to games that challenged players and changed the industry. Making up the Class of 2025 are: Defender, the 1981 arcade game that raised the bar on difficulty; Tamagotchi, the digital pets that bridged toys and video games; GoldenEye 007, whose four-person mode influenced multiplayer games that followed; and Quake, which debuted in 1996 with a 3D engine that became the new standard for the industry. The winners emerged from a field of 12 finalists that included Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Frogger, Golden Tee, Harvest Moon, Mattel Football, and NBA 2K.  The Hall of Fame each year recognizes arcade, console, computer, handheld, and mobile games that have had staying power and influenced the video game industry or pop culture.  Id Softwares 1996 Quake was recognized for its lasting influence, with a game code that is a literal legacy and continues to be used in some games after nearly 30 years, electronic games curator Lindsey Kurano said.  Quake co-creator John Romeo, on hand to see his game enshrined, said he and the other developers worked on the game for an exceptionally long time, a year and a half, playing it constantly. We knew that what we were building into the game was going to make people who had played our previous game, Doom, even happier with the addition of a programming language built into the game, he said in remarks aired on RochesterFirst.com.  
        
     Were just really happy with the impact that Quake made on the world, he said. The best-selling Defender, released by Williams Electronics, proved that players would embrace complex and challenging games in the arcade, the experts said. It combined intense gameplay and a complicated control scheme with a horizontally scrolling shooter.  Defenders punishing gameplay raised the level of competition in arcades, and it was among the first games to truly separate dedicated players from more casual ones, Jeremy Saucier, assistant vice president for interpretation and electronic games, said. The 1996 launch of Tamagotchi is credited with sparking the popularity of pet simulation video games. The handheld egg-shaped electronic game allowed owners to care for a virtual pet from birth through death, feeding, playing with and cleaning up after it by pressing buttons. Collections manager Kristy Hisert said Tamagotchi offered something different than the popular video game electronics of the time. It provided players with feelings of connection, caring, and customization, a respite from competition and fighting games, she said. Neopets, Nintendogs and other social media and app-based versions of pet simulation games would follow. GoldenEye 007 was based on the 1995 James Bond spy film GoldenEye and was the third best-selling game for the Nintendo 64, behind Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64. The result of a 1997 partnership between Nintendo and Rare, the first-person shooter game was known for its four-person multiplayer mode, which Hall of Fame experts said influenced many multiplayer games that followed.  The World Video Game Hall of Fame is inside The Strong National Museum of Play. Anyone can nominate a video game for consideration. Museum staff name 12 finalists each year and solicit votes from experts and fans before announcing the winners.",https://apnews.com/article/video-game-hall-of-fame-defender-tamagotchi-2e4ad6ec2258d482dc3a34ed324ee7f5,business
"Trump says US kids may get 2 dolls instead of 30, but China will suffer more in a trade war","WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump on Wednesday acknowledged that his tariffs could result in fewer and costlier products in the United States, saying American kids might have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, but he insisted China will suffer more from his trade war. The Republican president has tried to reassure a nervous country that his tariffs will not provoke a recession, after a new government report showed the U.S. economy shrank during the first three months of the year. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump was quick to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any setbacks while telling his Cabinet that his tariffs meant China was having tremendous difficulty because their factories are not doing business, adding that the U.S. did not really need imports from the worlds dominant manufacturer. You know, somebody said, Oh, the shelves are going to be open, Trump continued, offering a hypothetical. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally. His remarks followed a defensive morning after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% during the first quarter. Behind the decline was a surge in imports as companies tried to front-run the sweeping tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and almost every country. And even positive signs of increased domestic consumption indicated that purchases might be occurring before the import taxes lead to price increases. Trump pointed his finger at Biden as the stock market fell Wednesday morning in response to the gross domestic product report. This is Bidens Stock Market, not Trumps, the Republican president, who took office in January, posted on his social media site. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden Overhang. This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS. President Donald Trump, right, speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump, right, speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) But the GDP report gives Democrats ammunition to claim that Trumps policies could shove the economy into a recession. Democrats statements after the GDP report noted how quickly the economy, which still has a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, appears to lose momentum within weeks of Trumps return. A top House Democrat, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, said that weve only seen the beginning of the dangerous impacts from Trumps random policies. She noted that U.S. manufacturers still depend on parts and components from China to assemble final goods and said Trumps approach to trade reflected a misunderstanding of the investment and certainty that domestic companies need in order to construct more factories and create jobs.  Chaos and dysfunction are not going to help build investment, said DelBene, who leads the House Democrats congressional campaign efforts. A strong economy needs stability and certainty. We havent seen that. The GDP report landed as Trump sought to put the focus on new corporate investments in the U.S. as he spends the week celebrating his 100th day in office. He delivered remarks on Wednesday afternoon and called out investments from companies such as Nvidia, Soft Bank, Apple, Johnson & Johnson and others that he said reflected the coming prosperity. Still, Trumps economic message contains some clashing arguments and dismisses data that raises red flags. He wants credit for an aggressive first 100 days back in the White House that included mass layoffs of federal workers and the start of a trade war with 145% in new tariffs against China. He also wants to blame the negative response of the financial markets on Biden, who left office months ago. Hes also saying his tariffs are negotiating tools to generate trade deals, but at the same time banking on hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff revenues to help cover his planned income tax cuts. In a town hall Wednesday night on NewsNation, Trump said he didnt believe he had made any mistakes during the start of his second term and thought he could turn around a public that has severe doubts about his tariffs. I just think that Ill be able to convince people how good this is, he said. At the Cabinet meeting, Trump highlighted the positive aspects of the GDP report. But that session revealed how his administration is also trying to take credit for policies that involve the Biden administration. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick talked about his recent trip to Arizona to see the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s computer chip factories. The company notes on its website that it announced plans in May 2020, during Trumps first term, when the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the global economy, to build its first plant in Arizona. The company announced a second factory in December 2022, when Biden was in office. After getting up to $6.6 billion in commitments in 2024 from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, TSMC announced plans for a third plant.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump dismissed the importance of the government support that Biden made possible for computer chip factories to open domestically. Theyre building because of the tariffs, Trump said. Yet Democrats are quick to say that Trump inherited an economy on a steady course of low unemployment and declining inflation that his tariff plans have almost immediately disrupted. In just 100 days, President Trump has taken the U.S. economy from strong, stable growth to negative GDP, said Heather Boushey, a former member of Bidens White House Council of Economic Advisers. This astonishing turn of fortune is directly due to the incoherence of his economic policy and his mismanagement of federal policy more generally.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-economy-tariffs-gdp-7494825851dcef94ec81475124f9326f,business
"Employers added a surprising 177,000 jobs as job market shows resilience. Unemployment stays at 4.2%","WASHINGTON (AP)  American employers added a surprising 177,000 jobs in April as the job market showed resilience in the face of President Donald Trumps trade wars. 
        
     Hiring fell slightly from a revised 185,000 in March, but that is above economist projections of 135,000 jobs. The unemployment rate remained at a low 4.2%, the Labor Department reported Friday. Trumps aggressive and unpredictable policies  including massive import taxes  have clouded the outlook for the economy and the job market and raised fears that the American economy is headed toward recession. Fridays report showed employment, one of the strongest aspects of the U.S. economy, remains solid, yet many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers and potentially, President Trump.  Politicians can count their lucky stars that companies are holding on to their workers despite the storm clouds forming that could slow the economy further in the second half of the year, said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at fwdbonds, a financial markets research firm.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Delivery workers carry boxes outside a grocery store in the Chinatown neighborhood, Wednesday, April 9, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Transportation and warehousing companies added 29,000 jobs last month, suggesting companies have built up inventory before imported goods are hit with new tariffs. Healthcare companies added nearly 51,000 jobs and bars, restaurants almost 17,000 and construction firms 11,000. Factories lost 1,000 jobs.  Labor Department revisions shaved 58,000 jobs from February and March payrolls. Average hourly earnings ticked up 0.2% from March and 3.8% from a year ago, nearing the 3.5% that economists view as consistent with the 2% inflation the Federal Reserve wants to see.  Trumps massive taxes on imports to the U.S. are likely to raise costs for Americans and American businesses that depend on supplies from overseas. They also threaten to slow economic growth. His immigration crackdown threatens to make it more difficult for hotels, restaurants and construction firms to fill job openings. By purging federal workers and cancelling federal contracts, Elon Musks Department of Government Efficiency risks wiping out jobs inside the government and out. 
        
     The drastic changes have shaken markets and consumers. The Conference Board, a business group, reported Tuesday that Americans confidence in the economy fell  for the fifth straight month to the lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, called the jobs report reassuringly normal. The fears of a softer labor market due to tariff uncertainty went unrealized last month ... There are signs that businesses are reining in plans for hiring and capital spending and that consumers are turning more cautious toward discretionary spending.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier, File) American workers have at least one thing going for them. Despite the uncertainty about fallout from Trumps policies, many employers dont want to risk letting employees go  not after struggling to bring people back from the massive but short-lived layoffs from the pandemic. For now, the unemployment rate and the number of people filing claims for jobless benefits every week remain low by historical standards, Boston College economist Brian Bethune said this week. The federal governments workforce fell by 9,000 on top of 17,000 job losses in February and March, The full effect of Musks DOGE cuts may yet to be seen. Bethune noted job cuts by the billionaires DOGE are still being challenged in court. Also, some of those leaving federal agencies were forced into early retirement and dont count as unemployed. After the jobs numbers were released, Trump repeated his call for the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark short-term interest rate, which it raised to combat inflation. Trump said on social media platform Truth Social that there is NO INFLATION and employment strong.

Huh, File) Yet as long as the job market remains healthy, the Fed will likely stay on the sidelines as it takes time to evaluate the impact of tariffs. Fed chair Jerome Powell has underscored that the duties are likely to push up prices in the coming months, making the central bank wary of the potential for higher inflation. The Fed typically fights inflation with higher interest rates, so it is unlikely to cut its key short-term rate anytime soon. It may change course if layoffs spike and unemployment rises. Some U.S. companies stand to benefit from Trumps protectionist policies.  Allen Jacoby, executive vice president of textile division at Milliken & Co., said that cheap Chinese imports have hurt business at the Spartanburg, South Carolina, manufacturer. His division makes Polartec fabric for brands such as North Face and Patagonia and has closed six plants and reduced its payrolls 12% since 2019.  Trumps tariffs, he said, could improve Millikens sales and hiring. Its too early to tell, but theres more optimism than pessimism, he said.

Merzs stumble casts shadow over hopes for rebooting Germanys struggling economy,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  Friedrich Merzs unprecedented failure to win election as German chancellor in the first round of voting in parliament  though he won in the second  raised doubts about his new governments ability to carry through on plans to push Europes largest economy out of stagnation. Tuesdays stumble at the start of his new coalition government between his Union bloc and the Social Democrats added uncertainty around the future of an economy that hasnt seen significant growth since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Above all, Merz had been expected to end the squabbling over spending and budgets that plagued predecessor Olaf Scholzs unruly three-party coalition that collapsed in November. His Feb. 23 election win and coalition deal seemed to provide assurance that his government could end policy paralysis and confront challenges including lagging investment in pro-growth projects, choking bureaucracy and a lack of skilled labor. But the first-round flop in parliament raised questions about how solid Merzs majority would be and whether it can pass reforms to raise growth after two years of shrinking output. The outgoing government predicted zero growth for this year. The failed vote, and fact that it came out of the blue, have already weakened Merz significantly, said Franziska Palmas, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. His promise to run a much more efficient and conflict-free government ... looks much less credible now. And delivering on his economic proposals, including a big increase in defense and infrastructure spending, corporate tax cuts, bureaucracy cuts and digitalization, will be more difficult than expected, Palmas added. 
        
     Merzs coalition has 328 members in the new parliament. The fact that he received only 310 votes on the first secret ballot  when he needed a majority of 316 out of 630 votes  led to speculation that some fiscally conservative legislators are resisting his post-election decision to loosen Germanys constitutional limit on deficit spending and set up a 500 billion euro fund to spend on infrastructure such as bridges, schools and rail lines.  Those measures were passed in the outgoing parliament. Merz won election with 325 votes on the second try, but significant damage has been done. He is taking office with two black eyes and shaky knees, said Andrea Roemmele, professor of communications in politics and civil society at Berlins Hertie School. Hope that the government will quickly push ahead with new investments and reforms has been shattered, said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank: Todays events show that not everyone seems to have understood the sense of urgency and the need to have a functioning government. For years, the debt limits constrained spending on infrastructure and was ultimately blamed for slowing growth. On top of that, China has gone from a lucrative export market for German companies to a competitor in German specialties such as autos and industrial machinery. Extensive permissions processes are blamed for slowing new business projects, while the loss of cheap Russian natural gas due to the invasion of Ukraine has raised energy costs for businesses. While the vote was a bad surprise, some of the tough decisions on spending and the debt limit were already taken care of in the outgoing parliament, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. The extra fiscal space exists ... todays upset will probably not affect the way the additional money for defense and infrastructure is allocated in a major way. Schmieding noted that most votes in parliament are not by secret ballot, which could prevent some of the coalition members who spurned Merz from voting against bills in parliament. The decision to set up the infrastructure fund outside the debt limit had raised hope for more government spending and an exit from stagnation. Those hopes were dampened April 2 when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a slew of new tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners, including a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union. That immediately added to the headwinds for Germanys export-dominated economy, amid uncertainty over whether EU officials can negotiate a lower tariff rate during the 90-day pause institute by Trump before the tariffs take effect.",https://apnews.com/article/germany-economy-gdp-merz-growth-3aaeeb2b19de9373cb8668ce5d183afb,business
Got your first job? Here are some tax tips for first-time filers,"NEW YORK (AP)  The deadline to file your taxes is less than a month away, and if youre doing them for the first time, you might be feeling added pressure. Its an incredibly daunting and stressful experience for many of them, said Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant based California.  Planning ahead, doing your research and talking with experts can help first-time filers feel better about their taxes, Ringbauer said.  The deadline to file your 2024 taxes is April 15. If you run out of time, you can file for an extension until Oct. 15. The extension is only to file your taxes, not to pay them. If you think you will owe taxes, you should pay an estimated amount before the deadline to avoid paying penalties and interest. If you expect to receive a refund, you will still get your money when you file your taxes. Here are some expert recommendations if you are filing taxes for the first time: The first step is to gather all the relevant documentation, said Eva Simpson, vice president of Member Value, Tax & Advisory Services for the American Institute of CPAs.  Tracking down documentation is key, especially if they may be in college and have correspondence sent to their parents house, Simpson said.  Ringbauer also recommends that you make a folder, either physical or electronic, with all of the documents you need so its easier to file your taxes.  While the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs: 
        
      Social Security number  W-2 forms, if you are employed  1099-G, if you are unemployed  1099 forms, if you are self-employed  Savings and investment records  Any eligible deduction, such as educational expenses, medical bills, charitable donations, etc.  Tax credits, such as child tax credit, retirement savings contributions credit, etc. 
        
     Many young adults are still receiving some financial help from their parents when theyre ready to file their taxes for the first time. Its important that first-time filers communicate with their parents in case they are being claimed as dependents, Simpson said.  Being claimed as a dependent affects their standard deduction and eligibility for certain credits, said Simpson.  Having a conversation with your parents will prevent you from claiming tax credits that you might not qualify for if they claim you as a dependent. If your parents claim you as a dependent, you will add this information to your tax return. Knowing if you are eligible for any tax credits and deductions is a crucial step when filing your taxes, Simpson said. Tax credits can lower the amount of taxes you owe or increase the amount of your refund. Some relevant tax credits for first-time filers include the American Opportunity tax credit and the Earned Income credit.  When it comes to deductions, you can either opt for a standard deduction or itemize. Itemizing generally only makes sense if your itemized deductions add up to more than the current standard deduction of $14,600 for a single filer and $29,200 for a married couple. In many cases, first-time filers wont need to be itemizing their expenses, said Simpson.  Doing research or asking a professional for the types of deductions and tax credits you qualify for can save you money, If you freelance, work in rideshare or sell your clothes online in addition to your part- or full-time job, you must add this income to your tax returns, said Tim McGrath, a certified financial planner based in Chicago.  Forgetting to add tax income from freelance work in your tax documents is a common mistake by young filers, Ringbauer said. Some gig workers receive 1099 forms from their employers while others dont, but both must document their income and expenses so they can be added to their tax returns.  Simpson recommends that first-time filers look into the multiple resources available to file taxes for free or at a low cost. One of the is the new Direct File program, which allows people in 25 states who have very simple W-2s to calculate and submit their returns directly to the IRS for free. Aside from Direct File, IRS offers free guided tax preparation that does the math for you. This is available for people who make $79,000 or less per year. If you have questions while working on your tax forms, the IRS also offers an interactive tax assistant tool that can provide answers based on your information. The AARP also offers a tax-aid locator where you can search for tax assistance near you.  Mistakes can happen to everybody, but deliberately ignoring income can have more consequences, Ringbauer said. In general, if you make a mistake our youre missing something in your tax return, the IRS will audit you, which means they will ask you for more documentation.  A common mistake is failing to declare a source of income such as gig work or selling products online, said Ringbauer. This, he said, should be taken very seriously.  One of the biggest challenges is not taking it seriously, not caring about the nuances, Ringbauer said. It has to be accurate and exact information whether you self prepare or youre doing it with a professional, because life is exact.  If you need to correct an error in a tax return you already filed, you can file an amended return.  Its always good practice to keep a record of your tax returns, just in case the IRS audits you for an item you reported years ago, Ringbauer said. The IRS recommends that you keep your documents for at least three years and up to seven depending on your situation.  Ringbauer recommends that his clients keep records of their tax documents in a digital folder on a cloud platform of their choosing. Password-protecting your tax folders can also add an extra layer of protection against scammers.  ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Tax tips for recently married couples and first-time parents,"NEW YORK (AP)  Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby. But once you return from your honeymoon or while your newborn is napping, youll need to spend some time thinking about them.  Keeping your documents organized, updating your withholding and knowing which tax credits youre eligible for are some crucial steps as couples and parents navigate tax season, said Henry Grzes, lead manager of tax practice & ethics for the American Institute of CPAs.  The deadline to file your 2024 taxes is Tuesday. If you run out of time, you can file for an extension until Oct. 15.  Here are some expert recommendations if you are filing taxes as a newlywed or new parent.  Keeping your tax documents organized is a great practice regardless of your filing year. Having your tax documents in a folder on your personal computer, even if its pictures of the documents, can help you have everything in the same place, said Tyler Horn, a certified financial planner and head of planning at Origin, a financial planning app.  Just take a picture with your phone, send it and keep it in that secure folder on your computer. That way you have everything together, Horn said. Its also good to keep your records for the future. The IRS recommends that you keep your documents for at least three years and up to seven depending on your situation. 
        
     If you changed your last name, you will need to make sure your government documents reflect this. Your tax return must match your Social Security number so, if you choose to change your name, youll need to make a change with the Social Security Administration. Oftentimes, people forget to make this change ahead of time, which leads them to make mistakes on their tax returns. Thats something that people dont necessarily think about and when they do think about it sometimes its its too late, Grzes said.  You can find out more about how to change your name on the Social Security Administrations website.  One of the biggest changes, for tax purposes, when you get married is whether you choose to file your taxes jointly or separately, Horn said. To make this decision, each couple should take a look at their specific situation. In most cases, filing jointly might make the most sense but its not always that case, Horn said. One of the benefits of filing jointly is that it gives you access to new tax credits and deductions.  Its important to know that if a couple is married as of Dec. 31, the law indicates that the couple was married for the entire year, Grzes said. So, if you got married in the summer, in the eyes of the IRS you have been married the full year.  You can read more about each filing status on the IRS website. If youre planning to file taxes jointly with your spouse, you must update your W-4 form with your employer. Updating your W-4 is meant to reflect your new filing status, from single to married, as well as updating your tax withholding.  Knowing what tax credits and deductions you qualify for is very important when filing your taxes, Horn said. Relevant tax credits for married couples include the Earned Income, American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits.  When it comes to deductions, you can either opt for a standard deduction or itemize. Itemizing generally only makes sense if your itemized deductions add up to more than the current standard deduction of $29,200 for a married couple.  In some cases, a person that qualifies for the Earned Income Credit as a single filer will no longer qualify if they file jointly with their spouse, Grzes said. To avoid surprises when youre filing your taxes, Grzes recommends that you work with a tax professional ahead of time.  Its important that you obtain a social security number for your child as soon as you can, Grzes said. The first time you file taxes after youve had your new baby, you will be able to apply for several new tax credits, but you can only do so if you claim them as a dependent.  If youre going to claim your child as a dependent, you have to have a Social Security number and put that number on the return. Otherwise, the IRS is going to deny you, Grzes said. Usually, hospitals let you apply for a Social Security number registration. However, you can also apply online or at your local Social Security office.  To alleviate some of the expenses of having children, the IRS offers several tax credits, including the Child Tax Credit, Childcare Credit and Adoption Credit. Parents also continue to qualify for the Earned Income Credit, which will continue to be based on your earned income and the number of children you have. The Earned Income Credit clearly provides a significant refund and by having a child, you could increase the amount of income that you could earn and still qualify for that credit, Grzes said. Parents can benefit from opening tax-free accounts such as a flexible spending account or a 529 account. A flexible spending account (FSA), allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for healthcare and childcare costs, while the 529 account lets you set money aside for education expenses.  Its worth making sure you are maximizing your tax opportunities, Grzes said.  ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Microsoft and Meta Platforms lead Wall Street higher,"NEW YORK (AP)  Microsoft and Meta Platforms  led Wall Street higher Thursday after the Big Tech companies reported profits for the start of the year that were even bigger than analysts expected.  The S&P 500 rose 0.6% for an eighth straight gain, its longest winning streak since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 83 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.5%.  Microsoft rallied 7.6% after the software giant said strength in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses drove its overall revenue up 13% from a year earlier.  Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also topped analysts targets for revenue and profit in the latest quarter. It said AI tools helped boost its advertising revenue, and its stock climbed 4.2%.  Theyre two of the most influential stocks within the S&P 500 and other indexes because of their massive sizes, and they werent alone. CVS Health, Carrier Global and a bevy of other companies also joined the stream of better-than-expected profit reports that have helped steady Wall Street over the last week. The S&P 500 is back to within 9% of its record set earlier this year, after briefly dropping nearly 20% below the mark.  Still, plenty of uncertainty remains about whether President Donald Trumps trade war will force the economy into a recession. Even though companies have been reporting better profits for the first three months of the year than analysts expected, many CEOs are remaining cautious about the rest of the year.  General Motors cut its forecast for profit  in 2025, for example. It said its assuming it will feel a hit of $4 billion to $5 billion because of tariffs, and it expects to offset at least 30% of it. GMs stock slipped 0.4%. 
        
     McDonalds fell 1.9% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected, even though its profit was slightly above forecasts. An important measure of performance at its U.S. restaurants had its worst decline since 2020, when COVID shuttered the global economy, and McDonalds CEO Chris Kempczinski said consumers are grappling with uncertainty.  McDonalds joined Chipotle  and other restaurant chains that have seen customers get more cautious amid all the unknowns about the economy and inflation thats still higher than many would like. The uncertainty has already shown up in surveys of consumers, which say pessimism is shooting higher about where the economy heading. On Thursday, a couple reports about the economy came in mixed, following up on several recent updates that suggested its weakening. The first of the reports said more U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits  last week than economists had forecast, setting the stage for a more comprehensive report on the job market arriving Friday.  But a later update said U.S. manufacturing activity was better last month than economists had feared, though it still contracted again. The fear on Wall Street is for a possible worst-case scenario called stagflation, where the economy stagnates yet inflation remains high. The Federal Reserve has no good tools to fix both such problems at the same time. If the Fed were to try to help one problem by adjusting interest rates, it would likely make the other worse. Some encouraging news on inflation arrived Wednesday, when a report said that the measure of inflation the Fed likes to use slowed  in March.  In the bond market, Treasury yields swiveled following Thursdays economic reports. The yield on the 10-year Treasury initially fell below 4.13% after the worse-than-expected update on joblessness. But it later trimmed its losses following the better-than-expected report on manufacturing and rallied to 4.21%. Thats up from 4.17% late Wednesday.  Stocks were steadier and held onto their gains through the day after opening higher. All told, the S&P 500 rose 35.08 points to 5,604.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 83.60 to 40,752.96, and the Nasdaq composite gained 264.40 to 17,710.74. In stock markets abroad, trading was closed in many countries for May Day, or international Labor Day holidays. Tokyos Nikkei 225 rose 1.1% after the Bank of Japan kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, as many investors expected.  Hopes that Trump may eventually roll back some of his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries also helped to support markets.  A social media blog by Chinas state broadcaster claimed that the Trump administration has been seeking contact with the worlds second largest economy through multiple channels to start negotiations over tariffs.  ___ AP Writers Yuri Kageyama, Matt Ott and Didi Tang contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-tariffs-trump-ed03cfc78cd7d7d988573ef72301d11a,business
Have you experienced a disaster? You have more time to file your taxes,"NEW YORK (AP)  If your life has been upended by a wildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado, or another disaster this past year, the IRS recognizes that you may need more time to file your taxes and grants you an automatic extension beyond the normal filing deadline, which is Tuesday.  Youre also permitted to write off a certain amount of loss due to disaster, reducing your tax burden. That could be damaged property, lost income, or small business losses. It can feel really daunting and overwhelming, after youve already lost your home or your vehicle, to tackle that project (of loss write-off). It can take time and a lot of energy, said Alison Flores, manager at the Tax Institute for H&R Block. We see people be hesitant to tackle that, and so they leave that loss on the table. In the wake of a disaster, people are also more vulnerable to scams, so be extra vigilant as you prepare your taxes, even with the extra time of an IRS extension. Scammers often pose as representatives of the IRS or FEMA to exploit victims of disasters, said Misty Erickson, tax content program manager at the National Association of Tax Professionals. Common scams include false promises of tax refunds, fake charities soliciting donations, and phishing attempts requesting personal or financial information. Heres what you should know: 
        
     The IRS keeps an official list online of all disaster locations that qualify you for an extension to file. For the past year, individuals and businesses affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton qualify for tax relief, as well as disaster victims in parts of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Alaska. Taxpayers in these areas have until May 1 to file returns and make payments, and theres no need to do any additional paperwork to receive that extra two week grace period. Filers also have the option to request additional extensions to October 15, but interest will accrue if any money due isnt paid by May 1. Individuals and businesses in southern California affected by wildfires and straight-line winds also qualify for automatic extensions due to disaster. Taxpayers in the relevant counties have until Oct. 15 to file returns and make payments.  Any interest or fees that normally accrue on late payments wont accrue during disaster extensions. Most direct disaster relief is also not counted as income, and so is not taxed. While nothing is easy in the first days and weeks following a disaster, a few choices can help when seeking insurance reimbursement and at tax time. We recommend saving media coverage, said Flores. If your neighborhood was on the news showing the disaster, write down what date that was or record that copy. Anything that substantiates your losses and what condition your property was in is helpful. According to the IRS, other steps include:  Taking photographs of damaged property or belongings to document and calculate the amount of your loss.  Keeping receipts for associated expenses, including contracted work on property damaged by disaster.  Keeping records of the original value of any property, including a home, car, jewelry, or big credit card purchases. Filing your insurance claims as soon as possible is also important, as you deduct any insurance reimbursement from disaster losses claimed on your tax return. When we look at a loss, its often damage to your home, furnishings inside your home, vehicles, that kind of thing, Flores said. Most of the time, people will have home insurance and auto insurance, and file claims. Thats the first step. The tax deduction is for loss thats not paid for or reimbursed by your insurance. The IRS calls this kind of disaster relief casualty loss. Claiming casualty loss doesnt result in dollar-for-dollar reimbursement, but it does lower your tax burden, which can mean more cash to help pay for recovery.  Form 4684, which you include when you file your return, walks you through the relevant steps for calculating your casualty write-off. Victims of disasters may deduct their losses in either the year they suffered the loss or in the previous year  in that case, by filing an amended return. In the wake of a disaster, its normal to feel vulnerable and to listen to voices that promise relief. But scammers often target disaster victims for exactly this reason. Taxpayers should be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, emails or texts claiming to be from the IRS or relief agencies, said Erickson. The IRS never initiates contact via email, text, or social media to request sensitive information. When in doubt, taxpayers should verify correspondence by calling official numbers directly. According to the IRS, you should watch out for:  Big paydays: The promise of more money than you think sounds reasonable. Bad advisers may make outlandish statements about available credits.  Threats and demands: Any pressure to pay for tax help now or else, mentions of arrest or deportation, or refusals to let you question or appeal the taxes they say you owe.  Suspicious or misspelled website links that arent IRS.gov. Scammers may say that they want to help you file casualty loss claims or to get big refunds. Always rely on official IRS government websites and beware fishy offers of help with high price-tags or sensational promises. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

What to do if you cant pay the taxes you owe,"NEW YORK (AP)  If you know or suspect you cant pay the taxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information or file for an extension. Thats the top piece of advice that tax professionals want you to know. The IRS wants to work with you, said Tom OSaben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals. But if youre asking the IRS for some help, they have to know something about you. So the first thing is to have that return filed. The number one takeaway is that owing money is not a reason not to file. If you dont file a return or ask for an extension, then interest and penalties begin to accrue immediately. Those costs are largely avoidable if you share the information about your circumstances with the IRS in a timely way. Filing a return without paying taxes owed in full is preferable to not filing.  
        
     To be clear, if you dont pay all the taxes you owe by the April 15 filing deadline, interest will accrue even if youve been granted an extension to October, but that interest will be more manageable than fees that add up when you pay no taxes at all.  The worst case scenario is that you dont file and end up being liable for penalties later on, said Emily DiVito, senior advisor for economic policy at the nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative and former U.S. Treasury advisor. Thats not good for anyone. But there are opportunities to ask for extensions and to go on payment plans. Heres what to know: 
        
     In addition to tacking on interest and penalties, the IRS can eventually garnish your wages, place a lien on your property, or even place a hold on your passport. But if you file for an extension, or if you file your return with your financial information, you can avoid these consequences. Even if you dont have the money to pay what you owe in full by April 15, paying just a small part when you file. Yes. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites across the country are staffed with volunteers who will help you file a return or arrange for an extension for free. These volunteers can help you set up an installment payment plan of as many as 72 months to pay off any owed taxes. The IRS Direct File program is also free to use. While the question mark when you go to click the button to pay can be intimidating, we want to make sure that taxpayers get the money youre owed, too, said DiVito. Most taxpayers  certainly most working taxpayers  get money back. But the way that a lot of the tax credits function, you only get that refund if you file your taxes in the first place. If youve experienced unusual hardship, and you share that with the IRS, the IRS can sometimes put your account in currently-not-collectible status. To do that, you share information about your income and living expenses, and the IRS determines if you qualify.  Lets say youve been ill, and you lost your job from illness, and you have serious medical bills. Youve had all the bad luck, and things happened outside of your control, and you need some relief, said OSaben. Then the IRS can place you in uncollectable status. But all of this requires conversation and communication. No one wants to admit theyre having economic problems, but the IRS will work with you if you do. There are also rare circumstances in which the IRS will settle your tax debt for less than the amount owed, called an offer in compromise. VITA tax professionals can also help you see if youre eligible, or you can use a free IRS tool online.  Thats OK. Start now.  Ive been doing taxes for more than 35 years, said OSaben. The number one reason people dont file is that they have a feeling they may owe  which could be wrong  and they dont want to face it. But its not a problem thats going to go away. So tell the IRS the truth of the situation. And they will work with you. Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA and tax professional in California, echoed this. Its perfectly okay, he said. The IRS deals with every single taxpayer. They have dealt with this before. Theres nothing they havent seen. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"Trump says its Bidens economy, but businesses and economists beg to differ","WASHINGTON (AP)  When the stock market was climbing in January 2024, Donald Trump knew exactly who deserved credit: He did.  Nearly a year before his return to the White House, he declared on his Truth Social platform that investors were celebrating his lead in the polls against President Joe Biden. When the stock market fell Wednesday on news that the American economy had gone backward during the first three months of 2025, Trump knew exactly who to blame: Biden. This is Bidens Stock Market, not Trumps, he posted, adding that Biden left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!! Trump also said, Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden Overhang. This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS. Yet for economists puzzling out how prices and hiring will change in the coming months, or businesses struggling with a starkly uncertain future, Trumps massive and unpredictable import taxes on almost every country do in fact bear much of the blame. Rarely have a new presidents policies had such a sharp, immediate impact on the economy.  To Georgia Tech Universitys Mark Zachary Taylor, who studies the economic policies of the American presidents, Trumps assertions sound like a brazen double standard. He cannot have it both ways, Taylor said by email, though he always tries. Trumps attempt to shift blame for bad economic news to his predecessor raises a question: At what point in a four-year term does a new president assume responsibility for the economys performance? 
        
     Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said in interviews that the benefits of Trumps policies will be felt in the second half of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter. And Taylor notes that for a typical president, it might take six months to two years for us to accurately call the economy theirs. But the threshold is different for presidents who enter the White House with big ambitions to reshape the economy from the get-go. The more boldly an incoming president acts (and the stronger his Congressional support), the sooner the economy becomes his,  Taylor said. The most notable example is President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who pushed through major legislation  including a bill that effectively established deposit insurance to calm a banking crisis  to combat the Great Depression during his first 100 days in office. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama also entered office during economic crises and moved swiftly to deal with them. But even they did not move the economic data as quickly or sharply as Trump. On Wednesday, the government reported that imports surged 41%, the biggest jump  excluding the pandemic  since 1972. Companies rushed to bring in goods in the first quarter to beat the impending tariffs.  The flood of imports pulled down growth, under the governments accounting, and the economy shrank 0.3% at an annual rate, the first decline in two years. The negative showing is what prompted Trumps Biden-bashing post on Wednesday.  The figures are exactly what one would expect from millions of American businesses and households trying to get ahead of looming tariff hikes, Taylor said, adding that Trumps trade war is also responsible for the slumping stock market and a drop in the value of the dollar. Surveys show that manufacturers are receiving fewer orders and that their production is falling. On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, released its monthly survey of manufacturers, which typically includes a selection of comments from its membership.  Typically, the comments reflect the individual concerns of a specific industry, whether chemicals, electronics, or clothing makers. In Aprils report, all 10 comments  every single one  focused on tariffs.  Tariffs impacting operations  specifically, delayed border crossings and duties calculations that are complex and not completely understood, one company in the transportation equipment sector said. As a result, we are potentially overpaying duties. Trump has blown up the existing world trade system by slapping 10% import taxes  tariffs  on friends and foes alike in the name of bringing back jobs to the U.S. Hes plastered 145% tariffs on China, drawing retaliation from Beijing that threatens to end trade between the worlds two largest economies. Hes also hit foreign steel, aluminum and autos. The erratic way hes rolled out his protectionist policies  introducing, then suspending tariffs, then announcing new ones  has left companies, consumers and investors bewildered. The S&P 500 stock index has dropped 7% since just before Inauguration Day Jan. 20. And consumer confidence has wilted.  Some of what you are seeing right now is purely Trump related, said Columbia Universitys Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration. No one can look at what is going on in the economy without saying the on-again, off-again tariffs are not having an impact.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-economy-biden-tariffs-a268e2c155019a462eaa951aa20c7fcd,business
Fighter jet goes overboard from USS Harry S Truman. Yemens Houthis assess Sanaa airport damage,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  An F/A-18 fighter jet landing on the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea went overboard, forcing its two pilots to eject, a defense official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The incident Tuesday marks the latest mishap to mar the deployment of the Truman, which has been essential in the airstrike campaign by the United States against Yemens Houthi rebels.  On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump and Omans foreign minister both said that a ceasefire had been reached with the Houthis, who would no longer target ships in the Red Sea corridor.  A Houthi spokesman early Thursday sought to portray the ceasefire as a victory for the rebels, describing it as America stopping aggression in exchange for stopping attacks. The rebels claimed a drone attack on Israel on Wednesday, something acknowledged by the Israeli military without it being attributed to the rebels. It is ridiculous for Washington to claim that Sanaa raised the flag of surrender, but this is not important, Hashem Sharaf al-Din said in a statement carried by the state-run SABA news agency. What is important is that Yemens victory represented a major shift in the balance of power in favor of Yemen, which was able to force America to halt its aggression and stop its attacks. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, said he expects the Houthis in Yemen to uphold their commitment to stop firing on cargo vessels in the Red Sea. 
        
     Hopefully thats over with, and theyll leave those ships alone, he said. We take their word for it. Meanwhile, the Houthis continue to assess the damage after daytime Israeli airstrikes targeted Yemens rebel-held capital of Sanaa.  The F/A-18 Super Hornet landed on the Truman after a flight, but the arrestment failed, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to speak publicly about the incident now under investigation. Arrestment refers to the hook system used by aircraft landing on carriers, which catches steel wire ropes on the flight deck. It remains unclear what part of the system failed. The two pilots on board were later rescued by a helicopter and suffered minor injuries in the incident, the official added. No one on the flight deck was hurt. CNN first reported on the incident.  Tuesdays incident was the latest to see the Navy lose an F/A-18, which cost about $60 million. In April, another F/A-18 fighter jet slipped off the hangar deck of the Truman and fell into the Red Sea. The crew members who were in the pilot seat of the Super Hornet and on the small towing tractor both jumped away.  In December, the guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 after ships earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Both aviators in that incident also survived. And in February, the Truman collided with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt. The Truman, based out of Norfolk, Virginia, has seen its deployment extended multiple times amid the Houthi airstrike campaign. It had been joined recently by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier operating out of the Arabian Sea.  Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell wrote on the social platform X that an investigation was underway and that this aircraft was not struck by the Houthis. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group remains fully mission-capable, he added. The Israeli attack on Tuesday that targeted Sanaa International Airport devastated the airfield. Khaled al-Shaif, the head of the airport, told the Houthis al-Masirah satellite news channel that the Israeli strike destroyed the airports terminal and left craters in its runway.  Satellite images from Maxar Technologies showed craters and destroyed aircraft on the taxiways of the airfield.  At least six passenger planes were struck, including three belonging to Yemenia Airways, the countrys flag-carrying airline, he said. That leaves the airline with only one functional aircraft, which was spared only because it had left earlier in the day on a flight to Amman, Jordan. He put overall damage there at $500 million. With the damage, the airport was now out of service, al-Shaif said.  The International Committee of the Red Cross said the strikes on the airport, as well as earlier Israeli strikes on Hodeidas seaport, affected vital gateways for humanitarian aid and basic essentials such as food and medical supplies. After more than a decade of conflict in Yemen, civilians and the infrastructure they rely on cannot endure any further strain, it added. The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the groups leadership has described as an effort to end Israels offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually. The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. Meanwhile, a wider, decadelong war in Yemen between the Houthis and the countrys exiled government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, remains in a statemate.",https://apnews.com/article/uss-harry-truman-fighter-jet-aircraft-carrier-pilots-eject-0c3f39a4a08d013a428f5f7559c16413,business
Sothebys postpones auction of jewels associated with Buddha after backlash from Indias government,"HONG KONG (AP)  Sothebys on Wednesday postponed an auction of jewels associated with Buddhas remains after the Indian government opposed the sale and demanded it be halted. The gems for auction were found buried together in reliquaries with the corporeal relics of the historical Buddha and discovered in northern India in 1898, the auction house said. They dated back to around 240-200 BC, it said.  But Indias Ministry of Culture said in a Facebook post on Tuesday it had issued a legal notice to Sothebys Hong Kong to demand the immediate halt of the sale, accusing the auction of violating Indian laws, international norms and UN conventions. In its letter to Sothebys Hong Kong dated Monday, posted on Facebook, it said the auction involves sacred Buddhist relics that constitute the inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community. It demanded the repatriation of the relics to the Indian government and a public apology from the auction house and Chris Pepp. Pepp is a great-grandson of British William Pepp, who excavated the relics.  The Indian government warned in the letter that failure to comply would result in legal actions and public advocacy campaigns highlighting the auction houses role in perpetuating colonial injustice and becoming a party to unethical sale of religious relics.  Sothebys announced the postponement in a statement on Wednesday, acknowledging the matters raised by the Indian government and saying it was done with the agreement of the consignors.  
        
     This will allow for discussions between the parties, and we look forward to sharing any updates as appropriate, it said.  Some of Sothebys webpages about the auction were no longer available on Wednesday.  The Indian Ministry of Culture said on Facebook on Wednesday it was pleased to inform that the auction was postponed after its intervention.",https://apnews.com/article/southebys-auction-india-hong-kong-postpone-buddha-bc8e57a840347b577e81afb717ecc16b,business
Automaker owned by Taiwans Foxconn to make EVs for Japans Mitsubishi Motors,"Foxtron, an automaker partly owned by Taiwan iPhone manufacturer Hon Hai Technology Group, and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan said Wednesday they have agreed to develop an electric vehicle to be sold in Australia and New Zealand.  Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, is one of a growing number of technology companies that are leveraging their knowhow in electronics and communications to try to break into the EV market, snapping up links in the automotive supply chain.  Foxtron is a joint venture between Hon Hai and Taiwans Yulon Motor Co. Yulon makes Nissan vehicles under license.  There was speculation earlier this year, when talks on a possible merger between Nissan and Honda Motor Corp. fell through, that Hon Hai might make a bid for Mitsubishis alliance partner Nissan Motor Co.  The two companies said Wednesday that the EV developed by Foxtron will be produced by Yulon and introduced in Oceania in the second half of 2026.  Foxtron and Mitsubishi Motors gave no financial details and said their memorandum of understanding would be followed by further talks.  Japanese automakers like Mitsubishi have been stepping up efforts to compete in the EV segment as they contend with intense competition from their Chinese rivals. Mitsubishi has set a target for having all of its product lineup be EVs or hybrids by 2035.  Foxtron showcased its Model B, a sleek EV hatchback, and its automotive electronics at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. Foxconn lists 11 vehicle models on its website, including its Model T bus, Model V pickup truck, Model N van, its Model B, and its luxury flagship Model E sedan.",https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-hon-ev-mitsubishi-japan-cea083c0c1ad944a792317963a62820d,business
Merz stresses European unity and defense during his first trip as German chancellor,"BERLIN (AP)  Friedrich Merz plunged straight into international crises on his first full day as Germanys new chancellor Wednesday, presenting a united front with France against U.S. President Donald Trumps trade war, demanding more aid for Gaza and announcing he soon would visit Ukraine. Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron  firm believers in the European Union and leaders of the continents largest economies  used their first meeting since the German leaders appointment Tuesday to show unity on Ukraine and other issues causing alarm in Europe. They vowed to strengthen the continents security and increase defense spending. The tandem of Germany and France has long underpinned the 27-nation bloc, but lost some of its vigor in recent months as leaders in both countries wrestled with domestic issues. In a joint news conference, Merz acknowledged that Europe still needs the U.S. for peace in Ukraine. It is our firm conviction that we cannot end this war in Ukraine without further political and military engagement by the United States of America, he said. The Europeans cannot replace this at present. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports a long, stressful day in Germany politics ends with a new chancellor. Both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been exerting pressure on the EU, forcing it to rethink its own security. It was not clear when Merz would visit Ukraine. Macron said that France and Germany will accelerate defense cooperation, including jointly developing new defense technologies necessary for the wars of tomorrow. He listed working together on tanks, long-range missiles and combat aircraft. He also said that the countries would start regular meetings of a French-German defense council. 
        
     Merz also visited Poland on Wednesday and addressed his new governments plans to station more police at Germanys border to curb illegal migration and even turn away some asylum-seekers. If we, everybody together in the European Union, give the signal to those who are setting out for Europe without valid opportunities for entry, if we give this signal especially to the traffickers, that these routes are going to get a lot more difficult and that we are going to close them, then that is a joint and good signal, Merz said during a joint news conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Merz and Macron also demanded that Israel allow humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza. Israel cut off all aid to the territory over two months ago to try to pressure the Hamas militant group. Israel is preparing to ramp up its campaign against Hamas in a devastating war now entering its 20th month. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Israels offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, who dont distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count. Merz urged Israel to be more responsible  striking comments given Germanys past and present support for Israel. Macron said that France couldnt, on the one hand, defend Ukrainians sovereign and territorial rights while ignoring the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, saying: We cannot have double standards. Both men sought stability between India and Pakistan, saying they view the latest exchange of fire between these two nuclear powers with the utmost concern. India fired missiles into Pakistani-controlled territory early Wednesday, killing at least 31 people in what Pakistans leader called an act of war. India said it struck infrastructure used by militants linked to last months massacre of tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. The German leaders trip to Paris came the day after his historic defeat in the first round of voting in the German parliament. No other postwar candidate for chancellor has failed to win on the first ballot. He won in the second. Traditionally, newly elected chancellors make a point of visiting their big neighbors in the west and east on the first day in office to stress European unity. Merzs Paris stop showed that the new chancellor was plunging into world affairs, sending a message that Germany is back after his predecessors more timid approach. Macron touted their meeting as a new page in the French-German partnership. In particular, France is looking for German backing for increased EU defense spending in the face of Russias threat as well as concerns that Trump is pivoting from its post-World War II relationship with Europe to focus on countering China. The French president also said France and Germany would act hand in hand in the face of Trumps tariffs and work for a united European response and a balanced outcome that respects our interests. The stops in Paris and Warsaw occurred on the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germanys unconditional surrender in World War II. The meeting with Macron was particularly loaded with symbolism for the two countries that were bitter enemies in World War I and II. The first war ended with an armistice agreement signed in a railway car north of Paris. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler then used that railway car in accepting Frances capitulation in 1940, after its defenses succumbed to the German invasion. German-French friendship is a gift, a gift of forgiveness and reconciliation, especially for us Germans, Merz said. Polands leader re-affirmed his support for a strengthened European defense, which would include a stronger German military. It is not easy, considering history, to say out loud, as a Polish prime minister, that I would very much like Germany to arm itself faster and more intensively, Tusk said. Armed Germany in Poland is not a popular slogan, but fortunately today we live in times when there is a different Germany, a different Poland, different threats. ___ Leicester reported from Paris.

South Korea remains confident about $18b nuclear deal put on hold by Czech court,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  South Korean officials on Wednesday downplayed a Czech courts decision to put on hold an $18 billion project for South Korea to build two nuclear reactors in the country, describing it as a temporary setback and expressing confidence that the deal will eventually proceed. A South Korean consortium led by the state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power had expected to finalize the deal this week with a subsidiary of CEZ, the Czech Republics largest electricity supplier. However, a Czech court blocked CEZ from signing the contract while it reviews a complaint from French company EDF, which lost the bid to the South Koreans. South Korean Industry Minister Ahn Dukgeun told reporters in Prague that the courts decision would only delay the signing of the official contract, and that all other procedures would proceed on schedule, assuming that the deal goes through. He said that the Czech government clearly didnt anticipate the courts decision to pause the agreement, and that CEZ plans to appeal. It is not clear when the Czech Supreme Administrative Court could rule on that appeal. The Czech government did not think of (EDFs claims) as a major problem and invited us for the scheduled signing ceremony, Ahn said. It seems that the Czech governments judgement did not align with the courts ruling. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Wednesday his government respects the courts decision, before adding: I believe that the judges and the court realize how important this decision is and its impact on security of the Czech Republic and our national interests.  
        
     Lee Ju-Ho, South Koreas acting president, said that Seoul would communicate closely with the Czech side to ensure that the deal is finalized quickly.  In July, CEZ selected KHNP over EDF as the preferred bidder to build two 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactors at the Dukovany plant. EDF filed a court complaint last week after the Czech Republics competition regulator rejected its appeal over the bidding process. Before he was ousted last month over an ill-fated martial law imposition in December, former conservative South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol had pledged to boost the countrys nuclear power exports, arguing that they had suffered under the previous liberal governments push to reduce domestic reliance on nuclear energy. Yoons government had set a goal of exporting 10 nuclear power reactors by 2030.",https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-czech-nuclear-power-deal-court-e88fef0f634c1ad2e40bff6705bf3f5a,business
Slovakias leader rejects an EU plan to halt Russian natural gas imports by the end of 2027,"BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP)  Slovakias populist leader on Wednesday blasted a European Union plan to halt imports of Russian natural gas by the end of 2027 to deprive President Vladimir Putin of revenue that helps fuel the war in Ukraine. The European Commission, the blocs executive branch, will present a detailed plan next month. It will seek to ban new gas contracts with Russia by the end of this year and phase out existing ones still in use in the 27-nation EU by the end of 2027. Slovakias Prime Minister Robert Fico said the plan is absolutely unacceptable for his country and that his government was ready to veto it. He said the move would be harmful for Slovakia and the entire EU, because the price of gas will increase as a result.  Slovakia has a gas delivery deal with Russia that expires in 2034, and Fico said that he would seek compensations for damages, if the plan proceeds. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is pressing ahead with the plan, told EU lawmakers that Russia has proven time and again that it is not a reliable energy supplier. Dependency on Russia is not only bad for our security, but also for our economy. Our energy prices cannot be dictated by a hostile neighbor, she told members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Fico also rejected a proposal to halt imports of oil and nuclear fuel from Russia to the European Union.  
        
     Hungary and Slovakia  whose leaders are considered to be Putins closest allies in Europe  have blocked EU military assistance to Ukraine and have been expected to oppose the European Commissions gas plans. Fico, a divisive figure at home and abroad, returned to power in 2003 after his leftist Smer (Direction) party won a parliamentary election on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform. Known for his pro-Russia views, he has openly challenged the EUs policies over Ukraine. He is set to become the only EU leader to travel to Moscow for festivities on Friday marking the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. It will be his second trip to Moscow since December. His government has faced vocal protests against its pro-Russian stance and other policies.",https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-fico-eu-plan-halt-russian-gas-aa37148e4b4461b9d30fa826387be02a,business
"Edmunds: Five great budget performance cars for under $35,000","New car prices continue to rise for the latest high-performance sports cars. Even a new Chevrolet Corvette, long considered a performance bargain compared to the likes of the Porsche 911, has a starting price of almost $70,000. But that doesnt mean driving enthusiasts on a budget cant find a car thats both fulfilling to drive and genuinely capable.  The auto experts at Edmunds have come up with their five favorite performance vehicles for under $35,000. True, you wont be able to buy anything with a V8. The same applies to electric power  the best-value electric performers cost more. But the vehicles listed here have other distinct advantages. All of the following prices include destination fees. Theres some irony in the first vehicle in a list of budget-performance cars not being a car at all. But Dodges Hornet isnt your usual small SUV. First off, it has an Italian heritage. Though you wouldnt know it by its styling, the Hornet shares much of its mechanical design with the Alfa Romeo Tonale small luxury SUV. Second, its genuinely powerful for a pint-size SUV. The GT version has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that cranks out 268 horsepower and is good enough to get you from 0 to 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. Another bonus: It has standard all-wheel drive for all-season driving and more cargo space than the typical performance car. 2025 Hornet starting price: $31,590 A Ford Mustang GT with its rumbly V8 is well beyond our $35,000 price cap. But the less expensive Ford Mustang EcoBoost is a viable substitute. Having a turbocharged four-cylinder under the hood might seem like heresy, but you cant argue with the output of 315 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. With its 10-speed automatic spinning the rear wheels, the Mustang EcoBoost can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in a quick 5.6 seconds. The newest Mustang provides a classic American driving experience while being comfortable, stylish and well equipped with the latest technology features.  2025 Mustang coupe starting price: $33,515 Youre as likely to see a Mazda MX-5 Miata roadster in the hands of a cool-headed retiree on lonesome canyon roads as you are spotting one ripping through cones at an autocross. In both cases, the Miatas appeal comes down to the fun-to-drive fundamentals. A four-cylinder engine directs 181 horsepower to the rear wheels through either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Thats not much, but you dont need much when the car is as light as the Miata. A manual-equipped Miata went from 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds at the Edmunds test track. Beyond the numbers, the Miata is all about playfulness. Quick steering, nimble handling and an easy-to-lower top combine to make any drive worthwhile. 2025 MX-5 Miata starting price: $30,715  The Subaru BRZ and Toyota 86 are mechanically related. Both use a four-cylinder rated at 228 horsepower that sends its power to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Edmunds found these cars can sprint to 60 mph in about 6 seconds when equipped with the manual. Theres enough power to be entertaining but not enough to get a new driver in too much trouble, making these fantastic beginners sports cars. And theres a low center of gravity and classic rear-wheel-drive balance to help drivers enjoyably learn about car control. But the Toyabaru twins dont stop being fun once you master them.  2025 Toyota GR86 starting price: $31,135; 2025 Subaru BRZ starting price: $32,380 The Volkswagen GTI is the quintessential budget performance hatchback. Its fun and engaging to drive yet practical and comfortable day to day. Few cars can do as many things as well as the GTI. Its turbocharged four-cylinder engine produces 241 horsepower. For 2025, every GTI has a seven-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Edmunds has found its good for a 5.9-second 0-60 mph sprint. Besides performance, the GTI has a spacious cabin and a generous cargo area for its size. The original hot hatch that traces its American lineage all the way back to 1983 is a solid performance value. Starting manufacturers suggested retail price: $33,640 Spending less than $35,000 can get you a fun vehicle to drive in 2025. Each model here has distinct advantages. Youll likely prefer the Hornet or Golf GTI if space and practicality are priorities. The Miata, BRZ and GR86 all provide a great feel and connection to the road; picking one of these comes down to whether you want a convertible top or the extra security of a coupe. The Mustang cant be beat for its classic pony car styling and heritage.  ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

Disney parks thrive in second quarter and company adds 1.4 million new streaming subscribers,"Disney posted solid profits and revenue in the second quarter as its domestic theme parks thrived and the company added well over a million subscribers to its streaming service.  The company also boosted its profit expectations for the year, sending shares up 11% Wednesday.  Disney also announced that it will build a seventh theme park in Abu Dhabi.  For the three months ended March 30, Disney earned $3.28 billion, or $1.81 per share. The Burbank, California, company lost $20 million, or a penny per share, a year earlier. Removing one time charges or benefits, earnings were $1.45 per share, easily topping the $1.18 that Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.  Revenue rose 7% to $23.62 billion, also topping projections.  Revenue for Disney Entertainment, which includes the companys movie studios and streaming service, climbed 9%, while revenue for the Experiences division, its parks, increased 6%.  Recent box office hits include Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Its latest film, Thunderbolts(asterisk), is currently sitting atop the box office. CEO Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said in prepared remarks that theyre confident in this years movie slate, which includes Lilo & Stitch, The Fantastic Four: First Steps and Avatar: Fire and Ash. Disney, however, faces potential ramifications from the trade war launched by President Donald Trump. Other U.S. corporations have noted blowback by consumers in overseas markets and on Monday, Trump opened a new salvo in his tariff war, targeting films made outside the U.S. 
        
     Trump on Monday said that he had he authorized a 100% tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. Disney is already under scrutiny by the Trump administration. In March the head of the Federal Communications Commission said that he was opening an investigation into Disney and its ABC television network to determine if they are promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination. As of now, Disneys streaming business continues to grow. Its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, posted quarterly operating income of $336 million compared with $47 million in the prior-year period. Revenue increased 8%. The Disney+ streaming service had a 2% increase in paid subscribers domestically, which includes the U.S. and Canada. There was a 1% rise internationally, which excludes Disney+ HotStar.  Total paid subscribers for Disney+ edged up 1% in the quarter to surprising 126 million subscribers, from 124.6 million in the first quarter. The Walt Disney Co. previously said that it expected a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter when compared with the first three months of the year. Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions totaled 180.7 million, up 2.5 million from the first quarter.  A perfect cocktail of content helped Disney deliver a better than expected quarter as the companys streaming business continues to grow profitability, Mike Proulx, Forrester vice president and research director said in an email. As Disney eyes investments in local international content, it could be a sign that its trying to more directly take on Netflix which is known for its strong international slate.  Disney has benefited doubly from success at the box office as those productions become content for its growing streaming service.  Moana 2"" has more than 139 million hours streaming since hitting Disney+ on March 12, making it the biggest Walt Disney Animation Studios premiere on the platform since Encanto, Iger and Johnston said. The first Moana film remains the most watched movie on Disney+ with more than 1.4 billion hours streamed.  The Moana franchise also drives traffic at Disneys properties, with character meet and greets at theme parks and on cruise ships and the Journey of Water at Epcot at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.  The Experiences division, which includes Disneys six global theme parks, its cruise line, merchandise and videogame licensing, reported operating income rose 9% to $2.5 billion. Operating income climbed 13% at domestic parks. Operating income dropped 23% for international parks and Experiences, due to softness at its Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks. While Disney continues to pull levers to successfully manage all of the different components of its business, it also continues to work on its search for a successor to Iger, the face of Disney for most of the past two decades.  Disney created a succession planning committee in 2023, but the search began in earnest last year when the company enlisted Morgan Stanley Executive Chairman James Gorman to lead the effort. Disney does have some time, as Iger agreed to a contract extension that keeps him at the company through the end of 2026. Disney is looking at internal and external candidates. The internal candidates are widely believed to include the chairman of Disney-owned ESPN, Jimmy Pitaro, Chairperson of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Josh DAmaro, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden. Disney is projecting full-year adjusted earnings of $5.75 per share, which is better than the $5.43 per share that analysts polled by FactSet are looking for. The companys previous guidance was for high-single digit adjusted earnings per share growth for fiscal 2025.",https://apnews.com/article/disney-iger-hulu-trump-12a484b389359d746c703898d71697c3,business
Czech central bank cuts key interest rate to 3.5% as inflation drops more than expected,"PRAGUE (AP)  The Czech Republics central bank cut its key interest rate again on Wednesday, with lower-than-expected inflation. The cut brought the interest rate down by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.50%. The bank had kept the rate unchanged at its previous policy meeting in March. Analysts predicted the cut was likely, but also said the uncertainty over the tariff policies of U.S. President Donald Trump was an argument in favor of no change. The bank started to trim borrowing costs by a quarter-point on Dec. 21, 2023, to boost the economy, and further cut rates by half or a quarter of a percentage point several times last year. Inflation dropped to 1.8% year-on-year in April, the lowest level in seven years, preliminary data by the Czech Statistics Office indicated on Tuesday. It was 2.7% year-on-year in March. The size of the Czech economy was up 1% in 2024 compared with the previous year. The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 20 countries that use the euro currency, lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25% on April 17 for the seventh time. The U.S. Federal Reserve was expected to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% later on Wednesday, despite weeks of harsh criticism and demands from Trump that the Fed reduce borrowing costs.",https://apnews.com/article/czech-central-bank-rates-50a3e17d19df95c65f8e6ee8f631debd,business
Less farmland is going for organic crops as costs and other issues take root,"SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP)  Farmer Jeremy Brown taps the nose of a young calf. I love the ones with the pink noses, he says. This pink-nosed animal is just one of about 3,200 cattle at Twin Birch Dairy in Skaneateles, New York. In Browns eyes, the cows on the farm arent just workers: Theyre the boss, theyre the queen of the barn. Brown, a co-owner at Twin Birch, is outspoken on the importance of sustainability in his operation. The average dairy cow emits as much as 265 pounds (120 kilograms) of methane, a potent climate-warming gas, each year. Brown says Twin Birch has worked hard to cut its planet-warming emissions through a number of environmentally sound choices. Ruminants are the solution, not the problem, to climate change, he said.

He stepped over an electric manure scraper used to clean the animals barn.  
        
     The electric scraper means the dairy doesnt have to use a fuel-burning machine for that particular job. Twin Birch also recycles manure for use on crops, cools its milk with water that gets recirculated for cows to drink and grows most of its own feed.

(Caitlyn Daproza via AP) Despite all that, the farm has no desire to pursue a U.S. Department of Agriculture organic certification, Brown said. Doing so would add costs and require the farm to forego technology that makes the dairy business, and ultimately the customers jug of milk, more affordable, he said. He raises a question many farmers have been asking: Is organic farming just a word?  An increasing number of American farmers think so. Americas certified organic acreage fell almost 11% between 2019 and 2021. Numerous farmers who implement sustainable practices told The Associated Press that they have stayed away from the certification because its costly, doesnt do enough to combat climate change and appears to be losing cachet in the marketplace. Converting an existing farm from conventional to organic agriculture can cost tens of thousands of dollars and add labor costs. The rules governing the National Organic Program were published in 2000, and in the years after, organic farming boomed to eventually reach more than 5 million acres. But that has been declining in recent years. Any downward trend is significant, as organic farms make up less than 1% of the countrys total acreage, and organic sales are typically only a tiny share of the nationwide total.  Shannon Ratcliff, a farmer and co-owner of organically certified Shannon Brook Farms in Watkins Glen, New York, attributes the decline to a 2018 fraud case in Iowa involving a farmer selling grain mislabeled as certified organic. The whole thing went crazy  work requirements for farmers ramped up and inspection levels were higher, she said. Its also just a tough business, Ratcliff said.

(Caitlyn Daproza via AP) Frank Mitloehner, a professor in animal science in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at University of California Davis, said lack of flexibility and efficiency are driving farmers away from organic in an era of rising prices for farmers. He said organic standards need to be overhauled or the marketplace risks organic going away completely. I am in awe that so many organic farmers were able to produce that way for that long, he said. It seems that they are losing consumer base in these financially troubling times.  Still, there are consumers determined to buy organic. Aaron Swindle, a warehouse employee at a chain supermarket, spends every Sunday morning shopping for organic groceries at the Brighton Farmers Market. The taste quality is different when its growing nearby, Swindle said. He calls the Finger Lakes of New York a trifecta, a region that contributes dairy, produce, and meat for its residents. John Bolton, owner of Bolton Farms in Hilton, New York, said he has some reservations about organic certification, but hes pursuing it for his hydroponic farm, which grows produce in nutrient-rich water instead of soil. It produces greens such as kale and chard and is popular as a supplier for restaurants in western New York, and draws waves of regular customers at the Rochester Public Market on weekends. Bolton doesnt use pesticides. On a chilly day this spring, he was at his greenhouse unloading 1,500 ladybugs to do the work of eliminating the operations aphids. Thats the kind of practice organic farms use to earn the certification, he said. Bolton Farms owner John Bolton looks up as he works at the hydroponic farm Friday, March 21, 2025, in Hilton, N.Y.

"Disney to build its 7th theme park, this one in the United Arab Emirates","Disney will build its seventh theme park, this one in the United Arab Emirates, the entertainment company said Wednesday.  The waterfront resort will be built on Yas Island on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, already home to Formula Ones Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the Ferrari and Warner Bros. amusement parks, SeaWorld and a waterpark.  Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Home to 9 million people, it has leveraged its long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways to bring in more tourists over the years. A real-estate boom and the citys highest-ever tourism numbers have made Dubai a destination as well as a layover.  Disney and Miral, the Abu Dhabi developer overseeing the project, hope to capitalize on the 120 million airline passengers that travel through Abu Dhabi and Dubai each year.  While long viewed as more buttoned up than the beaches and raucous nightlife in neighboring Dubai, Abu Dhabi also is home to the Louvre Abu Dhabi and there are more museums currently under construction. The theme park announcement is being made ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the region next week. Trump has promised a series of business deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE. The theme park will be built and operated by Miral, but Disney will handle the design and development. Disney will also license its intellectual property and provide development and management services, according to a regulatory filing.  
        
     The California company will not be providing any capital for the project. It will earn royalties based on the resorts revenues. It will also earn service fees. Miral has been involved in the development of almost all of the entertainment complexes built on the island.  A projected opening date has not been announced. Shares of Disney, which also reported second-quarter financial results on Wednesday that beat Wall Streets expectations, jumped more than 9% in morning trading.",https://apnews.com/article/disney-abu-dhabi-miral-yas-uae-trump-831fe2e23068b5d487765c53a7d52e63,business
Moderna study shows immune response in older adults for a combo flu and COVID-19 shot,"A combination shot for flu and COVID-19 using messenger RNA generated antibodies in a study, but U.S. government regulators want to see data on whether the new vaccine protects people from getting sick. Researchers from vaccine-maker Moderna reported in a study published Wednesday that the new combo shot generated a stronger immune response against COVID-19 and most strains of flu than existing standalone shots in people 50 and older. Side effects were injection site pain, fatigue and headaches. Moderna previously reported a summary of the results from the company-sponsored trial in 8,000 people. The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. Moderna believes mRNA could speed up production of flu shots compared with traditional processes that use chicken eggs or giant vats of cells. A combo shot also might improve vaccination rates, the researchers wrote in the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. Greg Poland, who studies vaccine response at Mayo Clinic and was not involved in the new study, said hes not convinced that a combo shot would be popular. And while flu comes in seasonal waves, COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the year, Poland said, posing challenges for how to time the shots to keep protection strong. Hed also like to see data on how well the new shot protected people from infection and hospitalization. 
        
     The findings are based on measuring antibodies in participants blood after 29 days, an indication of short-term disease protection.  Last week, Moderna pushed its target date for the vaccines approval to 2026 after the Food and Drug Administration requested a more direct measure: how much the shot lowered the risk of disease. I agree in this case with FDA that efficacy data are important to see, Poland said. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cast doubt on the safety of mRNA vaccines, but Moderna President Stephen Hoge told investors in an earnings call last week that talks with the FDA were productive and business as usual. Also last week, Novavax said the FDA was asking the company to run a new clinical trial of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine after the agency grants full approval, sowing uncertainty about other vaccine updates. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Feds vow to overhaul US air traffic control system while fixing problems at troubled Newark airport,"A deadly midair collision in January between a military helicopter and a commercial airliner, several additional crashes and technical problems that resulted in mass cancellations at New Jerseys biggest airport have prompted officials to pledge a fix for the nations outdated air traffic control system and vow to hire more controllers. Doing so, they say, would help ensure safety and prevent the kind of problems that have plagued the Newark, New Jersey, airport since its radar system briefly failed last week.  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to unveil a multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nations air traffic control system Thursday, while the Federal Aviation Administration works to quickly solve technology and staffing problems in Newark and avoid similar crisis elsewhere. Amid turmoil, one thing seems clear: An aging system struggles to handle the nations more than 45,000 daily flights. Its uncertain whether Duffys plan that President Donald Trump supports will get the necessary congressional funding to be more effective than previous reform efforts during the last three decades. But Duffy says its necessary. Already more than $14 billion has been invested in upgrades since 2003 but none have dramatically changed how the system works. We are on it. We are going to fix it. We are going to build a brand new system for all of you and your families and the American people, Duffy said. 
        
     But details are scant. Its unclear whether the plan will involve privatizing the air traffic control system as Trump backed in his first term. Duffy has not highlighted that possibility. Thursdays announcement is expected to attract dozens of unions, which would likely oppose privatization, along with trade groups, industry representatives and family members of victims of the January crash. For years, the system has operated well enough to be largely neglected by every administration, said University of Illinois professor Sheldon Jacobson, who has studied risks in aviation. But well enough isnt good enough when it comes to air travel because peoples lives are at risk. Jacobson is skeptical Duffys proposal will succeed. But there could be renewed support following the collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter over Washington D.C. in January, and a plane that flipped and caught fire in Toronto. The weaknesses of the nations air traffic control system have for years been highlighted in reports and hearings. Most recently, a Government Accountability Office review released in March declared that 51 of the FAAs 138 systems were considered unsustainable and another 54 were potentially unsustainable. A 2023 outage in FAAs Notice to Airmen system forced the grounding of every flight nationwide for more than two hours.  Were dealing with an outmoded system and we have an outdated infrastructure, said former Continental Airlines CEO Frank Lorenzo, who helped establish a major hub in Newark that United Airlines still maintains years after acquiring Continental. We havent really given it the attention that it requires. The president of National Air Traffic Controllers Association told Congress that the majority of the FAAs telecommunications infrastructure at more than 4,600 sites relies at least in part on aging copper wires, instead of more reliable fiber optic lines that can handle more data. Unexpected outages related to those lines routinely cause ground stops at airports and appear to have led to the problems in Newark. The radar system air traffic controllers in Philadelphia use to direct planes in and out of the Newark airport went offline for at least 30 seconds on April 28. That facility relies on radar data sent over lines from New York that may have failed, some of which are old copper phone lines. The FAA relies on those lines because Newark controllers were moved from New York to Philadelphia last summer to address staffing issues. The FAA said Wednesday it plans to replace any old copper wires with fiber optics and add three new data lines between New York and Philadelphia. The agency is also working to get additional controllers trained and certified. It wasnt immediately clear how long either step will take, but Duffy has said he hopes the situation in Newark will improve by summer, which is when an ongoing runway construction project is scheduled for completion. Several controllers remain on extended trauma leave after the radar outage, which worsened staff shortages in Philadelphia. In response, the FAA has slowed traffic in and out of Newark to ensure flights can be handled safely, leading to cancellations. Duffy also said FAA will meet with all airlines to determine how many flights the airport can handle. On Wednesday, Newark led the nation with 42 canceled departures and 46 canceled arrivals, according to FlightAware.com. Thats even after United cut 35 daily flights at the airport starting last weekend. The FAA has made incremental improvements as part of its Nextgen program that was established in 2003. Advancements include development of the ADS-B system that provides more precise aircraft locations to controllers and other planes. That system has been a focal point of the investigation of the January crash because the Black Hawk helicopter was not using it to broadcast its location at the time of the collision. Duffy has also tried to supercharge air traffic controller hiring by shortening the time it takes to get into the academy and improving student success rates. The FAA is also offering bonuses to experienced controllers to discourage early retirement. A major challenge to upgrading the aviation infrastructure is that the FAA must keep the current system operating while developing a new system  and then find a way to seamlessly switch over. Thats partly why the agency has pursued more gradual improvements in the past. The problem has existed for decades. Its not because of neglect, but because its a hard problem to solve, said Jeff Guzetti, who is a former accident investigator who also worked in the Transportation Departments Inspector Generals office for several years that was focused on aviation. And it requires money and good management. And the FAA has been has had shortages of both money and in some cases good management for years.",https://apnews.com/article/aviation-safety-crash-newark-air-traffic-control-8c529cd72fab0bcb42ba286682553d6e,business
"The more Trump talks about making trade deals, the more confusing the tariff picture gets","WASHINGTON (AP)  The more President Donald Trump talks about his efforts to reach deals with Americas trading partners, the more confusing the tariff picture gets. His team seems good with that, saying Trump is using strategic uncertainty to his advantage. Trump says the United States does not have to sign any agreements, and that it could sign 25 of them right now. He says he is looking for fair deals on all sides, and that he does not care about other countries markets. He says his team can sit down to negotiate the terms of a deal, and that he might just impose a set of tariffs on his own. I am struggling to make sense of it, Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in an email. Late Wednesday on his social media site, Trump wrote that hell be holding a news conference Thursday morning concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. He added that it would be THE FIRST OF MANY!!! Although Trumps team holds up his best-selling book The Art of the Deal as proof that he has a master plan, much of the world is on tenterhooks. That has meant a volatile stock market, hiring freezes and all kinds of uncertainty even as Trump continues to promise that new factories and jobs are on the horizon. A look at how the trade talks may play out:  
        
     As part of any deal, Trump wants to keep some of his tariffs in place. He believes the import taxes can generate massive revenues for a heavily indebted federal government even though other countries see the whole point of striking a deal as getting rid of tariffs. Theyre a beautiful thing for us, Trump said recently about tariffs. If you can use them, if you can get away with using them, its going to make us very rich. And well be paying off debt, well be lowering your taxes very substantially because so much money will be taken in that well be able to lower your taxes even beyond the tax cut that youre going to be getting. So far this year, the U.S. government has collected $45.9 billion from tariffs, about $14.5 billion more than last year, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Those revenues could escalate sharply given the 10% baseline tariffs, the 145% rate being charged on Chinese goods and rates as high as 25% on steel, aluminum, auto and Mexican and Canadian imports.

(Adrian Wyld /The Canadian Press via AP) Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump engage in a meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C., Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (Adrian Wyld /The Canadian Press via AP) To reach Trumps stated goals of repaying the $36 trillion debt and reducing income taxes, his tariffs would need to raise at least $2 trillion annually without causing the economy to crash in ways that lead to lower overall tax revenues. That would be close to impossible mathematically. The Republican administration has said 17 of its major 18 trading partners have essentially presented them with term sheets, which list the possible compromises that they are prepared to make. Agreeing to a mutual understanding of the terms would be only the start of any trade talks. But foreign leaders have said it is unclear exactly what Trump wants or how deals could be codified into a durable agreement. They also know Trump approved the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2020, only to charge new tariffs on those same two trading partners this year.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP) Canadas Prime Minister Mark Carney gestures to a reporter as he takes questions during a news conference at the Canadian embassy in Washington, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP) While meeting with Trump on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested the next version of that agreement would need to be strengthened to prevent a repeat of the fentanyl-related tariffs imposed this year by Trump that Canada saw as arbitrary.  Some things about it are going to have to change, Carney said.  The 145% tariffs on China  and the 125% tariffs on the U.S. that Beijing imposed in response  hang over the entire negotiating process. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledges that those tariffs are not sustainable.  The first talks between the U.S. and China are set to begin this weekend in Switzerland, but they will likely be limited to finding ways to de-escalate tensions enough for meaningful negotiations to take place. The key issue is that China is the worlds dominant manufacturer, which makes also makes it a leading exporter in ways that can supplant domestic industries. Because China suppresses domestic consumption and focuses on production, the rest of the world buys what it makes because there is not enough internal demand. The U.S. wants to rebalance trade, but it has done so also through tariffs on countries that could be its natural allies in defending their auto and tech industries against China. Obviously in this trade puzzle, China is the biggest piece, Bessent said this week. Where do we end up with China? Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian has suggested that a meaningful way for the Trump administration to jump-start talks would be to pull back on its rhetoric and punitive import taxes. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop threatening and pressuring and engage in dialogue with China on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit, Lin said Tuesday.

(Chinatopix Via AP) Containers are pile up at a container terminal in Shanghai, China, Sunday, April 20, 2025. (Chinatopix Via AP) Asked on Wednesday whether he would reduce the tariffs on China as a condition for negotiations, Trump said, No. The president also disputed statements by the Chinese government that his administration sought the talks in Geneva. Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files, Trump said. Not necessarily. Trump unilaterally imposed his universal tariffs without Congress, using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so, which has led to multiple lawsuits. The administration also maintains that any agreements to change the rates would not need congressional approval. Previously, presidents, including Trump in his first term with his Phase One China deal, could negotiate only more limited agreements that have focused on select bilateral trade and tariff issues, according to a Congressional Research Service report updated this April. Other examples of limited deals include a 2023 agreement on critical minerals and a 2020 deal on digital trade with Japan. The challenge is that Trump has also made nontariff barriers such as safety regulations for autos and the value added taxes charged in Europe part of his talks. He wants other countries to change their nontariff policies in exchange for the U.S. reducing the new tariffs he introduced. Other countries, in return, might object to U.S. subsidies to its companies. In theory, it would take House and Senate approval to complete a deal that would address non-tariff barriers and require changes to U.S. law, the Congressional Research Service report said. If other countries fail to satisfy him, Trump has suggested he will just do some kind of internal deals and set a tariff rate, although he technically already did that with his April 2 Liberation Day tariffs. The import taxes announced by Trump then led to a financial market sell-off that caused him to pause some of his new tariffs for 90 days and charge the lower 10% baseline rate while negotiations take place.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) It appears Trump will agree not to impose the originally threatened tariffs if he thinks other countries are making adequate concessions, essentially meaning that the U.S. gives up nothing because the tariffs are new. But Trump might also pull back his tariffs without necessarily getting much in return. Trump is notorious for making maximalist demands and then retreating as negotiations go on, so well see how long he sticks with his formula, said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. But so far it is pretty clear that countries coming in and wanting a normal trade negotiation with both sides making substantive concessions are being rebuffed.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-deals-china-trade-02986c700a2d46c8b1ba85afe77d139f,business
"Energy Star, efficiency program that has steered consumer choice, targeted in cuts","An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.  The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President Donald Trumps sharp turn away from the prior administrations focus on climate change. The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agencys core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback. The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the programs website says. People recognize it right away, so they would be like oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one, said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said. Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues. Trumps proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPAs entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.  But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said Americas energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time. Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products energy use. The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star. The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the programs website, DOEs role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.  The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that would meet the administrations goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.  The move is the latest in the Trump administrations broader deregulatory effort. Theyve announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.  The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.  Trump targeted Energy Star during his first stint in the White House, but faced backlash. For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an energy emergency, Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency, Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Missouri poised to become first U.S. state to exempt stock sale profits from income taxes,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP)  Investors who profit from selling stocks, real estate and other assets soon could reap an even larger benefit in Missouri, which is poised to become the first U.S. state to exempt capital gains from its income tax.  Legislation that won final approval Wednesday would halt the capital gains tax this year for individuals and could eventually eliminate it for corporations, if state revenues keep growing. The tax repeal now heads to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has said hes very supportive of it.  Though proponents hope it can spur the economy, detractors assert that the capital gains tax repeal will primarily benefit the rich and result in less tax revenue for public schools and services. The Republican-led Legislature overcame objections by Democrats only after expanding the bill with greater tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and new sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products. Missouris unique income tax carve-out comes as Republican-led legislatures in at least eight other states have passed more traditional income tax rate reductions this year. It also comes as Congress weighs whether to renew and expand income tax breaks enacted during President Donald Trumps first term in office. 
        
     Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency or property. The federal government taxes long-term capital gains, on assets held for more than a year, at a lower rate than ordinary income.  All states that tax income also tax capital gains. Missouri currently is among 32 states and the District of Columbia that tax capital gains at the same rate as wages and other income, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation. Eight states tax capital gains at a lower rate than other income.  
        
     Some Democratic-led states have been moving in the opposite direction. Maryland lawmakers last month passed a bill that would impose a 2% capital gains tax on those with incomes over $350,000. And Washington lawmakers recently passed legislation to impose an extra 2.9% tax on capital gains over $1 million. Minnesota already imposes a surcharge on capital gains and other investment income over $1 million.  Proponents of axing the capital gains tax say the tax discourages investment and incentivizes people to hold onto assets instead of selling them and spending money elsewhere in the economy.  When you tax something you get less of it, said Jonathan Williams, president and chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an association of conservative lawmakers and businesses. The idea is, of course, you want more investment in your state. Though ALEC has long backed the repeal of state capital gains taxes, Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said the idea came to him last year from friends at an employee-owned construction company that was getting hit with the tax. He said his legislation also could benefit family farmers who want to sell their land.  The capital gains tax results in lost economic opportunity, financial sclerosis, lower wages -- all of which serve to make Missouri less competitive both domestically and internationally, said Republican state Sen. Curtis Trent, who handled the bill in the Senate.  Opponents say the wealthy will get the greatest reward.  Repealing Missouris tax on capital gains would set a worrisome precedent nationally and worsen economic and racial inequities, said Sam Waxman, deputy director of state policy research at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  One government study found that white families are more likely to report capital gains than some minorities. Among middle-income taxpayers, about 8% of white families benefited from the federal governments tax rates on capital gains and dividends compared to just 3% of Black families and 1% of Hispanic families, according to a 2023 U.S. Treasury Department report.  In Missouri, about 542,000 individual income taxpayers reported capital gains in 2022, amounting to just one-fifth of all filers, according to the Missouri Budget Project, a nonprofit research group that opposes the capital gains tax repeal. The group estimates that 80% of the tax relief would go to the wealthiest 5% of taxpayers. Legislative researchers estimate Missouris capital gains tax repeal could cost the state about $262 million annually when fully implemented. But thats disputed by both supporters and opponents.  The Missouri Budget Project estimates the cost could be nearly $600 million annually.  Trent predicts the tax repeal will trigger increased economic growth (that) will translate into increased tax revenue over time.  Owen Zidar, an economics and public affairs professor at Princeton University, studied the impacts of 584 capital gains tax rate changes in states over four decades. Capital gains tax cuts tend to result in more people selling assets for gains, but not so much as to offset the lost tax revenue, he said.  Zidar said he is skeptical of claims that Missouris capital gains tax repeal will attract a lot of investment and economic activity. I think its going to be a substantial revenue decrease, he said.",https://apnews.com/article/capital-gains-tax-repeal-missouri-b5a9c79db57b6d10369b2449b98b1b19,business
New report shows NYC helicopter breaking apart in midair before crash that killed 6,"NEW YORK (AP)  Federal officials on Wednesday released images of a doomed New York City sightseeing helicopter as it broke apart in midair last month, killing six people. The series of still photographs taken from surveillance camera video shows the fuselage, containing the engine and rotors, separating from the helicopters tail. The rotor blades and the transmission then detach from the cabin thats carrying the passengers and the pilot.  The images were included in the preliminary report about the flight released by the National Transportation Safety Board.  Several witnesses described hearing several loud bangs emanating from the helicopter before it broke up and descended into the river, the report says.  Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine helicopter pilot, said the sequence of images shows the helicopter yawing severely and the tail boom failing, suggesting it was most likely struck by the aircrafts main rotor blades during flight. Its clear that some mechanical issue precipitated the breakup, he said.  The initial report, which runs about six pages, does not address the initial cause of the breakup. That, Green said, will likely be determined by a forensic examination of the wreckage itself, including the rotor blades, the engine and transmission. A tail strike could be caused by a pilot not handling a loss of power emergency and allowing the rotor rpm to decay, which makes the rotors flap up and down more and that can cause a strike, he said. 
        
     The aircraft, a Bell 206L-4 built in 2004, also appeared to be fairly old and well used, according to Green.  At the time of the crash, the helicopter had operated about 50 hours since its last inspection on Feb. 27, according to the NTSB report. The helicopters airframe accrued nearly 13,000 total hours of operation, and the engine accrued more than 23,000 hours. Federal Aviation Administration records also show the aircraft had a maintenance issue last September involving its transmission assembly. The NTSB will be looking at the overhaul and maintenance records to make sure everything is up to date, Green said.  The NTSB said previously that the aircraft, operated by tour company New York Helicopter, was not equipped with any video or data recording devices. But on Wednesday, it said photos taken beforehand show that the pilot, Seankese Johnson, was wearing computer-augmented sunglasses, which would have had video and audio recording capability. The glasses have not been recovered. Johnson, a 36-year-old former Navy SEAL, received his commercial pilots license in 2023 and had logged 790 hours of flight time, the NTSB report said. But he didnt appear to be particularly experienced flying a Bell 206L-4, observed Al Yurman, a retired NTSB investigator. The agency said in its report Johnson had fewer than 50 hours of flight in that type of aircraft.  Its quite sophisticated for that type of work, Yurman said. I would prefer to have someone more experienced, but well know more when the full report comes out. The report said Johnson worked a 10 days on/10 days off schedule and the April 10 flight was his first day back after 10 days off. The flight was also the eighth that day for the pilot and the helicopter. The aircraft was on a typical tour, departing from the downtown heliport by Wall Street around 3 p.m. and flying north along the Manhattan skyline before heading south toward the Statue of Liberty. Less than 18 minutes into the flight, witnesses saw the tail and main rotor break away and smoke pouring from the spinning helicopter. In recent years New York Helicopter, the tour company, went through bankruptcy and faced ongoing lawsuits over alleged debts.  The company has said it is cooperating with authorities in the investigation. No one answered the phone at its office or responded to an email seeking comment on Wednesday. The crash was among a recent string of aircraft disasters and close calls that left some people worried about the safety of flying in the U.S. It also revived concerns about the popular and costly aerial tours over New York City. Five commercial sightseeing helicopters have gone down in the rivers around Manhattan since 2005 as a result of mechanical failure, pilot error or collision, killing 20 people. The April 10 crash killed a prominent family from Barcelona, Spain: Agustn Escobar, 49; Merc Camprub Montal, 39; and their children Victor, 4, Mercedes, 8, and Agustin, 10.  Officials have said Escobar, global CEO of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, was in the New York area on business.  Montal, who worked for Siemens Energy and was the granddaughter of a former president of the famous Barcelona FC soccer club, flew in with their children to meet him.",https://apnews.com/article/new-york-fatal-helicopter-crash-ntsb-investigation-c0350c1bbb78edaa238aded56eda3342,business
"How major US stock indexes fared Wednesday, 5/7/2025","U.S. stocks ended a choppy day higher after the Federal Reserve left its main interest rate alone, as was widely expected, but also warned about rising risks for the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% Wednesday. The index is coming off a two-day losing streak that had snapped its nine-day winning run.

Google partners with Elementl Power on nuclear energy sites as power demand for AI grows,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Google is partnering with Elementl Power on three project sites for advanced nuclear energy as the energy required to power burgeoning artificial intelligence projects rises sharply.  Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Google will provide capital for the projects, which the companies say will each produce 600 megawatts of power capacity. No dollar figure for Googles investment was given. Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation, said Amanda Peterson Corio, Googles head of data center energy. Google and Elementl said they will collaborative with utility and regulated power companies to identify and advance new projects. We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid, said Elementl Power Chairman and CEO Chris Colbert. U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industrys power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles. Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute. Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal governments regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms. 
        
     In October, Amazon announced that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, just two days after a similar announcement by Google.  A month before that, Constellation Energy, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said it it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers.  Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nations worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. Amazon, Google and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions.

States sue the Trump administration for blocking funds for electric vehicle charging,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump s administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday. The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden  part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available. The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administrations authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority. These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it short-sighted of Trump to revoke the funds. We wont sit back while the Trump administration violates the law, Bonta, a Democrat, said.  The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing  although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met. 
        
     Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades. It was expected that states would fight against the federal governments efforts to slow the nations electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration. Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trumps Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.  Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nations EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.  Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. Its a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as charging deserts. Its also a problem for people who cant find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China. Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon  and the nation  by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding, Newsom said, referencing Trumps recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk. The Trump administrations effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.  During Trumps first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry. The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House. ___ St. John reported from Detroit. ___ Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Texas may put restraints on new big businesses hoping to tap into the energy grid,"ODESSA, Texas (AP)  Texas will need a lot more energy in the future. Driven largely by demand from businesses such as data centers and the oil and gas industry, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the states grid operator, predicts the states energy needs will nearly double in six years. State Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford, worries ERCOT is not working with a full picture. He told a legislative panel as much in February. We do not have accurate load forecasting. No one knows if the forecast is real, he said. Large companies, he added, are requiring ERCOT to plan for load growth at dramatically higher levels than experienced ever in the history of Texas, and frankly, ever in the history of the United States. And without credible data, we run the risk of overbuilding, with high costs being passed on to consumers, or underbuilding, further exacerbating scarcity, he said. He believes his legislation, Senate Bill 6, will put restraints on the states open-energy market, and help the grid plan for the future to save rate payers money and avoid another catastrophe when extreme weather strikes again. The bill, which has already won Senate approval and is expected to start its journey in the Texas House Wednesday with a committee hearing, would place more requirements on businesses meant to help ERCOT better forecast the electricity needs. Businesses would also have to pay more in advance of operating. 
        
     While business groups have said they agree the grid needs more security, they believe Kings bill is too heavy-handed. They said some of his proposals wont help ERCOTs planning and put their operations at risk. They want changes to the bill, such as removing language that would grant ERCOT the ability to disconnect power to major energy users during an emergency, and new rules on arrangements between power generators and companies. Michael Jewell, an attorney who has represented large industrial companies on energy issues and policy, said Kings legislation will need to strike a balance between addressing the growth without scaring companies away. This legislation is important to finding that balance, that we can bring these large loads into the ERCOT region, grow the Texas economy, and support the development of this technology, he said. But we also want to be sure that we, as Texans, will continue to have reliable electricity. Kings bill only applies to industrial-sized facilities, or those needing more than 75 Megawatts. Under the bill, businesses wanting to plug into the grid must disclose whether they have similar requests elsewhere in Texas or out of state. Companies must tell ERCOT if their backup generators can meet at least 50% of their power. During an emergency, ERCOT could instruct facilities to use that power, instead of the grid. Another provision allows ERCOT to shut off a facilitys power in an emergency. ERCOT must give the facilities a days notice. Facilities sometimes negotiate directly with power generators, like gas-fired plants, to satisfy their electricity needs without connecting to the grid. The bill gives the Public Utility Commission, which regulates electricity and some water and wastewater, authority over such arrangements, allowing it to approve or reject them, in addition to 180 days of review. Companies would also have to pay an electric, municipal utility or a cooperative at least $100,000 to study the transmission work necessary to transport electricity to their facilities. Companies must also demonstrate that they can afford to contribute to the construction of transmission lines and purchase any equipment or services. The bill also directs the utility commission to determine how to better allocate transmission costs, including looking at peak demand, the point at which supply meets demand. King acknowledged the strain on the states power grid means more businesses are moving to Texas, something he supports. I want to make it very clear that while this load growth is a strain on the ERCOT grid, it is also an excellent opportunity for the state of Texas, King said in February. So long as we manage it properly (and) not create reliability risks or pricing issues for everyday Texans. Groups consisting of the facilities King is targeting said parts of his proposals wont benefit ERCOTs efforts to make the grid reliable or lower prices. Dan Diorio, a government affairs expert for the Data Center Coalition, a national group, said it is supportive of the goals the bill is trying to reach. But in its current form, the group said it has lingering concerns as the bill moves through the House, including a provision requiring companies to disclose information that he said is unnecessary for the grid, such as out-of-state requests for electricity. He said ERCOT can separate serious requests within Texas. This is a highly competitive industry, he said. So not only do we have competitive concerns about that, because this is proprietary information, but how is that going to inform the forecast correctly? He said diesel makes up most backup power generation, and is a fuel overseen by the federal government and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Forcing companies to run emergency generators could lead to air emissions violations and air pollution, Diorio said. Diorio added that the information data centers collect and maintain  including from local and state authorities  could be put at risk when the system shuts down. Proposing to shut off power, even with a notice, could risk public safety, adding that the bill does not offer enough specificity regarding how the shut-off would be implemented. Walt Baum, president of Powering Texans, a group representing natural gas power generators, said the bill imposes administrative requirements on agreements between power companies and facilities. In this case, the company would pay the power generator directly for the needed electricity. Baum said a company could otherwise go directly to the grid, drawing out the same amount of electricity it would have gotten from the generator directly. The amount of energy used would not change. And the impact on the grid is the same, he said. ___ This story was originally published by The Texas Tribune and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",https://apnews.com/us-news/texas-phil-king-general-news-cffb42e58fad37bd67a5187f126ef9a3,business
"US trade deficit hits record high as businesses, consumers try to get ahead of Trump tariffs","NEW YORK (AP)  The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of President Donald Trumps latest and most sweeping tariffs  with federal data showing an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products. The deficit  which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys  has roughly doubled over the last year. In March 2024, Commerce Department records show, that gap was just under $68.6 billion. According to federal data released on Tuesday, U.S. exports for goods and services totaled about $278.5 billion in March, while imports climbed to nearly $419 billion. Thats up $500 million and $17.8 billion, respectively, from February trade. Consumer goods led the imports surge  increasing by $22.5 billion in March. And pharma products in particular climbed $20.9 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis noted, signaling that drugmakers sought to get ahead of Trumps threats to slap tariffs on the sector. While we had known consumer goods accounted for the bulk of Marchs rise, we can now see pharmaceutical products were $20 billion higher  almost all of which were imported from Ireland, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote in a Tuesday research note. Uncertainty remains high, and broader signs of front-loading may be visible in coming months. Because pharma accounted for so much of this surge, the big rise in imports doesnt necessarily mean other sectors used March to stockpile in the same way. Retailers, for example, may not have bought as many clothes, toys and furniture from abroad  perhaps because they were already feeling the effects of previously-implemented levies, some analysts say, or because they decided to hold off on rushing in new inventory amid uncertainty.  
        
     Either way, this may signal supply challenges down the road  with shoppers potentially seeing barer shelves for products that run out of inventory in the coming months. Still, imports of capital goods, like computers, as well as automotive parts and cars, also increased in March. But industrial supplies and materials, such as metal and crude oil coming into the U.S., fell  notably as steel and aluminum tariffs and other levies impacting energy took effect. And service-based imports like travel also decreased. Overall, imports are flooding into the U.S. for products that have  or rather, are feared to soon be  caught in the crosshairs of the ongoing trade wars. Since taking office in January, Trump has threatened and imposed a series of steep tariffs. Much of March, in particular, was filled with anticipation and uncertainty leading up to what the president called Liberation Day on April 2, when he announced new import taxes on nearly all of Americas trading partners. With the exception of China, higher tariff rates for many countries have since been postponed  but other sweeping levies remain. The White House insists that new tariffs will help close long-standing trade deficits (the U.S. hasnt sold the rest of the world more than its bought since 1975), reinvigorate manufacturing in America and generate government revenue. But economists are warning of significant consequences for businesses, households and economies worldwide under the rates that Trump has proposed.  These new tariffs are already increasing operating costs for businesses that rely on a global supply chain  which, in turn, will hike prices for a range of goods that consumers buy each day.  The recent surge in imports reflects efforts by companies across the country to bring in foreign goods before more duties kicked in. New orders for manufactured durable goods, for example, jumped 9.2% to $315.7 billion in March, Census Bureau data released last month shows. Marchs trade deficit surpasses the last monthly record of $130.7 billion reported in January  also amid tariff uncertainty after Trump took office, marking a more than $32 billion jump from December. All of this contributed to shrinking economic growth in the first three months of the year. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. gross domestic product  or output of goods and services  fell at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March, marking the first drop in three years.  Imports grew at a total 41% pace for that period, its fastest rate since 2020, shaving 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. But that surge is likely to reverse in the second quarter, removing some weight on GDP.",https://apnews.com/article/economy-trump-deficit-imports-4c7e61748f7d17c35dd6eb3091e9a681,business
Trump says the US will stop bombing Yemens Houthis after rebels say theyll stop targeting ships,"WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump said Tuesday that hes ordering a halt to nearly two months of U.S. airstrikes on Yemens Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have indicated that they dont want to fight anymore and have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route.  Were going to stop the bombing of the Houthis, effective immediately, Trump said at the start of his Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.  That likely means an abrupt end to a campaign of airstrikes that began in March, when Trump promised to use overwhelming lethal force after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israels mounting another blockade on the Gaza Strip.  AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Trump says Yemens Houthis will stop fighting, and the U.S. will stop striking them. At the time, they described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. Trump said the Houthis had indicated to U.S. officials that they dont want to fight anymore. They just dont want to fight. And we will honor that, and we will stop the bombings.  His announcement came the same day that Israels military launched airstrikes against the Houthis that it said fully disabled the international airport in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Israels attacks were its second round of airstrikes on targets in Yemen in retaliation for a Houthi missile strike Sunday on Israels international airport. A U.S. official said the administration had not notified Israel of the agreement with the Houthis before Trump talked about it publicly.  
        
     Israel, according to this official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic talks, was irked by the unexpected news  particularly because the Houthis have continued to launch attacks on Israel proper and other Israeli targets. Israel does not appear to be covered by the U.S.-Houthi agreement.  Appearing before reporters again later Tuesday, this time for the swearing-in of senior adviser and special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump was asked about the possibility that the Houthis would continue to attack Israel and responded, I dont know about that, frankly. But I know one thing, they want nothing to do with us, Trump said. And theyve let that be known through all of their surrogates and very strongly. In his comments during the earlier meeting with Carney, Trump said the Houthis had capitulated but, more importantly, we will take their word that they say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. And thats what the purpose of what we were doing.  I think thats very positive, Trump added. They were knocking out a lot of ships. Asked how the Houthis had communicated that they were looking to stop being targeted by U.S. bombs, Trump offered few details, saying only with a chuckle that the information came from a very good source.  Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, confirmed that the U.S. bombing campaign was ending, posting on X that discussions involving the U.S. and Oman, as well as negotiators in Yemen, have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides. In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping, he wrote, calling the agreement a welcome outcome. In a statement, the Houthis said that its position toward Gaza hadnt changed and its initial understanding with the U.S. would not impact its support for the Palestinians. It wasnt clear in the statement whether it was on board with the agreement with the U.S. The costs of the U.S. munitions used against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen in daily attacks since March 15 have totaled more than $750 million, another U.S. official said. The Trump administration has dropped more than 2,000 munitions on more than 1,000 targets, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details on the strikes. The total is only a fraction of the total costs of the operation. It doesnt account for the costs of operating two aircraft carriers, their accompanying warships or the flight hours of the aircraft. It also doesnt include the Houthis destroying seven U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones, at a cost of more than $30 million apiece, or the loss of an F/A-18 fighter jet and tug from the carrier USS Harry S. Truman when it maneuvered to avoid a Houthi missile and the jet fell off the carrier. Despite Trumps framing of the deal as a way to reopen the Red Sea to commercial shipping without fear of Houthi attack, the Houthis have not fired on a commercial ship since December, Gregory Brew, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group risk-analysis firm, said on X. They are likely, however, to continue shooting at Israel, Brew noted. As to the Houthis continuing to attack Israel - they do so at Irans own peril, Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on social media. The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the groups leadership has described as an effort to end Israels war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.  The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. Those strikes Trump had ordered were similar to ones carried out against the Houthis multiple times by the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden. The Trump administration actions gained a higher profile in the public consciousness when The Atlantic revealed that Hegseth had texted sensitive plans for a military strike against the Houthis on a group chat in the messaging app Signal that mistakenly included the magazines editor-in-chief. Trump stood by Hegseth and downplayed the breach as a glitch. But national security adviser Mike Waltz, who created the group chat on Signal, left his post last week and has been nominated by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Lee, Tara Copp and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489,business
Critic of drug industry and COVID-19 measures to lead FDA vaccine program,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration, has been named to oversee the agencys program for vaccines and biotech drugs. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the appointment Tuesday in a message to agency staff, praising Prasads long and distinguished history in medicine. Prasad is the latest in a series of medical contrarians and critics of COVID-19 measures to join the federal government under President Donald Trump.  Unlike political roles such as FDA commissioner, the job Prasad is stepping into has traditionally been held by an FDA career scientist. His appointment raises new questions about whether vaccines and other new therapies will face unnecessary scrutiny from regulators.  Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, FDAs longtime vaccine chief who resigned in March after clashing with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over concerns about the safety of vaccinations. In a social media post, Prasad likened Marks to a bobblehead doll that just stamps approval.  Last year, he told former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy that Americans would probably be better off without the FDA in its current form. If youre talking about FDA 2024, I think theyd probably be better off as a result of not having the FDA Prasad said during an appearance on Ramaswamys podcast. 
        
     A professor at the University of California San Francisco, Prasads medical training is in cancer and blood disorders. He first came to prominence among academics more than a decade ago for a series of papers scrutinizing the evidence behind new cancer therapies. Research by Prasad and his colleagues showed that many cancer drugs fast-tracked by the FDA have never been shown to improve or extend patient lives. Instead, the drugs are often approved based on alternate measures, such as the ability to shrink tumors, which are thought to predict long-term survival in patients. The FDA has long defended this practice as a way of accelerating approval of medicines for gravely ill patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prasad reached a much broader audience as a critic of vaccine and mask mandates, lockdowns and moves to speed the availability of booster shots from Pfizer and Moderna. Many of his views mirror those of other Trump appointees, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya.  In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. Those patients received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild.  The paper concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions, prompting pushback from many health experts. Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said Tuesdays announcement bodes extremely poorly for vaccine approvals in the U.S. This decision will invariably result in decreased vaccine access for the public, less transparency, and fewer approvals, Rasmussen wrote in an email. In recent years, Prasad became a regular on podcasts associated with Kennedys Make America Healthy Again movement, which often portrays the FDA as beholden to the pharmaceutical industry. Prasads appointment is likely to rattle drug and vaccine makers, who depend on the predictability of FDA standards and procedures to guide drug development plans that can span years or even decades. ___ Associated Press writer JoNel Aleccia contributed to this story. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The EU seeks to halt Russian gas imports by the end of 2027 and ban new contracts already this year,"BRUSSELS (AP)  The European Union should halt imports of Russian natural gas by the end of 2027 to deprive President Vladimir Putin of revenue that helps fuel his war on Ukraine, the blocs executive branch said Tuesday. Under a detailed plan to be presented next month, the European Commission would seek to ban new gas contracts with Russia by the end of this year and phase out existing ones still in use in the 27-nation EU by the end of 2027. Putin has shown that he doesnt mind weaponizing gas, EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jrgensen said as he outlined the plan. We do not want to fill up his war chest and support his war economy because who knows which countries will be next. Jrgensen said the EU had completely cut coal purchases from Russia and drastically lowered oil and gas imports since the war on Ukraine began in 2022, but that 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) in energy revenue still reached Moscow every month last year. I am a little bit embarrassed that last year we still paid 23 billion euros ($26 billion) to Russia whilst they are in war with our friends in Ukraine, Jrgensen told reporters in Strasbourg, France. The EU says it has cut gas imports from 45% to 19%, and oil from 27% to 3%, of its prewar levels. But that still makes it Russias biggest gas client, with pipelines in operation across the Black Sea, Belarus, and Turkey, according to the Energy and Clean Air think tank. 
        
     Ten countries continue to import energy from Russia. Those that still take its gas via pipelines include Greece, Hungary and Slovakia. Austria, Poland and the Baltic countries  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  have phased out their imports. Hungary and Slovakia  whose leaders are considered to be Putins closest allies in Europe  have blocked EU military assistance to Ukraine, and are sure to oppose the commissions gas plans. However, the EUs executive branch appears determined not to let them veto the plan and is ready to propose a system that would only have to be endorsed by about two-thirds of the 27 member countries, and possibly by the European Parliament. Jrgensen said that by the end of this year, each country would be required to submit plans showing how they intend to stop imports of Russian energy and that existing spot market contracts would be banned, measures that would eliminate one-third of imports. He conceded that the plan would face challenges but said that it would be introduced in a gradual, coordinated way, with EU support being provided if needed to those countries that are hardest hit. Russia is a threat to all of us. Therefore, we must act, Jrgensen said. ___ McNeil contributed to this report from Barcelona, Spain.",https://apnews.com/article/europe-russia-gas-contracts-2027-hungary-slovakia-64a06c9062832ff92047cb736b896f78,business
Senate confirms Bisignano to lead Social Security Administration as agency faces DOGE overhaul,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Wall Street veteran Frank Bisignano was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday to lead the Social Security Administration, taking over at a turbulent time for the agency that provides benefits to more than 70 million Americans.  The Senate confirmed Bisignano in a 53-47 vote.  Bisignanos confirmation comes after a months-long series of announcements at the Social Security Administration of mass federal worker layoffs, cuts to programs, office closures and a planned cut to nationwide Social Security phone services, which were eventually walked back.  Many of the changes are driven by the Trump administrations Department of Government Efficiency, headed by billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who said this week that he is preparing to wind down his role with the administration. The upheaval has made Social Security a major focus of Democrats, including former President Joe Biden, who said in his first public speech since leaving office that Republican President Donald Trump has taken a hatchet to the program.  Bisignano, a self-professed DOGE person, has served as chair of Fiserv, a payments and financial services tech firm since 2020. He is a one-time defender of corporate policies to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. Bisignano takes over from the agencys acting commissioner, DOGE supporter Leland Dudek. Bisignanos term ends in January 2031. Asked during his March confirmation hearing whether Social Security should be privatized, Bisignano responded: Ive never heard a word of it, and Ive never thought about it. 
        
     Democrats and activists have for weeks railed against Bisignanos confirmation, holding rallies and other events protesting his nomination. During the final roll call vote, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden called Bisignano unfit to be the steward of Americans Social Security benefits. Wyden said Trump wants Bisignano to gut Social security, and that Republicans who support Bisignanos confirmation would be to responsible if their grandmother misses a Social Security check and cant pay rent. By confirming Mr. Bisignano, the Senate will be signing a death sentence to Social Security as we know it today, Wyden said. The chaos at the the agency began shortly after acting commissioner Michelle King stepped down in February, a move that came after DOGE sought access to Social Security recipient information. That prompted a lawsuit by labor unions and retirees, who asked a federal court to issue an emergency order limiting DOGEs access to Social Security data. Most recently, the full panel of judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 9-6 not to lift restrictions on the access that DOGE has to Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans. Also in February, the agency announced plans to cut 7,000 people from the agency payroll through layoffs, employee reassignments and an offer of voluntary separation agreements, as part of an intensified effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce. Dudek also announced a plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices. That sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population. That plan has since been rolled back.

Congress sends Trump a resolution ending Biden-era rule targeting rubber tire emissions,"DETROIT (AP)  Congress has voted to kill a Biden-era rule requiring rubber tire makers to clean up planet-warming emissions from their manufacturing processes in the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency finalized rules for the rubber tire industry, specifically previously unregulated rubber processing, last November through amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Tires are made of chemicals, compounds and materials that release greenhouse gases, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds, experts say. Republican Virginia Congressman Morgan Griffith, alongside South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, also Republicans, introduced a resolution to undo the rules earlier this year and it advanced through the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to reverse recently adopted federal agency rules with a simple majority vote in each chamber. The vote passed in the House on March 5 and the Senate on Tuesday. The measure heads to the presidents desk for signing next. Like many of the regulations issued during the waning days of the Biden-Harris Administration, the rubber tire manufacturing emission standard utilized questionable emissions data and pointed to negligible health benefits as justification for the rule, Griffith said in a statement Tuesday. He said the rule did not serve public health. The standards regulate other so-called source categories including asbestos, asphalt roofing processing and manufacturing, dry cleaning, petroleum refineries, other chemical production and processes and more, which  in addition to the environmental concerns  can cause cancer and other serious health problems, according to the EPA. 
        
     The rubber rule resulted from a court decision that required the EPA to address unregulated emissions from source categories upon the agencys technology reviews as required by the Clean Air Act. Plaintiffs in the case included the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, a nonprofit organization representing communities located near historically dirty air. Another case, led by the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League based in South Carolina, also called out the EPA for missing sources of HAPs and said it did not set rules in a timely manner. Aimed at meeting Clean Air Act requirements, the EPA said at the time that the rubber rule changes would cut total hydrocarbons and filterable particulate matter  or solids that can be captured on a filter, known as fPM  emissions by approximately 171 tons per year.  Scott previously said the rule was a last-minute Biden EPA regulation that was based on questionable data and imposes onerous one-size-fits-all pollution controls. The industry argues that tire factories would be required to install costly new air pollution control equipment that could harm American manufacturing jobs. The nation is home to major tire makers including Michelin North America, headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, and Goodyear, in Akron, Ohio. The two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The measure marks the latest of this administrations efforts to deregulate industry in the name of bolstering American manufacturing. The EPA first said it would reconsider National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants regulations for rubber tire manufacturing and other notable industries as part of a 31-action deregulation blitz announced on March 12. Republicans have generally been using the Congressional Review Act to wage an assault on the previous administrations many efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In a statement to The Associated Press, the EPA said: Once a law, EPA will work expeditiously to rescind the overly burdensome rule, noting agency Administrator Lee Zeldins recent efforts speaking specifically with the South Carolina manufacturing industry on issues such as this one.  The U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association said the vote reduces financial burdens on tire manufacturing facilities. Tire manufacturers have long understood and complied with existing standards, Anne Forristall Luke, president and CEO of the industry group said in a statement. To the group, the November rule creates an adverse environmental impact, while imposing significant financial burdens on tire manufacturing facilities and providing negligible, if any, benefits. But Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, called the measure yet another of many attempts to unravel protections for human health and the environment and part of an endless quest to accommodate the countries biggest polluters. Ahead of Tuesdays vote, Whitehouse said on the Senate floor that the resolution would deny clean air protections to the American people with particular harm to American children whose lungs and brains, still developing, are most vulnerable to the effects of these pollutants. ___ Read more of APs climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate reporter.

Court upholds racketeering convictions of ex-Ohio House speaker and lobbyist in $60M bribery scheme,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  A federal appeals court upheld the racketeering convictions of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and an ex-lobbyist on Tuesday in a $60 million bribery scandal described as the largest corruption scheme in state history. The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati represented a win for the Department of Justice, which had secured the convictions in March 2023 after a yearslong investigation. Householder, a Republican, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and lobbyist and former Ohio Republican Party chair Matt Borges was sentenced to five years in prison.  Acting U.S. Attorney Kelly A. Norris said the appeals panels unanimous decision affirmed the strength of the governments evidence, the correctness of the jury instructions, and the fairness of the proceeding. Householder was convicted of masterminding a $60 million bribery scheme funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. to elect allies, secure power, pass a $1 billion bailout of two of its affiliated nuclear plants and then defend the bill, known as House Bill 6, from a repeal effort. Prosecutors had described Borges primary role in the scheme as working to thwart a ballot campaign aimed at repealing the tainted legislation. Specifically, he was accused of paying $15,000 to someone who was helping spearhead the effort in order to get inside information. The referendum ultimately failed to make the ballot.  
        
     Scott Pullins, a long-time legal and personal adviser to Householder, called it a sad and disappointing day for both men and their families and supporters, and even a sadder day for constitutional free speech and the rule of law. He said in a Substack post that Householder raised undisclosed, unlimited donations for a 501c4 organization that supported him and his political allies  just as speakers before and after him have done. But the federal government singled only Mr. Householder out for prosecution. Householder has a couple long shot legal options remaining: He could ask for a review by the full Sixth Circuit, or seek whats known as certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, hoping for consideration by the nations highest bench. Both types of requests are rarely granted. A message seeking comment was left for Householders criminal defense attorney.  Householders appeal failed on all six claims he brought in hopes of a reprieve. He alleged erroneous jury instructions, insufficient and inadmissible evidence, violations of his right to counsel, judicial bias and that his sentence was unreasonable for the circumstances. The 65-year-old Householder argued that the government was wrong in describing what he had engaged in as a bribery scheme. Instead, he cast the money that flowed from FirstEnergy into a network of secret dark money accounts that he controlled as legal campaign contributions. Federal prosecutors charged that the money was given to Householder in exchange for the passage of House Bill 6, providing the necessary quid pro quo to make his conduct illegal.  Householder had also faulted U.S. District Judge Timothy Black in his appeal, asserting that he failed to properly instruct the jury that an agreement is necessary to prove bribery and that Householder needed to have agreed he would take action on a specific and focused question or matter at the time that agreement was struck. The judicial panel said all of his claims failed.  Borges appeal hinged on three technical points of law. All failed, as well, though he could also ask for review by the full appellate court or the U.S. Supreme Court. However, Circuit Judge Amul Thapar wrote in a concurring opinion that each of Borges contentions raises tricky and unresolved issues in honest services fraud jurisprudence. And here, Borges has a good argument his conduct fell within a murky middle: perhaps objectionable, but not clearly illegal, he wrote. Until the Supreme Court revises its caselaw, however, we must follow its precedent. Dennis Belli, Borges attorney, noted a part of Thapars concurrence that said ""(t)he Tinkerbell strategy  clap if you believe hes guilty  doesnt cut it when we think about criminal convictions.  Tinkerbell strategy aptly describes the prosecutions use of an alleged violation of a misdemeanor statute in the Ohio Elections Code to obtain a felony racketeering conviction of Borges in federal court, Belli said, noting that his client denies that the statute even applies to his conduct. I will be studying the 64-page ruling closely and thoughtfully, and will advise my client regarding his options going forward. ___ Bruce Shipkowski contributed to this report from Toms River, N.J.",https://apnews.com/article/bribery-investigation-ohio-householder-firstenergy-548b850df5bb837f0e489a2f7deb1b03,business
Scott Frosts return to UCF earns him a five-year contract valued at $22.1M; starting salary $3.9M,"Scott Frost received a five-year, $22.1 million contract upon his return to UCF and will have it automatically extended a year if the Knights appear in a bowl this season. An executive summary of Frosts contract was obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday through an open records request. UCF rehired Frost in December after Gus Malzahn left after four seasons to become offensive coordinator at Florida State. Frost had his first head coaching job at UCF in 2016, and the Knights went 6-7. A year later, UCF went 13-0 with a conference championship, a bowl victory over Auburn and final ranking of No. 6. Frost took over at Nebraska in 2018 and went 16-31 at his alma mater. He was fired three games into the 2022 season. He was out of coaching in 2023 and on the Los Angeles Rams staff in 2024. Frosts starting salary will be $3.9 million, just under the $4 million he earned in his last year at Nebraska, and will receive annual increasing topping out at $5 million in 2029-30. He can earn bonuses of $75,000 for reaching a conference championship game, $50,000 for winning a conference title, $100,000 for appearing in a College Football Playoff game and an additional $100,000 for winning one, with a first-round bye deemed a win. He also will receive bonuses for his team ranking in the top 20 nationally in any of eight designated statistical categories. ___ AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football",https://apnews.com/article/ucf-scott-frost-9a80787c338f08fcd8e67f816eda5629,business
Thousands of chickens euthanized in South Africa after they were left starving and eating each other,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  Animal welfare officers faced the grisly task of euthanizing more than 350,000 chickens by hand after they were left starving and cannibalizing each other when a South African state-owned poultry company ran out of money to feed them, officials said Tuesday. The National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or NSPCA, said it wasnt able to say for certain how many other chickens had already died by the time its officers reached several neglected poultry farming sites because of the mass cannibalism that took place among the birds.  The NSPCA managed to save more than 500,000 chickens, it said. It was a harrowing scene, the NSPCA said in a statement. Skeletal chickens huddled together, chickens eating one another, feeding lines stripped bare. The chickens were owned by Daybreak Foods, a major poultry supplier owned by South Africas state asset management company Public Investment Corp.  NSPCA officers were first alerted to a crisis at one farm on April 30. The organization uncovered at least five other farms in northern South Africa with multiple sites on each farm where birds had been left to starve, it said. Daybreak Foods was denied permission to take the birds to a slaughterhouse because they were too small. There was no immediate response to an email message seeking comment from Daybreak Foods late Tuesday. 
        
     Company spokesperson Nokwazi Ngcongo told the Daily Maverick news outlet that the birds went unfed for a period of time due to financial challenges affecting feed delivery. She said efforts had been made to limit animal suffering as much as possible. Nazareth Appalsamy, the manager of the NSPCAs farm animal protection unit, told The Associated Press that the mass culling began last Wednesday and was only completed on Monday. Around 75 animal protection officers were tasked with euthanizing the chickens that werent able to recover one by one, Appalsamy said. Culling took a real toll on the staff, being exposed to such extreme measures, he said. The NSPCA said the chickens hadnt been fed for more than a week and pledged to file a court case against Daybreak Foods under animal protection laws for abandoning its responsibilities. The South African government said it is in talks with Daybreak Foods leadership over its financial troubles. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",https://apnews.com/article/chickens-euthanized-animal-neglect-farm-61459549d78555f7fe121d6461b6bd41,business
Controllers briefly lost contact with Newark planes before wider flight disruptions,"The long flight delays and cancellations plaguing Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and spilling over to airports across the U.S. can be traced to a week ago when air traffic controllers temporarily lost communications with planes in the sky, according to the controllers union. Crews in the Philadelphia air traffic control facility that lines up flights going in out and of Newark lost radar and communications with the planes on April 28, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The outage left controllers unable to see, hear, or talk to planes under their control, union spokesperson Galen Munroe said. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed the brief problem and said traffic into the Newark airport was reduced afterward as a precaution to ensure safety. But that move led to the widespread delays and canceled flights. After the breakdown, a number of controllers took leave under a contract provision that allows them to step away after experiencing a traumatic event on the job. Having those controllers on leave exacerbated staff shortages at the facility. The flight disruptions that have trickled down to airports in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas renewed calls to upgrade aviation technology and infrastructure, and address the nationwide air traffic controller shortage, a problem the Trump administration has pledged to solve.  
        
     The whole system needs to be redone, Duffy said Tuesday at the White House. On Thursday, he plans to detail the administrations multibillion-dollar proposal to overhaul the nations air traffic control system that has been in the works since the aftermath of the deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., in January. Congress will have to approve funding for that plan. Controllers handling the planes in Newark lost communication for 30 seconds last week after the control centers primary communication line went down and a backup line failed to kick-in, he said. Former air traffic controllers said briefly losing contact with one plane was not uncommon but dropping communication with all of them would be unusual. Even then there are safeguards and backups. Duffy said that in this situation the backup line didnt immediately come online. If the pilot doesnt respond right away, you dont have them set up where they could collide, said Jordan Morales, who worked 12 years as a controller before leaving the job in 2022.  During a total outage, the control center would call an adjacent facility to take over the air space, he said. Airplanes also have built-in systems that allow pilots to know whats around, he added. Its a tense moment, particularly if its at critical point in the flight, said Todd Yearly, who spent 13 years as a controller in Chicago. Neither of the former controllers, though, said the latest trouble shook their confidence in flying. Safety was maintained that should be the story. In the moment when it mattered, they did their job, Yearly said. After the communications outage, traffic was slowed in and out of the Newark airport, the nations 12th busiest.  Travelers flying out of Newark on Tuesday said they were constantly checking for delays. Joseph Rierson, who was going to Spain with his wife, said they had tried to change plans. But they said the flights still scheduled and on time, so we couldnt do that yet, he said. United Airlines, which operates the most flights out of Newark by far, cut 35 daily Newark flights from its schedule beginning Saturday. United CEO Scott Kirby said the technology used to manage the planes failed more than once last week. Kirby said its clear Newark wont be able to handle the amount of planes currently operating there in the coming months. Last week, he called on the Federal Aviation Administration to limit arrival and departure slots at Newark  a practice used at three of the nations busiest airports where demand exceeds the airports capacity: Reagan National outside Washington and New York Citys LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports.  The union representing 55,000 flight attendants also has voiced concern, asking the airlines to cut flights operating out of Newark until the situation improves. The FAA moved the controllers responsible for the Newark airport from a facility in Long Island, New York, to Philadelphia last year partly to try to address chronic staffing shortages at the New York facility. But only 24 of the 33 controllers responsible for the Newark airspace made the transfer, leaving the Philadelphia facility shorthanded. At the time of the move, controllers union questioned whether the FAA had the equipment and procedures to handle the complicated transfer. Last fall, The Air Current trade magazine reported on several radar failures in Philadelphia related to lines that send data from New York to Philadelphia. The Trump administration has said it wants to supercharge the air traffic controller workforce and address the shortage of controllers. It announced a program last week to help recruit new controllers and give existing ones financial incentives not to retire early. But it takes years to train new air traffic controllers and get them certified. Duffy has said he hopes that the new hiring efforts might be able to have the system fully staffed within three or four years. It is absolutely going get worse, David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector, said in an interview. And something needs to be done about it because of the fact that, first of all, it takes a long time to hire controllers and get them in place. And you cant just turn on a switch, you can just go to the closet and pull out a new air traffic controller and say, here you go, we got new people now. ___ Associated Press reporters Darlene Superville and Joseph Frederick contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/newark-airport-flight-delays-cancellations-united-4d3a3e226608583df5c292389f3c3b37,business
Top US officials will meet with Chinese delegation in Switzerland in first major talks of trade war,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Donald Trump sparked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their counterparts in Geneva in the most-senior known conversations between the two countries in months, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. It comes amid growing U.S. market worry over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods.  No country has been hit harder by Trumps trade war than China, the worlds biggest exporter and second largest economy. When Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs on April 2, China retaliated with tariffs of its own, a move that Trump viewed as demonstrating a lack of respect. The tariffs on each others goods have been mounting since then, with the U.S. tariffs against China now at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%.  American firms have already begun canceling orders from China, postponing expansion plans and hunkering down as a result of the tariff war. After plans for the talks had been announced, Bessent said on Fox News The Ingraham Angle that as the U.S. has engaged in negotiations with various trading partners, China has been the missing piece. 
        
     The current situation, he said, isnt sustainable ... especially on the Chinese side. He added that current high tariff levels were the equivalent of an embargo. We dont want to decouple. What we want is fair trade. Trump had claimed previously that the U.S. and China were holding negotiations on lowering tariffs, which Beijing has denied, saying Trump must first lower his stiff tariffs.  The Chinese Commerce Ministry on Tuesday confirmed the meeting between its vice premier and Bessent in Switzerland. The Chinese side carefully evaluated the information from the U.S. side and decided to agree to have contact with the U.S. side after fully considering global expectations, Chinese interests and calls from U.S. businesses and consumers, said a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson said China would not sacrifice its principles or global equity or justice in seeking any agreement. Most economists have said the cost of the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. And the higher prices are already becoming a burden on U.S. consumers, who are in the biggest economic funk since the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, economists say the risk of a recession is growing. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official and now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the upcoming meeting is a welcome development.  As the first face to face meeting between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since Trumps inauguration, its an important opportunity to have initial talks on unwinding some tariffs, mapping out a path forward, as well as raising concerns, Cutler said. We should not expect any quick victories  this will be a process that will take time. In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, according to readouts from their respective offices.  Both Greer and Bessent had talked with their counterparts before the beginning of the trade war. Greer told Fox News Channel last month that he spoke with his Chinese counterpart for over an hour before the trade war started. I thought it was constructive, he said, adding: This is not a plan just to encircle China. Its a plan to fix the American economy, to have a greater share of manufacturing as GDP, to have real wages go up, to be producing things instead of having an economy thats financed by the government. And Bessent in February spoke with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to exchange views on the bilateral economic relationship, according to a Treasury news release.  ___ Associated Press writer Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-trade-switzerland-bessent-2a3335ed92989dc4b3a74ea550b79b3f,business
"Alabama lawmakers approve tax cuts for food, diapers and other items","MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP)  Alabama lawmakers on Tuesday voted to cut the state sales tax on food and to exempt diapers, baby formula and menstrual hygiene products from the state sales tax altogether.  The Alabama Senate approved both bills by votes of 34-0. The bills now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. The food tax reduction comes as lawmakers in both parties said families are being hurt by soaring grocery prices. The reduction, if signed into law, will lower the state sales tax on food from 3% to 2% beginning Sept. 1. Lawmakers in 2023 reduced the tax from 4% to 3%. An additional reduction to 2% was planned but hinged on budget growth that did not materialize. Were still one of a few states that taxes groceries. Were headed toward zero taxes, were headed in the right direction. This is big, Republican Rep. Danny Garrett, the sponsor of the bill, said.  The reduction will cost the state about $121 million annually in tax revenue that would otherwise goes to the Education Trust Fund.  The leader of Alabama Arise, an advocacy group that supports policies that help low-income families, said the grocery tax belongs in the dustbin of history.  The grocery tax drives many families deeper into poverty, and Arise remains committed to the goal of eliminating it entirely, Alabama Arise Executive Director Robyn Hyden said.  Lawmakers also approved a bill that will exempt baby formula, maternity clothing, diapers and menstrual hygiene products from state sales tax. Baby wipes, breast pumps and bottles would also be exempt. The exemption from the 4% sales tax will cost the state about $13 million annually.

WeightWatchers files for bankruptcy protection to eliminate debt burden,"NEW YORK (AP)  WeightWatchers said Tuesday it is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to eliminate $1.15 billion in debt and focus on its transition into a telehealth services provider. Parent WW International Inc. said it has the support of nearly three-quarters of its debt holders. It expects to emerge from bankruptcy within 45 days, if not sooner. WeightWatchers, which was founded more than 60 years ago, has struggled recently. In 2023, the company moved into the prescription drug weight loss business  particularly with the $106 million acquisition of Sequence, now WeightWatchers Clinic, a telehealth service that helps users get prescriptions for drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Trulicity. Its latest earnings report Tuesday showed that first-quarter revenue declined 10% while its loss on an adjusted basis totaled 47 cents per share. However, clinical subscription revenue  or weight-loss medications  jumped 57% year over year to $29.5 million. In September, WW International CEO Sima Sistani  resigned, and the New York company named Tara Comonte, a WeightWatchers board member and former Shake Shack executive, interim chief executive. Comonte, now CEO, said in a statement Tuesday that, As the conversation around weight shifts toward long-term health, our commitment to delivering the most trusted, science-backed, and holistic solutions grounded in community support and lasting results  has never been stronger, or more important.

Nevada high court weighs public access to secretive legal spat over control of Murdoch media empire,"LAS VEGAS (AP)  Nevadas high court is weighing whether to open up courtroom access and unseal records in the secretive legal dispute over who will control Rupert Murdochs powerful media empire after he dies. The case has been unfolding behind closed doors in state court in Reno, with most documents under seal. But reporting by The New York Times, which said it obtained some of the documents, revealed Murdochs efforts to give control to just one of his sons to ensure that Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant. The Nevada Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on a bid by media outlets including the Times and The Associated Press to let the public in on the Murdochs legal spat. The court said it will issue its decision at a later date.  Murdochs media empire, which also includes The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, spans continents and helped to shape modern American politics. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since his father stepped down in 2023. The issue at the center of the case is Rupert Murdochs family trust that would divide control of the company equally among four of his children  Lachlan, Prudence, Elisabeth and James  after his death. Irrevocable trusts are typically used to limit estate taxes, among other reasons, and cant be changed without permission from the beneficiaries or a court order. 
        
     Rupert Murdoch has attempted to alter the trust. But Prudence, Elisabeth and James have united to try to stop that, according to the Times. James and Elisabeth are both known to have less conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating the media moguls desire to keep Fox News political tone. The dispute has had many twists and turns, including a probate commissioner ruling against Rupert Murdoch in December. In a 96-page opinion, the commissioner characterized the plan to change the trust as a carefully crafted charade to permanently cement Lachlan Murdochs executive roles inside the empire regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries of the family trust, according to the Times. Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, told the newspaper at the time that they were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal. Another evidentiary hearing is scheduled for this month.",https://apnews.com/article/rupert-murdoch-media-empire-family-trust-nevada-a36b4a453630f8848d5d4282e813e94d,business
"One Tech Tip: Skype shut down for good, but users still have these alternatives","LONDON (AP)  Skype is dead. What now?  Microsofts shutdown of Skype on May 5 sent millions of users scrambling to find an alternative to the pioneering internet phone service.  Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011, was beloved by a dwindling group of users who appreciated how it let them make cheap long-distance calls as well as communicate with other users through chat messages, voice or video calls. Some liked its simplicity and ease of use  an advantage, for example, when setting up a communications app for an elderly parent living far away.  Or they just used it out of habit.  Skype was founded in 2003 and was among the first in a wave of communication services that used voice over internet protocol technology (VoIP), which converts audio into a digital signal.  Skypes disappearance also inconveniences Americans and other expatriates living overseas who signed up because they needed an U.S.-based number to receive text authentication codes from, say, a bank back home. It was also handy for calling 800 numbers for free even if you werent living in North America.  Here is a guide for life after Skype:  
        
     Microsoft announced in late February that it was shutting down Skype on May 5 and shifting some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship office videoconferencing and group collaboration platform. Skype users can use their existing accounts to log into Teams and have the option to automatically migrate their contacts and chats. If you had a Skype number or a calling subscription, it stopped automatically renewing on April 3.  If your account still has credit, you can access Skypes dial pad from the web portal or Teams to make calls.  Skype numbers wont immediately expire on May 5 so youll still be able to receive calls until your subscription expires. But youll have to use Teams or keep the Skype dial pad open on the web portal to receive them.  If your Skype number hasnt expired and you dont want to lose it, you should transfer it to another provider. Skype numbers can be ported to a phone carrier or any number of other VoIP services. But youll have to start the process through the new provider, not Skype.  Google users can access the online search giants internet phone service to make calls from a smartphone or a desktop web browser. You can get your own Google Voice phone number and use features like call forwarding and voicemail. Or you can port your number from another service like Skype, but it will cost $20.  Calls to U.S., Canadian or Puerto Rican numbers are free. Rates for other countries vary.  The free version of Google Voice is only available to U.S. residents physically located in the 48 contiguous states, so that means expatriate Americans can only use it if they registered before they moved overseas.  You cannot sign up for a Google Voice number while outside the USA, according to a help page. Do not try to circumvent this by using a VPN. Owned by Japans Rakuten, Viber was long considered one of the closest competitors to Skype. One key difference is that Skype users dont need a phone number and are identified by their usernames, while Viber users need a number to register for service.  Similar to Skype, Viber users can buy credit or packages to call phone numbers around the world but its no longer possible to get a Viber number to receive calls.  The videoconferencing service thats become a byword for online company meetings offers a calling service, Zoom Phone, and features like number porting and the ability to send and receive SMS text messages.  Take note that Zoom Phone isnt free. There are various calling plans that involve a monthly subscription cost and extra fees for international calls.  Microsoft users have the option of making calls on Teams, dubbed Teams Phone. Like Zoom Phone, youll need to buy a subscription and pay extra for international calls.  But its not an option for regular people because Microsoft says Teams Phone isnt for consumer use and is only available to small and medium-sized businesses.  If you absolutely need a U.S. number but live overseas, sign up for service with a low-cost virtual wireless carrier that offers cheap cellphone plans or pay-as-you-go rates.  One provider, Tello, offers monthly plans for as little as $5 and says users can activate its service even if theyre living outside the U.S.  Because mobile virtual network operators like Tello are essentially wireless phone companies that piggyback off a bigger carriers physical network, you cant use it to make calls on a computer or an app.  There are a slew of Skype pretenders offering phone calls over the internet, such as Zoiper, VoIP.ms, CallCentric, Mytello, and Virtual Landline. Many are aimed at business users.  Some are capitalizing on Skypes disappearance. Hushed, which started as an anonymous calling app, bills itself as a Skype alternative. Users can buy a phone number from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom or Puerto Rico or port their own number.  It warns that some of its numbers arent guaranteed to work with third-party verification text messages.  We do not intentionally block anyone from receiving these codes, but its common that some services will prevent verification texts from being sent to certain phone numbers due to their own security policies, Hushed says on its website.  Maybe you cant decide which calling service you want to switch to. If you want to save your current number, there are services to just park your number like NumberBarn.com and Parkmyphone.com.  They let you store a phone number for a monthly fee while relaying any text messages sent to that number. You can port the number to another service whenever you want.  Beware, you can only port in U.S. or Canadian phone numbers.  What about an international eSIM? Theyre the virtual version of the mobile phone SIM card that you can buy and add to your phone when youre on a trip to save on roaming fees.  They offer cheap data access rates so you can use the internet without worrying about racking up a huge bill when you get home.  Unfortunately, you cant port a Skype number to an international eSIM because of the fundamental differences between VoIP services and traditional mobile networks, said Pedro Maiquez, co-founder of eSIM provider Holafly. Skype numbers are not tied to a mobile carriers physical infrastructure, making them incompatible with mobile eSIM solutions. Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

AP and others challenge an Indiana law barring reporters from witnessing executions,"The Associated Press and four other media companies argue in a federal lawsuit that Indianas ban on reporters attending state-sanctioned executions violates the publics constitutional right to an independent and unsanitized description of a sensitive and contentious government action.  The complaint, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, comes two weeks before the scheduled execution of Benjamin Ritchie, who was condemned for the September 2000 fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney during a foot chase.  It maintains that the law omitting news media from the states list of permitted witnesses improperly prevents the taxpayers from receiving an unbiased review of the death penaltys implementation. I dont think its about wanting to witness this act  Im sure its not a pleasant experience, said Kristopher Cundriff of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which is representing the plaintiffs. Its about having a representative standing in the shoes of the public to provide an account of what happened that comes from a neutral party. Named as defendants are Ron Neal, superintendent of Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, which houses the death chamber, and Lloyd Arnold, commissioner of the Indiana Department of Correction.  Department spokesperson Annie Goeller said she cannot comment on pending lawsuits. 
        
     Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bar media witnesses. The other, Wyoming, has conducted just one execution in the last half-century.  The AP aims to attend every execution in the U.S. to provide an accurate and unconstrained description for taxpayers. The news organization has repeatedly been on hand to report botched attempts. In December, Joseph Corcoran became the first person put to death in Indiana in 15 years because of a nationwide scarcity of lethal-injection drugs. Ritchie is scheduled for the death chamber on May 20. Five more await execution in Indiana, according to the lawsuit.  The media groups contend that the Indiana law violates the First Amendments guarantee that the public has a qualified right of access to certain government proceedings. It also notes that the law, which allows attendance by as many as five friends or relatives chosen by the condemned and up to eight members of the victims family, improperly treats them more favorably than the media. A hearing has not been scheduled. Joining the AP in pressing the lawsuit are Gannett Co., the nations largest local newspaper operation with Indiana outlets in Indianapolis, Lafayette, Bloomington and South Bend; and TEGNA Inc., which operates WTHR-13 in Indianapolis.  The other plaintiffs are Circle Broadcasting, whose WISH-TV is a statewide network, and States Newsroom, which operates the nonprofit Indiana Capital Chronicle. It was the Capital Chronicle that ensured media representation at the December execution, as Corcoran chose one of its reporters as a witness.",https://apnews.com/article/indiana-death-penalty-executions-secrecy-news-media-e4f5e97a2d26a0663f202214954d197c,business
Associated Press finds no definitive evidence to change credit for famous Vietnam War photo,"Months after the release of a film that questions who took an iconic Vietnam War image of a naked girl running from a napalm attack, The Associated Press said Tuesday it had found no definitive evidence to warrant changing a nearly 53-year-old photo credit. The AP released a 96-page report  its second examination in less than four months  about who actually took the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo credited to Nick Ut that became one of the defining images of the 20th century. A documentary shown at Sundance in January, The Stringer, asserts that it was actually shot by another man, Nguyen Thanh Nghe, but that credit was given to Ut, an AP staff photographer. The AP concluded that it was possible Ut took the photo, but it was unable to be proven conclusively due to the passage of time, absence of key evidence, limitations of technology and the deaths of several key people involved. At the same time, AP found no proof that Nguyen took the photo, the report said. We left nothing uncovered that were aware of and weve done it with a great deal of respect to everybody involved, said Derl McCrudden, an AP vice president who heads global news production. It makes no difference to us if we changed the credit, but it has to be based on facts and evidence. And there is no definitive evidence proving that Nick Ut did not take this picture. The APs latest study involved further interviews, examination of cameras, building a 3D model of the scene and studying photo negatives that survive from June 8, 1972, the date of the photo.  The report revealed inconsistencies on both sides. The prize-winning photo was apparently taken on a Pentax camera, not a Leica as Ut had long claimed. Nguyen told AP he was not working for NBC that day, as was earlier asserted. Of 10 people on the scene that day that the AP reached, Nguyen is the only one who believes that Ut didnt take the picture, the report said. 
        
     The report said that believing Nguyens story would require several leaps of faith, including believing that the only time he ever sold a photo to a Western news agency it turned out to be one of the most famous images of the century. Ut, who has strongly maintained that the photo is his, said Tuesday he was gratified by the findings of APs investigation. This whole thing has been very difficult for me and has caused great pain, he said in a statement. Im glad the record has been set straight. ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Puerto Rico governor under fire as federal funds for solar projects are stalled,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)  Puerto Ricos governor came under fire Tuesday as her pledge to support the investment of millions of federal dollars in solar projects across the U.S. territory appeared to fade. More than a week has passed since the U.S. Department of Energy missed a deadline to finalize contracts worth $365 million that would see battery-operated solar systems installed at health clinics and public housing units in Puerto Rico. Since last month, the department has not been in communication with those awarded the grants, including the nonprofit Hispanic Federation. Theres been deathly silence, said Javier Ra Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Ricos Solar and Energy Storage Association. The lack of communication by the federal government comes as Puerto Rico prepares for the Atlantic hurricane season, which starts June 1 and is predicted to be above average, with nine anticipated hurricanes, four of them major. Puerto Rico already struggles with chronic power outages, including two island-wide blackouts that occurred on Dec. 31 and April 17. There are people who really need this help immediately, said Frankie Miranda, president and CEO of the Hispanic Federation. Until recently, Gov. Jenniffer Gonzlez, a Republican and supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, had backed more than $1 billion appropriated by Congress for solar projects in Puerto Rico, including the $365 million slated for public housing units and health centers, including those that provide dialysis. 
        
     But the governors public affairs secretary, Hiram Torres Montalvo, told Radio Isla on Monday that the governor tried to defend the funds but ultimately withdrew her support for the grant. He said that Gonzlez has proposed using the funds to improve the generation, transmission and distribution of power, and is focused on ensuring theres enough electricity for the summer months. We are extremely surprised and shocked over this development, Miranda said in a phone interview. We want the governor to reconsider her position and continue to fulfill her word. Miranda and others have noted that some $18 billion in federal funds is already slated for the grid. Neither Torres nor a spokeswoman for the governor returned messages seeking comment. On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy sent The Associated Press a statement saying that the agency was conducting a department-wide review of grant processes, and that it was working with Puerto Ricos governor and the White House to strengthen the islands grid and ensure that the island has reliable, affordable and secure energy. In the wake of recent outages that impacted families, businesses, and critical infrastructure, the Department of Energy remains focused on advancing solutions that provide urgent relief, prevent future disasters, and restore long-term reliable energy access across the island, the agency said. The department did not say whether Puerto Ricos government has formally requested that the funds be reassigned. More than 60% of energy on the island is generated by petroleum-fired power plants, 24% by natural gas, 8% by coal and 7% by renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The push for more renewable energy comes as crews continue to rebuild Puerto Ricos power grid after Hurricane Maria hit the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already weak before the storm hit given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-us-solar-energy-projects-trump-2d7035b0c26692e328f8a0d23a5a4b80,business
"Trump keeps contradicting himself on tariffs, making a fragile world economy nervous","WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump cant stop contradicting himself on his own tariff plans.  He says hes on a path to cut several new trade deals in a few weeks  but has also suggested its physically impossible to hold all the needed meetings.  Trump has said he will simply set new tariff rates negotiated internally within the U.S. government over the next few weeks  although he already did that on his April 2 Liberation Day, which caused the world economy to shudder. The Republican president says hes actively negotiating with the Chinese government on tariffs  while the Chinese and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said talks have yet to start. What should one believe? The sure bet is that uncertainty will persist in ways that employers and consumers alike expect to damage the economy and that leave foreign leaders scratching their heads in bewilderment. And the consequences of all this tariffs turmoil are enormous.  Trump placed tariffs totaling 145% on China, leading China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S.  essentially triggering a trade war between the worlds two largest economies with the potential to bring on a recession. 
        
     The president told Time magazine in an interview released Friday that 20%, 30% or 50% tariffs a year from now would be a total victory, even though a financial market panic led him to temporarily reduce his baseline import taxes to 10% for 90 days while talks take place. The deal is a deal that I choose, Trump said in the interview. What Im doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries. If that is confusing for the nations trading partners, its also sowing anxiety at home.  The Federal Reserves beige book, a compilation of anecdotes from U.S. businesses prepared eight times a year, on Wednesday reported a huge spike in uncertainty among American companies that has caused them to pull back on hiring and investment in new projects. The word uncertainty cropped up 80 times, compared with 45 in early March and just 14 in January. Beyond the idea that Trump plans to keep some level of tariffs in place, the world finance ministers and corporate executives who gathered this past week in Washington for the International Monetary Fund conference said in private discussions that the Trump administration was providing no real clarity on its goals for substantive talks. Theres not a coherent strategy at the moment on what the tariffs are supposed to achieve, said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center at The Atlantic Council. My conversations with the ministers and governors this week at the IMF meetings have been they dont understand completely what the White House wants, nor who they should be negotiating with. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF released Friday, said after a meeting with Bessent that Switzerland would be one of 15 countries with which the United States plans to conduct privileged negotiations. But she said a memorandum of understanding would have to be reached for talks to formally begin. She was happy to at least know whom to talk to, saying that we have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration. Nations are deploying various negotiating tactics. The South Korean officials who met with their U.S. counterparts this week say they specifically asked for the tariffs to be lifted with the goal of working toward an agreement by July. The European Union has pushed for cutting tariffs to zero for both parties, though Trump objects to European countries charging a value-added tax, which is akin to a sales tax that he says hurts U.S. goods. Trump continues to radiate optimism that negotiated deals with other countries will occur despite his claims that he will set his own deals and a lack of clarity about how the process goes forward. Im getting along very well with Japan, Trump told reporters on Friday. Were very close to a deal. As part of a deal with Japan, the Trump administration has publicly called on the Japanese government to change its auto safety standards that put a greater focus on pedestrian safety. But the steering wheels on autos sold in Japan are on the right-hand side, while U.S. automakers put their steering wheels on the left. I dont think left-hand drive cars sell in Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told a parliamentary session this week. We want to make sure we arent seen as being unfair, Ishiba said, suggesting a possibility of reviewing Japanese car safety standards. As Trump continues to make conflicting statements about tariffs, companies are actively looking at higher prices, lower sales and possibly bare shelves in stores due to fewer shipments from China. Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a supply chain company, said on the social media site X: In the 3 weeks since the tariffs took effect, ocean container bookings from China to the United States are down over 60% industry wide. Consumers are getting notices via email and social media from retailers that lamps, furniture and other housewares will now include tariff-related charges. The showerhead company Afina on Wednesday reported on a test to see if people would buy an American-made product that cost more than an import. Their Chinese-made filtered showerhead retails for $129, but to manufacture the same product domestically would take the price up to $239.  When customers on the companys website were given a choice between a showerhead made in the USA or a cheaper one made in Asia, there were 584 purchases of the $129 model made abroad and not one sale of the domestically produced showerhead. Ramon van Meer, Afinas founder, said in an interview that the scale and the speed of the tariffs were part of the challenge for smaller businesses looking to adapt, adding that part of the challenge is that Trump imposed the import taxes without proper planning or announcements. He concluded in his written analysis: If policymakers and pundits want to rebuild American industry, they need to grapple with this truth: idealism doesnt always survive contact with a price tag. ___ AP economics writer Christopher Rugaber in Washington and AP writers Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-time-china-switzerland-660aa519e9059de7d81368ec4eef4b38,business
"LA firefighters union leaders suspended after audit finds $800,000 in undocumented spending","LOS ANGELES (AP)  Top officials at the Los Angeles firefighters labor union were suspended Monday after an audit conducted by its parent organization found over $800,000 in credit card spending, some of it by the unions president, could not be accounted for. The International Association of Fire Fighters, which oversees firefighter unions across the country, wrote in a letter to the United Firefighters of Los Angeles City that it would be placing the union under a conservatorship to properly manage its finances. The union represents more than 3,600 members of the Los Angeles Fire Department, according to its LinkedIn. According to the letter from IAFF President Edward Kelly, the organization voted to suspend union President Freddy Escobar and two other officials who made thousands of credit card transactions with no receipts or other documentation justifying them. Escobar posted a statement on his Instagram account denying the allegations. Im going to defend myself because I have nothing to hide and I have always worked for the benefit of our membership for the greater good, the post said. These false allegations are disgusting and politically motivated by those who want to attack the union and me personally and Im going to clear my name. The unions troubles began in October 2024, when an officer flagged concerns about improper record-keeping to the parent organization. An investigation found that then-secretary Adam Walker transferred, without authorization, more than $80,000 from the unions nonprofit to support firefighters and families directly into his personal bank accounts, according to IAFF. 
        
     Investigators found that after moving those funds, Walker paid off substantial personal debts such as mortgage and loan payments, as well as casino cash ATM withdrawals. He was suspended for breach of fiduciary responsibility and misappropriation of funds, Kelly said. Contact information could not be located for requesting comment from Walker. A more extensive audit was ordered, revealing that Escobar had spent more than $300,000 on his union credit card between July 2018 and November 2024. Kelly said there was no way to determine that the funds were used for legitimate union expenditures. Auditors had warned union leadership in March 2024 there were significant deficiencies in the locals financial practices. Escobar spent more than $70,000 without submitting a single receipt that year. A former treasurer, Domingo Albarran, was also found to have spent more than $300,000 over about five years without documentation of the expenditures, according to the letter. The unions parent organization voted to suspend Vice Presidents Chuong Ho and Doug Coates for failing to ensure leaders were following policy. The financial malpractice by the leadership of UFLAC has dealt serious harm to the membership, Kelly said. Contact information for Albarran, Ho and Coates could not be immediately located.",https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-firefighters-union-funds-misuse-6773881a5973045ff3cbf6a8d9726596,business
Indias leader Modi touted all was well in Kashmir. A massacre of tourists shattered that claim,"SRINAGAR, India (AP)  Hundreds of Indian tourists, families and honeymooners, drawn by the breathtaking Himalayan beauty, were enjoying a picture-perfect meadow in Kashmir. They didnt know gunmen in army fatigues were lurking in the woods. When the attackers got their chance, they shot mostly Indian Hindu men, many of them at close-range, leaving behind bodies strewn across the Baisaran meadow and survivors screaming for help.  The gunmen quickly vanished into thick forests. By the time Indian authorities arrived, 26 people were dead and 17 others were wounded. India has described the April 22 massacre as a terror attack and blamed Pakistan for backing it, an accusation denied by Islamabad. India swiftly announced diplomatic actions against its archrival Pakistan, which responded with its own tit-for-tat measures. The assailants are still on the run, as calls in India for military action against Pakistan are growing. World leaders have been scrambling to de-escalate the tensions between two nuclear-armed neighbors, which have historically relied on third countries for conflict management. But the massacre has also touched a raw nerve.  Early on Wednesday, India fired missiles that struck at least three locations inside Pakistani-controlled territory, according to Pakistani security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. India said it was striking infrastructure used by militants.

     Those claims now lie shattered. Security experts and former intelligence and senior military officers who have served in the region say Modis government  riding on a nationalistic fervor over Kashmir to please its supporters  missed warning signs.  The government acknowledged that in a rare admission. Two days after the attack, Kiren Rijiju, Indias parliamentary affairs minister, said that a crucial all-party meeting discussed where the lapses occurred. We totally missed ... the intentions of our hostile neighbor, said Avinash Mohananey, a former Indian intelligence officer who has operated in Kashmir and Pakistan. The meadow, near the resort town of Pahalgam, can be reached by trekking or pony rides, and visitors cross at least three security camps and a police station to reach there. According to Indian media, there was no security presence for more than 1,000 tourists that day.  Pahalgam serves as a base for an annual Hindu pilgrimage that draws hundreds of thousands of people from across India. The area is ringed by thick woods that connect with forest ranges in the Jammu area, where Indian troops have faced attacks by rebels in recent years after fighting ebbed in the Kashmir Valley, the heart of an anti-India rebellion. The massacre brought Modis administration almost back to where it started when a suicide car bombing in the region in 2019 prompted his government to strip Kashmir of its semi-autonomy and bring it under direct federal rule. Tensions have simmered ever since, but the region has also drawn millions of visitors amid a strange calm enforced by an intensified security crackdown.  We probably started buying our own narrative that things were normal in Kashmir, Mohananey said.

(AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File) Tourists wait for their turn to use a ski-lift to transport them up a slope in Gulmarg, northwest of Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Jan. 10, 2021. (AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File) In the past, insurgents have carried out brazen attacks and targeted Hindu pilgrims, Indian Hindu as well as Muslim immigrant workers, and local Hindus and Sikhs. However, this time a large number of tourists were attacked, making it one of the worst massacres involving civilians in recent years. The attack outraged people in Kashmir and India, where it led to calls of swift action against Pakistan.  Indian television news channels amplified these demands and panelists argued that India should invade Pakistan. Modi and his senior ministers vowed to hunt down the attackers and their backers. Experts say much of the public pressure on the Indian government to act militarily against Pakistan falls within the pattern of long, simmering animosity between both countries. All the talk of military options against Pakistan mainly happens in echo chambers and feeds a nationalist narrative, in India, New Delhi-based counterterrorism expert Ajai Sahni said. It doesnt matter what will be done. We will be told it was done and was a success, he said. And it will be celebrated nonetheless.

(AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan, File) Experts also say that the Modi governments optimism was also largely misplaced and that its continuous boasting of rising tourism in the region was a fragile barometer of normalcy. Last year, Omar Abdullah, Kashmirs top elected official, cautioned against such optimism. By this attack, Pakistan wants to convey that there is no normalcy in Kashmir and that tourism is no indicator for it. They want to internationalize the issue, said D.S. Hooda, former military commander for northern India between 2014 to 2016. Hooda said the choice of targets and the manner in which the attack was carried out indicates that it was well-planned. If there would have been a good security cover, maybe this incident would not have happened, he said. Indian security experts believe the attack could be a retaliation for a passenger train hijacking in Pakistan in March by Baloch insurgents. Islamabad accused New Delhi of orchestrating the attack in which 25 people were killed. India denies it. Mohananey said that Indian authorities should have taken the accusations seriously and beefed-up security in Kashmir, while arguing there was a striking similarity in both attacks since only men were targeted. It was unusual that women and children were spared in both cases, Mohananey said. Two senior police officers, who have years of counterinsurgency experience in Kashmir, said after the train attack in Pakistan that they were anticipating some kind of reaction in the region by militants.

(AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File) The officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that security officials perceived the threat of an imminent attack, and Modis inauguration of a strategic rail line in the region was canceled. A large-scale attack on tourists, however, wasnt anticipated, because there was no such precedence, the officers said. Hooda, who commanded what New Delhi called surgical strikes against militants in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir in 2016, said that the attack has deepened thinking that it was time to tackle the Pakistani state, not just militants. Such calculus could be a marked shift. In 2016 and 2019, India said that its army struck militant infrastructure inside Pakistan after two major militant attacks against its soldiers. After this attack, Hooda said, India wants to stop Pakistan from using terrorism as an instrument of state policy. We need to tighten our security and plug lapses, but the fountainhead of terrorism needs to be tackled, Hooda said. The fountainhead is Pakistan. ___ Saaliq and Roy reported from New Delhi.",https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-pakistan-tourist-attack-pahalgam-1089607a2c148eff059ca1052fe86aad,business
A GOP Nebraska bill would criminalize hemp-based THC. Opponents say it could make grandma a felon,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP)  Kind Life Dispensary has been offering cannabinoid gummies, tinctures, ointments, now even canned beverages for seven years as one of the first businesses in Nebraska to offer such products. Founder and co-owner Andrea Watkins said her venture has been wildly successful, and she now has three locations in Nebraskas capital city that employ eight people and sell to hundreds of regulars who use the products to treat everything from aches and pains to anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. But now, shes worried her livelihood will crumble as a bill winding its way through the Nebraska Legislature would outlaw most of the products she sells. The Nebraska bill would criminalize the sale and possession of an array of products containing hemp-based tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC  the same compound that gives marijuana its psychoactive properties. Any product containing more than a total weight of 0.3% THC or more than 10 milligrams total per package would be outlawed.  If that bill becomes law? We would have to close, Watkins said recently at her flagship store that looks like a cross between a pharmacy and a spa.  She suspects many of the more than 300 businesses across the state offering similar products since hemp was legalized under the 2018 federal farm bill could face the same fate. That farm bill created a legal loophole that allows manufacturers to synthesize THC from hemp plants and sell it in products where marijuana isnt legal to sell. 
        
     As the bill is currently written, it would even ban topical products like THC-containing lotions and creams intended to dull joint and muscle pains, leading opponents to accuse the bills sponsors of making criminals of grandparents seeking a treatment for arthritis. What happens to all the grannies who have some kind of CBD with delta-8 in the back of their medicine cabinet? Omaha Sen. Wendy DeBoer asked during recent debate on the Nebraska bill, adding that the bill would make felons of all the grannies using products with hemp-based THC for aching joints. The Nebraska bill includes a grace period through the end of 2025 to allow people who have such products to dispose of them. Republican lawmakers behind Nebraskas bill say its needed to protect people  especially children  from dangerous products that use synthetic cannabinoids masquerading as hemp and are infused into food and drink with candy and fruit flavors. Several lawmakers relayed accounts of children and others suffering ill effects and even hospitalization after consuming products containing synthesized THC. But those amount to scare tactics that mischaracterize the benefits of the products, said Dr. Andrea Holmes, an expert in organic chemistry with an emphasis in cannabis. Holmes is a co-owner of Kind Life Dispensaries and has traveled the country promoting regulated cannabis and cannabinoid products. What they leave out in these cases they talk about is that the person has also taken some other substance or has some underlying problem that leads to their condition, Holmes said. Our products arent dangerous. Opponents of the bill say it is part of a yearslong effort by state Republicans  including Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers  to criminalize hemp products and thwart growing efforts to legalize marijuana both in Nebraska and across the country. Dozens of states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. In November, voters in Nebraska overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana use. We need to look at that fact. Most people want these types of products, Holmes said. So far, Nebraska lawmakers have rejected efforts by Omaha state Sen. John Cavanaugh, a Democrat, to supplant the ban bill with a measure that would require strict regulation of hemp-based consumables, as several other states have done. The Nebraska Hemp Industries Association supports Cavanaughs effort to regulate the industry. Cavanaugh and supporters of his measure say banning hemp products at a time when the state is suffering dramatic revenue shortfalls would just hit state coffers harder. Hemp-derived cannabinoid businesses employ more than 1,600 people in Nebraska and provide a tax revenue potential of nearly $8 million to the state, Cavanaugh said, citing figures from the 2023 U.S. National Cannabinoid Report. Despite the decriminalization of hemp and voters approval of some marijuana use, Hilgers has been crisscrossing the state targeting businesses that sell hemp-based cannabinoid products. Many shops have received cease-and-desist letters. Some have been subject to raids by law enforcement. Hilgers insists hes protecting the public from dangerous products and unscrupulous dealers trading in plain sight. With our new complaints, we are ramping up our efforts to clean up Nebraska, Hilgers said in September, when he sued four businesses in Norfolk selling hemp-based consumables. These stores are misleading Nebraskans. Not one of the products we tested were accurately labeled, and many contained controlled substances. Nebraska is far from alone in the push to restrict access to consumable hemp and other THC products. It joins a slew of other states where similar efforts to regulate, criminalize or ban such products, including Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and Texas.  But Democratic-led states also have led efforts to restrict hemp-derived products. In California, where recreational marijuana use is legal and heavily regulated and taxed, regulators issued a ban last year on food and beverage products with hemp-derived THC, citing health concerns.",https://apnews.com/article/hemp-cbd-thc-ban-nebraska-78e103e98accfdb489e5078ee26ce8a4,business
Trump critics launch new group to highlight rising costs,"NEW YORK (AP)  A bipartisan group of President Donald Trumps critics is launching a new organization, dubbed the Cost Coalition, to highlight Trumps struggle to control rising costs in the early months of his new presidency.  The group expects to be especially active ahead of upcoming elections in Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, according to preliminary plans shared with The Associated Press this week ahead of a formal announcement. The Cost Coalition will push its message through a combination of paid advertising, social media, press interviews and on-the-ground events with small business leaders, veterans and the faith community. Terry Holt, a former spokesperson to former President George W. Bush and former House Speaker John Boehner, both Republicans, is serving as a senior communications adviser along with Andrew Bates, a former spokesperson for former President Joe Biden, a Democrat.  In 100 days, Donald Trump put the best-performing economy in the world on a crash course toward recession. Trumps tariffs  the biggest middle class tax hike in modern history  are making everyday prices skyrocket and wreaking havoc for businesses large and small, Holt and Bates said in a joint statement. Next up are grossly inflationary tax cuts for the wealthy that will only saddle future generations with staggering debt. Whether youre a Republican, Democrat, or anything else, Donald Trumps agenda is an economic crisis threatening your livelihood and standard of living. The new group enters a political landscape already packed with powerful voices fighting to shape the national conversation little more than 100 days after Trump began his second term. The Republican president vowed to end inflation on Day 1, but he has focused more on immigration, culture wars and exacting revenge against his political adversaries while launching a global trade war that has pushed some costs higher and threatens to send the U.S. economy into recession. 
        
     Trump late last week said on his social media platform that there is NO INFLATION and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gasoline has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.  Thats not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gasoline and oil prices have declined  gas costs are down 10% from a year ago  continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken.

A spokesperson declined to say how the new group will be funded, except to say it has seed contributions from some large donors in both parties and will also rely on grassroots donations. As a project of the American Values Alliance, the organization will be set up as a nonprofit with a hybrid political action committee. As such, it wont have to publicly disclose all of its funding sources.",https://apnews.com/article/cost-coalition-group-bipartisan-trump-harris-inflation-e9c8b000ff751458d49b3089672cb570,business
Disabled workers have faced prejudice. Now they face DOGE firings,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Spencer Goidel, a 33-year-old federal worker in Boca Raton, Florida, with autism, knew what he could be losing when he got laid off from his job as an equal employment opportunity specialist at the IRS. Because of his autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, Goidel had been able to secure his spot as one of more than 500,000 disabled workers in the federal government under Schedule A, which allows federal agencies to bypass the traditional hiring process and pick a qualified candidate from a pool of people with certain disabilities. His job, he said, was accommodating and enriching, and he wonders if hell ever get another one like that in the private sector. A lot of people who are disabled, they came to the federal government because it was a model employer for disabled individuals, and now they have nowhere else to go, he told The Associated Press. The irony, he says, is that his job was to help resolve workers harassment claims before they escalated into full-blown lawsuits against the government. So much for reducing waste, he says.  
        
     For decades, the federal government has positioned itself as being committed to inclusive hiring and long-term retention across agencies. But as mass layoffs ripple through the federal workforce under President Donald Trumps Republican administration, disabled employees are among those being let go. Amid the firings, rollbacks of accommodation guidance for businesses and skepticism of disability inclusion practices, advocates and experts wonder if the governments status as a model employer will hold true.  Trump has said he ended diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the government because people should be hired based on work quality and merit alone. However, under Schedule A, candidates already have to be qualified for the position with or without an accommodation. They dont get a job solely because they have a disability. Disability advocates point to a slew of statements from Trump administration officials that indicate they view disabled workers as a liability to the government. Trump criticized the federal governments inclusion efforts in January when a midair collision between a plane and a helicopter near Reagan National Airport killed 67 people. Without evidence, he blamed the Federal Aviation Administrations targeted hiring of people with disabilities for the crash, saying that only psychologically superior air traffic controllers should work for the agency. Kelly McCullough, legal director at Disability Law Colorado, said the messaging from the Trump administration could affect how seriously the private sector takes on disability inclusion efforts. Recently, she said, the nonprofit has received an uptick in disability discrimination complaints. It does make me wonder, if the federal government is setting this example, challenging these ideas of inclusion that have (had) long-standing support from the government  is that trickling down? she said. Is that messaging getting to employers in other contexts? Trump also rescinded a Biden-era executive order that required federal agencies to create action plans to hire more diverse staff, including those with disabilities. The order calls diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, or DEIA, efforts illegal and says they violate the text and spirit of civil rights. The Trump administrations other actions have caused consternation, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s dismantling of the Administration for Community Living, an agency that serves disabled and aging adults. HHS officials also floated - and walked back - a plan to create a registry of people with autism. Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, which advocates for people with physical and intellectual disabilities, said she is concerned about the impact the massive reductions in the federal workforce will have on government services for all Americans as well as the loss of opportunities for workers with disabilities. Im really worried  where are these folks going to go? Whos going to hire them? she asked. Employment gaps for disabled people have been an issue across the federal and private sectors for years. When the Labor Department began recording disability status in its employment trends in the Current Population Survey in 2009, just 30% of disabled people between ages 16 and 64 were working at least part time. Thats compared with 71% of people without a disability. Last year, employment rates for disabled people hit a record high of 38%, but the decades-old disparities still persisted: 75% of people without disabilities were employed that year. Disability hiring in the federal government became a prominent effort in the 1970s, shortly after the passing of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits disability discrimination in federal agencies. Expectations to hire disabled people expanded from there.  In 2014, Democratic President Barack Obamas administration began requiring that federal contractors meet specific goals related to hiring disabled people.  Three years later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission updated rules under the Rehabilitation Act. The new rules required federal agencies to set hiring goals for people with disabilities and create plans to help them get jobs and promotions. Anupa Iyer Geevarghese worked as a disability policy adviser at the EEOC when officials updated the regulations. She said it increased progress in ensuring that disabled people had equitable opportunities in the federal workforce. She now worries that progress will be undone as the Trump administration shows little interest in continuing inclusion efforts. I think, unfortunately, there are still perceptions about the knowledge, skill and abilities of people with disabilities, she said. As a whole, were still, as a community, still perceived as people who cant do their jobs, are unqualified, who are uneducated and are incapable  we thought we had combated it, but we are still fighting that fight. Abby Tighe, a former public health adviser at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, was among thousands of federal probationary workers terminated in February. Tighe, 30, has a progressive form of muscular dystrophy, which may eventually affect her ability to walk independently.  I really truly understand how other people who are using a chair or using some kind of assistance device might be really concerned about that next stage of employment when they cant interview and hide their disability at the same time, she said. Some also worry that disabled federal workers may have been disproportionately hurt by the terminations. Tighe and Goidel were hired through Schedule A, which allows a probationary period of up to two years. Other federal employees typically have one year of probation.  Tighe suspects that if she hadnt been hired through the special hiring authority, she might still have a job, given that no one else on her team was let go.  Goidel, who was converted to permanent status with full tenure in 2019, says his employment with the federal government motivated him to continue his education and pursue a masters degree in employment law. He says the decision to slash jobs at the IRS EEO office will mean there are fewer federal workers able to investigate harassment claims and that could result in more litigation against the government. The White House is promoting its efforts to provide services for disabled individuals and veterans.  In an email to The Associated Press, a White House official pointed to student loan forgiveness for completely disabled veterans and record low unemployment for people with disabilities during Trumps first term. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, also noted that a multiagency task force was created in 2018 to focus on increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. HHS also announced plans for the Administration for Community Living to release more than $1 billion in funding to states to address nutrition, daily living assistance, chronic disease management and more. Goidel says he hopes the Trump administration realizes what its losing with the layoffs. Theyre taking away peoples opportunities, and theyre taking away peoples livelihoods, he said. Theyre also hurting people who may need a little extra help to get over the finish line and have that upward mobility. ___ Hunter reported from Atlanta.",https://apnews.com/article/disabled-federal-workers-layoffs-trump-77528e68350b62e52bab3455f0a87591,business
"Trump, Carney faceoff in Oval Office leaves gaping differences on tariffs, 51st state","WASHINGTON (AP)  U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney faced off in the Oval Office on Tuesday and showed no signs of retreating from their gaping differences in an ongoing trade war that has shattered decades of trust between the two countries.  The two kept it civil, but as for Trumps calls to make Canada the 51st state, Carney insisted his nation was not for sale and Trump shot back, time will tell. Asked by a reporter if there was anything Carney could tell him to lift his tariffs of as much as 25% on Canada, Trump bluntly said: No. President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The U.S. president added for emphasis, Just the way it is. Carney acknowledged that no bit of rhetoric on tariffs would be enough to sway Trump, saying that this is a bigger discussion. There are much bigger forces involved, the Canadian leader continued. And this will take some time and some discussions. And thats why were here, to have those discussions. The meeting between the two leaders showcased the full spectrum of Trumps unique mix of aggression, hospitality and stubbornness.  Shortly before Carneys arrival, Trump insulted Canada by posting on social media that the United States didnt need ANYTHING from its northern neighbor, only to then turn on the charm and praise Carneys election win in person before showing his obstinance on matters of policy substance. Carney won the job of prime minister by promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump, even as he has preserved the calm demeanor of an economist who has led the central banks of both Canada and the United Kingdom.  
        
     At times, Carney struggled to interject his views and raised his hand to talk as Trump held forth at length and veered between topics, touching on California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, Carneys predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and teasing a great upcoming announcement thats not necessarily on trade. Trump offended Canadas sense of pride and friendship by saying he wants to make Canada the 51st U.S. state and levying steep tariffs against an essential partner in the manufacturing of autos and the supply of oil, electricity and other goods. The outrage provoked by Trump enabled Carneys Liberal Party to score a stunning comeback victory last month as the trade war and attacks on Canadian sovereignty have outraged voters. Trump said the two would not discuss making Canada part of the U.S., even as he insisted the idea would lead to lower taxes for Canadians. Its not for sale, Carney said. It wont be for sale. Ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together. Trump persisted by saying that the United States did not want to buy autos from Canada, even if the vehicles were also assembled in America. The U.S. leader insisted that the $63 billion trade deficit in goods  which he inflated to $200 billion  was a subsidy that needed to come an end. The meeting never devolved into the outburst that the public saw in Trumps meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was berated by the U.S. president and his team for not being sufficiently deferential. Nor did it have the ease of Trumps sit down with the United Kingdoms Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who invited Trump for a visit provided by King Charles III. Carney later described his conversation with Trump as wide ranging and constructive, telling reporters that the prospect is there for positive negotiations but there would be zigs and zags. Carney said he stressed the value that Canadian companies and factories created for U.S. automakers while stressing that it was unfair to assume one meeting could resolve any differences. I wouldnt have expected white smoke coming out of this meeting, Carney said after the Tuesday meeting, referencing the signal that a new pope has been selected. Carney said that he privately asked Trump to stop calling Canada the 51st state during their meeting. But when pressed on how Trump responded, the Canadian prime minister said: Hes the president. Hes his own person. Trump was later asked if he would give Carney the same governor nickname that he had put on Trudeau. The nickname was a slight meant to imply that Canadas leader would eventually be just one of many U.S. governors. As far as calling him Gov. Carney, no, I havent done that yet, and maybe I wont, Trump said. I did have a lot of fun with Trudeau. But I think this is, this is a big step. Its a good step up for Canada. Trump added that the meeting with Carney had been great and that he thought the ongoing relationship would be strong. A senior Canadian government official said the president asked Carney his perspective on a variety of foreign policy issues including Iran, Russia, Ukraine and China. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said Trump was looking forward to the G-7 meeting in Alberta, Canada. The stakes of the meeting were high and the messages beforehand mixed. Trump told reporters on Monday that he wasnt quite sure why Carney was visiting. Im not sure what he wants to see me about, Trump said. But I guess he wants to make a deal. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick further stoked doubts about their interest in repairing the relationship with Canada in a Monday interview on Fox Business Networks Kudlow show.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Asked if the U.S. could make a deal with Canada, Lutnick called the country a socialist regime that has been basically feeding off America. Lutnick said Tuesdays meeting would be fascinating. Carney, at a Friday news conference ahead of his trip, said the talks would focus on immediate trade pressures and the broader economic and national security relationships. He said his government would fight to get the best deal for Canada and take all the time necessary to do so, even as Canada pursues a parallel set of talks to deepen relations with other allies and lessen its commitments with the U.S. President Donald Trump greets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump has maintained that the U.S. doesnt need anything from Canada. He is actively going after a Canadian auto sector built largely by U.S. companies, saying, Theyre stopping work in Mexico, and theyre stopping work in Canada, and theyre all moving here. He also said the U.S. doesnt need Canadas energy  though nearly one-fourth of the oil that the U.S. consumes daily comes from the province of Alberta. The president has also disparaged Canadas military commitments despite a partnership that ranges from the beaches of Normandy in World War II to remote stretches of Afghanistan. He said on Tuesday with Carney that the U.S. would continue to provide national security support to Canada. Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and tariffs on other products outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in some cases ostensibly to address relatively low volumes of fentanyl intercepted at the northern border. That has jeopardized a closely entwined trade relationship as Canada sees an increasing need to build relations with the European Union and other nations. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canadas exports go to the U.S.",https://apnews.com/article/canada-prime-minister-carney-trump-c279642998197ecb212f39bf38184388,business
A Czech court blocks the signing of a deal with South Koreas KHNP to build 2 nuclear reactors,"PRAGUE (AP)  A court in the Czech Republic blocked on Tuesday the government from signing a deal with South Koreas KHNP to build at least two nuclear reactors in country. KHNP won a lucrative public tender last year, beating a competing bid by Frances EDF. The two new reactors will be built at the existing Dukovany power plant in an effort for the country to wean itself off fossil fuels. The contract between the dominant power company CEZ, where the Czech state has a majority stake, and the South Korean company was scheduled for Wednesday. EDF challenged the signing of the deal at the regional court in the second largest Czech city of Brno on Friday after the Czech anti-monopoly office dismissed its complaint about the tender. The court said that the deal could not be signed before it rules on the EDF case, because then there would be no way to change it even if the French company won. It is not clear when that might happen. Prime Minister Petr Fiala said he believed the tender was correct and in line with law. CEZ said the Korean bid was the better one, and the tender was transparent and fair. EDF had no immediate comment. The two new reactors will complement Dukovanys four 510-megawatt units that were completed in the 1980s. The government estimated they would each cost about 200 billion koruna ($9.1 billion). The first new reactor is expected to become operational for a trial by 2036, the second about two years later.",https://apnews.com/article/czech-nuclear-reactors-edf-khnp-2dcaa77856b7837c596cb0291dad5659,business
On the attack: Trumps media response in Abrego Garcia story is notably vigorous,"NEW YORK (AP)  Responding to coverage of Kilmar Abrego Garcias deportation, the Trump administration has called journalists despicable, questioned CNNs patriotism, scolded Fox News and even admitted to a mistake  in admitting to a mistake in the first place. The vigorous reaction was noteworthy even in service to a president known for never backing down and a hostility toward the press. The song is the same, said former CNN Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno, but the volume is a lot louder. President Donald Trump has fought the press on several fronts since returning to office in January. His team is battling The Associated Press in court over White House access, has sought to close Voice of America and launched FCC investigations into ABC News, CBS News, PBS and NPR, among others. In the Abrego Garcia case, the White House took a situation that may have knocked predecessors on their heels and used it as an opportunity. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national has lived in the United States for 14 years, married and is raising three children, and a judge shielded him from deportation in the first Trump term. In what Justice Department officials called an administrative error, he was sent last month to a Salvadoran prison. His case has come to symbolize concerns over whether people are being expelled legally. Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller wasnt interested in those questions during an interview with Fox News Bill Hemmer. I hate to do it, Bill, but I have to correct you on every single thing that you said, because it was all wrong, Miller said, interpreting a U.S. Supreme Court order that the administration facilitate Abrego Garcias return as a victory. Similarly, Trump said that people at CNN hate our country and objected when the networks Kaitlan Collins asked about Abrego Garcia in an Oval Office news conference. Why dont you just say, Isnt it wonderful that were keeping criminals out of our country? Trump responded. Why cant you say that? Why do you go over and over  and thats why nobody watches you anymore, you know. You have no credibility. From the briefing room, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said outrage about the case by Democrats and the media has been nothing short of despicable. Based on the sensationalism of many of the people in this room, you would have thought we had deported a candidate for Father of the Year, she said. She called Abrego Garcia an illegal alien MS-13 gang member and foreign terrorist who was deported back to his home country. Abrego Garcia has denied being part of the El Salvadoran gang. She later told Fox News that the official who labeled Abrego Garcias deportation an administrative error was himself mistaken. The immigrant, she promised, wouldnt be returning to his old life in the United States. Trump and his team are banking on his immigration stance being among his most popular, and that many of his followers dislike journalists, said Sean Spicer, White House press secretary during the presidents first term. If the roles were reversed and the Trump administration had been referring to Abrego Garcia as a Maryland family man, the media would have gone nuts claiming he was spreading misinformation, Spicer said in an interview. Matt Margolis, a columnist for PJMedia, told The Associated Press that when the media wont report the facts, its on the Trump administration to bring the facts directly to the public, and I think theyve done so effectively. Thats why he has solid approval ratings on immigration. The public knows the media is lying  and they know Trump isnt. Nonetheless, Abrego Garcia put a human face to an issue and an effort frequently happening in the shadows. Recognizing the potency of government by anecdote, the administration produced its own face  inviting Patty Morin to meet Trump in the White House and address reporters. The Maryland womans daughter, Rachel, was raped and killed in 2023 and a jury on April 14 convicted an immigrant from El Salvador in the U.S. illegally, Victor Martinez-Hernandez, of the crime. Trump aide Steven Cheung called it a media outrage that CNN and MSNBC did not carry angel mom Patty Morins recounting of the tragedy live on the air. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr criticized the same two networks for news distortion in their coverage of Abrego Garcia. A conservative media watchdog, the Media Research Center, produced a report that Martinez-Hernandezs trial received 12 seconds of coverage on the ABC, CBS and NBC morning and evening newscasts. The Abrego Garcia case got 143 minutes in total on the broadcasts between April 1 and 23, enabling them to berate the Trump administration, they said. Disgusting, Donald Trump Jr. said in a social media posting. The Morin murder trial did receive extensive local news coverage. Nationally, ABC News covered the case in 2024 when Martinez-Henderson was arrested and when Morins brother spoke before the Republican national convention. The tactic  dont look here, look there!  is familiar in politics and propaganda, said Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News executive who is now dean of the Hofstra University school of communication. It seems to me that what the White House would like the Abrego Garcia case to be about is whether this individual should be in the United States, Lukasiewicz said. Their clear view is that he should not, and that should be the story. From a news perspective, thats not what the story is about. The story is about the absence of due process. Attacking the news media is also not unique or new; ask your grandparents who former Vice President Spiro Agnew was referring to when he coined the phrase nattering nabobs of negativism. Trumps defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has bitterly denounced the press for a series of tough stories on his leadership. Yet the Abrego Garcia case is worth examining; the media strategy followed by the White House is likely to be repeated, especially since the president has a strong cadre of loyalists to follow his lead, said Sesno, professor at George Washington Universitys school of media and public affairs. Does any of this ever get old? he asked. That is the question. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

UK and India sign a landmark trade agreement after years of tough negotiations,"LONDON (AP)  Britain and India announced Tuesday that they have agreed on a hard-wrought free trade agreement that will slash tariffs on products including Scotch whisky and English gin shipped to India and Indian food and spices sent to the U.K. The deal comes more than three years after negotiations started  and stalled  under a previous British government. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X that the deal was ambitious and mutually beneficial. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it a landmark. This is the biggest trade deal that we the U.K. have done since we left the EU, and its the most ambitious trade deal that India has ever done, Starmer said.  The U.K. government said the deal will reduce Indian import taxes on British goods including whisky, cosmetics, medical devices, cars, airplane parts and lamb. Whisky and gin tariffs will be halved from 150% to 75% before falling to 40% by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will fall from over 100% to 10% under a quota.  Indias Trade Ministry said 99% of Indian exports would face no import duty under the deal, which applies to products including textiles, marine products, leather, footwear, toys, gems and jewelry. This brings us closer to our goal of becoming a global economic powerhouse. It protects our core interests while opening doors to Indias greater participation in global value chains, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said.  
        
     Modis office said the agreement covered trade in both goods and services, and would unlock new potential for the two nations to jointly develop products and services for global markets. Britain said the deal is expected to increase bilateral trade by 25.5 billion pounds ($34 billion) a year from 2040 and add almost 5 billion pounds ($6.7 billion) a year to the British economy. Mark Kent, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the deal would be transformational for the industry. India, a country of 1.4 billion people, is the worlds largest whisky market, and Kent said the agreement had the potential to increase Scotch whisky exports to India by 1 billion pounds over the next five years. The issue of visas for Indian nationals was a sticking point in the talks. The British government is under pressure to cut immigrant numbers  pressure heightened by the success of anti-immigrant party Reform UK in local elections in England last week. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the trade deal had no impact on the immigration system, but made modest changes to business mobility.  The agreement adds Indian musicians, chefs and yoga instructors to the groups who can apply for U.K. visas, and includes a three-year exemption from British social security contributions for Indian workers in the U.K. The same exemption will apply to British workers in India. The deal, which must be ratified by both countries, comes as countries around the world scramble to strike trade deals to make up for tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on Americas trading partners. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of employers organization the Confederation of British Industry, said the trade deal between India and Britain  the worlds fifth- and sixth-largest economies  was a beacon of hope amidst the specter of protectionism. U.K.-India trade negotiations began long before Trumps re-election. Formal talks began in 2022 on a free trade agreement that then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed as a key goal after Britains departure from the European Union in 2020. Johnson famously promised to have a deal done by Diwali in October of that year. The two countries held 13 rounds of negotiations without a breakthrough before talks were suspended while both nations held general elections in 2024.  Modi was re-elected, and Britain replaced the Conservative government with one led by Starmers Labour Party. The two leaders spoke by phone on Tuesday, and Modi said he had invited Starmer to visit India soon. Starmers office said he would go there at the earliest opportunity. ___ Roy reported from New Delhi.",https://apnews.com/article/uk-india-trade-deal-starmer-modi-6cbaf787f49a08aac18f93b2601d09f2,business

Holly LaFavers says she tried stopping 8-year-old Liams Amazon order for about 70,000 Dum-Dum suckers before the treats arrived but it was too late. Amazon had already delivered 22 cases to her home. He told me that he wanted to have a carnival, and he was ordering the Dum-Dums as prizes for his carnival, LaFavers said. Again, he was being friendly, he was being kind to his friends. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on 70,000 lollipops showing up at a second graders home, after he gets a hold of his moms Amazon account. The surprise got worse after a quick check of her bank account. She owed about $4,000 for the order. When I saw what the number was, I just about fainted, LaFavers said. Then she found out that eight more cases from the order were unaccounted for, she said. After a trip to the post office, those cases were returned to sender, she said. Her efforts to get a refund took a bit more time but she got her money back. After a long day of working with the bank and talking to a few news stations Amazon called and they are refunding my money, she said in a social media post. LaFavers said she was changing some settings on her phone to make sure theres never another surprise delivery at home.",https://apnews.com/article/lollipop-delivery-kentucky-home-71775d424d9f9f3dcae49b1fbecdc216,business
"Homeland Security chief says travelers with no REAL ID can fly for now, but with likely extra steps","WASHINGTON (AP)  Travelers who havent obtained a REAL ID by this weeks deadline received assurances from the head of Homeland Security that they will be able to fly after additional identity checks. Her comments came Tuesday as people were waiting in long lines outside of government buildings from California to Chicago trying to update their IDs before the long-delayed deadline.  Kristi Noem told a congressional panel that 81% of travelers already have IDs that comply with the REAL ID requirements. She said security checkpoints will also be accepting passports and tribal identification when the deadline hits Wednesday. Those who still lack an identification that complies with the REAL ID law may be diverted to a different line, have an extra step, Noem said. But people will be allowed to fly, she said. We will make sure its as seamless as possible.

(AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) People line up to apply for Real ID at a Real ID Supercenter in downtown Chicago, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) The Transportation Security Administration warned people who dont have the REAL ID to show up early and be prepared for advanced screening to avoid causing delays.  I do not have a belief that this will cause people to miss their flights if they take that additional time in, said Thomas Carter, the TSAs Federal Security Director in New Jersey. I think theres that self-responsibility of the law that they need to know, give themselves that extra time, and if they do that, they shouldnt have an issue. Across the country, government offices extended their hours to help meet the demand. But despite that, some people waited for hours Tuesday to get a REAL ID ahead of the long-delayed deadline.  
        
     Renel Leggett, a college student from West Chester, Pennsylvania, spent hours getting her REAL ID and was not happy about it. Ive been out here for three hours to get one ID when Ive already had one that should have lasted me until about 2029, Leggett said.  You have to do it. But it feels like a waste of time, she said.  REAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that Homeland Security says is a more secure form of identification. It was a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission and signed into law in 2005.  The commission recommended the government set security standards for state-issued drivers licenses and IDs. It was supposed to be rolled out in 2008. But the implementation has been repeatedly delayed. Besides needing a REAL ID to fly domestically, people will also need one to access certain federal buildings and facilities. In recent weeks, Noem has been warning the American public about the upcoming deadline. In a television ad put out by Homeland Security, she warned that these IDs were needed for air travel and for entering public buildings, adding: These IDs keep our country safe.

In California, about 58% of all drivers license and ID cardholders have a REAL ID. The state has extended the hours of some Department of Motor Vehicles offices through June 27 to help more people get the federally required identification. Officials are also reminding residents that if they already have a valid U.S. passport, they can use that and wait to upgrade to a REAL ID when their ID or drivers license is due for renewal. Lucas Krump was traveling Tuesday to San Francisco on business from Newark, New Jersey, and said he was using a passport to get through security.  I dont have a license that is Real ID, he said. I question the bureaucracy around it. It feels like attacks on everyday people, having to upgrade their licenses and all of their identification for something that really, you know, seems like weve been fine without it. At the Driver Services Bureau in Jackson, Mississippi, there were no long lines Tuesday, and people were getting their REAL IDs fairly quickly.  Marion Henderson said before going in that she planned to travel to California, Michigan, Chicago and New York this year and wanted to be prepared.  Even though I have my license, now that its required, I wanted to go ahead and get it done ahead of the deadline, Henderson said.  ___ Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.

Florida raises basketball coach Todd Goldens salary to $6M annually after national title,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP)  Florida basketball coach Todd Golden has signed a contract extension that raises his annual salary to $6 million, a lucrative bump nearly a month after the Gators won the national championship. Golden inked a six-year, $40.5 million extension Tuesday night, adding a year to his current deal and putting him under contract through the 2030-31 season. He signed a two-year extension in March 2024 that increased his average salary to $4.1 million annually. His latest raise is a significant commitment from Florida and puts Golden nearly on par with football coach Billy Napier, who is scheduled to make $7.4 million in 2025. Goldens deal pays $6 million a year (beginning April 16, 2025), with a $300,000 pay hike every year after. The coach of the reigning national mens college hoops champion is getting a raise. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports. Todd has done an incredible job getting Florida mens basketball back where it belongs, athletic director Scott Stricklin said in a statement. We believed in his vision, his competitive nature and his modern approach to the game back in 2022, and he has validated that belief in a relatively short time and helped create memories of a lifetime for another generation of Gator fans. The new money makes the 39-year-old Golden the second-highest-paid basketball coach in the Southeastern Conference behind Arkansas John Calipari, who earns $8 million annually. Golden, once an assistant under Bruce Pearl at Auburn who got his first head coaching job at San Francisco in 2019, previously ranked 12th out of 16 coaches in the league. 
        
     He now jumps to fifth among the seven active coaches with national titles, behind Bill Self of Kansas, Calipari, UConns Dan Hurley and Michigan States Tom Izzo. As weve shown during our time in Gainesville, the University of Florida is an institution that has the resources, support, and people in place to compete and win national championships, Golden said in a statement. Goldens new deal is nearly fully guaranteed. Florida would owe him 85% of the remaining value if the school fired him without cause at any point. Goldens buyout to leave Gainesville starts at $16 million next season and drops annually: $11 million in 2026-27; $4 million in 2027-28; $3 million in 2028-29; $2 million in 2029-30; and $1 million in 2030-31. However, Golden can leave for the NBA at a much lower price. His NBA buyout begins at $3 million next season and drops to $2 million (2026-28) and then $1 million in 2028-29. Included in Goldens annual compensation is a $500,000 signing bonus, a $500,000 annual longevity incentive and a $60,000 annual expense account. In addition to that, he gets $70,000 annually in travel allowance for using the university athletic associations plane and other fringe benefits valued at $62,000. He would get a $100,000 bonus for winning the SEC regular-season championship, a $50,000 bonus for winning the SEC Tournament, a $100,000 bonus for making the NCAA Tournament and a $50,000 bonus for every NCAA Tournament victory. With Golden at the helm for his third season in Gainesville, the Gators finished 36-4 and beat Houston to clinch the programs third national title. They won their final 12 games, including four in the NCAA Tournament in come-from-behind fashion. Floridas style of play under Golden has drawn rave reviews, leading to sellouts in eight of the teams last 10 home games. Florida averaged 84.8 points a game this season after setting the program record (85.6) during the 2023-24 campaign. Golden became the third coach this century to win a national title within his first three seasons on the job, joining North Carolinas Roy Williams (2005) and UConns Kevin Ollie (2014). Williams and Ollie accomplished the feat in their second seasons. Golden has a modest rebuild on his hands now. Leading scorer Walter Clayton, the Final Fours Most Outstanding Player, is headed to the NBA along with fellow guards Alijah Martin and Will Richard. Forwards Alex Condon and Rueben Chinyelu are going through the NBA draft process with the potential to stay in school and return for next season. Backup guard Denzel Aberdeen (Kentucky) and backup forward Sam Alexis (Indiana) transferred, and assistant coaches Kevin Hovde (Columbia) and John Andrzejek (Campbell) took head coaching jobs. Golden signed two guards out of the transfer portal  Princetons Xaivian Lee and Ohios AJ Brown  and have swingman CJ Ingram and guard Alex Lloyd joining the team as incoming freshmen. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

"Home of Philadelphia 76ers, Flyers lands naming rights deal with Xfinity Mobile","PHILADELPHIA (AP)  The home of the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76ers has a new name. The arena will be renamed Xfinity Mobile Arena, effective Sept. 1 and running through the 2030-2031 season. Banking giant Wells Fargo announced last year that it would not renew its deal with building owner and operator Comcast Spectacor  the parent company of the Flyers  when it expires in August. Financial terms were not announced. Wells Fargo paid a reported $1.4 million annually as part of the naming rights deal. The arena, originally named CoreStates Center, opened in 1996 and has been the home to Philly sports stars like Allen Iverson, Eric Lindros and Joel Embiid, as well as NCAA Tournament games. The building has carried a number of names, including the First Union Center in 1998 and Wachovia Center in 2003. Wells Fargo bought out Wachovia and posted its name on the roughly 21,000-seat building in 2010. Comcast Spectacor last year completed a $400 million renovation project of the Wells Fargo Center. The 76ers earlier this year announced they would partner with Comcast Spectacor, their current landlord, to build a new arena in South Philadelphia and abandon a deal with the city to move downtown. Comcast will own the naming rights to the arena being developed via a joint venture between HBSE and Comcast Spectacor, set to open in the 2031-2032 season. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/flyers-76ers-philadelphia-xfinity-comcast-d5a3c6dc790d5ef8ecdceb61475dc1d9,business
Champion skier Mikaela Shiffrin joins NWSL Denvers ownership group,"DENVER (AP)  Olympic gold medal-winning skier Mikaela Shiffrin has joined the ownership group of the National Womens Soccer League expansion team in Denver, set to launch next year. Shiffrin, an eight-time world champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist, is the most decorated alpine skier of all time. She is the latest celebrity athlete to invest in an NWSL team. Others run the gamut from NBA star James Harden (Houston Dash) to former NFL quarterback Eli Manning (Gotham FC) to actress Natalie Portman (Angel City). Im beyond thrilled to join the ownership group of Denver NWSL and support something so meaningful in the community I call home, Shiffrin said in a statement Tuesday. The sport culture in Colorado is rich and deep, and  most notably  the growth of womens sports is one of the most exciting movements in our culture today. Denver was awarded the NWSLs 16th team earlier this year. A club in Boston will join Denver in kicking off next year. In March, the Denver teams owners unveiled plans for a new downtown soccer stadium. The facility will be only the second purpose-built womens soccer stadium in the league after the Kansas City Current opened CPKC Stadium last year. Denvers owners more recently announced plans for a temporary stadium and training facility in Centennial, Colorado, southeast of Denver. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/nwsl-denver-mikaela-shiffrin-35720a317458e5cb31890e77a4672a79,business
What customers can expect as Rite Aid closes or sells all its drugstores,"Rite Aid customers can expect their local store to close or change ownership in the next few months, as the struggling drugstore chain goes through another bankruptcy filing. The company plans to sell customer prescription files, inventory and other assets as it closes distribution centers and unloads store locations. Stores will remain open for now, but the company isnt buying new inventory so bare shelves are likely become more common. I think what well progressively see is the stores will become more and more spartan, said retail analyst Neil Saunders. The company runs 1,245 stores in 15 states, according to its website. It has a heavy presence in New York, Pennsylvania and California, which alone has 347 locations. Heres what customers can expect next. Rite Aid says a few months for most of its stores. All locations will eventually close or be sold to a new owner. Until then, customers will still be able to fill prescriptions, get immunizations and shop in the stores or online. Rite Aid has said that it will stop issuing customer rewards points for purchases. It also will no longer honor gift cards or accept returns or exchanges starting next month. 
        
     Rite Aid will try to sell them to another drugstore, grocer or retailer with a pharmacy. The company says it is working to put together a smooth transfer of customer prescriptions to other pharmacies. But theres no guarantee those files will wind up at a retailer near the location that is closing. That may be challenging because some Rite Aid stores are in rural areas, miles away from another pharmacy, noted Saunders, managing director of the consulting and data analysis firm GlobalData. Prescription files can be valuable assets because they can connect the acquiring drugstore with a regular customer if that person sticks with the new store. Philadelphia-based Rite Aid had been closing stores and struggling with losses for years before its first bankruptcy filing in 2023. The company says its only viable path forward is a return to Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The company said in letter to vendors that it has been hit with several financial challenges that have grown more intense. Rite Aid and its competitors have been dealing with tighter profits on their prescriptions, increased theft, court settlements over opioid prescriptions and customers who are drifting to online shopping and discount retailers. Walgreens, which has more than six times as many stores as Rite Aid, agreed in March to be acquired by the private equity firm Sycamore Partners. CVS Health also has closed stores. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

DoorDash agrees to acquire UK rival Deliveroo for $3.9 billion,"LONDON (AP)  DoorDash, the ubiquitous U.S. food delivery app, has agreed to acquire British rival Deliveroo for 2.9 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in cash, expanding its business in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.  San Francisco-based DoorDash will pay 180 pence ($2.40) for each Deliveroo share, 29% more than the closing price on April 24, the day before the offer was announced, the companies said in a joint statement before the London Stock Exchange opened for trading on Tuesday. The deal is DoorDashs second major international acquisition in three years as the company expands from its traditional base in the U.S., Canada and Australia. After the purchase of Deliveroo, and the 2022 acquisition of Helsinki-based Wolt Enterprises, DoorDash will operate in more than 40 markets worldwide. I could not be more excited by the prospect of what DoorDash and Deliveroo will be able to accomplish together, DoorDash CEO Tony Xu said in the statement. Both companies were founded in 2013, using the then emerging technology of smartphones to link restaurants and their customers to a network of delivery riders. Deliveroo now operates in nine countries, including the U.K. and Ireland, which accounted for 59% of its business in 2023. It also does business in France, Italy, Belgium, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar.  The acquisition comes less than three months after technology investment company Prosus agreed to buy Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway.com for 4.1 billion euros ($4.29 billion), boosting its food delivery portfolio in Europe.",https://apnews.com/article/uk-deliveroo-doordash-acquisition-delivery-6b8655dab08ed3161241b2456d3d3a45,business
US imposes sanctions on Myanmar ethnic militia for facilitating cyber scams,"BANGKOK (AP)  An ethnic militia in southeastern Myanmar that has been sanctioned by the United States for alleged involvement in human trafficking and online scams on Tuesday denied the accusations. The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday announced sanctions against the Karen National Army, or KNA, as well as its leader Col. Saw Chit Thu and his sons, Saw Htoo Eh Moo and Saw Chit Chit. They are accused of facilitating cyber scams that harm U.S. citizens, human trafficking, and cross-border smuggling, according to a Treasury Department statement. Cyber scam operations, such as those run by the KNA, generate billions in revenue for criminal kingpins and their associates, while depriving victims of their hard-earned savings and sense of security, said Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender. Treasury is committed to using all available tools to disrupt these networks and hold accountable those who seek to profit from these criminal schemes. Those who are hired to carry out the scams have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretences and find themselves trapped in virtual slavery. The sanctions block the targeted individuals and their companies from accessing money and assets under U.S. control, and prohibit U.S. citizens from providing financial services to them. Saw Chit Thu has already been sanctioned by the European Union and the U.K. for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking.  
        
     Lt. Col. Naing Maung Zaw, a spokesperson for the KNA  which operates as the Karen ethnic minoritys official Border Guard Force affiliated with Myanmars military government  said the groups activities are aimed at regional development and not related to cyber scams. He described the U.S. sanctions as a deliberate act of abasement by a powerful country over a weaker one. They are doing it because they can, he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Local militias in several border regions have de facto control in areas where their minority groups are dominant. The KNA controls Shwe Kokko and some areas in Myawaddy, on the border with Thailand in the state of Kayin, also known as Karen state. Shwe Kokko and Myawaddy are known havens for criminal syndicates that have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams, including romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Critics have accused the KNA of being involved in the criminal activities, at least to the extent of providing protection to the scam centers. Naing Maung Zaw said scam operations were carried out not only in areas controlled by the KNA but also in other places in Myawaddy. He acknowledged that his group rented land to some businesses holding the property where scam centers were located and said the KNA would continue with its mass repatriation of the foreigners working in scam centers, which it carries out in cooperation with the military government. He said 7,454 of 8,575 foreign scam workers have been repatriated through Thailand following a crackdown on the scam centers by Thailand, Myanmar and China in February. Naing Maung Zaw said more than 10,000 people remain to be identified in the KNA-controlled areas, and the group will continue to work toward the elimination of scam activities.  Kayin state, which is dominated by the Karen ethnic minority, has seen intense armed conflict since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. The U.S. has previously imposed sanctions on Myanmars military leaders, their suppliers and state-owned banks in connection with alleged human rights abuses",https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-us-sanctions-cybercime-fraud-7915e341c8490e527af64084bb0e2694,business
DoorDash rings up record first-quarter revenue and expands delivery reach through acquisitions,"DoorDash said Tuesday that demand for deliveries remained strong in the first quarter even as more Americans feel increasingly uneasy about the U.S. economy.  We havent seen any changes in consumer behavior even if there are changes in consumer sentiment, co-founder and CEO Tony Xu said in a call with investors. Food really is the most resilient category. Total orders climbed 18% to 732 million, a quarterly record. DoorDash said demand for grocery delivery surpassed prior quarters, with more than 25% of active users ordering groceries. DoorDash said it also added U.S. restaurants to its platform and broadened its geographic reach. Customers who use the companys DashPass and Wolt+ subscription services, which charge a monthly fee, feel delivery is more affordable, said Chief Financial Officer Ravi Inukonda. The San Francisco company said 22 million people subscribe to those services.  DoorDash confirmed that it will acquire Britains Deliveroo for 2.9 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in cash, expanding its business in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Deliveroo first announced it had received a bid from DoorDash just over a week ago.  It also said Tuesday that it had purchased SevenRooms, a New York company that makes hospitality management software, for $1.2 billion in cash. DoorDash said the deal will expand its offerings to merchants and help them grow in-store sales and customer marketing. 
        
     DoorDash expects the SevenRooms deal to close in the second half of this year, while the Deliveroo deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The acquisitions are the biggest for DoorDash since 2022, when it bought Finnish rival Wolt Enterprises for $8.1 billion. That deal brought DoorDash into 22 countries where it didnt already operate, including Germany and Israel. With the addition of Deliveroo, Xu said DoorDash will operate in 45 countries, 30 of them in Europe. Deliveroo, which was founded in 2013, served 7 million monthly active users last year. DoorDash, founded the same year, has 42 million monthly active users. Investors expressed some concern about DoorDashs ability to generate profits as it integrates Deliveroo. DoorDash shares dropped nearly 9% Tuesday. Inukonda said the increasing scale will help drive profitability. Our goal is to improve unit economics. Take that and continue to drive improvements in retention and order frequency, which ultimately drive scale. And that scale drives profitability in the business, he said. Revenue at DoorDash rose 21% to a quarterly record of $3.03 billion. That was short of Wall Streets forecast of $3.09 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Net income was $193 million, a year after the company reported a $23 million loss for the January-March period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 44 cents per share, topping Wall Street expectations by a nickel.",https://apnews.com/article/doordash-first-quarter-deliveroo-sevenrooms-47e21b6a18ac4cfa91fba0bfb479d56a,business
US stocks sink again as more companies detail damage theyre taking because of Trumps trade war,"U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday as quarterly results show more companies are scrubbing their forecasts for upcoming profits because of uncertainty created by President Donald Trumps tariffs. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, its second drop after breaking a nine-day winning streak, its longest such run in more than 20 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite finished 0.9% lower. Palantir Technologies was one of the heaviest weights on the market as it sank 12%. The company, which offers an AI platform for customers, dropped even though it reported a profit for the latest quarter that met analysts expectations and raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. AI-related companies have been finding it more difficult recently to convince investors to support their stocks after theyve already shot so high. Palantirs stocks price remains near $110, when it was sitting at only $20 less than a year ago.  The APs Seth Sutel tells us the markets are sinking again. The return to Earth for AI stocks is happening as Trumps tariffs change the economic landscape for other companies.  Clorox CEO Linda Rendle said her company saw changes in shopping behavior during the first three months of the year, for example, that led to lower revenue. The company reported both weaker revenue and profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Clorox expects the slowdowns to continue in the current quarter, and its stock fell 2.4%. Mattel, meanwhile, said its pausing its financial forecasts for 2025, in part because the evolving U.S. tariff landscape is making it difficult to predict how much U.S. shoppers will spend over the holiday season and the rest of this year.  
        
     The toymaker closed 2.8% higher after also reporting better results for the latest quarter than analysts feared. Ford Motor said its expecting to take a $1.5 billion hit this year because of tariffs. The automaker also said its cancelling financial forecasts for the full year because of tariff-related uncertainty. The stock rose 2.7%. Theyre the latest companies to join a lengthening list that have yanked their forecasts for the year given uncertainty about what Trumps on-again, off-again rollout of tariffs will do to the economy. The hope is that Trump will relent on some of his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries. Without them, many investors expect the economy to fall into a recession. Regardless, all the will-he-wont-he uncertainty around tariffs has already made U.S. households more pessimistic about the economy and could affect their long-term plans for purchases. That uncertainty has helped fuel a surge in imports ahead of potentially more severe tariffs ahead.  The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of tariffs that went into effect in April and others that have been postponed until July. That follows another update from last week showing that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace during the first quarter of the year because of a surge in imports. Some companies say theyre already seeing impacts to their business from the uncertainty created by tariffs. Food processing giant Archer Daniels Midland said that operating profit for agricultural services slumped 31% during its most recent quarter because of trade policy uncertainty. The stock rose 1.7%. DoorDash fell 7.4% after reporting weaker revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter, though it may have also offered a more encouraging snapshot of how U.S. households are doing. The company said order growth in its U.S. marketplace remained healthy and consistent with average growth over the last year. All told, the S&P 500 fell 43.47 points to 5,606.91. The Dow dropped 389.83 points to 40,829, and the Nasdaq lost 154.58 points to close at 17,689.66. Treasury yields closed broadly lower in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.31% from 4.36% late Monday. The Federal Reserve is beginning a two-day meeting, and it will announce its next move on interest rates Wednesday. Virtually no one expects it to do anything to its main rate, even though Trump has been advocating for cuts. While the possibility still exists for potential rate cuts later this year, the economic picture is complicated, and its too early to know if or when those cuts might happen, said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research and consulting at TransUnion. Lower interest rates could help goose the economy, but they could also give inflation more fuel. And worries are already simmering that Trumps tariffs could push inflation higher. Markets were mixed across Europe and Asia. Indexes rose 1.1% in Shanghai and 0.7% in Hong Kong. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-fed-trump-tariffs-bf90daa13604b67ab355ab63a43e166f,business
Wall Street rises on hopes for trade deals that could forestall a recession,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks rose Thursday after the United States and United Kingdom announced a deal on trade that would lower some tariffs between the two countries, the first of what Wall Street hopes will be enough agreements to keep a recession from hitting the economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% for its 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 254 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1%.  It wasnt just stocks. Bitcoin jumped back above $101,000, and crude oil prices climbed, while the price of gold eased back as investors felt less need for safety. Treasury yields rose on bets that more trade deals with other countries may mean the Federal Reserve wont need to cut interest rates as sharply as feared in order to prop up the economy.  Stocks and other financial markets have been swinging for weeks with hopes that President Donald Trump could reach such deals that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked. Trump on Thursday lauded what he called a maxed-out trade deal with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10% tariffs on U.K. products but would lower taxes on U.K. automobiles in exchange for greater access in the U.K. market for U.S. beef, ethanol and other products.  Trump said it may take weeks to finalize all the details in the U.K. deal, but he also gave potentially encouraging updates on talks pending with an even bigger trading partner, China.  
        
     The worlds second-largest economy is set to meet with high-level U.S. officials in Switzerland this weekend. China has been calling for the United States to cancel its tariffs, while Trump has said that he wouldnt reduce his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods as a condition for negotiations.  Asked on Thursday whether he would consider lowering tariffs on Chinese imports if this weekends talks go well, Trump said, It could be. Were going to see. Right now, you cant get any higher. Its at 145. So we know its coming down. He also said he expects the talks in Switzerland to be substantive. Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from U.S. companies have also helped to drive the S&P 500 closer to its all-time high set in February. Its back within 7.8% after dropping nearly 20% below the mark a month ago.

It credited new, younger customers in North America, among other things. Molson Coors, though, described a different landscape when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts expectations. Its stock fell 4.5%.  The global macroeconomic environment is volatile, CEO Gavin Hattersley said. Uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade policy, including the impacts on economic growth, consumer confidence and expectations around inflation, and currencies has pressured the beer industry and consumption trends.  It became the latest company to either lower or pull its financial forecasts for 2025 given the uncertainty. Krispy Kreme tumbled 24.7% after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year.

The U.S. economy has remained OK so far, with the Federal Reserve saying Wednesday  that it still looks to be running at a solid rate underneath the surface. But pessimism has soured sharply among U.S. households because of tariffs, and the fear is that all the uncertainty created by them could be enough to force the economy into a recession. A couple reports on the economy Thursday came in mixed. One said slightly fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment  benefits last week. But another said productivity for U.S. workers slowed by more than economists expected at the start of the year. That could keep upward pressure on inflation, when tariffs could be set to raise prices for all kinds of imported products.  Treasury yields rose following the reports, and the 10-year yield climbed to 4.38% from 4.26% late Wednesday.  The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for action by the Fed, leaped to 3.89% from 3.78%. Traders pared back expectations for how many times the Fed may cut interest rates later this year.  In stock markets abroad, the FTSE 100 slipped 0.3% in London after the Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.  Indexes rose across much of the rest of Europe and Asia. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/markets-interest-rates-federal-reserve-trump-tariffs-inflation-8ebf3f0d6c5bb0b0d90852cca08263ef,business
"Asian stocks are mixed after hopes for China-US talks, trade deal with the UK lift Wall Street","HONG KONG (AP)  Shares were mixed in Asia on Friday as investors pinned their hopes on weekend trade talks between China and the U.S.  U.S. futures and oil prices logged modest gains.  China reported that its exports rose at a faster-than-expected 8.1% annual pace in April, down from 12.4% the month before. Exports to the United States dropped more than 20%, however, as President Donald Trumps steep tariff increases took effect.  Hong Kongs Hang Seng slipped 0.1% to 22,777.82, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3% to 3,343.38. Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials are due to meet Saturday in Geneva, Switzerland.  Asked on Thursday whether he would consider lowering tariffs on Chinese imports if this weekends talks go well, Trump said, It could be. Were going to see. Right now, you cant get any higher.

Tokyos Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5% to 37,493.65, while the Kospi in Seoul was almost unchanged at 2,578.64. Australias S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 8,228.10. Taiwans Taiex surged 1.7%.  U.S. stocks rose Thursday after the United States and United Kingdom announced a deal on trade that would lower some tariffs between the two countries, the first of what Wall Street hopes will be enough agreements to keep a recession from hitting the economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to 5,663.94 for its 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6% to 41,368.45, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% to 17,928.14.  
        
     Trump lauded what he called a maxed-out trade deal with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10% tariffs on U.K. products but lower taxes on U.K. automobiles in exchange for greater access in the U.K. market for U.S. beef, ethanol and other products.  Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from U.S. companies also have helped to drive the S&P 500 to within 7.8% of its all-time high set in February after it dropped nearly 20% below the mark a month ago.

Democrats block stablecoin bill as they raise concerns about Trumps crypto ventures,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Senate Democrats have blocked legislation to regulate stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency, after arguing that the bill needed stronger protections and airing concerns that it could help President Donald Trump enrich himself. The bill, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had previously won some Democratic support. But it failed 49-48 on a procedural vote Thursday after Democrats said that they needed to see more changes to the legislation before they could back it.  Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans would work with Democrats if they allowed the bill to move forward, but they refused. All Democrats voted not to bring it up. The vote is a blow to one of Trumps top legislative priorities and a setback for the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last years election and has been emboldened to cement its influence in politics and the mainstream financial system. The legislation would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws. Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrencys notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset to make commercial transactions than other forms of crypto. While some Democrats agree that regulation is needed, and several voted to move the bill out of committee, Trumps involvement in the crypto industry has complicated the legislations path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And earlier this week, Trump promoted a dinner hes set to attend on May 22 thats open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins. 
        
     Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the worlds largest cryptocurrency exchange. Among other proposed changes, Democrats said that elected officials and their families should be barred from owning, controlling or promoting stablecoin business ventures. The Senate should not pass a bill that facilitates Trumps breathtaking corruption and lines his pockets and welcomes other elected officials to do the same, said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. A former skeptic turned zealous promotor, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previously enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industrys top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation. The legislation could still move forward if the two parties can come to a deal. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who has been helping negotiate the legislation, said in a statement after the vote that he would continue to work on it.  I remain fully committed to getting this right, Warner said. A group of nine Democrats, including Warner, said in a release over the weekend that they could not support the legislation until it included stronger provisions on money laundering, foreign issuers and accountability for those who violate it, among other concerns. They did not mention Trump.  We recognize that the absence of regulation leaves consumers unprotected and vulnerable to predatory practices, the Democrats said. Thune, the Republican leader, questioned Democrats motives, speculating that they just wanted to deny Trump a bipartisan win.  It makes you wonder if this is about the bill at all, he said of their opposition.  ___",https://apnews.com/article/senate-cryptocurrency-trump-bill-stablecoins-regulation-blocked-b38d40abff48b48902f8249eb4ef626b,business
Fishermen battling with changing oceans chart new course after Trumps push to deregulate,"STONINGTON, Maine (AP)  Virginia Olsen has pulled lobsters from Maines chilly Atlantic waters for decades while watching threats to the states lifeblood industry mount. Trade imbalances with Canada, tight regulations on fisheries and offshore wind farms towering like skyscrapers on open water pose three of those threats, said Olsen, part of the fifth generation in her family to make a living in the lobster trade.  Thats why she was encouraged last month when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that promises to restore American fisheries to their former glory. The order promises to shred fishing regulations, and Olsen said that will allow fishermen to do what they do best  fish.  That will make a huge difference in communities like her home of Stonington, the busiest lobster fishing port in the country, Olsen said. Its a tiny island town of winding streets, swooping gulls and mansard roof houses with an economy almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing, some three hours up the coast from Portland, Maines biggest city. Olsen knows firsthand how much has changed over the years. Hundreds of fish and shellfish populations globally have dwindled to dangerously low levels, alarming scientists and prompting the restrictions and catch limits that Trumps order could wash away with the stroke of a pen. But shes heartened that the livelihoods of people who work the traps and cast the nets have become a priority in faraway places where they often felt their voices werent heard. I do think its time to have the conversation on what regulations that the industry does need. Were fishing different than we did 100 years ago, she said. If everything is being looked at, we should be looking at the regulations within the fishing industry. But if fishing and lobstering interests finally have a seat at the table, the questions become how much seafood can be served there  and for how long. Trumps April 17 order, called Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness, promises an overhaul of the way America fishes, and cites a national seafood trade deficit of more than $20 billion as the reason to do it. The order calls on the federal government to reduce the regulatory burden on fishermen by later this month. It arrives at a time when conservation groups and many marine scientists say the ocean needs more regulation, not less. One oft-cited 2020 study led by a scientist at the University of British Columbia looked at more than 1,300 fish and invertebrate populations and found that 82% were below levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields. The university said the study discovered global declines, some severe, of many popularly consumed species. Trumps order prioritizes commerce over conservation. It also calls for the development of a comprehensive seafood trade strategy and a review of existing marine monuments, which are underwater protected zones, to see if any should be opened for fishing. At least one, the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, has already been reopened. Many commercial fishermen and fishing trade groups lauded the order. Members of the industry, one of the oldest in the country, have long made the case that heavy regulations  many intended to protect the health of fish populations  leave the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage to the fleets of countries that dont bear the same kind of burden. That disadvantage is a big piece of why America imports more than two-thirds of its seafood, they argue. The presidents executive order recognizes the challenges our fishing families and communities face, and we appreciate the commitment to reduce burdensome regulations and strengthen the competitiveness of American seafood, said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermens Association. Some fishermen, including Maine lobsterman Don McHenan, said theyre looking forward to members of the industry being able to fish in areas of the ocean that have been closed off to them for years. McHenan said hes also hopeful the pace of new regulations will slow. As long as they dont put any more onto us, McHenan said. Well see  time will tell. But the support for deregulation is not unanimous among fishermen. Some say strong conservation laws are critical to protecting species that fishermen rely on to make a living. In Alaska, for example, Matt Wiebe said the executive order terrifies him. A commercial fisherman with more than 50 years of experience fishing for salmon, he said the order could potentially harm the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery, which has received praise from sustainability organizations for careful management of the fish supply. Absent that management, he said the worlds largest sockeye salmon fishery could go the way of the New England cod fishing business, which collapsed due in large part to overfishing and has never recovered. Since New England fishers lost their cod fishery due to overfishing, many other fisheries came to respect and depend on conservation efforts, Wiebe said. We fish because its what we do, and conservation efforts mean we and our kids can fish into the future. The executive order arrived at a time when Americas commercial fishermen are coping with environmental challenges and the decline of some once-marketable species. Maines historic shrimp fishery shuttered more than a decade ago, Californias salmon industry is struggling through closures and the number of fish stocks on the federal overfished list has grown in recent years. There is also the looming question of what Trumps trade war with major seafood producers such as Canada and China will mean for the U.S. industry  not to mention American consumers. To many in Maines lobster and fishing business, the answer is clear: Cut regulations and let them do their thing. We definitely feel the industry is over-regulated as a whole, said Dustin Delano, a fourth-generation Maine lobsterman who is also chief operating officer of the New England Fishermens Stewardship Association. We hope that this will help for sure. It does seek to initiate that America-first strategy in the fishery. ___",https://apnews.com/article/trump-seafood-climate-change-fishing-regulations-abd37f0baaeaf6897a2926902eba10e6,business
"Wall Street storms back from early losses, echoing its manic moves through a historic April","NEW YORK (AP)  Much like its wild month of April, a scary Wednesday for Wall Street found a gentler ending as U.S. stocks stormed back from steep early losses to continue their manic swings amid uncertainty about what President Donald Trumps trade war  will do to the economy. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to extend its winning streak to a seventh day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 141 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite edged down by 0.1%. It was a stunning reversal after the S&P 500 dropped as much as 2.3% and the Dow fell 780 points in early trading. Stocks initially tumbled after a report suggested the U.S. economy may have shrunk  at the start of the year, falling well short of economists expectations, in a sharp turnaround from the economys solid growth at the end of last year.  Importers rushed to bring products into the country before tariffs could raise their prices, which helped drag on the countrys overall gross domestic product.  Such data raised the threat of a worst-case scenario called stagflation, one where the economy stagnates yet inflation remains high. Economists fear it because the Federal Reserve has no good tools to fix both problems at the same time. If the Fed were to try to help one problem by adjusting interest rates, it would likely make the other worse. Even if todays weak GDP may have partially reflected companies trying to get ahead of tariffs, it was still a stagflation warning shot over the bow of the economy, according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.  
        
     But some better news came later in the day when a report said the measure of inflation that the Fed likes to use slowed  in March. Inflation decelerated to 2.3%, closer to the Feds goal of 2%, from Februarys reading of 2.7%. Stocks began paring their losses almost immediately after the report.  If inflation keeps trending lower, it would give the Fed more leeway to cut interest rates in order to juice the economy. Expectations are building for the Fed to cut its main interest rate at least four times by the end of this year, according to data from CME Group, though it likely wont begin at its next meeting next week. Much of Wednesdays economic data raised concerns about a weakening economy. A report on the job market from ADP suggested employers outside the government may have hired far fewer workers in April than economists expected, less than half.  Its discouraging because a relatively solid job market has been one of the linchpins keeping the U.S. economy stable. A more comprehensive report on the job market from the U.S. government will arrive on Friday.  Wednesdays reports add to worries that Trumps trade war may drag the U.S. economy into a recession. The presidents on-again-off-again rollout of tariffs has created deep uncertainty about whats to come, which could cause damage by itself. Im not taking a credit or discredit for the stock market, Trump said Wednesday. Im just saying we inherited a mess. Uncertainty around Trumps tariffs has already triggered historic swings for financial markets, from stocks to bonds to the value of the U.S. dollar, that battered investors through April. The S&P 500 briefly dropped nearly 20% below its all-time high  set earlier this year, with scary headlines at one point warning of the potential for the worst April since the Great Depression.  But the uncertainty has been two-sided, and hopes that Trump may relent on some of his tariffs helped the S&P 500 claw back a chunk of its losses. It ended April with a decline of just 0.8%, much milder than Marchs, and its only 9.4% below its record. Stronger-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies have helped support the market, and Seagate Technology jumped 11.6% for one of Wednesdays biggest gains after the maker of data storage joined the parade. Gains for other storage makers also helped to offset drops for stocks within the artificial-intelligence industry, which have been pulling back on worries their prices shot too high in prior years. Super Micro Computer warned that some customers delayed purchases in the latest quarter, which caused the maker of servers used in AI and other computing to slash its forecast for sales and profit. Its stock tumbled 11.5% for the largest loss in the S&P 500. Starbucks sank 5.7% after the coffee chain fell short of analysts forecasts for revenue and profit in the latest quarter. Starbucks did log its first quarterly sales increase in more than a year, but acknowledged that its turnaround effort is far from complete. All told, the S&P 500 rose 8.23 points to 5,569.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 141.74 to 40,669.36, and the Nasdaq composite fell 14.98 to 17,446.34. It still marked the close of a third straight losing month for the S&P 500. Stocks in the energy industry took some of the hardest hits, dropping over three times more than any of the other 11 sectors that make up the index.  Halliburton, an oil services company, lost nearly 22% in April as the price of crude slid on worries that tariffs will weaken the global economy.  In the bond market, Treasury yields fell as investors ratcheted up their expectations for cuts to interest rates by the Fed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.17% from 4.19% late Tuesday.  Lower interest rates in general give boosts to prices for stocks and other investments. Yields have largely been sinking since an unsettling, unusual spurt higher earlier this month rattled both Wall Street and the U.S. government. That rise had suggested investors worldwide may have been losing faith in the U.S. bond markets reputation as a safe place to park cash. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.  ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-autos-tariffs-trump-earnings-bbad7ca16bceb8c35822d906b195f5d2,business
US consumer confidence plummets to Covid-era low as trade war stokes anxiety,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Americans confidence in the economy slumped for the fifth straight month to the lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as anxiety over the impact of tariffs takes a heavy toll.  The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.9 points in April to 86, its lowest reading since May 2020. Nearly one-third of consumers expect hiring to slow in the coming months, nearly matching the level reached in April 2009, when the economy was mired in the Great Recession. The figures reflect a rapidly souring mood among Americans, most of whom expect prices to rise because of the widespread tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. About half of Americans are also worried about the potential for a recession, according to a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center.  Rattled consumers spend less than confident consumers, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in an email. If confidence sags and consumers retrench, growth will go down. A measure of Americans short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market plunged 12.5 points to 54.4, the lowest level in more than 13 years. The reading is well below 80, which typically signals a recession ahead.  How this gloomy mood translates into spending, hiring, and growth will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. On Wednesday, the government will report on U.S. economic growth during the first three months of the year, and economists are expecting a sharp slowdown as Americans pulled back on spending after a strong winter holiday shopping season.  
        
     And on Friday the Labor Department will release its latest report on hiring and the unemployment rate. Overall, economists expect it should still show steady job gains, though some forecast it could report sharply reduced hiring.  The stark decline in consumer confidence also likely reflected the sharp swings in stock and bond prices that roiled financial markets earlier this month. While all age groups and most income brackets reported lower confidence, the decline was steepest among households earning more than $125,000 and among consumers 35 to 55 years old. Though major U.S. markets rebounded over the past week, the S&P 500 is still down 6% for the year and the Dow Jones has lost 5%. The growth-heavy Nasdaq is down 10% in 2025.  The Conference Board said that mentions of tariffs in write-in responses reached an all-time high this month, with the duties on the top of consumers minds. Trump has imposed a tariff of 10% on nearly all imports, as well as a huge 145% tariff on most goods from China. He has imposed separate import taxes on steel, aluminum, and cars.  More Americans are also now worried that the economy could tip into a recession, with the proportion of consumers expecting a downturn in the next 12 months reaching a two-year high.  Fewer consumers said they were planning to buy a home or car in the next six months. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes slowed last month in a lackluster start to the spring homebuying season as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged those looking.  And Americans also said they would spend less on services. The proportion of Americans planning an overseas vacation in the next six months fell to 16.4%, down from 24.1% in December. And the proportion of consumers planning to spend more on dining out plummeted by nearly the most on record in April, the Conference Board said.",https://apnews.com/article/economy-confidence-tariffs-f3cb9058971c008127f8dc22c8933296,business
Wall Street rises as corporate profits pile higher along with uncertainty about Trumps trade war,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks rose again Tuesday as stronger-than-expected profits kept piling higher for companies, though CEOs said theyre unsure  how long that can last because of uncertainty around President Donald Trumps trade war. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to extend its winning streak to a sixth day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 300 points, or 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.5%.  Honeywell International helped lead the market with a gain of 5.4% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Perhaps even more importantly for investors, it also raised its forecast for profit over the full year. Though we have not yet seen it in our results, we recognize we face an uncertain global demand environment for the remainder of 2025, and our company will work tirelessly, leveraging all tools available to us, to deliver for customers and shareholders, CEO Vimal Kapur said. Sherwin-Williams rose 4.8% for another one of the markets bigger gains after the paint and coatings company likewise reported a better-than-expected profit.  CEO Heidi Petz said it expects to see softness from some of its customers persist well into the second half of this year, but she also said her company gets the majority of its raw materials from the regions where it manufactures. That could help blunt the possible impact from tariffs. Other stocks werent as strong, even though their companies reported stronger-than-expected profits.  
        
     Much like the broader market, UPS stock swung between losses and gains at the days start of trading after it reported a stronger profit than analysts expected  for the first three months of 2025. Because its the worlds largest package delivery company, UPS can offer a window into how the global economy is doing. But UPS also said it wasnt updating its financial forecasts previously given for 2025 because of the current macro-economic uncertainty. It also said it expects to cut about 20,000 jobs and close 73 buildings this year as part of a cost-cutting effort that CEO Carol Tom said could not be timelier. Its stock finished 0.4% lower. Investors fear Trumps tariffs could bring a recession if left unaltered because they could freeze global trade and send prices higher for all kinds of products. And Trumps on-again-off-again rollout could by itself throw into disarray the long-term plans for spending and investment by businesses and households.  U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic  because of tariffs, and a report from the Conference Board on Tuesday said their expectations for income, business and job market conditions dropped to the lowest level since 2011 and are well below the level that usually signals a recession ahead.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said such economic uncertainty is a tool Trump can use  as he negotiates tariffs and trade deals. President Trump creates what I would call strategic uncertainty in the negotiations, he told reporters at the White House. The latest zigzag may be arriving for the U.S. auto industry  after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump will sign an executive order Tuesday relaxing some of his 25% auto tariffs. General Motors nevertheless slipped 0.6% despite reporting a stronger profit  for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company rescheduled a conference call with investors to discuss its results and forecasts for 2025 to Thursday because of recent reports regarding updates to trade policy. JetBlue Airways stock bounced between losses and gains after CEO Joanna Geraghty said the airline was puling its financial forecasts for the full year given the macroeconomic uncertainty. The airline also delivered a stronger profit than expected for the latest quarter. Its stock accelerated later in the day and finished 2.7% higher. Coca-Cola  also overcame an early drop to rise 0.8%. The beverage giant reported better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter and said the impact of tariffs on its business are likely to be manageable. Coke updated some of its financial forecasts for the year but left alone its guidance for an important underlying measure of revenue growth.  All told, the S&P 500 rose 32.08 points to 5,560.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 300.03 to 40,527.62, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 95.18 to 17,461.32. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.17% from 4.23% late Monday. Not only did the report on consumer confidence come in weaker than expected, so did an update on how many job openings U.S. employers were advertising at the end of March. Such weaker-than-expected data could eventually push the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates in order to give the economy a boost.  Yields have largely been sinking since an unsettling, unusual spurt higher earlier this month rattled both Wall Street and the U.S. government. That rise had suggested investors worldwide may have been losing faith in the U.S. bond markets reputation as a safe place to park cash.

Wall Street takes a breath ahead of another week full of potential swings,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish on Monday, ahead of potential flashpoints this week that could bring more sharp swings  for financial markets. The S&P 500 inched up by 0.1% to extend its winning streak to a fifth day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 114 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%. The relative lull in trading offered a respite from the sharp, historic swings that have rocked markets for weeks, as hopes rose and fell that President Donald Trump may back down on his trade war. Many investors believe Trumps tariffs could cause a recession if left unaltered. Coming into Monday, the S&P 500 had roughly halved its drop that had taken it nearly 20% below its record  set earlier this year. Mixed trading for some influential tech stocks ahead of their earnings reports this week pulled the S&P 500 back and forth between modest gains and losses for much of Monday. Amazon fell 0.7%, Microsoft dipped 0.2%, Meta Platforms added 0.4% and Apple rose 0.4%. All are on the schedule to report their latest result this week, and theyre some of Wall Streets most influential companies because theyve grown to become some of the biggest in terms of size, by far. That gives their movements extra weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes. Outside of Big Tech, executives from Caterpillar, Exxon Mobil and McDonalds may also offer clues this week about how theyre seeing economic conditions play out. Several companies across industries have already slashed  their estimates for upcoming profit or pulled their forecasts entirely because of uncertainty about what will happen with Trumps tariffs.  
        
     We heard more plans to mitigate tariff impacts than in prior months and than during 2018 from U.S. companies, including pre-ordering, shifting production and increasing prices for their own products, according to Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian. But she also said in a report that shes seeing some indications of a pause: no hiring/no firing, no new projects/no cancellations etc. A fear is that Trumps on-again-off-again tariffs may be pushing households and businesses to alter their spending and freeze plans for long-term investment because of how quickly conditions can change, seemingly by the hour. All told, the S&P 500 rose 3.54 points to 5,528.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 114.09 to 40,227.59, and the Nasdaq composite edged down by 16.81 to 17,366.13. So far, economic reports have mostly seemed to show the U.S. economy is still growing, though at a weaker pace. On Wednesday, economists expect a report to say U.S. economic growth slowed to a 0.8% annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from a 2.4% pace at the end of last year. But most reports Wall Street has received so far have focused on data from before Trumps Liberation Day on April 2, when he announced tariffs that could affect imports from countries worldwide. That could raise the stakes for upcoming reports on the U.S. job market, including Fridays, which will show how many workers employers hired during all of April.  Economists expect it to show a slowdown in hiring down to 125,000 from 228,000 in March.  The most jarring economic data recently have come from surveys showing U.S. consumers are getting much more pessimistic about the economys future because of tariffs. The Conference Boards latest reading on consumer confidence will arrive on Tuesday. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell some more. Theyve largely been sinking since an unsettling, unusual spurt higher in yields earlier this month rattled both Wall Street and the U.S. government. That rise had suggested investors worldwide may have been losing faith in the U.S. bond markets reputation as a safe place to park cash. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.21% from 4.29% late Friday. Its been pulling back recently as weaker-than-expected reports on the economy bolster expectations among investors that the Federal Reserve will deliver cuts to interest rates later this year. Such cuts could juice the economy by making it easier for households and companies to borrow and spend. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid modest moves across much of Europe and Asia. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.5%, but stocks slipped 0.2% in Shanghai.  ___ AP Writers Jiang Junzhe and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-tarifffs-trump-china-5a614e961c46ad406e47caf18fa78d74,business
Havent filed your 2021 tax return? You might be missing out on a COVID stimulus check,"If you havent filed your 2021 tax returns you might be missing out on a COVID stimulus payment. Taxpayers who havent filed 2021 tax returns who may be eligible for the Recovery Rebate Credit must file it by April 15, 2025 to claim the credit.  Earlier this year, the IRS announced that its distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who didnt receive their COVID stimulus payments. The agency said its distributing these payments to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who did not receive one or more Economic Impact Payments (EIP), also known as stimulus payments. Looking at our internal data, we realized that one million taxpayers overlooked claiming this complex credit when they were actually eligible, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. Heres what you need to know: The special payments announced by the IRS are being sent to those taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return but left the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit blank or they filled it out as $0 when they were actually eligible for the credit. Payments will vary but the maximum amount will be $1,400 per individual. In total, the IRS will be distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns.  The IRS has posted information online about eligibility and how the payment was calculated. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who didnt receive the Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus payments, during 2020 and 2021. A refundable tax credit is a credit you can get as a refund even if you dont owe any tax. The IRS announced this initiative after reviewing its internal data and finding that many eligible taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return didnt claim the credit. To minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, were making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it, said Werfel.  
        
     If you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you dont have to take any action. The IRS plans sent letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments went out automatically and shouldve arrived by direct deposit or check by late January. Theyll are being sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayers 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.  You still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to the IRS. There were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents.  In March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In March 2021, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 per income tax filer and $1,400 per child under the American Rescue Plan Act. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

X restricts access to jailed Istanbul mayors account under court order but challenges decision,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP)  The social media platform X said Thursday it has blocked access to jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu s account in Turkey, complying with a Turkish court order  the latest measure targeting a key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. However, Elon Musks X said that while the company abided by the order, it disagrees with it and is legally challenging it. It said X complied to avoid severe punishments, such as the throttling of the whole platform in Turkey.  X has been and will continue to object to removal orders including government requests in courts to protect users when those requests do not align with principles of free expression, due process, or other local laws, the company said on its Global Government Affairs account. The statement said X maintains that keeping the platform accessible in (Turkey) is vital to supporting freedom of expression and access to information. Imamoglu, seen as the main opposition challenger to Erdogans 22-year rule, was arrested on March 19 and jailed on corruption charges. He was nominated as his Republican Peoples Party, or CHPs presidential candidate while in custody. His arrest has been widely viewed as politically motivated although the government insists Turkeys judiciary is independent and free of political influence. It triggered widespread demonstrations calling for his release and an end to Turkeys democratic backsliding under Erdogan. 
        
     According to Engelli Web, a website that that tracks and reports internet censorship in Turkey, X restricted Imamoglus account in Turkey complying with a legal request by Turkish authorities who cited national security and public order concerns. A notice that appears on Imamoglus account, which has 9.7 million followers, says it has been withheld in TR in response to a legal demand. The account remains accessible outside of Turkey. Gonenc Gurkaynak, a lawyer representing X in Turkey, said he had filed an appeal on behalf of the platform against the decision blocking the account. He said he had submitted a 27-page petition and hundreds of pages of supporting documents to the court. The Turkish presidencys Center for Countering Disinformation said the court decision followed an investigation into a post by Imamoglu on X, which prosecutors assessed to be an incitement to commit a crime.  Authorities also ruled that because Imamoglu is currently detained, his account is not directly managed by him and therefore poses a threat to public order.  On Thursday, CHPs leader Ozgur Ozel welcomed Xs decision to challenge the court order but said the platform should have resisted complying with it.  X should not impose this restriction, which contradicts universal freedoms and the companys own principles, he said and urged Imamoglus supporters to follow the mayors international account and re-share his posts. Ozel also criticized Erdogans administration saying that there probably is no other government that uses its judicial power so unfairly against its opponent. Despite his detention, Imamoglu had remained active on social media.  Supporters criticized the restriction as an assault on free speech in Turkey. They showed solidarity with the mayor by replacing their profile pictures with Imamoglus image.",https://apnews.com/article/turkey-istanbul-mayor-x-account-blocked-f7518fec17b5befbc413b7558262356b,business
Market turmoil has many afraid to check retirement savings,"NEW YORK (AP)  Michael Montgomery used to check the balance on his retirement account once a week and smile. But lately, not wanting to get upset and question if he could retire in a few years, there was only one solution. Im not looking, says the 66-year-old professor from Huntington Woods, Michigan. As the White House simultaneously injects turmoil into financial markets with its trade war and dismisses fears of a downturn, retired and near-retired Americans are anxiously looking on, worried about outliving their savings or having to put off entries on their bucket lists. Keeping logged off his account has made Montgomerys days less worrisome. He and his wife adjusted their portfolio after Election Day, including moving more money into bonds. But hes not sure what more he can do if the entire world economy can be affected by Washingtons decisions. I hope like hell I dont lose all my retirement savings, he says. But where else could you put the money that these people could not disorder? They cant get into your mattress but thats about it. Many experts warned U.S. stocks were overpriced and due for a correction even before President Donald Trump reclaimed the Oval Office. But a historic blanket of tariffs have injected new uncertainty into the market. Though stocks rallied this week, the S&P 500 is down 10% from an all-time high reached in February. Losses in the Nasdaq and among small-cap stocks are steeper. Even bonds and the U.S. dollar have been volatile. Many economists are warning of a possible recession. 
        
     It has 71-year-old Jeanne Oats Estridge feeling so paranoid she called her financial planner with an idea. How about we put it all in cash? Oats Estridge asked. I just dont advise it, she heard back. Oats Estridge, who lives in Dayton, Ohio, retired from a job in software engineering and now writes books, including her latest, on four octogenarian women kidnapped by sex-trafficking aliens. Her account is down more than $40,000 and she gets angry thinking about how some in Washington have reacted to the market volatility, including Trumps recent market assessment that it was a great time to buy. Where am I supposed to come up with the money to buy? My underwear drawer? Oats Estridge asks.  Earlier this month, the Cboe Volatility Index, considered a fear gauge of investor pessimism, reached its highest level in five years. The index, known as VIX, has since retreated but is still in territory reflecting fearful investors. Another measure of market sentiment, the Cboe S&P 500 Left Tail Volatility Index, which tracks investor worry about so-called black swan events such as the 2008 housing crash that spurred the Great Recession, likewise has backed off from highs but remains elevated. Trump has urged people to be cool in assessing the impact of tariffs on their investments. Asked about his own savings earlier this month, he chuckled and replied: I havent checked my 401(k).  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meantime, brushed off the possibility that some might need to delay retiring, saying people dont look at the day-to-day fluctuations of whats happening. That seeming nonchalance isnt sitting well with some older investors. Peter Rost, 72, retired from his software development job last year and planned to start tapping his retirement savings to supplement Social Security. But he doesnt want to bake in his losses. Im looking to take $2,000 and meanwhile the account drops by $30,000, he says. Hes been through serious downturns before, but those were different. I had the time to be patient and let it work its way back, says Rost, who lives in New Hartford, Connecticut, but now Im retired and I need money from that account. At his age, he says, theres one goal: Make sure I dont run out of money before I die. Americans retirement savings totaled about $44 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Investment Company Institute. The composition of those savings has shifted increasingly toward stocks in the last couple decades as the 401(k) has become employers typical offering.  Among fund giant Vanguards nearly 5 million accounts, for example, the average investor puts three-quarters of their savings in stocks. Even older investors are still heavily steeped in equities: People 55 to 64 have 64% in stocks at Vanguard; those 65 and older have 49% in stocks. With that exposure, financial advisers are getting an influx of calls amid the recent market uncertainty. Tj Binkowski, who runs Narrow Road Financial Planning in Clarksville, Tennessee, says some clients find themselves obsessively checking their accounts and feel the emotional strain of worrying about their money. A downturn, he says, hits an older investor much differently. When youre retired, paper losses arent just on paper anymore, says Binkowski. Youre locking them in every month that you take money out. Paul Duesterhaus, a 68-year-old retiree from Quincy, Illinois, is passing up an IRA withdrawal this year to avoid selling at a low. Instead, the retired manager at an air compressor manufacturing company will put off buying a new car as planned and cut back on things like eating out.  Still, he cant help but feel bigger impacts of a trade war are ahead. I think theres going to be longer lasting effects that are going to affect every American, he says. That angst is more common among older adults than younger people. An April poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found just under half of U.S. adults ages 45 and older said their retirement savings are a major source of stress for them right now, compared to about one-third of younger people. Older Americans were also more likely to say theyre stressed about the stock market. For now, many older investors are taking the advice of many experts, to fine-tune investments if necessary but avoid dramatic moves. But it can be hard advice to swallow. The more things go up and down, the more nervous you get, says Steve Turner, a 74-year-old from Chesterfield, Missouri, who runs a small public relations business. He now finds himself anxious when he goes to log on to his retirement account, wondering, Gee, do I want to press the button? You worry that things may work themselves out in the long run, but you dont have as long, says Turner. Youre not 30, youre not 40, youre not 50, youre not even 60. ___ Matt Sedensky can be reached at [emailprotected] and https://x.com/sedensky. ___ Associated Press writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/retirement-stock-market-tariffs-trump-recession-f658b939b66c9dae8ebe093d0dd10ab4,business
"Big Tech carries Wall Street to the close of its winning, roller-coaster week","NEW YORK (AP)  Big Tech stocks carried Wall Street Friday to the close of a winning, roller-coaster  week, one that saw markets swing from fear to relief and back to caution because of President Donald Trumps trade war. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to add some more to a big three-day rally, and its back within 10.1% of its record set earlier this year. Spurts for Nvidia and other influential tech stocks sent the Nasdaq composite up a market-leading 1.3%.  But they masked a mixed day of trading on Wall Street, where more stocks fell within the S&P 500 than rose, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added only a modest 20 points, or 0.1%. Alphabet climbed 1.7% in its first trading after Googles parent company reported late Thursday that its profit soared 50% in the beginning of 2025 from a year earlier, more than analysts expected.  Alphabet is one of the biggest companies on Wall Street in terms of size, and that gives its stocks movements extra influence on the S&P 500 and other indexes. Another market heavyweight, Nvidia, was also a major force pushing the S&P 500 index upward after the chip company rose 4.3%. They helped offset a 6.7% drop for Intel, which fell even though its results for the beginning of the year also topped expectations. The chip company said its seeing elevated uncertainty across the industry and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts expectations.  It wasnt just Intel. Roughly three out of every five stocks in the S&P 500 sank, including Eastman Chemical, which dropped 6.2% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts expectations.  
        
     CEO Mark Costa said that the macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased and that future demand for its products is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs. Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 5.3%.  Companies across industries have increasingly been saying the uncertainty  created by Trumps tariffs is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year.  Stocks bounced back from a steep slide on Monday  on hopes that Trump may be softening his approach on trade and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which had earlier shaken markets. The hope is that if Trump rolls back some of his stiff tariffs, he could avert a recession that many investors see as otherwise likely because of his trade war.  But Trumps on-again-off-again tariffs may nevertheless be pushing households and businesses to alter their spending and freeze plans for long-term investment because of how quickly conditions can change, sometimes seemingly by the hour. Business owners scrambling to figure out their supply chains and exposure to tariffs is more than just a distraction, according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. It could be an existential threat, especially for smaller businesses that dont have the scale or resources to have the same supply chain flexibility as larger firms.  All told, the S&P 500 rose 40.44 points to 5,525.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 20.10 to 40,113.50, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 216.90 to 17,382.94. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly across much of Europe following more mixed movements in Asia. Tokyos Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9%, but stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.1%.  In the bond market, Treasury yields eased some more, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.25% from 4.32% late Thursday.  Its been generally falling since approaching 4.50% earlier this month in a surprising rise  that suggested investors worldwide may have been losing faith in the U.S. bond markets reputation as a safe place to park cash. Yields have dropped as several reports on the U.S. economy have come in weaker than expected, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates later this year to support growth.  A report on Friday morning said sentiment among U.S. consumers sank in April, though not by as much as economists expected. The survey from the University of Michigan said its measure of expectations for coming conditions has dropped 32% since January for the steepest three-month percentage decline seen since the 1990 recession.  The value of the U.S. dollar meanwhile held steady against the euro and other rival currencies. Its been recovering some of its sharp, unexpected losses from earlier this month that had rattled investors.  ___ AP Writers Jiang Junzhe and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/market-rates-trump-tariffs-cd30ed61467eee2dc778006fa49924ee,business
"Wall Streets rally roars into a 3rd day as companies profits keep piling up, for now at least","NEW YORK (AP)  Wall Streets rally kept rolling Thursday as better-than-expected profits for U.S. companies piled up, though CEOs said theyre unsure whether it will last  because of uncertainty created by President Donald Trumps  trade war. The S&P 500 charged 2% higher and pulled within 11% of its record set earlier this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 486 points, or 1.2%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 2.7%. Tech stocks helped lead the way, including ServiceNow after the AI platform company delivered a stronger profit for the start of 2025 than analysts expected. The company, whose AI agents help clients manage their customers, saw its stock jump 15.5% after it also gave a forecasted range for upcoming subscription revenue that beat some analysts expectations.  Southwest Airlines likewise reported stronger results than expected for the first three months of the year. But its stock flipped between gains and losses through the morning after it also became the latest U.S. carrier  to say the outlook for the economy looks so cloudy that its pulling some of its financial forecasts for the year.  CEO Bob Jordan said the company is controlling what we can control, and its cutting how much flying it will do in the second half of the year. Southwests stock eventually pulled higher in afternoon trading and finished up 3.7%.  Rival American Airlines, meanwhile, pulled its financial forecasts for the full year and said it plans to provide an update when the economic outlook becomes clearer. Its stock rose 3.1% after it also topped profit expectations for the latest quarter.  
        
     Companies across industries have been talking about how difficult it is to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year, as Wall Street typically expects them to do, because of the on-again-off-again rollout of Trumps tariffs.  U.S. stocks rallied the prior two days on hopes that Trump was softening his approach on tariffs  and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which had earlier shaken markets. But China, the worlds second-largest economy, on Thursday denied its involved in active negotiations  with the United States over tariffs, saying that any suggestion of progress was as groundless as trying to catch the wind. Calling Trumps policy announcements headline turbulence, Tan Jing Yi of the Asia & Oceania Treasury Department at Mizuho Bank warned that global economies could be hurt in the long run, adding: Sentiments swing from hopes of intense relief to inflicted economic gloom. This week began with a steep loss for U.S. stocks  on fears about the trade war, and its been a microcosm of the markets severe swings in recent weeks as investors struggle with how to react to conditions that sometimes change by the hour. The only certainty is that the market will likely keep swinging until more clarity arrives on tariffs, which many investors expect would cause a recession unless theyre rolled back. Its an unhealthy market backdrop right now, and were trying not to react too much, said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.  Households across the United States are preparing for the higher prices  that economists say tariffs would bring, while the head of the International Monetary fund  urged countries to move swiftly to resolve their trade disputes that threaten global economic growth.  In the meantime, many U.S. companies are continuing to report stronger profit than analysts expected for the start of 2025, while offering caution and uncertainty about the year ahead. Toy company Hasbro was a winner and jumped 14.6% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It cited strong growth for its Magic: The Gathering game, among other products. Texas Instruments rallied 6.6% after the semiconductor company likewise reported a stronger profit than expected.  They helped offset a 3.7% drop for Procter & Gamble, which fell even though the company behind Olay, Tide and Pampers reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected. Its revenue came in below expectations, and it also cut its forecast for profit growth this fiscal year.  Procter & Gamble said its expecting a $200 million hit to its earnings this fiscal year because of higher costs for commodities.  At PepsiCo, CEO Ramon Laguarta said his company expects more volatility and uncertainty and that consumer conditions in many markets remain subdued and similarly have an uncertain outlook. His companys stock fell 4.9% after the beverage and snack maker cuts its forecast for an underlying measure of profit over 2025, citing increased costs from tariffs and subdued conditions for customers. A 25% tariff on  imported aluminum for cans is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. All told, the S&P 500 rose 108.91 points to 5,484.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 486.83 to 40,093.40, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 457.99 to 17,166.04. In the bond market, Treasury yields continued to ease following their disconcerting run higher earlier this month. Yields usually fall when fear is dominating markets, but their surprising earlier rise stirred fears that Trumps trade war was degrading the U.S. bond markets status as one of the worlds safest places to keep cash.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.30% from 4.40% late Wednesday, in part on expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later this year to soften the economic blow that may come from tariffs. Yields sank after a report showed slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week than economists expected. A separate report said sales of previously occupied homes weakened by more than expected  in March.  In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid modest moves across much of Europe and Asia.  ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-tariffs-trump-fed-dollar-f6b5873edeb86d883bc90b7a8cc9794d,business
Wall Street rises and markets rally worldwide as Trump softens his tough talk on tariffs and the Fed,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as a worldwide rally came back around to Wall Street after President Donald Trump appeared to back off his criticism of the Federal Reserve and his tough talk in his trade war. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its big gain  from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%.  Wall Streets gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies.  The markets latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has no intention to fire the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called a major loser, because of the Feds hesitance to cut interest rates.  Trumps tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term. While a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Economists say Trumps tariffs are likely both to slow the economy and to raise inflation, at least briefly.  
        
     Trump may have recognized the markets fear about a move against Powell. He may also be looking to keep someone around whom Trump could blame later if the economy does fall into a recession, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.  Indeed, if the Fed cuts its policy interest rates aggressively, Trump would have little excuse for a recession apart from the pugnacity of his tariff policies, Wizman said. Markets also rose after Trump said late Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down substantially from the current 145%. It wont be that high, not going to be that high, Trump said. The hope along Wall Street has been that Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries, and Trump said Tuesday he would be very nice to the worlds second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. There is an opportunity for a big deal here, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.  If Trump brings his tariffs down enough, investors believe a recession could be averted.  U.S. businesses say theyre already feeling the effects of the trade war. A preliminary reading of U.S. business activity fell to a 16-month low, as the threat of tariffs helped push up prices charged for goods and services, according to S&P Globals latest survey released Wednesday. All the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will more likely than not continue to be dictated by Trumps latest whims regarding tariffs and trade, said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. The S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administrations officials continue to surprise markets. On Wednesday alone, the S&P 500 charged to a 3.4% gain in the morning, only to more than halve that rise as the day progressed.  Trumps latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. Its a turnaround from earlier this month, when spiking Treasury yields raised fears that Trumps actions were scaring investors away from the United States and weakening the U.S. bond markets reputation as one of the safest places to keep cash.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning.  On Wall Street, Big Tech helped lead stock indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip companys stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500.  Other stocks in the artificial-intelligence technology ecosystem also drove higher. Vertiv Holdings, which traces its roots to the industrys first manufacturer of computer room air conditioning, jumped 8.5% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said its continuing to see accelerated demand from AI data centers.  Super Micro Computer, a company that makes servers used in AI, rose 7.6%. Palantir Technologies, which offers an AI platform for customers, climbed 7.3%.  Tesla revved 5.4% higher after CEO Elon Musk said hell spend less time in Washington  and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla on late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. Its been struggling because of backlash against Musks efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the U.S. government.  All told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 419.59 to 39,606.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 407.63 to 16,708.05. In stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.1% in France, 2.4% in Hong Kong and 1.9% in Japan. Stocks in Shanghai were an exception, where they dipped 0.1%.  ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stock-marketstrump-musk-tariffs-asia-4a79fc07c6025b7714526377e02eb839,business
The tax deadline is almost here. Heres when youll get your refund,"NEW YORK (AP)  Tax season is underway, and the IRS expects 140 million people will file returns by April 15. The agency has also debuted a new online tool to help taxpayers check the status of any refund they may be entitled to. President Donald Trump this week offered all federal employees a buyout package in an effort to reduce the size of the government workforce, which could impact IRS staffing at an important period for the agency, though its not yet clear how. The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Heres what to know: If you file your tax return electronically, the IRS says it should take 21 days or less to receive your refund. If you choose to receive your refund with direct deposit, it should take even less time. If you file a paper return, the refund could take four weeks or more, and if your return requires amendments or corrections, it could take longer. The IRS cautions taxpayers not to rely on receiving a refund by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills.  
        
     Taxpayers can use the online tool Wheres My Refund? to check the status of their income tax refund within 24 hours of e-filing and generally within four weeks of filing a paper return. Information related to this tool is updated once daily, overnight. To access the status of your refund, youll need:  Your Social Security or individual taxpayer ID number (ITIN)  Your filing status  The refund amount calculated on your return If you paid more through the year than you owe in tax, due to withholding or other reasons, you should get money back. Even if you didnt pay excess tax, you may still get a refund if you qualify for a refundable credit, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit. To get your refund, you must file a return, and you have three years to claim a tax refund. To qualify for the EITC, you must have under $11,600 in investment income and earn less than a specific income level from working. If youre single with no children, your income level must be $18,591 or below. And if youre married filing jointly with three or more children, you must make $66,819 or below. To determine if your household qualifies based on your marital status and your number of dependents you can use the online EITC Assistant tool. If you have a child, you are most likely eligible for the Child Tax Credit. The credit is up to $2,000 per qualifying child. To qualify, a child must:  Have a Social Security number  Be under age 17 at the end of 2024  Be claimed as a dependent on your tax return You qualify for the full amount of the Child Tax Credit for each qualifying child if you meet all eligibility factors and your annual income is not more than $200,000 ($400,000 if filing a joint return). The IRS has expanded a program that allows people to file their taxes directly with the agency for free. The federal Direct File program, which permits taxpayers to calculate and submit their returns without using commercial tax preparation software, is now available to taxpayers in 25 states, up from 12 states that were part of last years pilot program. The program allows people in some states with very simple W-2s to calculate and submit their returns directly to the IRS. Those using the pilot program in 2024 claimed more than $90 million in refunds, the IRS said in October. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Trumps tariffs loom over the economy as shipments from China fall,"WASHINGTON (AP)  American businesses are cancelling orders from China, postponing expansion plans and hunkering down to see what trade policy surprises President Donald Trump plans to spring on them next. The presidents massive and unpredictable taxes on imports seem likely to mean emptier shelves and higher prices for American shoppers, perhaps within weeks. And the higher costs and paralyzing uncertainty could exact an economic toll: U.S. consumers are in the biggest funk since COVID-19 hit five years ago, and economists say recession risks are climbing. An early sign of the damage emerged on Wednesday when the Commerce Department released its first look at first-quarter economic growth. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3% from January through March, the first drop in three years. Gross domestic product  the nations output of goods and services  was down from 2.4% in the last three months of 2024. Imports shaved 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. Consumer spending also slowed sharply. Separately, a report from payroll provider ADP showed that companies added just 62,000 jobs in April, about half of what was expected, and down from 147,000 in March. Its a potential signal that businesses may be taking a more cautious approach to hiring amid uncertainty over tariffs.  Asked how much of deterioration in the worlds biggest economy could be traced to Trumps erratic policies, Boston College economist Brian Bethune said: All of it. 
        
     As he promised on the campaign trail, Trump has upended decades of American trade policy. Hes been imposing  then sometimes suspending  big import taxes, or tariffs, on a wide range of targets. Hes currently plastered a 10% levy on products from almost every country in the world. Hes hit China  Americas third-biggest trading partner and second-biggest source of imported goods  with a staggering 145% tariff. China has responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own  125% on American products. The take-no-prisoners trade war between the worlds two biggest economies has shaken global financial markets and threatened to bring U.S.-China trade to a standstill. Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, warned last Thursday within two weeks arrivals to the port will drop by 35% as essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers has ceased. Seroka added that cargo from Southeast Asia also is much softer than normal with tariffs now in place. After Trump announced expansive tariffs in early April, ocean container bookings from China to the United States dropped 60% -- and stayed there, said Ryan Petersen, founder and CEO of Flexport, a San Francisco company that helps companies ship cargo around the world. With orders down, ocean carriers have reduced their capacity by cancelling 25% of their sailings, Flexport said. Many companies tried to beat the clock by bringing in foreign goods before Trumps tariffs took effect. In fact, that is a big reason that first-quarter economic growth is expected to come in so low: A surge in imports swelled the trade deficit, which weighs on growth. By stockpiling goods ahead of the trade war, many companies will be positioned to ride out this storm for a while, said Judah Levine, research director at the global freight-booking platform Freightos. But at a certain point, inventories will run down. In the next few weeks, Levine said, you could start seeing shortages ... its likely to be concentrated in categories where the U.S. is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and there arent a lot of alternatives and certainly quick alternatives. Among them: furniture, baby products and plastic goods, including toys. Jay Foreman, CEO of toymaker Basic Fun, said he paused shipments of Tonka trucks, Care Bears and other toys from China after Trumps tariff plan was announced in early April. Now, hes hoping to get by for a few months on inventory hes stockpiled. Consumers will find Basic Fun toys in stores for a month or two but very quickly we will be out of stock and stock product will disappear from store shelves,  he said.  Kevin Brusky, who owns APE Games, a small tabletop game publisher in St. Louis, has about 7,000 copies of three different games sitting in a warehouse in China. The tariff bill of about $25,000 would wipe out his profit on the games, so he is launching a Kickstarter campaign next week to help defray the cost of the duties.  Still, his sales representative is urging him to import the games if possible, because he expects that retailers will soon be desperate for products to sell. If he does import the games, Brusky is considering raising its price from $40 to at least $45.  Worried that tariffs will push up prices and drive away customer, retailers have put expansion plans on hold for next year, said Naveen Jaggi, president of retail advisory services in the Americas for real-estate firm JLL. What they are telling us is: We want to slow down the decision to open up stores and commit to leases because they want to watch how the consumer reacts. Consumers already seem to be freaking out. The Conference Board, a business group, reported Tuesday that Americans confidence in the economy fell for the fifth straight month to the lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly one-third of consumers expect hiring to slow in the coming months, nearly matching the level reached in April 2009, when the economy was mired in the Great Recession. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. GDP so if nervous consumers stop shopping, the economic fallout could get ugly. Economist Joseph Brusuelas of the consultancy RSM pegs the probability of a recession within the next 12 months at 55%. Even gloomier is Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. He sees a 90% chance of a recession by this summer if Trumps tariffs remain in place. Businesses are already planning on significant disruptions, particularly from the 145% duties on goods from China, he said. You see that in company reactions: Orders are down, (spending) plans are down, costs are up, prices paid are up, he said. He expects large layoffs by trucking firms and retailers as soon as late May, as the slowdown in goods coming into U.S. ports from China works its way through the supply chain. Flexport CEO Petersen said shortages of products are not a tragedy.  Its going to be much more about the layoffs that follow, Petersen said. Thats where the real pain is going to be felt. Shortages mean companies arent selling stuff and therefore dont have the profits that they need to pay their workers. He said the stakes are so high that he expects the U.S. and China to deescalate their trade war and bring down the tariffs. In fact, Trump and his advisers have sounded more conciliatory lately. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, for example, said that the triple-digit tariffs the U.S. and China have slapped on each other are not sustainable. But more abrupt shifts in trade policy risk increasing the uncertainty that has paralyzed businesses and worried consumers. Moreover, said economist Cory Stahle of the Indeed Hiring Lab, conditions may worsen in the coming months if people start behaving like they are in a recession. Softening some of the recent trade policy changes may ease some business concerns, but it may already be too late. ___ DInnocenzio reported from New York",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariff-economy-recession-china-imports-trade-8d90bb37735e833c43a7b7a9d5a0b9a2,business
US Treasury secretary says trade war with China is not sustainable,"WASHINGTON (AP)  U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday speech that the ongoing tariffs showdown against China is unsustainable and he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the worlds two largest economies. But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. U.S. President Donald Trump placed import taxes of 145% on China, which has countered with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures. Details of the speech were confirmed by two people familiar with the remarks who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations, Bessent said according to a transcript obtained by The Associated Press. Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying a trade war with China is not sustainable. The S&P 500 stock index rose 2.5% after Bloomberg News initially reported Bessents remarks. Trump acknowledged the increase in the stock market in remarks to reporters afterward on Tuesday, but he avoided confirming if he, too, thought the situation with China was unsustainable as Bessent had said behind closed doors. Were doing fine with China, Trump said. 
        
     Despite his high tariffs, Trump said he would be very nice to China and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Were going to live together very happily and ideally work together, Trump said. The U.S. president said that the final tariff rate with China would come down substantially from the current 145%. It wont be that high, not going to be that high, Trump said. The Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations. But Trump has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10% tariff, even as he has insisted hes looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the U.S. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States that could negatively impact China. China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of Chinas interests, Chinas Commerce Ministry said in a statement. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration has received 18 proposals from other countries for trade deals with the U.S., adding that everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen. The uncertainty over tariffs in the financial markets has also been amplified by Trump calling on the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate, with the president saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell if he wanted to do so. Leavitt said Trump believes the Fed has by holding rates steady as it awaits the impacts of tariffs in the name of politics, rather in the name of whats right for the American economy. Trump later said that he wanted Powell to be early in lowering rates and that he has no intention of firing the Fed chair, despite previously suggesting that he would.",https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trade-taxes-trump-china-bessent-treasury-66668fa26957ece530a250fa8ea19faa,business
Wall Street rallies and recovers Mondays losses as the dollar and US bond market steady,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks jumped in a widespread rally Tuesday, and other U.S. investments steadied a day after falling sharply on worries about President Donald Trumps trade war and his attacks on the head  of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 climbed 2.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,016 points, or 2.7%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.7%. All three indexes more than made up their big losses from the start of the week. The value of the U.S. dollar  also stabilized after sliding against the euro and other competitors, while longer-term Treasury yields  held steadier as more calm returned to financial markets. Sharp, unusual moves for the dollar and for Treasurys have recently raised worries that Trumps policies are making investors more skeptical about U.S. investments reputation as the worlds safest.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)  The only prediction many Wall Street strategists are willing to make is that financial markets will likely continue to veer up and down as hopes rise and fall that Trump may negotiate deals with other countries to lower his tariffs. If no such deals come quickly enough, many investors expect the economy to fall into a recession. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday slashed its forecast for global economic growth  this year to 2.8%, down from 3.3%. But Vice President JD Vance also said he made progress with Indias  prime minister, Narendra Modi, on trade talks Monday. 
        
     A suite of better-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, meanwhile, helped drive U.S. stocks higher.  Equifax jumped 13.8% after reporting a better profit for the first three months of 2025 than analysts expected. It also said it would send more cash to its shareholders by increasing its dividend and buying up to $3 billion of its stock over the next four years.  3M climbed 8.1% after the maker of Scotch tape and Command strips said it made more in profit from each $1 of revenue during the start of the year than it expected. The company also stood by its forecast for profit for the full year, though it said tariffs may drag down its earnings per share by up to 40 cents per share.

Drops for Treasury yields during the first three months of the year translated into lower mortgage rates for potential customers, though yields have been largely rising since early this month.  CEO Ryan Marshall said buyers remain caught between a strong desire for homeownership and the affordability challenges of high selling prices and monthly payments that are stretched. Tesla rose 4.6% ahead of its earnings report, which arrived after trading ended for the day. That trimmed its loss for the year so far to roughly 41%.  Elon Musks electric car company had already reported its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the year before. Its been hurt by vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musks oversight of cost-cutting efforts for the U.S. government.

First Solar jumped 10.5% after the U.S. Department of Commerce finalized harsher-than-expected solar tariffs on some southeast Asian communities. U.S. defense contractors, meanwhile, had some of the markets sharpest losses after RTX said tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports, along with other products, could mean an $850 million hit to its profit this year. RTX, which builds airplane engines and military equipment, fell 9.8% even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter.  Kimberly-Clark lost 1.6% even though the maker of Huggies and Kleenex likewise reported a better-than-expected profit.  CEO Mike Hsu said that the current environment will now mean greater costs across our global supply chain versus what it expected at the start of the year, and the company lowered its forecast for an underlying measure of profit this year.

In the bond market, longer-term yields eased following an unsettling run higher the day before. The yield on the 10-year Treasury pulled back to 4.39% from 4.42% late Monday.

Perhaps more worryingly, U.S. government bonds  and the value of the U.S. dollar  also sank as prices retreated across U.S. markets. Its an unusual move because Treasurys and the dollar have historically strengthened during episodes of nervousness. This time around, though, its policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening their reputations as some of the worlds safest investments.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Trader Robert Arciero works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, April 21, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) AP business correspondent Seth Sutel reports on how Wall Street is faring today. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession  if theyre not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan failed to reach a quick deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and theyre seen as a test case, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.  The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules, Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics, likewise in all caps. 
        
     Trump has recently focused more on China, the worlds second-largest economy, which has also been keeping up its rhetoric. China on Monday warned other countries  against making trade deals with the United States at the expense of Chinas interest as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements.  If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner, Chinas Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market are worries about Trumps anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last week criticized Powell again  for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy more juice. The Fed has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly  because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after slowing nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trump talked Monday  about a slowdown for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW. A move by Trump to fire Powell would likely send a bolt of fear through financial markets. While Wall Street loves lower rates, largely because they boost stock prices, the bigger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States reputation as the worlds safest place to keep cash.  All the uncertainty striking pillars at the center of financial markets means some investors say theyre having to rethink the fundamentals of how to invest. We can no longer extrapolate from past trends or rely on long-term assumptions to anchor portfolios, strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report. The distinction between tactical and strategic asset allocation is blurred. Instead, we need to constantly reassess the long-term trajectory and be dynamic with asset allocation as we learn more about the future state of the global system. That in turn could push investors outside the United States to keep more of their money in their home markets, according to the strategists led by Jean Boivin.  On Wall Street, Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports  due later this week. Tesla sank 5.7%. The electric vehicle makers stock has more than halved from its record set in December on criticism that the stock price had gone too high and that CEO Elon Musks role in leading the U.S. governments efforts to cut spending is damaging the brand.  Nvidia fell 4.5% for a third straight drop after disclosing that U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. They led another wipeout on Wall Street, and 92% of the stocks within the S&P 500 fell.  Among the few gainers were Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial, which climbed after the U.S. government approved their proposed merger. Discover rose 3.6%, while Capital One added 1.5%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 124.50 points to 5,158.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971.82 to 38,170.41, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 415.55 to 15,870.90.

In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors expect the Fed to cut its main overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy.  But longer-term yields rose with doubts about the United States standing in the global economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.40%, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. Thats a substantial move for the bond market.

Trumps attacks on Powell threaten the Feds independence. Heres why it matters,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Donald Trump has stepped up his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the same time that the Supreme Court is considering a case that could make it easier for the president to fire him.  The developments are occurring against a backdrop of wider turmoil in the economy and financial markets, brought on by Trumps sweeping taxes on imports. Most economists worry that an assault on the Feds longstanding independence from politics would further disrupt markets and add to the uncertainty enveloping the economy.  In comments at the White House Thursday, Trump suggested he has the power to remove Powell and criticized him for not aggressively cutting interest rates.  If I want him out, hell be out of there real fast, believe me, Trump said. Im not happy with him. All the scrutiny threatens the Feds venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here are some questions and answers about the Fed.  
        
     The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls  which it typically does when the economy falters  the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it raises the rate  which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation  it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.  Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliance more expensive. The importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the 1970s and early 1980s. Former Fed Chair Arthur Burns has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide.  Paul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Feds short-term rate to the stunningly high level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping rates triggered a sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11%, and spurred widespread protests.  Yet Volcker didnt flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen back into the low single digits. Volckers willingness to inflict pain on the economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of the value of an independent Fed.  An effort to fire Powell would almost certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt.  Most investors prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter interest rate policies if economic conditions changed.  If the Fed was more swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate  or understand  its decisions.  Well, no. Fed chairs like Powell are appointed by the president to serve four-year terms, and have to be confirmed by the Senate. The president also appoints the six other members of the Feds governing board, who can serve staggered terms of up to 14 years, though most governors leave before the end of their terms.  Those appointments can allow a president over time to significantly alter the Feds policies. Former president Joe Biden appointed five of the current seven members: Powell, Lisa Cook, Philip Jefferson, Adriana Kugler, and Michael Barr. As a result, Trump will have fewer opportunities to make appointments. He will be able to replace Kugler, who filled an unexpired term ending Jan. 31, 2026.  Congress, meanwhile, can set the Feds goals through legislation. In 1977, for example, Congress gave the Fed a dual mandate to keep prices stable and seek maximum employment. The Fed defines stable prices as inflation at 2%. The 1977 law also requires the Fed chair to testify before the House and Senate twice every year about the economy and interest rate policy.  Powell says the law establishing the Fed does not allow a president to fire a chair except for cause. There is some complication in that Powell was separately appointed as a member of the Feds board of governors, and then elevated to the position of chair  by Trump, in 2017.  Most legal scholars agree that Trump cant fire Powell from the Feds board of governors, but there is less agreement over whether a president can remove him as chair. In January, Michael Barr, who was vice chair for supervision, stepped down from that post but remained on the board to avoid a potential legal clash over whether Trump could fire him.  Should Trump try to fire Powell anyway, the ensuing fight would almost certainly end up at the Supreme Court.  We may get an early sign of how the Supreme Court would decide it this summer. There is already a case before the court on the issue of whether the president can fire top officials at independent agencies. The case stems from Trumps firings of two officials, one from the National Labor Relations Board and the other from an agency that protects workers from political interference. The Supreme Court last week let the firings stand while it considers the case. It could rule this summer that the president, as the head of the executive branch, could fire officials at any federal agency even if Congress had intended it to be independent.  The case would overturn a 90-year old precedent known as Humphreys Executor, in which the court ruled that the president couldnt fire such officials.  Powell said Wednesday he is watching the case closely, adding that it might not apply to the Fed. Lawyers for the Trump administration, seeking to narrow the focus of the case, have argued that it doesnt involve the Fed. Both the Trump administration and the Supreme Court justices have carved out exemptions for the Fed before. In February, the White House issued an executive order that placed several financial regulatory agencies, including the Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission, more directly under the presidents control. Yet the order specifically exempted the Feds ability to set interest rates from that order.  And in a case in 2023, Justice Samuel Alito said in a footnote that the Fed is a unique institution with a unique historical background that made it different than other independent bodies. If the court does give presidents more power over the heads of independent agencies, it could potentially exempt the Fed.",https://apnews.com/article/powell-trump-federal-reserve-interest-rates-7931193eb7ec39eb9dfa61169be2c17c,business
How to protect yourself from scammers offering fake jobs,"NEW YORK (AP)  Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of scammers impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.  In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.  Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.  Weve really seen tremendous growth in job scams, Velasquez said. I think thats just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people. It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.  After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment shed need for the job. A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. Thats when she learned the job was a scam.  
        
     Im a little traumatized, said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.  If youre a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers: Job scams are a type of impersonation scam. Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.  Theyre going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work, she said. And theyre often saying its a 100% remote position because thats so appealing to people. Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and drivers license details. The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.  Other details dont generally need to be shared with an employer until after youve gotten an offer. Whether youre replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didnt initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.  Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.  Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:   Dont respond to the message right away.   Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.   Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.  If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.  If you receive a message from a recruiter, its best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.  In Islams case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.  A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.  If you deposit a check and its fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check, Puig said.  So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.  When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.  Dont let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust, Velasquez said.  After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiters email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.  This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I cant just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are, Islam said.  If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, its good practice to report it on the FTCs website. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

UK economy enjoyed unexpected growth spurt in February before Trump tariff turmoil,"LONDON (AP)  Official figures Friday showed that the British economy, the worlds sixth-largest, enjoyed a growth spurt in February, the month before U.S. President Donald Trump started to roll out tariffs on imported goods.  The Office for National Statistics found that the British economy grew by 0.5% in February, ahead of market expectations for a more modest increase of 0.2%. It also revised up Januarys figure to no change from the previous estimate of a 0.1% decline. Were these more normal times, hopes for the year ahead would be high. But the recent market turmoil prompted by Trumps tariff policies  and subsequent abrupt changes  is expected to lead to a downturn around the world, as businesses and consumers retrench in the face of the heightened economic uncertainty.  Chinas decision to raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% from Saturday has only added to fears that the worlds two biggest economies are heading for a drawn-out and damaging trade war. While welcoming Fridays growth figures, British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves acknowledged the uncertain outlook.  The world has changed and we have witnessed that change in recent weeks, she said. I know this is an anxious time for families who are worried about the cost of living and British businesses who are worried about what this change means for them. The Labour government has said raising the U.K.s economic growth is the number one priority over the next five years. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-9, the British economys growth performance has been historically lackluster.",https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-labour-growth-51fb37581e69e7a5f9ab9560bb284415,business
Trumps meme coin business racks up fees as buyers jump at the chance for access to the president,"In the crypto world, meme coins are mostly just jokes with no intrinsic value. But the Trump family is parlaying the presidents meme coin into two valuable commodities: serious cash and access to the president. Since the coin was launched earlier this year, it has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And on Monday, Trump promoted a dinner hes set to attend on May 22 thats open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins. According to the contests rules, the top 220 holders of the meme coin will get to go to the dinner at Trumps Washington-area golf club. The top 25 holders will also get to attend a reception where they can rub shoulders with Trump beforehand. Let the President know how many $TRUMP coins YOU own! the meme coin said on its website promoting the dinner. Trading activity in the meme coin jumped after the dinner was first announced and the price rose as well. But the Trumps dont need to sell any coins to make money. 
        
     Decentralization is foundational to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the worlds most popular crypto, was born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a digital currency meant to be uncontrolled by banks or governments. Trump meme coins can be traded on a decentralized exchange, which is essentially a place where traders can swap goods without a middleman. Instead of matching buyers and sellers one by one, decentralized exchanges use something called a liquidity pool to ensure trades can happen easily and instantly. Liquidity pools are essentially an automated pot of funds that pair meme coins like $TRUMP with more popular types of crypto that can be easily traded. When the Trump meme coin was first launched, its creators initially released 20% of the planned 1 billion total coins. Half of that 20% was put up for public sale while the other half was put into a liquidity pool. CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, and another company receive trading revenue derived from trading activities of the Trump meme coins, according to its website. Through the liquidity pool, the creators of Trumps meme coins make money by charging tiny fees on each trade. You dont really care about what happens to the price. You only care that there is continuous volume, said Nicolai Sndergaard, a research analyst at the blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Because the more volume there is, that means more trades and therefore more fees for you. Since cryptocurrency blockchains are public, its possible to track how much in trading fees has been paid. Chainalysis said Trump meme coin creators made more than $1.3 million in trading fees in the week after the dinner was first announced. The value of the meme coin jumped from about $9 to around $14 just after the announcement. It was trading around $11 on Monday afternoon. Launched just before he took office, Trumps meme coin has become one of the most high-profile ways the norm-breaking president has mixed politics and his personal finances. The remaining 80% of Trumps meme coins, which are still under a lock-up, have been allocated to CIC Digital and another company. An ethics agreement  prohibits Trump from day-to-day decision making at the Trump Organization when hes president and limits the financial information about the business that can be shared with him.  During an interview with NBCs Meet the Press over the weekend, Trump said he didnt follow the price swings of his meme coin and dismissed the idea that he was profiting from the presidency. He also rejected a suggestion that he would forgo any profits made from his crypto endeavors. Should I contribute all of my real estate that Ive owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because Im president and doing a good job? I dont think so, Trump said. The team behind Trumps meme coins has been aggressively trying to promote the chance to eat with the president. Good News! President Trump is allowing one more person to attend Dinner with Trump, the meme coins official account on X said last week, encouraging people to reply with memes featuring Trump. Our favorite $TRUMP memes will be shown to President Trump and we will pick 1 person who gets to come to the dinner on May 22nd! The creators have also tried to up the ante by offering $100,000 Trump-themed watches to the top four holders of Trumps meme coins. On Monday night, Trump hosted a closed-door Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner fundraiser sponsored by his MAGA Inc. super PAC at his golf club outside Washington. An invitation to the event that circulated online instructs those invited to pay $1.5 million per person to attend. The White House did not provide a list of attendees, though the super PAC eventually will be required to list donors in its regular public disclosures. Whether the public will ever know who bought their way into the meme coin dinner with the president is unclear, though. Unlike political donations that must be publicly reported, theres no disclosure requirement for meme coin buyers.  Critics of Trumps foray into meme coins, which includes several Democrats, say the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency gives bad actors the opportunity to try and unduly influence the president through purchasing his digital assets. The Trump meme coin website assures those who register for the contest that their full legal name and contact information will never be publicly shown. Instead, registrants pick a username thats displayed on the websites leaderboard. The ranking is dependent not just on how many Trump meme coins someone holds, but also on how long. After No. 220, the board has a note of encouragement for those just below the cut to buy more of the meme coins. Youre so close. FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT for your $TRUMP dinner.  Associated Press reporter Will Weissert contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-meme-coin-crypto-75063140a2223eb2698db7435dfaf5ac,business
OpenAI reverses course and says its nonprofit will continue to control its business,"After months of pursuing a plan to convert itself into a for-profit business, OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the company that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products. We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees.  Altman and the chair of OpenAIs nonprofit board, Bret Taylor, said the board made the decision for the nonprofit to retain control of OpenAI but is proposing another way to grow its business. As part of what Taylor described as a recapitalization, the nonprofits existing for-profit arm will convert into a public benefit corporation that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission. Shareholders will also receive stock and a cap on profit for some investors will be lifted, as part of the new plan. Altman said the changes would make it easier for the for-profit to behave more like a normal company. Taylor declined to say Monday how large of an ownership stake the nonprofit will have in the new public benefit corporation. He said in a call with reporters that the nonprofit will choose the board members of the public benefit corporation and, at first, they will likely be the same people who now sit on OpenAIs nonprofit board. Public benefit corporations were first created in Delaware in 2013 and other states have adopted the same or similar laws that require the companies to pursue not just profit but a social good. Public benefit corporations, which include Amalgamated Bank and the online education platform Coursera, need to define that social good, which can vary broadly, when they incorporate.  
        
     Altman said that converting from a limited liability company to a public benefit corporation just sets us up to be a more understandable structure to do the things that a company of our scope has to do. Theres so much more demand to use AI tools than we thought there was going to be, Altman said. Getting access to more capital will make it easier for OpenAI to pursue mergers and acquisitions and other normal things companies would do, Altman said. OpenAIs co-founders, including Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build whats known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanitys benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product. OpenAI first outlined plans last year to convert its core governance structure but faced a number of challenges. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led Musk to invest in the charity and tried to block the conversion to a for-profit. A federal judge last week dismissed some of Musks claims and allowed others to proceed to a trial set for next year. OpenAI also faced scrutiny from the top law enforcement officers in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, and California, where it operates out of a San Francisco headquarters. The California attorney generals office said in a statement that it was reviewing the plan and, This remains an ongoing matter  and we are in continued conversations with Open AI. The attorney generals office in Delaware did not immediately return a request for comment. A number of advocates, including former OpenAI employees and other charities, had petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAIs charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. Some, including AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton, who won a Nobel Prize last year, were concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harm. Multiple other artificial intelligence companies have opted to incorporate as public benefit corporations, including Anthropic and xAI, Musks company. However, OpenAI would remain unique in that its public benefit corporation would still be controlled by the nonprofits board. Altman said it would maybe be easier to raise money if OpenAI were a fully normal company, but given its mission, we dont want to be a fully normal company, and we believe this is well over the bar of what we need to be able to fundraise. Altman said he still expects a large investment from Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group, which in February announced plans to set up a joint company with OpenAI to push AI services.  The companys biggest investor over the past several years has been Microsoft, which declined to comment Monday. Page Hedley, a former OpenAI employee who led a petition to halt the for-profit conversion, said he was pleased that OpenAI was listening to the concerns of civil society leaders but remained concerned about the details. The charitable mission is about ensuring this technology benefits the public and not shareholders, said Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview. The premise of OpenAIs founding was that those interests might diverge significantly in the development, ownership or control of the technology. Thats whats at stake. A coalition of California-based charities on Monday renewed its call for Californias attorney general to investigate and questioned whether OpenAIs planned new business structure would carry out its charitable mission. If OpenAI is truly committed to benefiting humanity, it should transfer its charitable assets over to an independent public trust completely separate from any for-profit interests, said a statement from Fred Blackwell, CEO of the San Francisco Foundation. Rose Chan Loui, a nonprofit tax attorney who has studied OpenAIs structure, said any change would need to allow the nonprofit to maintain control over the development of the technology. If theyre not the majority shareholder, the control would have to be given through outsized voting rights on specific issues, said Chan Loui, who is the executive director of the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law. That is possible but may frustrate investors who want to exercise their rights to influence the direction of the company.   The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of APs text archives.",https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-nonprofit-sam-altman-3dbfca4d13586debf9740e0dede8ba47,business
US states push for speed-limiting devices on the cars of dangerous drivers,"A teenager who admitted being addicted to speed behind the wheel had totaled two other cars in the year before he slammed into a minivan at 112 mph (180 kph) in a Seattle suburb, killing the driver and three of the five children she was transporting for a homeschool co-op. After sentencing Chase Daniel Jones last month to more than 17 years in prison, the judge tacked on a novel condition should he drive again: His vehicle must be equipped with a device that prevents accelerating far beyond the speed limit. Virginia this year became the first state to agree to give its judges such a tool to deal with the most dangerous drivers on the road. Washington, D.C., already is using it and similar measures await governors signatures in Washington state and Georgia. New York and California also could soon tap the GPS-based technology to help combat a recent national spike in traffic deaths. Its a horror no one should have to experience, said Amy Cohen, who founded the victims advocacy group Families for Safe Streets after her 12-year-old son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was killed by a speeding driver in front of their New York home more than a decade ago. 
        
     Andrea Hudson, 38, the minivan driver who was killed when Jones ran a red light, was building a backyard greenhouse with her husband to help educate several kids who shuttle between homes during the school day, her father, Ted Smith, said.  Also killed in the March 2024 crash near Hudsons home in Renton, Washington, were Boyd Buster Brown and Eloise Wilcoxson, both 12, and Matilda Wilcoxson, 13. Hudsons two children were sitting on the passenger side and survived, but they spent weeks in a hospital. You always hear of these horrific accidents, and its always far away, you dont know anybody. But all of a sudden, thats my daughter, Smith said. This guy did not swerve or brake. And it was just a missile. Smith knew Washington state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who reached out to offer condolences and tell him she was sponsoring legislation to mandate intelligent speed assistance devices as a condition for habitual speeders to get back their suspended licenses. Leavitt predicts it will have an even more powerful impact than revoking driving privileges, citing studies showing around three-quarters of people who lose their licenses get behind a wheel anyway. Between 2019 and 2024, the state saw a 200% increase in drivers cited for going at least 50 mph (80 kph) over the speed limit, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission. I guess I dont understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast, Leavitt said. But if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they cant. Its going to stop them in their tracks. The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda. Because Jones, 19, didnt receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldnt have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judges requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said. Competing tech companies that joined forces to lobby for ignition interlock requirements for drunken drivers have been working in unison again the last few years to pitch intelligent speed assistance. Brandy Nannini, chief government affairs officer at one manufacturer, Grapevine, Texas-based Smart Start, said fleet vehicles including school buses in the nations capital have been trying it out for years. But it took a lot of refinement before the GPS technology could instantly recognize speed limit changes and compel vehicles with the devices installed to adjust accordingly. Weve got a lot more satellites in the sky now, said Ken Denton, a retired police officer who is the chief compliance officer at Cincinnati-based LifeSafer, part of the coalition of companies. When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed. A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion. Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nanninis car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit. That was my first question: Is it safe? Hope said. Not only did he come away convinced it is, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers. For those mandated by a court, the price could be hefty: $4 per day and a $100 installation fee. The fee would be less for low-income offenders. Cohen with Families for Safe Streets, which provides support services to the loved ones of crash victims, knows firsthand the kind of impact slowing down speeders can make. A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.  By then, the roads speed limit had been lowered. That boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not, she said. When you are going a few miles slower, theres more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, its much less likely to be deadly.",https://apnews.com/article/speed-limiters-reckless-drivers-states-judges-washington-72165c45b7481b6b313248841006578b,business

"Threatened by Trump tariffs, Japan walks a delicate tightrope between US and China","WASHINGTON (AP)  Just as Japans top trade negotiator traveled to Washington for another round of tariff talks last week, a bipartisan delegation bearing the name of Japan-China Friendship wrapped up a visit to Beijing. A week earlier, the head of the junior party in Japans ruling coalition was in Beijing delivering a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba addressed to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Details of the letter are unknown, but the two sides discussed U.S. tariffs in addition to bilateral issues. Among all U.S. allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out.  It is a peculiar case not only for its staunch commitment to its alliance with the United States but also for its complicated and uneasy history with the neighboring Asian giant  particularly the war history from the 20th century that still casts a shadow over the politics of today. On one hand, they are neighbors and they are important economic partners. Theres a lot that connects Japan and China, said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations. But on the other hand, I think there are limits to how far theyre going to lean into China.  While Japan wont walk away from its alliance with the United States, the linchpin of the Asian countrys diplomacy and security policies, its also true that the tariffs and uncertainty that Trump has created for Japan is really shaking things up in Tokyo, Goodman said.  
        
     Last month, President Donald Trump announced a 24% tariff on Japanese goods in a sweeping plan to levy duties on about 90 countries. The White House has since paused the tariffs but a 10% baseline duty on all countries except China, allowing time for negotiations. Still, Trumps 25% tax on aluminum, steel and auto exports have gone into effect for Japan. The tariff moves, as well as Trumps America First agenda, have cast doubts among the Japanese if the United States is still a dependable ally, while China is rallying support from tariff-threatened countries  including Japan. When Tetsuo Saito led Japans Komeito Party delegation to Beijing in late April, China hinted at difficulty in its tariff dispute with the United States, signaling its willingness to improve ties with Tokyo. An unnamed senior Chinese official said his country was in trouble when discussing Trumps 145% tariff on Chinese products, according to Japanese reports. Saitos visit was soon followed by that of the bipartisan delegation of Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians Union. Zhao Leji, Beijings top legislator, told the delegation that Chinas National Peoples Congress would be willing to carry out various forms of dialogue and exchanges. Beijing did not lift a ban on Japans seafood imports as the Japanese delegates hoped, but it signaled positive signs on its assessment of the safety of the discharges of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Beijing banned Japans seafood products in 2023, citing those concerns. Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have long been rocky. In the past several years, they squabbled not only over the seafood ban but also long-standing territorial disputes over the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands in the East China Sea, Beijings growing military assertiveness and violence against Japanese nationals in China  an issue complicated by the nations uneasy history.  Tokyos closer ties with Washington during Joe Bidens presidency also upset Beijing, which saw it as part of the U.S. strategy to contain China and has lectured Tokyo to face squarely and reflect on the history of aggression. An imperial power in Asia for centuries, China fell behind Japan in the 19th century when Japan began to embrace Western industrialization and grew into a formidable economic and military power. It invaded China in the 1930s and controlled the northeastern territory known as Manchuria. War atrocities, including the Nanking Massacre and the use of chemical and biological weapons and human medical experiments in Manchuria, have left deep scars in China. They have yet to be healed, though Japans conservative politicians today still attempt to deny the aggression. Ishiba, elected Japans prime minister in October, has a more neutral view on his countrys wartime history than the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his two successors. Weeks after taking office, Ishiba held talks with Xi on the sidelines of a leaders summit. Chinese scholars, however, see Tokyos recent engagements with Beijing as a pragmatic move to hedge against U.S. protectionism and not a long-term strategy for stability with China. The odds are low for Japan to move into Chinas orbit, Goodman said. They have for a long time had to manage an important but challenging relationship with China, he said. And that is, again, a long-standing problem for Japan, going back centuries or millennia. While Japan might welcome the friendlier tone from Beijing, it is trying to stabilize Japan-U.S. relations under Trumps America First agenda, and it is hoping to settle the tariff dispute without confronting Washington, with an eye on preventing Beijing from exploiting any fallout in Japan-U.S. relations. Japan was among the first countries to hold tariff talks with Washington. During the first round in mid-April, Trump inserted himself into the discussions, a sign of the high stakes for the United States to reach a deal with Japan. The Trump administration reportedly pushed for Japan to buy more U.S.-made cars and open its market to U.S. beef, rice and potatoes.  After the second round of negotiation in Washington last week, Ryosei Akazawa, the countrys chief tariff negotiator, said he pushed Japans request that the U.S. drop tariffs and was continuing efforts toward an agreement acceptable to both sides. He said Japans auto industry was already hurting from the 25% tariff and that he needed to be thorough but fast. Asked about China, Akazawa said only that his country keeps watching the U.S.-China tariff development with great interest. He noted Japans deep trade ties with China. While China and Japan are working to mend ties, the two are also competing in the Southeast Asia region, where Trump has threatened high tariffs as well. The region is deeply integrated into Chinas supply chain but under pressure from the West to diversify and reduce its reliance on China. With younger and growing populations as compared to East Asia, the region is considered an important growth center. Japan, as a major postwar development aid contributor, has gradually regained trust in the region, which also was scarred by Japans World War II past. On Wednesday, Ishiba returned from Vietnam and the Philippines after agreeing with their leaders to further strengthen security and economic ties. During the visit, Ishiba stressed Japans commitment to maintaining and strengthening a multilateral free-trade system in each country. Ishiba also had telephone talks with his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts earlier this month about U.S. tariffs. Just weeks earlier, Xi was in Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, also stressing free trade and seeking stronger supply chains.  At a recent discussion at the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute, Itsunori Onodera, Japans governing party policy chief, warned of very unstable feelings among many Asian countries faced with high tariffs from the United States.  Theres a danger they might become more distant and become closer to China, Onodera said. This is not something that Japan wants, either. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",https://apnews.com/article/china-beijing-tariff-trump-xi-japan-1c9c669951146e9bee9c3563293dd694,business
Ford says its Q1 profit fell by two-thirds and it expects a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs this year,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP)  Ford Motor Co. says it expects to take a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year and is withdrawing its full-year financial guidance due to the uncertainty created by the Trump administrations evolving trade policy.  Ford said Monday that its net income fell by about two-thirds in the first quarter to $473 million, or 12 cents per share, from $1.33 billion, or 33 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue dropped 5% to $40.66 billion.  The results topped the expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet, who forecast earnings per share for the quarter would be flat. Revenue was forecast to be $38.02 billion. Still, the stock fell more than 2% in after-hours trading.  Last week, General Motors said it is bracing for a potential impact from auto tariffs as high as $5 billion in 2025. Ford and Tesla are expected to see a smaller impact from tariffs than GM and other automakers because they assemble more of their cars in the U.S. Still, what impact they do see wont be insignificant.  Ford originally forecast 2025 earnings before interest and taxes in a range of $7 billion to $8.5 billion, but on Monday the company said the risks associated with tariffs make updating full year guidance challenging right now given the potential range of outcomes.  Ford CEO Jim Farley has been touting the advantage that higher domestic production gives his company and he did so again Monday, while acknowledging that the shake-up to the industry from tariffs is still in its early stages.  
        
     Its too early to gauge the related market dynamics, including the potential industrywide supply chain disruptions, said Farley said on an earnings call with analysts. Automakers with the largest U.S. footprint will have a big advantage, and, boy, that is that true for Ford. It puts us in the pole position. President Donald Trump says one goal of his trade policy is to move more manufacturing of products such as autos back to the U.S. Last week Trump signed executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts in a move the president said would allow automakers more time to transition their manufacturing operations.  Automakers and independent analyses have indicated that the tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide.  The potential impact of tariffs dominated Fords earnings calls, with one executive noting how just a little trouble with a few parts could have a dramatic effect.  The rare earth materials from China, for example, how they are imported, not just for us, but for the entire industry, has become rather complicated over the last few weeks, said Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra. It would take only a few parts to potentially cause some disruption into our production.",https://apnews.com/article/ford-tariffs-net-income-gm-trump-549d908f4dc0e4c2383a7ccd7a326d67,business
"Ann Telnaes, who quit Washington Post in protest, wins Pulitzer for fearlessness in commentary","NEW YORK (AP)  A longtime editorial cartoonist for The Washington Post who quit in protest early this year after editors killed her sketch criticizing the Post owner and other media chief executives working to curry favor with Trump has won the Pulitzer Prize for illustrated reporting and commentary. Ann Telnaes won for delivering piercing commentary on powerful people and institutions with deftness, creativity  and a fearlessness that led to her departure from the news organization after 17 years, according to the Pulitzer announcement on Monday. Her cartoon showed a group of media executives bowing before then President-elect Donald Trump while offering him bags of money, including Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Several executives, Bezos among them, had been spotted around that time at Trumps Florida club Mar-a-Lago. Telnaes accused them of having lucrative government contracts and working to eliminate regulations. Amazon also donated $1 million to Trumps inauguration fund. When she quit the newspaper earlier this year, Telnaes that shed never before had a sketch killed because of the point of view inherent in the cartoons commentary. She called that a game-changer and dangerous for a free press. As an editorial cartoonist, my job is to hold powerful people and institutions accountable, Telnaes wrote on the online platform Substack in early January. For the first time, my editor prevented me from doing that critical job. So I have decided to leave the Post. I doubt my decision will cause much of a stir and that it will be dismissed because Im just a cartoonist. But I will not stop holding truth to power through my cartooning, because as they say Democracy dies in darkness. 
        
     David Shipley, the newspapers editorial page editor at the time, said in a statement after Telnaes quit that he decided to nix the cartoon because the paper had just published a column on the same topic. Shipley then resigned in late February after Bezos, in a major shift, directed that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The fallout continued in March when a longtime columnist, Ruth Marcus, quit after she said the newspapers management decided not to run her commentary critical of Bezos policy.  The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years, Its internal strife largely began last June when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists have since left for other jobs. Bezos decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate  after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris  led to an exodus of subscribers.",https://apnews.com/article/ann-telnaes-pulitzer-washington-post-quit-protest-4c1855566d0b02ea04d465e7aa39e070,business
Florida jury awards man $3M for defective airbag that caused serious injury during crash,"MIAMI (AP)  A South Florida jury has awarded $3 million to a man who was severely injured by a defective airbag in a 2020 crash. Miami-Dade jurors reached a verdict for Jose Hernandez on Thursday, according to court records. He had filed a lawsuit in 2022 against Takata Airbag Tort Compensation Trust Fund, which was formed during Takatas bankruptcy Hernandez was driving his 2005 Honda Civic in Miami in December 2020 when another vehicle hit him as he tried to make a left turn, his attorneys said. The collision should have caused only minor injuries, but the cars Takata airbag inflator improperly exploded, shooting a piece of metal shrapnel several inches long into Hernandezs right arm, the lawsuit said. Attorneys for the Takata trust didnt immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment. At least 28 deaths have been linked to Takata air bag inflators in the U.S. and at least 36 worldwide, according to regulators. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Large-scale recalls began in 2013. Takata used ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate over time due to high heat and humidity and explode with too much force. That can blow apart a metal canister and send shrapnel into the passenger compartment.",https://apnews.com/article/crash-airbag-takata-florida-award-cc06c52796f07906541bf154b5fb98a7,business
Rite Aid returns to bankruptcy protection as it seeks to sell most assets,"Rite Aid is again seeking bankruptcy protection as the struggling drugstore chain says it will try to sell substantially all of its assets. The company said Monday that its stores will remain open as it returns to Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The company said it will work to ensure that customer prescriptions are transferred to other pharmacies as it goes through the sale process. The drugstore chain has lined up from some of its lenders $1.94 billion in new financing which help fund it through the sale and bankruptcy proceedings.  The company initially filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2023, with plans to sell parts of its business and restructure. The company ran more than 2,300 stores in 17 states before the filing. Rite Aid said then that its initial voluntary Chapter 11 filing would allow it to slash debt and resolve litigation. The company sold its relatively small pharmacy benefits management business, Elixir Solutions, for around $576 million. Rite Aid emerged from Chapter 11 nearly a year later as a private company. The drugstore chain said in a statement that it came out of the process stronger, with a rightsized store footprint, more efficient operating model, significantly less debt and additional financial resources. Rite Aids creditors took ownership of the chain, which shrank to 1,245 stores in 15 states, according to its website.  
        
     A spokeswoman said in March that the company was laser focused on its retail pharmacies, including restocking its stores. But in early May, empty white shelves dotted a store that sits a few miles from Rite Aids corporate headquarters in Philadelphia. The only rolls of wrapping paper in the store were some Christmas-themed offerings that leaned next to empty shelf space beneath a sign advertising Great Value!  The location also had a limited selection of profitable beauty products and drugstore staples such as Qtips and cotton balls.   Retail analyst Neil Saunders said such a look encourages shoppers not to return. Theyre actively pushing customers away, said Saunders, managing director of the consulting and data analysis firm GlobalData.  Rite Aid was attempting to turn around its business in a tough environment for drugstores. Major chains and independent pharmacies have been closing stores and struggling with several challenges.  Prescription profitability has grown tight. The chains also are dealing with increased theft, court settlements over opioid prescriptions and shoppers who are drifting more to online shopping and discount retailers.  Walgreens, which has more than six times as many stores as Rite Aid, agreed in March to be acquired by the private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Philadelphia-based Rite Aid was founded in 1962 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as Thrif D Discount Center. The company had struggled with debt, posted annual losses for several years and was cutting costs and closing stores well before its initial bankruptcy filing.  Rite Aid also explored sale offers. Walgreens attempted to buy it for about $9.4 billion a decade ago, when Rite Aid ran more than 4,600 stores. But the larger drugstore chain eventually scaled back its ambition and bought less than half that total to get the deal past antitrust regulators. In 2018, Rite Aid called off a separate merger with the grocer Albertsons. ___ Jonathan Poet contributed to this report from Philadelphia. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Cadillac F1 makes its entrance as official team at Miami Grand Prix as questions swirl about lineup,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  The new Cadillac F1 team officially announced its arrival at a glitzy South Beach extravaganza packed with industry executives and influencers and highlighted by a musical showcase from Janelle Mone and actor Terry Crews Jr., who shared an anecdote about how hed never been born had his father not relocated at age 20 to Flint, Michigan, in search of a job with General Motors.  A splashy video ultimately unveiled the Cadillac F1 team logo at a multimillion-dollar party jammed elbow-to-elbow in the Queen Miami Beach venue.  What wasnt revealed? Cadillacs car, a bit of a disappointment for those who expected to see all the bells and whistles at the brand launch introduction to F1s newest team.  No worries, promised the leaders of the new team: Cadillac F1 is on pace to be on the grid in 2026.  Were building cars, weve been in the wind tunnel for a long time, said Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports, the team owner. Chassis has arrived, were continuing to add (personnel) to the team, there are so many work streams that are happening all at once. But I want to make sure everybody understands just how deep the partnership is with General Motors and with Cadillac. I think thats something that really will set apart this team, this entry, on the grid.  Cadillac will debut in 2026 with a two-car lineup that will push the F1 field to 22 cars  the first time since 2016 the grid will have more than 20 cars. It was a long road for Cadillac F1 to get to this point. The project started with Michael Andretti, who failed to buy Sauber in his effort to create a true American team that would feature at least one American driver. When he didnt close the Sauber deal, Andretti petitioned F1 and governing body FIA to expand the field for Andretti Global, which led to the equivalent of an IRS audit during a grueling application process. F1 denied the application. Towriss and Cadillac pressed on  they spent the last year saying work on the project continues on pace  and when Towriss bought out Andretti late last year, F1 changed course and the new team was suddenly fast-tracked. General Motors President Mark Reuss was finally able to attend an F1 race  the Miami Grand Prix over the weekend  in an official capacity. So geeked to finally be in the club, Reuss pulled out his phone to play an audio clip for reporters of the first Cadillac engine being fired.  Cadillac will initially race with Ferrari engines before GMs power unit is ready for 2029. Reuss said the Cadillac approach is deliberate to have a reliable, fast engine rather than rush one out for next season.  You have to go slow to go fast, Reuss said. Cadillac will have the largest U.S. presence of any F1 team and will operate out of facilities in Fishers, Indiana, as well as in Charlotte, North Carolina. The team also has a satellite facility at Silverstone, England. When Andretti first launched this project, he was adamant it was for an American driver, specifically California native and current IndyCar driver Colton Herta.  Now the list of potential drivers is rather long. Towriss and Reuss were adamant theyve yet to sign a driver amid reports that Sergio Perez has already signed. The need for there to be an American is not a pressing issue to TWG. Theres a lot of interest in this team and were very appreciative of that, Towriss said. We want that person set up for success, and want that seat respected when that American driver does come in for the team. ... Well find the right way and the right time to bring the right driver into Formula 1. IndyCar driver Pato OWard, who races under the Mexican flag but spent most of his childhood in Texas, wants a seat. Towriss said they had a funny run-in two weeks ago at the Indianapolis 500 open test when the elevator Towriss was in opened and there was OWard; they joked they would talk.  McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown said he wouldnt prevent OWard from pursuing a seat with Cadillac. OWard drives for McLaren in IndyCar and is the teams F1 reserve driver. I wouldnt like it, but I wouldnt stop him, Brown said. Valtteri Bottas, now an F1 reserve driver for Mercedes, told The Associated Press he is very interested while IndyCar driver Colton Herta has recently hedged on whether he wants the seat. There are a number of Americans who could be candidates, especially if the team is willing to wait until deeper into its existence to hire one. NASCAR driver Connor Zilisch, an 18-year-old quickly climbing through the stock car series ladder system, initially pursued European racing in his career. Sebastian Wheldon, who is deep into the Andretti Global driver development program, on Saturday won his debut Italian F4 race at Misano with Prema Racing. Another idea could put a long-debated topic to the test: NASCAR champion Kyle Larson, who often comes up as potentially the only driver in the world who could match F1 standout Max Verstappen in talent.  When AP asked Reuss about the possibility of Larson, Reuss said lets focus on Indianapolis first. Larson will run for McLaren and Chevrolet for a second consecutive year in the Indianapolis 500 later this month.  Reuss said GMs F1 efforts will not be affected by President Donald Trumps proposed tariffs despite a potential $5 billion (3.8bn) impact. Despite reversing a number of the planned tariffs on imports in recent weeks, a 25% tariff is still in place.  This is a long-term footprint that we have that are very old in some cases, that have been there a long time, Reuss said. So were working to bring as much as we can into the United States and avoid the tariffs. But not at all cost, and it doesnt happen overnight. Theres no light switch that says, Oh, all of a sudden were tariff-free. You probably would have seen over the last few days, we did earnings on the early part of the week, and then we came back and did the earnings review and guidance. In that second one, theres about $5 billion of impact for us. But its not going to affect this (F1) project. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-cadillac-miami-2026-895ff9f4e321ce964ddb65ed3447e870,business
"New York Times wins 4 Pulitzers, New Yorker 3; Washington Post wins for coverage of Trump shooting","NEW YORK (AP)  The New York Times won four Pulitzer Prizes and the New Yorker three on Monday for journalism in 2024 that touched on topics like the fentanyl crisis, the U.S. military and last summers assassination attempt on President Donald Trump. The Pulitzers prestigious public service medal went to ProPublica for the second straight year. Kavitha Surana, Lizzie Presser, Cassandra Jaramillo and Stacy Kranitz were honored for reporting on pregnant women who died after doctors delayed urgent care in states with strict abortion laws. The Washington Post won for urgent and illuminating breaking news coverage of the Trump assassination attempt. The Pulitzers honored Ann Telnaes, who quit the Post in January after the news outlet refused to run her editorial cartoon lampooning tech chiefs  including Post owner Jeff Bezos  cozying up to Trump. The Pulitzers praised her fearlessness. The Pulitzers honored the best in journalism from 2024 in 15 categories, along with eight arts categories including books, music and theater. The public service winner receives a gold medal. All other winners receive $15,000. The New York Times showed its breadth with awards honoring reporting from Afghanistan, Sudan, Baltimore and Butler, Pennsylvania. Doug Mills won in breaking news photography for his pictures of the Trump assassination attempt, including one that captured a bullet in the air near the GOP candidate. The Times Azam Ahmed and Christina Goldbaum and contributing writer Matthieu Aikins won an explanatory reporting prize for examining U.S. policy failures in Afghanistan. Declan Walsh and the Times staff won for an investigation into the Sudan conflict. The Times was also part of a collaboration with The Baltimore Banner, whose reporters Alissa Zhu, Nick Thieme and Jessica Gallagher won in local reporting for stories on that citys fentanyl crisis and its disproportionate effect on Black men. The Banner was created three years ago, with several staffers who had left the Baltimore Sun. This is a huge milestone for us, editor in chief Kimi Yoshino said in an interview. I told the newsroom today that never in my wildest dreams did I think we would be here at this moment. It is a testament to the power of local news, the need for local news and what journalists can do when they focus on important stories in our community. The Banner created a statistical model that it shared with journalists in cities like Boston, Chicago and San Francisco for stories there, she said. Reuters won for its own investigative series on fentanyl, showing how lax regulation both inside and outside the United States makes the drug inexpensive and widely available. inewsource.org in San Diego was a finalist in the illustrated reporting and commentary category for its stories on fentanyl. The New Yorkers Mosab Abu Toha won for his commentaries on Gaza. The magazine also won for its In the Dark podcast about the killing of Iraqi civilians by the U.S. military and in feature photography for Moises Samans pictures of the Sednaya prison in Syria. The Wall Street Journal won a Pulitzer for its reporting on Elon Musk, including his turn to conservative politics, his use of legal and illegal drugs and his private conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Pulitzer board said. The Journal was also a finalist for its cool-headed reporting on the plight of Evan Gershkovich, who was imprisoned in Russia. The Pulitzers also gave a special citation to the late Chuck Stone for his work covering the civil rights movement. The pioneering journalist was the first Black columnist at the Philadelphia Daily News and founded the National Association of Black Journalists. Mark Warren of Esquire won the feature writing prize for his portrait of a Baptist pastor and small-town mayor who died by suicide after his secret online life was exposed by a right-wing news site. Alexandra Lange, a contributing writer for Bloomberg CityLab won an award in criticism for graceful and genre-expanding writing about public spaces for families. The Houston Chronicle Raj Mankad, Sharon Steinmann, Lisa Falkenberg and Leah Binkovitz won the Pulitzer in editorial writing for its series on dangerous train crossings. The Associated Press was a finalist in breaking news reporting for its own coverage of the Trump assassination attempt, and in investigative reporting for its partnership with PBS FRONTLINE and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland and at Arizona State University for stories documenting more than 1,000 deaths at the hands of police using methods of subduing people that were supposed to be non-lethal. ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Barstool Sports founder retracts Auschwitz tour offer to customer in antisemitic sign incident,"PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said he would send two customers to tour a former Nazi concentration camp after they allegedly engaged in antisemitic behavior at a Barstool pub in Philadelphia, then later retracted that offer for at least one of them because he said the person was denying responsibility for what happened. Portnoy said in posts on social media that in an initial conversation Sunday the customer took 100% responsibility for his actions with his friend and agreed to take a learning trip to Auschwitz in Poland. But on Monday, Portnoy posted that the customer did a 180 and told him he had nothing to do with the antisemitic behavior and that he was just being a citizen journalist by sharing video of what happened. His trip to Poland has been revoked, Portnoy said in the post. Whatever ramifications come his way he 100% earned. It wasnt clear if the trip had been revoked for the other customer. In a video posted on social media Saturday night, a woman at the bar who appears to be a server holds a sign with an anti-Jewish message on it while a man repeats the message multiple times. The bar said in a statement posted to social media that several employees, against their training and organizations written discrimination policies, complied with a customers request for the sign in connection with ordering bottle service.  
        
     We are saddened, embarrassed, and frustrated by the deplorable actions of a customer and misguided staff, Barstool Samson Street said in the post. Portnoy said two bar employees had been fired over the incident.  Philadelphia police said they were investigating. No charges were immediately filed. Temple University said one of the customers is believed to be one of their students. The student was put on interim suspension while an investigation continues, President John Fry said in a statement posted on the universitys website.  Fry called antisemitism abhorrent and said he would take further action if other students were involved. It has no place at Temple and acts of hatred and discrimination against any person or persons are not tolerated at this university, Fry said.  Kappa Delta Rho said in a post on its website that it is also investigating because the customer involved was allegedly a member of their fraternity at Temple.  To be clear, our organization firmly opposes all forms of hate, which have no place in our fraternity, said Xavier Romano, executive director of the national fraternity. Portnoy, who is Jewish, had said he hoped to turn the event into a teachable moment. He did not initially identify the culprits, but identified one of them on Monday when saying he would not be sending them to Auschwitz. The customer didnt immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Portnoy said he has experienced increased antisemitism, as the war between Israel and Hamas continues. He founded Barstool Sports in 2003, a digital platform covering sports, lifestyle and entertainment, in the Boston area.

How removing unpaid medical bills from credit reports could help consumers,"NEW YORK (AP)  Lenders will no longer be able to consider unpaid medical bills as a credit history factor when they evaluate potential borrowers in the U.S. for mortgages, car loans or business loans, according to a rule the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized Tuesday.  Removing medical debts from consumer credit reports is expected to increase the credit scores of millions of families by an average of 20 points, the bureau said. The CFPB says its research showed that outstanding health care claims are a poor predictor of someones ability to repay a loan yet often are used to deny mortgage applications.  The three national credit reporting agencies  Experian, Equifax and TransUnion  said last year that they were removing medical collections under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports. The government agencys new rule goes further by banning all outstanding medical bills from appearing on credit reports and prohibiting lenders from using the information.  The rule is set to take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, although President-elect Donald Trump has proposed sweeping changes and limits to the CFPBs regulatory reach. Heres what to know: 
        
     The CFPB estimates the rule will remove $49 million in medical debt from the credit reports of 15 million Americans. According to the agency, one in five Americans have at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, and over half of collection entries on credit reports are for medical debts. The problem disproportionately affects people of color, the CFPB has found: 28% of Black people and 22% of Latino people in the U.S. carry medical debt versus 17% of white people. While the national credit reporting agencies voluntarily agreed to disregard medical debt below $500, many consumers have amounts much higher than this threshold on their reports. The CFPB says its action will give millions of consumers increased access to loans and lead to the approval of approximately 22,000 additional mortgages a year. Americans with outstanding medical bills may see their credit scores rise by an average of 20 points, according to the bureau. The rule was also drafted to increase privacy protections and to help keep debt collectors from using the credit reporting system to coerce people into paying bills they dont owe. The CFPB has found that consumers frequently receive inaccurate bills or are asked to pay bills that should have been covered by insurance or financial assistance programs.  Whats more, lenders will be barred from using information about medical devices, such as prosthetic limbs, to make them serve as collateral for a loan and subject to repossession, according to the CFPBs announcement. Nonprofits in the healthcare space are pleased.  This decision is great news for everyday Americans, said Carrie Joy Grimes, founder of personal finance organization WorkMoney. Medical debt is not a reflection of being bad with money  any one of us can experience illness or injury. With this new rule, Americans will now be able to focus less on the strain of medical debt and more on getting back on their feet. Patricia Kelmar, health care campaigns director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the rule would help many financially responsible families who have accumulated medical debt from unpredictable health issues, high out-of-pocket costs, insurance claim denials and billing errors. While high medical bills are common in the US, including for individuals and households with insurance, there are ways to get relief.  First, determine whether you qualify for charity care. Federal law requires nonprofit hospitals to lower or write off bills for individuals depending on household income. To determine if you qualify, do an internet search for the hospital or health care provider along with the phrase charity care or financial assistance policy. The nonprofit organization Dollar For also provides a simplified online tool for patients. Next, appeal under the provisions of the No Surprises Act, a federal law that says insurance companies must reasonably cover any out-of-network services related to emergency and some non-emergency medical care. If youre being charged more than youre used to or expect when you receive in-network services, that bill may be illegal. Also: Always ask for an itemized bill. Medical billing is notoriously complicated and rife with errors. An itemized bill includes the billing codes of all care received. If something is off between these codes and the care provided, contesting your bill can yield changes.  Another approach  comparing the bill with insurance companies estimates of fair charges for services can also help. If the price you were charged is more than average, you may have your costs lowered. You could even take the provider to small claims court over the discrepancy - or let them know you have a case. Finally, always compare your insurance companys explanation of benefits to the bill. The hospitals bill must match the explanation of costs that are covered and not covered.

10 tips from experts to help you change your relationship with money in 2025,"NEW YORK (AP)  With the end of 2024 around the corner, you might be reflecting on financial goals for 2025.  Whether youre saving to move out of your parents house or pay off student loan debt, financial resolutions can help you stay motivated, said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for Credit Karma.  Entering a new year doesnt erase all our financial challenges from the prior year, Alev said. But it can really help to bring a fresh-start mentality to how youre managing your finances.  If youre planning to make financial resolutions for the new year, experts recommend that you start by evaluating the state of your finances in 2024. Then, set specific goals and make sure theyre attainable for your lifestyle.  Here are some tips from experts:  Think about how you currently deal with finances  whats good, whats bad, and what can improve.  Let this be the year you change your relationship with money, said Ashley Lapato, personal finance educator for YNAB, a budgeting app. If you feel like money is a chore, that theres shame surrounding the topic of money, or like you were born being bad at money, its time to change that mentality, Lapato said.  To adjust your approach, Lapato recommends viewing money goals as an opportunity to imagine your desired lifestyle in the future. She recommends asking questions like, What do my 30s look like? What do my 40s look like? and using money as a means to get there.  Liz Young Thomas, head of SoFi Investment Strategy, added that its key you forgive yourself for past mistakes in order to move into the new year with motivation. 
        
     When setting your financial resolutions for 2025, its important to establish the why of each, said Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial tracking app.  If you can attach the financial goal to a bigger life goal, its much more motivating and more likely youll continue on that path, Watson said.  Whether youre saving to buy a house, pay off credit card debt or take a summer vacation, being clear about the goal can keep you motivated. Watson also recommends using a tool to help you keep track of your finances, such as an app, spreadsheet, or website.  After three years of inflation, your pay increases are likely still playing catch up to your monthly expenses, leaving you wondering where all the money is going, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. Make that monthly budget for 2025 and resolve to track your spending against it throughout the year. McBride said that you may need to make adjustments during the year as certain expenses increase, which would require cutting back in other areas.  Calibrate your spending with your income, and any month you spend less than budgeted, transfer the difference into your savings account, ideally a high-yield savings account, he said. Interest rates arent likely to come down very fast, so youre still going to have to put in the hard work of paying down debt, especially high-cost credit card debt, and do so with urgency, McBride said. Start by taking stock of how much debt you have now relative to the beginning of the year. Hopefully youve made steady progress on paying it down, but, if youve gone in the other direction, McBride encourages making a game plan. That includes looking into 0% balance transfer offers.  You have more power over credit card interest rates than you think you do, said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. Wielding that power is one of the best moves you can make in 2025.  A 0% balance transfer credit card is a good weapon in the fight against high card APRs, or annual percentage rates, he said. A low-interest personal loan is an option as well.  You may simply be able to pick up the phone and ask for a lower interest rate. LendingTree found that a majority of people who did that in 2024 were successful, and the average reduction was more than 6 points. When planning for your financial resolutions, its important to consider how youre going to make your goals sustainable for your lifestyle, said Credit Karmas Alev. It really is a marathon, not a sprint, Alev said.  Alev recommends setting realistic, practical goals to make it easier to stick with them. For example, instead of planning to save thousands of dollars by the end of the year, start by saving $20 a paycheck.  Even when your plans are achievable, there are times youll get derailed. Maybe its an unexpected medical bill or an extraordinary life event. When these situations happen, Alev recommends trying not to feel defeated and working to get back on track without feeling guilty.  You cant manage what you cant see, so set a New Years resolution to check your credit score monthly in 2025, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore. Be sure to pay more than the minimum on your credit accounts, as thats one of the best ways to boost your credit score.  Bandebo also advises student loan borrowers to make all payments on time, as servicers will begin to report late payments starting in January, and missed payments will affect borrowers credit scores.  Automated changes, like increasing workplace 401(k) plan contributions, setting up direct deposits from paychecks into dedicated savings accounts, and arranging for monthly transfers into an IRA and/or 529 college savings accounts all add up quickly, McBride said.  Your financial goals can encompass more than just managing your money better  they can also be about keeping your money safe from scams. A golden rule to protect yourself from scams is to slow down, said Johan Gerber, executive vice president of security solutions at Mastercard.  You have to slow down and talk to other people if youre not sure (whether or not) its scam, said Gerber, who recommends building an accountability system with family to keep yourself and your loved ones secure.  Scammers use urgency to make people fall for their tricks, so taking your time to make any financial decision can keep you from losing money. Your financial goals dont always have to be rooted in a dollar amount  they can also be about well-being. Finances are deeply connected with our mental health, and, to take care of our money, we also need to take care of ourselves. I think that now more than any other year, your financial wellness should be a resolution, said Alejandra Rojas, personal finance expert and founder of The Money Mindset Hub, a mentoring platform for women entrepreneurs. Your mental health with money should be a resolution.  To focus on your financial wellness, you can set one or two goals focusing on your relationship with money. For example, you could find ways to address and resolve financial trauma, or you could set a goal to talk more openly with loved ones about money, Rojas said.

"Most Americans expect higher prices as a result of Trumps tariffs, a new AP-NORC poll finds","WASHINGTON (AP)  Americans trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the presidents broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise. Roughly half of U.S. adults say that Trumps trade policies will increase prices a lot and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up somewhat, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 
        
     About half of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months. While skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesnt mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation. AP polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux reports on a new poll showing concerns over tariff impacts. Three months into his second term, Trumps handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. Thats roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March. Matthew Wood, 41, said hes waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but hes feeling anxious. Im not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends, said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. Personally, it hasnt affected me as of yet. But, generally, I dont know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.  
        
     Still, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trumps attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said hes willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs. About half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. Thats up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didnt previously have an opinion on tariffs. Trump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries. Actually, I think he shouldnt have suspended it, said Manis, a retired sheriffs deputy from Del Rio, Texas. Because now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen. Not quite 100 days into Trumps second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply. Trump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. Hes imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes  albeit partially suspending some of them  launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trumps tariff pronouncements. Many Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has gone too far when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll. Stocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trumps tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands. Trump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not sustainable. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are extremely or very concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want  a sign of the economys resilience so far. 
        
     Retirement savings are a source of anxiety  about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a major source of stress in their lives. But fewer  only about 2 in 10  identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety. This whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide, said Nicole Jones, 32. Its revenge  and everybodys losing on it. The Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadnt given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt. Things are more expensive for us, she said. And most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state. The difference is that Republicans  who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president  now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the countrys financial future. It wasnt all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine, Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trumps policies went into effect. ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,260 adults was conducted April 17-21, using a sample drawn from NORCs probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

"US and global economic outlook deteriorates in Trump trade war, IMF says","WASHINGTON (AP)  The U.S. and global economies will likely slow significantly in the wake of President Donald Trumps tariffs and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.  The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.  And the Fund sees the worlds two largest economies, China and the United States, weakening: U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesnt expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to about 40%.  China is now projected to expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.  AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports tariffs have changed the outlook on the economy. We are entering a new era, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. This global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset. The forecasts underscore the widespread impact of both the tariffs and the uncertainty they have created. Every country in the world is affected, the IMF said, by hikes in US import taxes that have now lifted average U.S. duties to about 25%, the highest in a century. 
        
     The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.  The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty. Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties. Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didnt substantially change the IMFs forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.  The Trump administration has slapped duties on cars, steel, and aluminum, as well as 25% import taxes on most goods from Canada and Mexico. The White House has also imposed 10% tariffs on nearly all imports, and a huge 145% duty on goods from China, though smartphone and computers have been exempted. China has retaliated with 125% duties on US goods. The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administrations next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Most traded goods are parts that feed into finished products, and the tariffs could disrupt supply chains, similar to what occurred during the pandemic, Gourinchas warned in a blog post.  Companies facing uncertain market access will likely pause in the near term, reduce investment and cut spending, he wrote.  The U.S. tariffs are also expected to hit less-developed nations, with Mexicos economy now expected to shrink this year by 0.3%, down from a previous projection of 1.4% growth. South Africa is forecast to grow just 1% this year, down from a 1.5% projection in January.  While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a supply shock, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall. Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.  In his blog post, Gourinchas acknowleged that there is an acute perception that globalization unfairly displaced many domestic manufacturing jobs and added that there is some merit to these grievances.  But he added that the deeper force behind this decline is technological progress and automation, not globalization. Gourinchas noted that both Germany, which has a goods trade surplus, and the U.S., which has a deficit, have seen factory output remain relatively level in recent decades even as automation has caused manufacturing employment to decline. The IMF expects the tariffs to take a big chunk out of Chinas economy, but it also forecasts that additional spending by the Chinese government will offset much of the hit.  The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.  The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMFs January forecast.  Japans growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.  In a separate report Tuesday, the IMF warned that global financial stability risks have increased significantly, along with the deteriorating economic outlook. The fund noted that some stock and bond prices remained high despite the recent market rout triggered by Trumps tariffs  which means they are vulnerable to further drops. The IMF also cautioned that some financial institutions could come under strain in volatile markets, pointing in particular to heavily indebted hedge funds and asset management companies and the risk that they will be forced to raise cash by selling investments into an already-fragile market. _____ AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/recession-imf-economy-tariffs-5ec37492c9fac499923c094776b87552,business
"US tariffs will weaken global economy and trigger inflation but not a global recession, IMF says","Surging U.S. tariffs will weaken the global economy and push up inflation this year, according to projections to be released next week by the International Monetary Fund. The IMFs Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said Thursday that the Trump administrations sharp increases in duties have caused global uncertainty to spike. The import taxes will slow global growth, but not cause a worldwide recession, she added. The details of the IMFs outlook will be issued Tuesday. The world economys resilience is being tested by the reboot of the global trading system that threatens to cause turbulence in financial markets, Georgieva said. That turbulence has been playing out in financial markets for weeks now, especially on Wall Street, which has experienced wild swings from day-to-day and often times even hour-to-hour. The IMF chief also echoed some Trump administration concerns. She called on countries to reduce their tariffs and lower other barriers to trade, a process that she said had stalled out in the past decade after making steady progress for many years after World War II. Trade distortions  tariff and nontariff barriers  have fed negative perceptions of a multilateral system seen to have failed to deliver a level playing field, she said. This feeling of unfairness in some places feeds the narrative: we play by the rules while others game the system without penalty. Georgieva added that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly. Due to the complexity of supply chains, the cost of a single item can be affected by tariffs in dozens of countries, she said. 
        
     Increased trade barriers also tend to immediately impact growth, and while it can lead to more domestic production, that takes time to implement, she added. In its most recent projections issued in January, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow nominally faster and for inflation to come down, though it warned that outlook was clouded by President Donald Trumps policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports. The Washington-based lending agency said at the time that it expected the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024.  Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, was forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026. However, in a blog post that accompanied those projections, the funds chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce are likely to push inflation higher in the near term.  Those forecasts from January are expected to change  possibly significantly  as Trumps trade war has escalated in recent months, particularly with the U.S.'s biggest trade partner, China. Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats  leading to more volatility in the stock market  but has been in a tit-for-tat tariff battle with China and has shown no sign of backing down. Each time Trump has raised tariffs on China, Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.

US expands attempt to blow up Google with proposed teardown of its ad technology,"The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking a federal judge to force the company to part with some of the technology powering the companys digital ad network. The proposed dismantling coincides with an ongoing federal effort to separate Googles Chrome browser from its dominant search engine. The governments latest proposal was filed late Monday in a Virginia federal court two-and-half weeks after a federal judge ruled that its lucrative digital ad network has been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers. In a 17-page filing, Justice Department lawyers argued that U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema should punish Google by ordering the company to offload its AdX business and DFP ad platform, tools that bring together advertisers, who want to market their products, and publishers, who want to sell commercial space on their sites, to bring in revenue. The government also is seeking other restrictions, including a 10-year ban on Google from operating a digital ad exchange, to undercut the power of a recidivist monopolist.  Not surprisingly, its an idea that Google vehemently plans to oppose when the penalty phase of the antitrust case known as remedy hearings  begins in late September. Google already has vowed to appeal Brinkemas ruling that the technology powering the ad network has been breaking the law, but cant do that until the judge rules on its punishment in a decision expected late this year or early next year. 
        
     The Justice Departments proposal would cause economic chaos and technological dysfunction resulting in harm to millions of advertisers and publishers, and in so doing, degrade the experience of internet users, Google said in a court filing late Monday.  In its counterproposal, Google outlined a plan that it believes will bring more transparency to its ad network and eventually foster more competition. Google proposed the appointment of a trustee to oversee its behavior for three years.  The attempt to tear down Googles ad network comes on top of the Justice Departments ongoing effort to have the company part with its popular Chrome browser and impose other restrictions to curtail the power of its ubiquitous search engine, which another federal judge branded an illegal monopoly in a ruling last August. The remedy hearings in the search case are scheduled to conclude later this month, with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta expected by Labor Day. If the Justice Department is able to persuade the two different judges to order its proposed dismantling of Google, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service into seven separate regional companies more than 40 years ago. Googles Play Store for apps running on its Android software that powers most of the worlds smartphones also was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal jury in 2023 and is battling a judges order that would require it to overhaul a commission system that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue. But hobbling its search engine and digital ad network would be far bigger blows because they are the key cogs in a business that generated $265 billion in revenue last year.  Google is confronting the breakup threats at the same time the advent of artificial intelligence is changing the way consumers are using technology and seeking information online  a shift that could also siphon traffic and money away from a powerhouse that began in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998. Despite the adversity, Google is still delivering robust financial growth to its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., which is currently valued at $2 trillion. Alphabets share dipped by less than 1% Tuesday to close at $163.20.",https://apnews.com/article/google-ad-network-monopoly-penalty-073faf53cd757249f83d6eddabcb8e56,business
Cyprus and Israel seek to quickly establish an electricity linkup via an undersea cable,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP)  Cyprus and neighboring Israel are seeking to swiftly establish an electricity linkup via an undersea cable that would eliminate their respective energy isolation, an official said Monday. Energy Minister George Papanastasiou said that Israel is particularly keen to ensure that it can rely on Cypriot energy reserves from both conventional and renewable sources to power the country if the need ever arises. Pananastasiou told The Associated Press that Cyprus would soon have the capacity to generate around four gigawatts of electricity from fossil fuels as well as solar and wind sources, while consuming only 0.5 GW. Wind turbines and photovoltaics generate 1 GW of electricity, but licenses have been issued for construction of new wind and solar energy parks with a capacity of 2.8 GW. Conventional fuels generate 1.4 GW. The shared commitment for an electricity cable link was affirmed Sunday when Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a daylong visit to Israel and Ramallah, West Bank. Both leaders said that the electricity link would showcase the two countries geographical location as the natural gateways between Europe and the Middle East. Papanastasiou said given this geographical advantage, the two leaders agreed to pursue the potential benefits from the establishment of a trade, energy and digital connectivity corridor between India, the Middle East and Europe. 
        
     The corridor, known as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, or IMEC, was unveiled at the India-hosted Group of 20 summit of the worlds leading rich and developing nations in 2023.  Netanyahu said Sunday that he had recently spoken with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi about IMEC, which he said was a very revolutionary and transformative development that we want to bring into place. Separately, an electricity cable project to link Greece with Cyprus is already underway. The 1.94 billion-euro ($2.19 billion) Great Seas Interconnector, or GSI, is partly funded by the European Union to the tune of 800 million euros ($903 million). Progress has been slowed because of Turkish objections over the cables course. Turkey says the project cant proceed without its consent because the cable would pass through waters it claims are under its jurisdiction.",https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-israel-india-imec-electricity-cable-corridor-e0fac3a0c5d53824266016b4ae17bcfa,business
Book Review: Restaurateur Keith McNally opens up in candid memoir I Regret Almost Everything,"Keith McNally has been charming New York City diners since he opened his first restaurant, The Odeon, in 1980, helping transform a then-derelict TriBeCa into a hotspot for the glitterati. The Odeons glowing neon sign was featured on the cover of Jay McInerneys 1984 novel Bright Lights, Big City, and the restaurant was a regular hangout for celebrities from Andy Warhol to John Belushi. Nearly five decades and 19 restaurants later, McNallys Balthazar in SoHo, Minetta Tavern in New York and D.C., and other restaurants are still going strong. In his candid, funny and poignant memoir, I Regret Almost Everything, McNally, 73, shows that he is, too. But it might not have been that way. The book opens with a 2018 suicide attempt, sparked by back pain, a crumbling marriage and the aftereffects of a 2016 stroke which left him with aphasia and a paralyzed right hand. Work  building and operating restaurants  helped keep him going. And with his speech distorted, he found a creative outlet in Instagram, where his filter-free screeds on everything  from dealing with his stroke to Balthazars evening recap by staff  often go viral. In some ways, it was only after I lost my voice that I learned to speak my mind, he writes. In his memoir, McNally charts his unlikely success story from a working-class teen actor raised in Bethnal Green, London, to being dubbed The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown in his heyday of the 1980s and 90s. 
        
     His exacting eye for lighting and ambiance and charming touches in his restaurants  he sends a gratis glass of champagne to solo diners at Balthazar, and often filled the cheap $15 carafe of wine at the now-defunct Schillers with his finest bottles  have turned countless customers into regulars at his establishments. McNallys memoir lets readers sidle up to the bar and feel like regulars in his life, too. ___ AP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",https://apnews.com/article/keith-mcnally-regret-book-review-21d5881808440f6323cfe2f64f90d8f7,business
"AI developers should counter misinformation and protect fact-based news, global media groups say","GENEVA (AP)  A global group of broadcasters and publishers is calling on artificial intelligence developers to make sure their technology serves the public by helping to counter misinformation and protect the value of fact-based news. The Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union, an association of public broadcasters thats also known for running the popular Eurovision Song Contest, says it and the World Association of News Publishers and other partners want to cooperate with tech companies behind AI.  The group says thousands of public and private media in broadcast, print and online formats have joined the News Integrity in the Age of AI initiative, whose five core steps were announced Monday at the World News Media Congress in Krakow, Poland. The initiative is calling for news content to only be used in generative AI models with the authorization of the content originator, and for clarity about attribution and accuracy. It says the original news source behind AI-generated material must be apparent and accessible. Organizations and institutions that see truth and facts as the desirable core of a democracy and the foundation of an empowered society should now come together at one table to shape the next era, said Ladina Heimgartner, president of the publishers association and CEO of Switzerlands Ringier Media.  Among the media affiliates along with EBU and WAN-IFRA  as the association of news publishers is known  are Latin American broadcasters association AIL; the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union; and the North American Broadcasters Association, which counts Fox, Paramount, NBC Universal and PBS among its members.  
        
     Since AI surged into public awareness with the launch of OpenAIs ChatGPT in November 2022, legacy media have grappled with how best to use the technology, and whether to cooperate with or even combat the companies behind it.  The New York Times and other newspapers have filed a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and business partner Microsoft. The Times has said the tech companies have threatened its livelihood by effectively stealing billions of dollars worth of work by its journalists. Many news outlets have struck deals with OpenAI, including the Associated Press. which has a licensing and technology deal with it as well as with Google for delivery of news through its Gemini AI chatbot.

States sue Trump administration for blocking the development of wind energy,"A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trumps attempt to stop the development of wind energy. Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesnt have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and hes jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals. Theyre asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it. This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet, New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are using lawfare to stop the presidents popular energy agenda, instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.  The American people voted for the president to restore Americas energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats radical climate agenda, Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.  
        
     Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal governments leasing and permitting of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts. The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. Hes boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing its necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world. The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.  Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.  Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nations largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trumps order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a national energy emergency, which called for expanding domestic energy production.  The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say theyve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate. Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nations first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island. Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermens organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind. The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey. Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmerannounced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.  ___ The Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

"How stocks, bonds and other markets have fared so far in 2025","NEW YORK (AP)  Global financial markets have been turned upside down this year by President Donald Trumps burgeoning trade war. Markets are not in full panic, but the double-digit declines in major U.S. stock indexes are testing nerves.  U.S. markets had been on a two-year tear coming into 2025, though many believed that stock prices had become overinflated. Trumps trade war pushed that sentiment into hyperdrive. The S&P 500 has tumbled more than 12%, and U.S. markets are being outpaced in Europe, Asia, and just about everywhere else.  Trading in traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasurys and the dollar has become erratic and unpredictable. On Monday, the dollar struck a three-year low and U.S. Treasury yields have been soaring. Typically, yields would fall as investors seek a safe place to park their money. U.S. Treasurys no longer appear to provide the shelter they once did.  Only gold, a commodity traded internationally, has maintained its reputation as a safe zone. The price of gold is hitting one record high after another. Heres a roundup of what is happening in various segments of the financial market:  U.S. stocks have been losing ground in a sharp reversal after two years of stellar gains. The S&P 500 index, which is considered a benchmark for the broader markets health, is down 12.3% in 2025. It gained more than 20% in both 2023 and 2024.  The benchmark index is already in correction, having fallen more than 10% from the record it set in February. There have been only five weeks in which its ended in positive territory this year and with Mondays decline its moving closer to bear market territory, or a 20% drop from recent highs. 
        
     Its worse on the growth-focused Nasdaq composite, which has plunged nearly 18 %.  Overseas markets have largely performed much better than their U.S. counterparts.  Treasurys, typically considered a less risky area of the market, have been volatile throughout the year. The 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates and other loans, was as high as 4.80% in January but then fell until Trump announced the broad details of his tariff policy in early April. Yields then began to spike this month. The recent jump in bond yields, which happens when bond prices fall, reflects rising anxiety about inflation and a potential recession. Treasury bonds are essentially IOUs from the U.S. government and theyre how Washington pays its bills. Bond prices typically move in the opposite direction of stock prices, but prices for both have fallen in tandem. That raises more significant concerns, namely a loss of faith in the U.S. as a safe place to invest. In all of the economic uncertainty, gold is soaring  setting record after record in 2025.  New York spot gold hit another all-time high Thursday, closing at about $3,343 per Troy ounce  the standard for measuring precious metals  per FactSet. The price is up nearly 27% this year. Gold futures rose to more than $3,432 Monday. Interest in gold spikes in times of uncertainty as investors seek a safe place for their money, although there can still be some volatility. The price of spot gold fell for three straight trading days following Trumps sweeping Liberation Day announcement on April 2, for example, but soon rebounded overall. The U.S. dollar, the worlds reserve currency, is falling under the weight of uncertainty over tariffs, inflation and the direction of the U.S. economy. The U.S. dollar is down a steep 9% for the year when measured against a basket of other currencies, including the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian Dollar and Swiss franc. The dollar began to erode almost immediately in 2025, but those losses have accelerated over the past two months. A weakened dollar means it is more difficult for the U.S. government, businesses and consumers to borrow money at lower rates. It also means less purchasing power for U.S. consumers and the potential for stunted economic growth. There is good news and bad news about energy prices. The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. on Monday was $3.15, down sharply from $3.67 at this time last year. Thats the good news.  The bad news is that energy prices fall when people start anticipating an economic slowdown. Factories produce less, families call off vacations and businesses cut travel expenses.  Oil prices hit a four-year low this month with anxiety over the impact of tariffs on global economic growth sinking in.  West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, stood at around $62.40 per barrel Monday. Thats down nearly 14% year to date. And Brent crude, the European standard, was just above $66  down nearly 13% since the start of 2025. Economists are warning that the steep tariffs Trump is pursuing could cause a recession, which could carry significant implications for the supply chain and jobs in the energy sector. Bitcoin has continued to undulate.  The worlds largest cryptocurrency has been on a rollercoaster since the start of the year  with the volatile asset climbing to more than $109,000 ahead of Trumps inauguration in January, only to dip under $75,000 amid wider market sell-offs this month. As of midday Monday, bitcoins going price was above $87,000, per CoinMarketCap. Thats more than $6,000 lower than what bitcoin was trading at the start of 2025  but still significantly higher than in recent years. At this time last year, bitcoin traded around $65,000. And in April 2023, months after the November 2022 collapse of FTX crushed crypto, the digital asset went for under $30,000. Trump, once a crypto skeptic, became a major promoter of the industry throughout his campaign  and last month, he signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-bonds-gold-bitcoin-oil-dollar-f3bf98f79192e4c6706437b36ea064e9,business
Heres what you need to know about credit card defaults,"NEW YORK (AP)  Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData.  With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default.  A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower wont pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire.  Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir.  These are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people dont realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas, added Sotir.  Heres what you should know about credit card defaults.  
        
     There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesnt pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card delinquent and the borrowers credit scores can be damaged further. When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub.  Thats where youre going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while, said Lupo.  When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower.  The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether its reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid. Ive seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, its easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it, said Sotir Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since its in the banks best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor.  Its best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company.  Do whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If youre 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default, said Bandebo.  If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan.  Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee.  Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you dont pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo.  Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time.  Theres not miracle solutions that once youve missed a payment, or youve gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You cant just flip a switch, said Bandebo.  If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income.  For most people, its really about understanding how much money is coming in and where its going, added Sotir.  If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who cant afford large and high-interest credit card balances.  Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo.  If your budget doesnt allow you to resume payments, its important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo.

F1s governing body studying cost cap and ponders McLarens proposal on paying to lodge complaints,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  The president of Formula 1s governing body is studying the cost cap that teams operate under and is considering eliminating it because managing it has become such a headache for the FIA.  Mohammed Ben Sulayem also said before the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday that he supports a proposal floated by McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown that would require teams making any allegations against another to lodge a formal complaint with a monetary deposit. Brown suggested the money would be returned if the allegations proved true, but it should count against the cost cap if unproven as a deterrent to baseless and damaging claims.  Ben Sulayem wants to adopt the rule, but is studying if it should count against the cost cap. That then led him to vocalize his frustration with the entire cost cap system, in which the FIA must review each teams annual spending and make sure they are within the budget.  Im looking at the cost cap and its just giving the FIA a headache. So whats the point of it? Ben Sulayem said in his trackside office about an hour before the race around Hard Rock Stadium.  I dont see the point. I really dont.  The cost cap was introduced in 2021 with new rules that restricts spending and a sliding scale of aerodynamic and CFD testing  financial regulations that has made the competition closer. The cost caps prevent the bigger teams from being able to endlessly spend on development that the smaller teams cannot afford.  
        
     The cost cap for the 2025 season is $140.4 million. As for Browns idea, which Brown raised in Miami by using a bottled labeled TIRE WATER to troll Red Bull Racings accusations that McLaren is using water to manipulate its tire temperatures, Ben Sulayem was in full agreement on charging teams to lodge an allegation.  You cannot just accuse someone without a written complaint, and that protest, you have to pay money, said Ben Sulayem, who even tossed out $50,000 as the potential fee charged. Finally, Ben Sulayem said he expects clarification to the driver code of conduct policy to be completed next week, but he was explicit in that he wont be lifting the ban on profanity. Drivers as of this season can be fined for cursing when in official FIA appearances and the rule has been highly criticized by drivers from multiple series managed by the governing body.  Ben Sulayem said the clarifications coming will address how the code of conduct is applied to individual series, but he wont be lifting the cursing restriction. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-ben-sulayem-a6509003abc8cf260c9afa0d5d90f3ee,business
"Trump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, saying the movie industry in the US is dying","NEW YORK (AP)  President Donald Trump is opening a new salvo in his tariff war, targeting films made outside the U.S. In a post Sunday night on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he has authorized the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to slap a 100% tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death, he wrote, complaining that other countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw filmmakers and studios away from the U.S. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! The White House said Monday that it was figuring out how to comply with the presidents wishes. Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trumps directive to safeguard our countrys national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again, said spokesperson Kush Desai. Its common for both large and small films to include production in the U.S. and in other countries. Big-budget movies like the upcoming Mission: Impossible  The Final Reckoning, for instance, are shot around the world. Incentive programs for years have influenced where movies are shot, increasingly driving film production out of California and to other states and countries with favorable tax incentives, like Canada and the United Kingdom. 
        
     Yet Trumps tariffs are designed to lead consumers toward American products. And in movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelmingly dominate the domestic marketplace. China has ramped up its domestic movie production, culminating in the animated blockbuster Ne Zha 2 grossing more than $2 billion this year. But even then, its sales came almost entirely from mainland China. In North America, it earned just $20.9 million. In New Zealand, where successive governments have offered rebates and incentives in recent years to draw Hollywood films to the country, the film industry has generated billions of dollars in tourism revenue driven by the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, which featured the countrys pristine and scenic vistas. More recently, the blockbuster Minecraft movie was filmed entirely in New Zealand, and U.S. productions in 2023 delivered $1.3 billion New Zealand dollars ($777 million) to the country in return for NZ$200 million in subsidies, according to government figures. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was awaiting more details of Trumps measures before commenting on them but would continue to pitch to filmmakers abroad, including in Indias Bollywood. Weve got an absolutely world class industry, he said. This is the best place to make movies, period, in the world. The Motion Picture Association, which represents major U.S. film studios and streaming services, didnt immediately respond to messages Sunday evening. The MPAs data shows how much Hollywood exports have dominated cinemas. According to the MPA, the American movies produced $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus in 2023.  Trump, a Republican, has made good on the tariff man label he gave himself years ago, slapping new taxes on goods made in countries around the globe. That includes a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with even higher levies threatened. By unilaterally imposing tariffs, Trump has exerted extraordinary influence over the flow of commerce, creating political risks and pulling the market in different directions. There are tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, with more imports, including pharmaceutical drugs, set to be subject to new tariffs in the weeks ahead. Trump has long voiced concern about movie production moving overseas. Shortly before he took office, he announced that he had tapped actors Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone to serve as special ambassadors to Hollywood to bring it BACK  BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE! U.S. film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Overall production in the U.S. was down 26% last year compared with 2021, according to data from ProdPro, which tracks production.  The groups annual survey of executives, which asked about preferred filming locations, found no location in the U.S. made the top five, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Toronto, the U.K., Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia came out on top, with California placing sixth, Georgia seventh, New Jersey eighth and New York ninth. The problem is especially acute in California. In the greater Los Angeles area, production last year was down 5.6% from 2023 according to FilmLA, second only to 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. Last, October, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, proposed expanding Californias Film & Television Tax Credit program to $750 million annually, up from $330 million.  Other U.S. cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago and San Francisco have also used aggressive tax incentives to lure film and TV productions. Those programs can take the form of cash grants, as in Texas, or tax credits, which Georgia and New Mexico offer. Other nations have been stealing the movie-making capabilities from the United States, Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday night after returning from a weekend in Florida. If theyre not willing to make a movie inside the United States we should have a tariff on movies that come in. ___ Associated Press writers Gary Fields in Washington and Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-films-hollywood-tariff-movies-415367dff6ae5bb7dc0871db5ac97d48,business
"Federal Reserve likely to defy Trump, keep rates unchanged this week","WASHINGTON (AP)  The Federal Reserve will likely keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, despite weeks of harsh criticism and demands from President Donald Trump that the Fed reduce borrowing costs.  After causing a sharp drop in financial markets two weeks ago by saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump subsequently backed off and said he had no intention of doing so. Still, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said the Fed should cut rates.  They argue that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked.  Separately, Elon Musk, the head of Trumps Department of Government Efficiency, last Wednesday suggested that DOGE should look more closely at the Feds spending on its facilities.  The heightened scrutiny shows that even as the Trump administration backs off its threats to fire Powell, the Fed is still subject to unusually sharp political pressures, despite its status as an independent agency.  Even so, the Fed will almost certainly leave its key rate unchanged at about 4.3% when it meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Powell and many of the other 18 officials that sit on the Feds rate-setting committee have said they want to see how Trumps tariffs affect the economy before making any moves. Trump, however, on Friday said on the social media platform Truth Social that there is NO INFLATION and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.  
        
     Thats not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined  gas costs are down 10% from a year ago  continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon. Inflation did drop noticeably in March, an encouraging sign, though in the first three months of the year it was 3.6%, according to the Feds preferred gauge, well above its 2% target.  Without tariffs, economists say its possible the Fed would soon reduce its benchmark rate, because it is currently at a level intended to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Yet the Fed cant now cut rates with Trumps broad tariffs likely to raise prices in the coming months.  Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY, said that the Fed is scarred by what happened in 2021, when prices rose amid supply snarls and Powell and other Fed officials said the increase would likely be transitory. Instead, inflation soared to a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.  This time they will be more cautious, he said.  Thats a Fed that is going to have to wait for evidence and be slow to adjust on that evidence, Reinhart said.  Plus, Trumps badgering of Powell makes it harder for the Fed chair to cut rates because doing so anytime soon would be seen as knuckling under to the White House, said Preston Mui, an economist at Employ America.  You could imagine a world where there isnt pressure from the Trump administration and they cut rates ... sooner, because they feel comfortable making the argument that theyre doing so because of the data, he said. For his part, Powell said last month that tariffs would likely push up inflation and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the Fed. The central bank would typically raise rates  or at least keep them elevated  to fight inflation, while it would cut them to spur the economy if unemployment rose.  Powell has said that the impact of the tariffs on inflation could be temporary  a one-time price increase  but most recently said it could also be more persistent. That suggests that Powell will want to wait, potentially for months, to ensure tariffs dont sustainably raise inflation before considering a rate cut.  Some economists forecast the Fed wont cut rates until its September meeting, or even later.  Yet Fed officials could move sooner if the tariffs hit the economy hard enough to cause layoffs and push up unemployment. Wall Street investors appear to expect such an outcome  they project that the first cut will occur in July, according to futures pricing.  Separately, Musk criticized the Fed Wednesday for spending $2.5 billion on an extensive renovation of two of its buildings in Washington, D.C.  Since at the end of the day, this is all taxpayer money, we should certainly look to see if indeed the Federal Reserve is spending $2.5 billion on their interior designer, Musk said. Thats an eyebrow raiser. Fed officials acknowledge that the cost of the renovations have risen as prices for building materials and labor have spiked amid the post-pandemic inflation. And former Fed officials, speaking on background, say that local regulations forced the Fed to do more of the expansion underground, rather than making the buildings taller, which added to the cost.  Meanwhile, Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and a potential candidate to replace Powell as chair when Powells term expires next year, said recently that the Fed has attracted greater scrutiny because of its failure to keep prices in check.  The Feds current wounds are largely self-inflicted, he said in a speech during an International Monetary Fund conference in late April, in which he also slammed the Fed for participating in a global forum on climate change. A strategic reset is necessary to mitigate losses of credibility, changes in standing, and most important, worse economic outcomes for our fellow citizens. Powell, for his part, said last month that Fed independence is very widely understood and supported in Washington, in Congress, where it really matters.",https://apnews.com/article/inflation-trump-fed-rates-dda543c3c00fda34e37e09119d9a9709,business
A massive coastal restoration project is in peril amid claims Louisiana concealed a critical report,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP)  An ambitious project to restore a rapidly vanishing stretch of Louisiana coast that was devastated by the 2010 Gulf oil spill has been thrown deeper into disarray amid claims by Gov. Jeff Landry that his predecessor concealed an unfavorable study that it was feared could imperil the $3 billion effort. Its a controversy that was even predicted by the previous administration as it grappled with how to handle conflicting environmental analyses for the project, according to a confidential memo obtained by The Associated Press.  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, left, listens as Attorney General Jeff Landry, right, speaks during a news conference at the Governors Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management, April 6, 2020, in Baton Rouge, La. (Bill Feig/The Advocate via AP, Pool, File) Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, left, listens as Attorney General Jeff Landry, right, speaks during a news conference at the Governors Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management, April 6, 2020, in Baton Rouge, La. (Bill Feig/The Advocate via AP, Pool, File) The nine-page document, prepared by five attorneys working for then-Gov. John Bel Edwards administration, sheds new light on a study Landry says was improperly withheld from the public and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as it was approving a permit for the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion. The stakes were so high the attorneys even weighed whether state officials could face federal charges for withholding from the Corps a report that the diversion would generate significantly less land than another modeling projection used in a federal review. Prosecution seemed extremely unlikely, the lawyers wrote to the heads of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which oversees the diversion project, but they added that the severe consequences and criminalization of the action warranted mention. The attorneys also warned that the Corps might suspend or revoke the permit if it discovered the study after the fact, the 2022 memo shows, foreshadowing actions taken last month when the Corps cited deliberately withheld information among its reasons for suspending its permit for the project. The move halts construction despite more than half a billion dollars already spent.  
        
     They hid the bad stuff and only showed the (Corps) the version they liked, Landry wrote in a post on X. Science is easy when you just delete the inconvenient parts! Edwards denied his administration withheld information from the Corps and said Gov. Landrys accusations are demonstrably false. When all the facts are presented, the public will see that his administration has played political games and botched this important project, Edwards said in a statement to AP. Landry countered in his own statement that the facts speak for themselves.  Amid the finger-pointing, conservation proponents have called the report in question a red herring that Landry is using to tank the project. The diversion, funded mostly from a settlement arising from BPs 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, is the largest of its kind in Louisianas history. The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion would puncture levees in southeast Louisiana, diverting some of the rivers sediment-rich flow to restore wetlands. The long-delayed project was intended to mitigate a disappearing coastline caused by a range of factors such as climate change-induced sea-level rise and the rivers vast levee system. Ground was broken in 2023, but state and federal litigation has stalled it. Opponents have blasted its ballooning cost and crippling effects on the local fishing and oyster industries. Landry has said the project would break Louisianas culture of shrimp and oyster harvesting, likening it to government efforts a century ago to punish schoolchildren for speaking Cajun French.  Earlier this year, Landrys administration approached the Corps with a list of concerns about the project, including a 2022 study it said does not appear to have been disclosed to the public nor considered by all necessary persons within the Corps.  Officials working for the state at the time defended their handling of the report in question, saying it had been focused on analyzing maintenance and operational costs related to the diversion and was not intended to be part of the federal environmental impact statement process.  The report, prepared by AECOM Technical Services and a subcontractor, produced inconsistent results such as a significantly lower projected land creation  as few as 7 square miles (18 square kilometers) compared to the 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) estimated under the primary model, according to the confidential memo.  Officials familiar with the study said its lower projection resulted from not properly accounting for sea level rise and underestimating the rivers flow. The memo also pointed to the need for significant dredging to maintain the diversion channel, which Landrys administration now says will cost tens of millions of dollars.  In the memo, the attorneys outlined a series of reputational concerns about withholding the study and warned it would be more difficult to keep controlling the narrative if the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority is on the defensive. The memo noted the Corps and other federal agencies could delay the project for years if they attempted to integrate the modeling results into their environmental impact analysis. Failing to formally disclose the modeling results to federal agencies like the Corps, the attorneys warned, also would leave the project vulnerable to litigation.  They suggested the Edwards administration informally discuss the issue with federal agencies and then strategize the best way to formally enter it into the public record for the agencies to review. The reports findings eventually were verbally communicated to at least one Corps official, who indicated it was insignificant, according to multiple former Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority officials familiar with the exchange. But the complete analysis itself was not submitted into the public record, nor was the officials response at the time, they said. The former state officials werent authorized to discuss internal deliberations and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.  Col. Cullen Jones, head of the Corps New Orleans District, told Landrys administration last month that the Corps recently conducted a technical review of the modeling analysis in question and concluded it would not affect the permit. But Jones said the Corps suspended the projects permit in part because the State deliberately withheld information  that the State knew it should provide. The Corps also pointed to actions taken by Landrys administration, including a 90-day work stoppage announced last month amid plans to study an alternative smaller diversion and claims the state cant afford the project. Its unclear how Landry intends to respond to the permits suspension. The state has until Monday to take action to dispute the permit suspension. At that point, the Corps could revoke or modify the permit as it sees fit.  Louisianas coastal agency earmarked about $573 million in its 2025 budget for the project, an amount now being reviewed by the legislature. Last fall, federal agencies tasked with managing Deepwater Horizon settlement money warned that if Louisiana backs out of or alters the Mid-Barataria diversion, money allocated for it would need to be returned.  Lauren Bourg, director of the National Audubon Societys Mississippi River Delta program, told lawmakers that ending or altering the project sends the message that any infrastructure project in this state may be undone by a few stakeholders who engage in politics with the right people, distorting the scientific and engineering principles upon which all of these projects are grounded. But many in southeast Louisianas fishing industry applauded the move to halt the project. If all this water comes down, its going to kill everything, said Mitch Jurisich, chairman of the Louisiana Oyster Task Force.  __ Brook reported from New Orleans.

"In battle against transgender rights, Trump targets HUDs housing policies","As a transgender man, the words youre a girl gutted Tazz Webster, a taunt hurled at him from the day he moved into his St. Louis apartment. The government-subsidized buildings manager also insisted on calling Webster by the wrong name, the 38-year-old said, and ridiculed him with shouts of, Youre not a real man!

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) I just felt like I was being terrorized, Webster told The Associated Press. I felt that I was being judged and mistreated, like I was less of a human being. Then one day in March 2022, the manager shoved Webster so hard he stumbled backward. After regaining his balance, Webster said he pushed the manager back. Four months later he was homeless.  Webster filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity office, the agency tasked with investigating housing discrimination and enforcing the landmark Fair Housing Act that guarantees equal access to housing for all Americans.  Websters harassment allegation was serious enough that it was investigated for more than two years, until the office suddenly notified him in February it was dropping his case without a finding, citing lack of jurisdiction.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) The timing of the closure was not a coincidence. In the months since President Donald Trump took back the White House and installed a loyalist to lead the federal housing department, HUD Secretary Scott Turner and his team have moved swiftly and strategically to undo, uproot and remake the agencys decades of work and priorities.  
        
     In the crosshairs is an intense focus on transgender people, as HUD retreats from long-established fair-housing protections by closing their discrimination complaints and, more broadly, moving to undo the Obama-era Equal Access Rule that cemented transgender peoples rights to discrimination protection in housing. Its time to get rid of all the far-left gender ideology and get government out of the way of what the Lord established from the beginning when he created man in his own image  male and female, Turner said in announcing in February that he was halting enforcement of the Equal Access Rule.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) At issue is the fact that discrimination against LGBTQ+ people wasnt specifically cited in the Fair Housing Act. But the Equal Access Rule enacted in 2012 under former President Barack Obama further defined sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The policy was expanded in 2016 to cover transgender people seeking help at federally funded emergency shelters, escalating opposition from the right.  In 2020, the first Trump administration unsuccessfully moved to relieve shelters of any obligation to serve transgender people. Now, advocates fear an emboldened Trump will go further and forbid shelters from accommodating gender identity altogether, as his administration announces unspecified revisions to the Equal Access Rule.  Our protections cant be a pingpong ball that changes every four years, said Seran Gee, an attorney for Advocates for Trans Equality.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) After being left with permanent injuries in a car crash, Webster, who survives on disability payments, was grateful to move in April 2021 into an apartment near the citys 1,300-acre (526-hectare) Forest Park, scene of the 1904 Worlds Fair and home to museums and a zoo.  His rent was initially less than $200 per month, he said. That is because Branscome Apartments had a contract with the federal government to provide subsidized housing to people with disabilities and low-income seniors. But the HUD money also comes with strings, said Linda Morris, staff attorney for the ACLUs Womens Rights Project, who leads the organizations housing discrimination work.  The Equal Access Rule applies to HUD-funded programs and shelters, said Morris, who doesnt represent Webster. If an entity is going to accept federal funding they have to comply.  Under the rule, HUD-funded housing and programs must provide equal access to everyone regardless of gender identity, and cant require intrusive questioning. Four months after the shoving incident, Webster found his door kicked in and his belongings trashed, even though, he said, he was up to date on his rent and never received an official eviction notice.  Gone were his king-size bed, dishes, Social Security card and birth certificate. Even worse was the loss of the obituary for his mother, who died when he was 12, and her necklace, a treasured memento. I had nothing, said Webster, who had been mostly staying away from the apartment for fear of another run-in with the manager. I was so afraid to be there, I would go to my friends house and spent nights at a time and then come back, switch my clothes, and leave. Court records in an eviction case filed against Webster in April 2022 cited repeated unsuccessful efforts to serve him. After he was gone, the case was dropped.  Last August, Webster filed a lawsuit in Missouri state court alleging he was illegally evicted.  There was never a court order allowing them to change the locks, allowing them to throw away his belongings, said attorney KB Doman of Arch City Defenders, an advocacy group representing Webster.  The suit seeks $25,000 in property damage and for severe emotional stress and trauma. The apartment has denied the allegations in court filings. Stephen Strum, the attorney representing the building, declined the APs requests for comment on the HUD case and said the pending lawsuit merely alleges that my client did not properly follow the steps for evicting. To Doman, Websters case reflects a larger trend.  A lot of people that would have some recourse, at least through HUD investigating, really are just out on their own now, she said. Its going to be harder for trans people to find safe, stable housing, and its very hard already.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Since Turner took the helm at HUD, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has instructed staff to pause investigations of all gender identity discrimination cases, according to two HUD attorneys who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or benefits.  One said letters were then issued closing the cases for lack of jurisdiction. HUD has not disclosed how many cases have been dropped.  Websters letter and another provided to the AP cite Trumps executive order calling for the federal government to define sex as only male or female.  Morris, of the ACLU, said she has never seen an executive order cited in a jurisdictional closure of a complaint.  So thats really alarming, said Morris, who described the closures as very much consistent with this administrations broader attacks on trans people and on civil rights more broadly.  Asked about policy changes concerning transgender discrimination, HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said the agency was enforcing the Fair Housing Act while implementing Trumps executive order restoring biological truth to the federal government.  In a statement citing Trumps order, she said government policy recognizes two sexes that are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Bea Gonzalez, a transgender man, was kicked out of a suburban St. Louis domestic violence shelter on a chilly night in November 2021, along with his three children, then 2, 5 and 7.  The family was just settling into a room after filling out paperwork at Bridgeway Behavioral Health Womens Center when Gonzalez was told they had to go because he disclosed he was a transgender man.  I wasnt about to go back into the closet, the 33-year-old said of his insistence on telling the truth even after it was suggested he keep his trans identity secret.  He needed a domestic violence shelter, he said, for greater security for the children and because he feared for his safety as a trans man in a mens shelter, some of which dont accept children anyway. The city had no domestic violence shelters for men, said his attorney Kalila Jackson. In the St. Louis metropolitan area, there was no place else for him to go. There were no other options.  The family was sent to a motel, but when they arrived they discovered it hadnt been paid for, and the organization that sent them there was closed. So I was stranded, said Gonzalez, who did not have a car. I had to call a friend who was able to let us stay for the night.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Jackson said Bridgeway received HUD funding and that its policy of barring transgender men was a violation of the Equal Access Rule and straight up sex discrimination.  Jackson said the message the shelter sent was this: Youre biologically a girl, you should dress as a girl. Since you say that you are a man, we are not going to accept you here. HUD didnt address Gonzalezs or Websters complaints when the AP sought comment on their cases.  HUD investigated Gonzalezs complaint for 2 1/2 years until it suddenly notified him in March the agency was dropping it without a finding. The company operating the shelter, Preferred Family Healthcare, did not respond to the APs requests for comment. After 455 days of being shuttled between six shelters in six cities in two states  Missouri and Illinois  Gonzalez ultimately found stable housing, where his children live with him part time. He sees what happened as part of what he describes as a nationwide federal push to erase trans identity. Advocates are concerned by HUDs shift, noting high rates of discrimination  and homelessness  among people who are LGBTQ+.  Nearly one-third of trans people say they have been homeless at some point in their lives, while 70% who stayed in a shelter reported being harassed, assaulted or kicked out because of their gender identity, according to an Advocates for Trans Equality survey released in 2015, a year before Obama expanded protections for trans people in shelters.  Teens who come out to families who arent accepting are particularly at risk, said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.  Some shelters that might have served them in the past are becoming less welcoming now amid upheaval with the Equal Access Rule, Oliva said. Folks who are trans just wont go if they dont think that theyre going to be treated with respect, she said, adding that is particularly problematic for young people who are vulnerable to sex traffickers and to other types of abuse. Further complicating the situation are seemingly contradictory requirements in new HUD contracts with nonprofits that find permanent housing and run shelters for the homeless. One section stipulates they cant promote gender ideology while another requires compliance with anti-discrimination law, according to a copy provided to the AP. Organizations say they are confused. What is promoting gender ideology? What does that mean? asked Jeannette Ruffins, CEO of Homeward NYC, a nonprofit that runs three permanent housing sites for LGBTQ+ young adults, as well as a homeless shelter.  Does housing LGBTQ young adults promote gender identity? she asked. You know, theyre coming to us. This is already their gender identity. Like Im not promoting it.  Ruffins called a board meeting to discuss potential vulnerabilities on their website, something she said most New York City nonprofits were doing as well. Her organization made small changes to their website, saying they were LGBTQ+ affirming and friendly in a few places rather than LGBTQ+ serving, hoping that will make them less of a target.  In Memphis, Tennessee, a nonprofit that provides emergency shelter for transgender people is looking to increase capacity because of the uncertainty.  Kayla Gore, executive director of My Sistahs House, said it can do that because it doesnt take federal funding. People are confused, Gore said. They dont know what to do because they want to protect their bottom line. Nearly three years after losing his apartment, Webster remains homeless, staying with friends and sometimes sleeping on the floor.  He is on a waiting list for subsidized housing because he cant afford rent otherwise. But he expects the massive federal funding cuts and Trump administration directives banning diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives will make the wait even longer. Lets be honest. This is the world, he said. People, they do hateful things. If you legalize them to hating, then they feel like they have a right.",https://apnews.com/article/transgender-hud-fair-housing-trump-lgbtq-turner-915634741f56f3d5ea265e316cd396bb,business
Copper cable theft in Spain delays thousands of high-speed rail passengers,"MADRID (AP)  Thousands of rail passengers in Spain were hit with delays after copper cables used in the signaling system of a high-speed line traveling south from Madrid to Seville were stolen at five locations, authorities said Monday.  The theft, which happened late Sunday, affected dozens of trains traveling between Madrid and the southern Andalusian cities of Seville, Malaga and Granada as many people were returning home to Spains capital after a holiday weekend. Copper prices are high on global markets, meaning criminals stand to collect big sums of cash from selling the material. Transport Minister Oscar Puente said in an X post that he expected the rail line would fully return to its normal schedule between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. local time (1200 GMT and 1400 GMT). Droves of travelers crowded Madrids Atocha station Monday seeking information about their trains from rail employees and screens with updated departure times. By 9 a.m, Alberto Valero and his family had spent hours at the station because of delays on services to Seville, where they were headed. Valero was on vacation in Spain from Mexico, and expressed frustration about the lack of information. Were here with tourists from everywhere  France, Portugal, Valero said. Everyone is at a loss for what to do because of the total disarray.  The cable theft took place at five points on the high-speed line in Toledo in central Spain, Puente said on X, adding that Spains national police force was investigating the incident. Spains high-speed rail network has expanded rapidly and travels through large stretches of the countrys little-populated countryside. The incident came a week after a blackout in Spain and Portugal grounded high-speed train traffic in Spain to a halt, stranding many passengers for several hours.",https://apnews.com/article/spain-train-delays-cable-theft-highspeed-rail-5a28e93f23e24c77c60749d5db397105,business
Romanias hard-right candidate will face a pro-EU reformist in presidential runoff,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  After decisively winning the most votes in Romanias first-round presidential election redo, hard-right nationalist George Simion will face a pro-Western reformist in a pivotal runoff in two weeks that could reshape the European Union and NATO member countrys geopolitical direction. Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, far outpaced all other candidates in the polls with 40.96% of the vote, according to official electoral data, after all votes were counted from Sundays election. In second place was reformist Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan with 20.99%. The runoff will be held on May 18 between the two staunchly anti-establishment candidates but ideological opposites, who have made their political careers railing against Romanias old political class. Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician and former anti-corruption activist who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) in 2016, ran on a pro-EU ticket, told the media early Monday that a difficult second round lies ahead, against an isolationist candidate. This was a democratic process that Romania needed  this wont be a debate between individuals, it will be a debate between a pro-Western direction for Romania and an anti-Western one, he said. I call on all Romanians to be part of this battle, and I am optimistic that we will win. In third place was the governing coalitions joint candidate, Crin Antonescu, with 20.07%, and behind him Victor Ponta, a former prime minister from 2012-2015, with 13% of the vote, while Elena Lasconi, who came second in last years first round ballot, only obtained about 2.6%. 
        
     In response to Antonescus poor showing, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu announced his resignation on Monday. Final turnout stood at 9.57 million people  or 53.2% of eligible voters, according to data from the electoral authorities. Last years election was annulled after the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the first round, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied. The election redo took place months after an annulled vote plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades. Simion, who came fourth in last years race and later backed Georgescu, said in a prerecorded speech aired after polls closed Sunday that, I am here to restore constitutional order.  I want democracy, I want normalcy, and I have a single objective: to give back to the Romanian people what was taken from them and to place at the center of decision-making the ordinary, honest, dignified people, he said. After her poor showing in Sundays vote, Lasconi announced her resignation on Monday as leader of the USR party, saying, I fought with all my strength against a rotten, corrupt system that has kept us captive for 35 years. Our efforts must be directed toward supporting a pro-European path and accelerating the transformation of a system that has proven dysfunctional and not in the citizens interest, she said.  The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy. Cristian Andrei, a Bucharest-based political consultant, said that Sundays outcome will likely trigger a crisis within the mainstream parties, and the runoff will pit pro-Western ideas against more conservative, patriotic messaging. Well have two anti-establishment candidates, one that is anti-establishment with a more conservative view of how Romania should advance, and a pro-Western anti-establishment, he told The Associated Press. This is the most important thing to say: that it will be like a total anti-establishment movement on both sides of the road. In a speech conceding defeat, the governing coalitions candidate, Antonescu, distanced himself and didnt endorse either candidate in the runoff, saying, I was not part of the coalition. I presented a program, some ideas, and some people voted for me. I urge them to decide for themselves which of the remaining candidates best aligns with the ideas I put forward, he said. I encourage everyone who voted for me today to show up and vote. Distrust in the authorities remains widespread, especially for those who voted for Georgescu, a sizable electorate that Simion has sought to tap into. Simion said that his hard-right nationalist AUR party is perfectly aligned with the MAGA movement, capitalizing on a growing wave of populism in Europe after U.S. President Donald Trumps political comeback. AUR rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election, proclaims to stand for family, nation, faith, and freedom, and has since doubled its support. The antiestablishment sentiment is not like an anarchic movement, but is against the people who destroyed this country, Simion told the AP days before the rerun. We are not a democratic state anymore.",https://apnews.com/article/romania-elections-presidential-europe-simion-28a8175191c38611d67c41e690504a5b,business
Trumps trade demands go beyond tariffs to target perceived unfair practices,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  The Trump administration says the sweeping tariffs it unveiled April 2, then postponed for 90 days, have a simple goal: Force other countries to drop their trade barriers to U.S. goods.  Yet President Donald Trumps definition of trade barriers includes a slew of issues well beyond the tariffs other countries impose on the U.S., including some areas not normally associated with trade disputes. Those include agricultural safety requirements, tax systems, currency exchange rates, product standards, legal requirements, and red tape at the border.  Hes given countries three months to come up with concessions before tariffs ranging from 10% to more than 50% go into effect. Tariffs on China are already in effect. On many issues it will be difficult, or in some cases impossible, for many countries to make a deal and lower their tariff rates. In addition, many trade officials from targeted countries say privately that it isnt always clear what the Trump administration wants from them in the negotiations.  Vice President JD Vance announced that India has agreed to the terms of trade talks with the United States, but other countries are still trying to set the contours for any negotiations. The White House has highlighted conflicting goals for its import taxes: Its seeking to raise revenues and bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but it also wants greater access to foreign markets and massive changes to other nations tax and regulatory policies. Here are several non-tariff areas the administration is targeting: 
        
     CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES Trump has accused Germany, China and Japan of global freeloading by  in his view  devaluing their currencies to make their exports cheaper.  The European Central bank has been cutting interest rates to support growth. That could also weaken the euro, which has strengthened sharply against the dollar since Trump took office. The ECB says it doesnt target the exchange rate.  In Japans case, the Bank of Japan has been gradually raising rates anyway after keeping them at zero or in negative territory for years, which should drive the yen up against the dollar. The U.S. dollar has fallen recently to 140-yen levels, down from about 160 yen last summer. Shrikant Kale, a strategist at Jefferies, believes the dollar will fall to 120 yen over the next 18 months. FARM PRODUCTS Agricultural safeguards against importing pests or health hazards have been a sticking point with U.S. trade partners for years. They include Japans restrictions on rice and potato imports, the EUs ban on hormone-treated beef or chlorine-disinfected chickens and Koreas ban on beef from cows more than 30 months old.  Yet changes face stiff political resistance from voters and farm lobbies in those countries. For years, U.S. potato growers have sought access to Japans potential $150 million market for table potatoes. Japan has engaged in talks but taken years simply to supply a list of concerns to U.S. negotiators. The delay is pure politics, intended to protect domestic growers, says National Potato Council CEO Kam Quarles. If Japanese politicians perceive the pain from Trumps tariffs might be worse than from their own potato growers, that makes it more likely to make a deal, Quarles said.  But if they perceive the pain domestically will be worse than the Trump administration can bring to them ... were going to be stuck where we are. Koreas beef restrictions started as a measure to keep out bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. The 30-month rule has been maintained in the wake of mass protests in 2008, even as the U.S. has become the largest beef exporter to Korea.  Its still politically controversial because of the scar at the time in 2008. I think the government will be very cautious, said Jaemin Lee, professor of law at Seoul National University and an expert on trade issues.  TAXATION Trump has railed against value-added tax as a burden to U.S. companies, although economists say this kind of tax is trade-neutral because it applies equally to imports and exports. Value-added tax, or VAT, is paid by the end purchaser at the cash register but differs from sales taxes in that it is calculated at each stage of the production process. Trumps view could mean higher tariffs for Europe, where individual countries levy VAT of 20% or more depending on the type of good, and for the more than 170 countries that use this kind of tax system. The U.S. is an outlier in that it doesnt use VAT; instead, individual states levy sales taxes. Theres little chance countries will change their tax systems for Trump. The EU for one has said VAT is off the table. The domestic taxation system has not been a conventional topic in trade negotiation because domestic taxation is directly related to national sovereignty or the domestic economic regime, trade expert Lee said. Its very hard to understand why VAT has become an important topic in the trade discussion. PRODUCT STANDARDS U.S. officials have complained about Japans non-recognition of U.S vehicle safety standards and its different testing procedures for car equipment.  Japan also provides subsidies for the Japanese-designed ChaDeMo plug standard for electric cars, requiring foreign makers to use an outdated technology if they want the subsidy.  BUREAUCRACY Concerns about excessive or baffling bureaucratic procedures to get goods into a country are mentioned repeatedly in the administrations latest trade assessment. The U.S. has complained about expensive delays getting permission to export seafood to Japan. Meanwhile, Japan requires wheat imports to be sold to a government entity and has highly regulated and intransparent quota system that keeps rice imports from the U.S. to a minimum. Most of these issues are years old, raising questions about whether 90 days is enough to make a deal over them.  U.S. pharmaceutical companies have complained about Koreas system for drug imports, while automakers say environmental equipment standards are unclear and expose only importers to criminal penalties in case of violations. BUY AMERICAN Analysts say that despite the long list of non-tariff issues, the administrations main focus may lie elsewhere: on Trumps desire to reduce trade deficits, cases where a country sells more to the U.S. than it buys. And the solution may be other countries buying more U.S. products, from energy to soybeans, and builingd more plants in the U.S.  U.S. energy is already a major export to Europe. Trump has mentioned a figure of $350 billion for potential EU gas imports. The EU does need imported gas. But Trumps figure would be a stretch given that last years exports of liquefied natural gas to the EU were around $13 billon, and that Europe is seeking to reduce its use of fossil fuels over the longer term. THE HEART OF THE MATTER? Discussions about non-tariff issues may simply be leverage to underpin Trumps stiff tariff levels.  Its just a thing thats there to justify my tariffs, said Tobias Gehrke, senior policy fellow at the European Council of Foreign Relations. While lower level trade officials and industry representatives are acutely aware of non-tariff issues like agricultural safety, Trump and his cabinet... dont really care about chlorinated chicken regulations in Europe and food standards, Gehrke said. They have much bigger thinking. They want to have European companies significantly move production to America... and to export from America to Europe. That would change the trade balance. And if thats the main logic, then theres no real deal to be had on non-tariff barriers. ___ Rugaber contributed from Washington DC and Kageyama from Tokyo.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-trade-war-tariffs-negotiations-f172b97761c1b4923df63e0beceb584b,business
Jackpot! How French police freed a cryptocurrency hostage whose finger was severed for ransom,"PARIS (AP)  Fearful that the kidnappers might sever another finger from their hostage or worse, the French police commander ordered his officers  with a radioed Go command  to raid the house where he suspected that the father of a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur was being held. Fabrice Gardon, director of Paris judicial police, then waited anxiously in his units headquarters in the north of the French capital for the code word they use to signal that a hostage has been freed. Finally, it came: Jackpot!  With seven suspects in custody, the police commander detailed in radio interviews Monday 58 hours of drama, mutilation and finally relief that marked the latest kidnapping in France of people working in the cryptocurrency business. The victim was the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, the prosecutors office said.  Attackers wearing balaclavas bundled him into a van as he was coming out of his Paris house to walk his dog last Thursday morning, Gardon said. He said bystanders alerted police. Speaking to RTL radio, he confirmed French media reports that the kidnappers severed one of the hostages fingers. He said they sent a video to his son of the mutilation and other video of his father tied up, and demanded millions of euros (dollars) in ransom. On Saturday night, police tracked the gang to a house in the Essonne region south of Paris, where investigators believed the man was being held.  
        
     We got there a few minutes before a new ultimatum where the victim might again have suffered another mutilation, Gardon said. He gave the go-ahead for an assault by a police Search and Intervention Brigade, known by its French initials, BRI. He then followed its progress over the radio from the judicial police headquarters. After a few moments, the head of the BRI said over the radio  using whats our code  Jackpot! In our jargon that means, All good. We have freed the hostage, he said on France Info radio.  Obviously, it was a big relief, he said. The prosecutors office said police detained four people in or close to the house where the man was held captive, and a fifth person at the wheel of a vehicle thought to have been used for the alleged abduction. Another two suspects were detained Sunday, it said. It said the police investigation is looking at an array of possible criminal charges, including kidnapping with torture or a barbaric act. In January, police said a co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, was also kidnapped with his wife from their home in the Cher region of central France. Police said they made 10 arrests and that the alleged kidnappers demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency from another of Ledgers co-founders. A raid by Frances elite National Gendarmerie Intervention Group unit that specializes in hostage situations freed Balland the next day, followed the day after that by the liberation, again by the GIGN, of his wife, found tied up in a vehicle, police said.",https://apnews.com/article/france-cryptocurrency-kidnapping-3bee45ffa10fa07dfe8ff4f339ec97e2,business
Europe launches a drive to attract scientists and researchers after Trump freezes US funding,"PARIS (AP)  The European Union launched a drive on Monday to attract scientists and researchers to Europe with offers of grants and new policy plans, after the Trump administration froze U.S. government funding linked to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. A few years ago, no one would have imagined that one of the biggest democracies in the world would cancel research programs under the pretext that the word diversity was in this program, French President Emmanuel Macron said at the Choose Europe for Science event in Paris. No one would have thought that one of the biggest democracies in the world would delete with a stroke the ability of one researcher or another to obtain visas, Macron said. But here we are. Taking the same stage at the Sorbonne University, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EUs executive branch would set up a super grant program aimed at offering a longer-term perspective to the very best in the field. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports the European Union has launched a drive to attract U.S. scientists and researchers to Europe. She said that 500 million euros ($566 million) will be put forward in 2025-2027 to make Europe a magnet for researchers. It would be injected into the European Research Council, which already has a budget of more than 16 billion euros ($18 billion) for 2021-2027. Von der Leyen said that the 27-nation EU intends to enshrine freedom of scientific research into law with a new legal act. As the threats rise across the world, Europe will not compromise on its principles, she said. 
        
     The White House responded by describing DEI as an inherently discriminatory policy. If the European Union wants to embrace policies that divide, rather than focus on real scientific discovery, they should not be surprised when U.S. innovation continues to outpace Europe, said spokesperson Anna Kelly. America will continue to attract and cultivate the best talent in science, research, and beyond.  Macron said that the French government would also soon make new proposals to beef up investment in science and research. Last month, hundreds of university researchers in the United States had National Science Foundation funding canceled to comply with U.S. President Donald Trumps order to end support to research on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the study of misinformation. More than 380 grant projects have been cut so far, including work to combat internet censorship in China and Iran and a project consulting with Indigenous communities to understand environmental changes in Alaskas Arctic region. Some terminated grants that sought to broaden the diversity of people studying science, technology and engineering. Scientists, researchers and doctors have taken to the streets in protest. While not mentioning the Trump administration by name, von der Leyen said that it was a gigantic miscalculation to undermine free and open research. We can all agree that science has no passport, no gender, no ethnicity, no political party, she said. We believe that diversity is an asset of humanity and the lifeblood of science. It is one of the most valuable global assets and it must be protected. Von der Leyens drive to promote opportunities in Europe in the field of science and take advantage of U.S. policy shifts dovetails with the way that she has played up the potential for trade deals with other countries since Trump took office in January and sparked a tariff war last month. The former German defense minister, and trained doctor, vowed that the EU would also address some of the roadblocks that scientists and researchers face, notably excessive red tape and access to businesses. Macron said that science and research must not be based on the diktats of the few. Macron said that Europe must become a refuge for scientists and researchers, and he said to those who feel under threat elsewhere: The message is simple. If you like freedom, come and help us to remain free, to do research here, to help us become better, to invest in our future. ___ Lorne Cook reported from Brussels.

Thousands of machinists union members go on strike at jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney,"EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)  About 3,000 labor union members went on strike early Monday at jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut, as negotiations over wages, retirement benefits and job security broke down. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were picketing at manufacturing locations in East Hartford and Middletown, after about 77% of nearly 2,100 union members voted to approve their first strike since 2001, union officials said. Their contract expired late Sunday. Pratt and Whitney is a powerhouse in military and commercial aerospace products because our membership makes it so, David Sullivan, the unions eastern territory vice president, said in a statement. This offer does not address the membership concerns, and the membership made their decision  we will continue to fight for a fair contract. Picketing workers lined and crossed streets near the entrances to the East Hartford and Middletown plants on a rainy Monday morning. Many of the signs said I am on strike! against Pratt & Whitney, while some read Solidarity for Security and Together We Rise. Some workers said they were concerned that the company may move jobs and manufacturing out of the state to its plants in Georgia. Theyre not giving us job security. We need time to be here, union member Scott Westberg told WFSB-TV. We want to be in Connecticut a long time. Theyre trying to deteriorate the middle class, which is what we are. We are the blue collar. 
        
     The company, a subsidiary of Arlington, Virginia-based RTX Corp., called its latest wage and retirement proposal competitive, and said its workforce is among the most highly compensated in the region and industry. AP correspondent Mike Hempen reports thousands of machinists have gone on strike. Our message to union leaders throughout this thoughtful process has been simple: higher pay, better retirement savings, more days off and more flexibility, the company said in a statement. We have no immediate plans to resume negotiations at this time and we have contingency plans in place to maintain operations and to meet our customer commitments. The strike comes as RTX faces a potential $850 million hit on profits this year because of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, if the tariff rates remain the same through the year. During its first-quarter earnings call on April 22, the company said its Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace subsidiaries would each shoulder just over $400 million of the potential tariffs hit. RTX is predicting $83 billion to $84 billion in adjusted sales companywide in 2025. The companys first-quarter earnings were $1.5 billion. Pratt & Whitneys adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $590 million. The company said its latest contract proposal included an immediate 4% wage increase, followed by a 3.5% increase in 2026 and a 3% increase in 2027. It also included a $5,000 contract ratification bonus and enhanced pension and 401k plan benefits. Pratt & Whitney makes engines for commercial and military jets, including the GTF line for Airbus commercial jets and the F135 for the militarys F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft fleet. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, both Democrats, issued a statement urging the company and union to continue negotiating. Members of Connecticuts all-Democratic congressional delegation and Democratic state lawmakers said they were supporting the union workers.",https://apnews.com/article/pratt-whitney-strike-machinists-jet-engines-95ee9e2f9854f4b4dde24f2db1bb7bd1,business
"In a trade-war whirlwind, shoemaker Skechers is sold for $9 billion to become a private company","The shoe company Skechers is being acquired for more than $9 billion to be taken private by the investment firm by 3G Capital.  The deal comes amid growing uncertainty over how U.S. President Donald Trumps tariffs on foreign goods will affect companies who make their products overseas, particularly in China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.  The offer of $63 per share represents a premium of 30% to Skechers 15-day volume-weighted average stock price. The deal was unanimously approved by Skechers board.  Skechers shares jumped nearly 25% Monday, to $61.56. In a press release announcing the deal, the companies did not mention the potential impacts of Trumps tariffs on its business going forward. However, Skechers says that about two-thirds of its revenue comes from sales outside of the U.S. China accounts for 15% of the companys revenue, according to the data firm FactSet. The deal comes at a precarious time with Trumps ongoing, on-again-off-again tariff announcements. Like many other companies increasingly have done since Trumps widespread tariff announcements, Skechers did not issue guidance when it released its first quarter earnings in April. Chief Financial Officer John Vandemore told investors that the current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success. Executives also said they would be looking to minimize products going to the U.S. from high-cost locations, including the impact of tariffs. The company did not immediately provide a breakdown of foreign production, but many of their shoes come with a Made in China stamp. 
        
     Trump raised the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% in early April, hours after China boosted the duty on American goods to 84% in an escalating battle that threatens to disrupt trade between the worlds two largest economies. Skechers executives said last month that the company had several levers it could pull to deal with tariffs, including cost sharing with vendors, sourcing optimization, and price adjustments.  Were looking at how we optimize the global cost of tariffs in all markets when we look to move production around, Vandemore said last month. Obviously, with an effective tariff rate at about 159%, products from China to the U.S. are prohibitively expensive. Skechers has about 5,300 retail stores worldwide, about 1,800 company-owned. About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs. When the deal closes, the company will be led by Skechers Chairman and CEO Robert Greenberg and his management team. Its headquarters will remain in Manhattan Beach, California, where it was founded more than three decades ago. Skechers reported a record $9 billion in revenue in 2024 with net earnings of $640 million.  The deal with 3G Capital is expected to close in the third quarter this year.",https://apnews.com/article/skechers-shoes-acquisition-private-3g-capital-00a1a3479cfc9015ec631fbe249bae4c,business
Sunoco buys Canadian gas and convenience store chain Parkland for about $9.1 billion,"Sunoco is buying Canadas gas station and convenience store chain Parkland in a cash-and-stock deal valued at approximately $9.1 billion, expanding its footprint north of the border.  Parkland has approximately 4,000 locations across Canada, the United States, and the Caribbean. Sunoco has gas and convenience store locations in more than 40 states, Puerto Rico, Europe, and Mexico.  Parkland Corp. shareholders will receive 0.295 SunCorp units and $19.80 Canadian ($14.34) for each Parkland share they own. Theres also an option for Parkland shareholders to choose to receive $44.00 Canadian ($31.86) per Parkland share in cash or 0.536 SunCorp units for each share. The deal also includes the assumption of debt. Parkland announced in March that its board was looking at strategic options for the company. It was at that point that talks with Sunoco significantly intensified, Parkland said.  Parkland will keep its headquarters in Calgary. Sunoco will also continue to invest in Parklands Burnaby refinery, which produces low-carbon fuels.  The deal is expected to close during the second half of the year. It is subject to shareholder and court approvals. The transaction is also subject to certain regulatory approvals, including approvals under the Investment Canada Act, and approval of the listing of the SunCorp shares to be issued under the transaction on the New York Stock Exchange. Parkland will hold a special shareholders meeting on June 24 to vote on the transaction.  If the deal doesnt close, Parkland would have to pay a $275 million break up fee, under certain circumstances.

"Grand Theft Auto VI delayed again, this time until May 2026","BOSTON (AP)  Fans of the hugely popular video game series Grand Theft Auto will have to wait a little longer to play the latest version. In a post on X Friday, Rockstar Games said it delayed the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI until May 26, 2026. It apologized for the delay of a game, the release of which has been talked about for several years. It didnt provide any specifics on why the release date has been pushed back from fall of this year. With every game we have released, the goal has been to try and exceed your expectations and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception, the company said in a statement. We hope you understand we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve. Shares of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstars parent company, fell Friday by nearly 7%.  Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, stood by Rockstar in a statement and said it supports the company taking additional time to realize their creative vision. He said it still expects a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations. While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence, Zelnick said in a statement. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders. Fans of the game reacted to the delay with disappointment but also a shrug -- since it has been suggested the game would be released in 2024 and then this year.  
        
     On a Reddit discussion forum dedicated to the game, several fans noted they had seen this before and wouldnt be surprised if the release was delayed again. Others took a more optimistic tone, saying an exact release date means it will actually happen this time around. One of the last times the game garnered this much buzz was in 2023, when a trailer for the game was leaked online. At the time, Rockstar released the first look of the sixth game 15 hours earlier than planned, citing the leak. That 90-second trailer gave fans a taste of what comes next for the game. The trailer suggested the next installment would be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and star a female protagonist, a first for the franchise, named Lucia. It is unclear whether the delay means any, or all, of these details will remain part of Grand Theft Auto VI.",https://apnews.com/article/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-games-9c1be2401e76cac72099ef02347ed1b9,business
Warren Buffetts best and worst investments in his 60 years leading Berkshire Hathaway,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said Saturday that he wants to step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. The revelation came as a surprise because the 94-year-old had previously said he did not plan to retire.  Buffett, one of the worlds richest people and most accomplished investors, took control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 when it was a textiles manufacturer. He turned the company into a conglomerate by finding other businesses and stocks to buy that were selling for less than they were worth.  His success made him a Wall Street icon. It also earned him the nickname Oracle of Omaha, a reference to the Nebraska city where Buffett was born and chose to live and work.  Here are some of his best and worst investments over the years:   National Indemnity and National Fire & Marine: Purchased in 1967, the company was one of Buffetts first insurance investments. Insurance float  the premium money insurers can invest between the time when policies are bought and when claims are made  provided the capital for many of Berkshires investments over the years and helped fuel the companys growth. Berkshires insurance division has grown to include Geico, General Reinsurance and several other insurers. The float totaled $173 billion at the end of the first quarter.   Buying blocks of stock in American Express, Coca-Cola Co. and Bank of America at times when the companies were out of favor because of scandals or market conditions. Collectively, the shares are worth over $100 billion more than what Buffett paid for them, and that doesnt count all the dividends he has collected over the years.   Apple: Buffett long said that he didnt understand tech companies well enough to value them and pick the long-term winners, but he started buying Apple shares in 2016. He later explained that he bought more than $31 billion worth because he understood the iPhone maker as a consumer products company with extremely loyal customers. The value of his investment grew to more than $174 billion before Buffett started selling Berkshire Hathaways shares.  
        
      BYD: On the advice of his late investing partner Charlie Munger, Buffett bet big on the genius of BYD founder Wang Chanfu in 2008 with a $232 million investment in the Chinese electric vehicle maker. The value of that stake soared to more than $9 billion before Buffett began selling it off. Berkshires remaining stake is still worth about $1.8 billion.  Sees Candy: Buffett repeatedly pointed to his 1972 purchase as a turning point in his career. Buffett said Munger persuaded him that it made sense to buy great businesses at good prices as long as they had enduring competitive advantages. Previously, Buffett had primarily invested in companies of any quality as long as they were selling for less than he thought they were worth. Berkshire paid $25 million for Sees and recorded pretax earnings of $1.65 billion from the candy company through 2011. The amount continued to grow but Buffett didnt routinely highlight it.  Berkshire Hathaway Energy: Utilities provide a large and steady stream of profits for Berkshire. The conglomerate paid $2.1 billion, or about $35.05 per share, for Des Moines-based MidAmerican Energy in 2000. The utility unit subsequently was renamed and made several acquisitions, including PacifiCorp and NV Energy. The utilities added more than $3.7 billion to Berkshires profit in 2024, although Buffett has said they are now worth less than they used to be because of the liability they face related to wildfires.  Berkshire Hathaway: Buffett had said his investment in the Berkshire Hathaway textile mills was probably his worst investment ever. The textile company he took over in 1965 bled money for many years before Buffett finally shut it down in 1985, though Berkshire did provide cash for some of Buffetts early acquisitions. Of course, the Berkshire shares Buffett began buying for $7 and $8 a share in 1962 are now worth $809,350 per share, so even Buffetts worst investment turned out OK.  Dexter Shoe Co.: Buffett said he made an awful blunder by buying Dexter in 1993 for $433 million, a mistake made even worse because he used Berkshire stock for the deal. Buffett says he essentially gave away 1.6% of Berkshire for a worthless business.   Missed opportunities. Buffett said that some of his worst mistakes over the years were the investments and deals that he didnt make. Berkshire easily could have made billions if Buffett had been comfortable investing in Amazon, Google or Microsoft early on. But it wasnt just tech companies he missed out on. Buffett told shareholders he was caught sucking his thumb when he failed to follow through on a plan to buy 100 million Walmart shares that would be worth nearly $10 billion today.  Selling banks too soon. Not long before the COVID pandemic, Buffett seemed to sour on most of his bank stocks. Repeated scandals involving Wells Fargo gave him a reason to start unloading his 500 million shares, many of them for around $30 per share. But he also sold off his JP Morgan stake at prices less than $100. Both stocks have more than doubled since then.  Blue Chip Stamps: Buffett and Munger, Berkshires former vice chairman, took control of Blue Chip in 1970 when the customer rewards program was generating $126 million in sales. But as trading stamps fell out of favor with retailers and consumers, sales steadily declined; in 2006, they totaled a mere $25,920. However, Buffett and Munger used the float that Blue Chip generated to acquire Sees Candy, Wesco Financial and Precision Castparts, which are all steady contributors to Berkshire.",https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-billionaire-berkshire-hathaway-investor-738682bbc8f420889fc4adee92fef3ca,business
Kidnappers in France target cryptocurrency entrepreneurs for ransom,"PARIS (AP)  French police rescued the father of a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur in a nighttime raid after he was taken hostage for ransom, the latest alleged criminal effort in France to extort people involved in the management of digital assets. The man was kidnapped Thursday morning in Paris, the prosecutors office said Sunday. The victim turned out to be the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, and the incident was accompanied by a ransom demand, its statement said, without giving their names or other specifics about their identities. Police investigators located the hostage in a house in the Essonne region south of Paris, from which he was rescued on Saturday night, the prosecutors office said.  It said he was treated for injuries but gave no details. French media reported that the alleged hostage-takers cut off one of the mans fingers.  Police detained 5 people  four were in or close to the house where the man was held captive, while the fifth was at the wheel of a vehicle thought to have been used for the alleged abduction, the prosecutors office said.

"Dow drops 1,600 as US stocks lead worldwide sell-off after Trumps tariffs cause a COVID-like shock","NEW YORK (AP)  Wall Street shuddered, and a level of shock unseen since COVIDs outbreak tore through financial markets worldwide Thursday on worries about the damage President Donald Trumps newest set of tariffs could do to economies across continents, including his own. The S&P 500 sank 4.8%, more than in major markets across Asia and Europe, for its worst day since the pandemic crashed the economy in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,679 points, or 4%, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 6%. 
        
     Little was spared in financial markets as fear flared about the potentially toxic mix of weakening economic growth  and higher inflation  that tariffs can create.  Everything from crude oil to Big Tech stocks to the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies fell. Even gold, which hit records recently  as investors sought something safer to own, pulled lower. Some of the worst hits walloped smaller U.S. companies, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 6.6% to pull more than 20% below its record.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Investors worldwide knew Trump was going to announce a sweeping set of tariffs late Wednesday, and fears surrounding it had already pulled Wall Streets main measure of health, the S&P 500 index, 10% below its all-time high. But Trump still managed to surprise them with the worst case scenario for tariffs, according to Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment officer at Sanctuary Wealth.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Trump announced a minimum tariff of 10% on imports, with the tax rate running much higher on products from certain countries like China and those from the European Union. Its plausible the tariffs altogether, which would rival levels unseen in roughly a century, could knock down U.S. economic growth by 2 percentage points this year and raise inflation close to 5%, according to UBS.  
        
     Such a hit would be so big that it makes ones rational mind regard the possibility of them sticking as low, according to Bhanu Baweja and other strategists at UBS.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Robert Greason works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Thursday, April 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Trump has previously said tariffs could cause a little disturbance in the economy and markets, and on Thursday he again downplayed the impact as he left the White House to fly to Florida.  The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom and the country is going to boom, Trump said. Tariffs sent stocks tumbling. The APs Seth Sutel has more.  Wall Street had long assumed Trump would use tariffs merely as a tool for negotiations with other countries, rather than as a long-term policy. But Wednesdays announcement may suggest Trump sees tariffs more as helping to solve an ideological goal than as an opening bet in a poker game. Trump on Wednesday talked about wresting manufacturing jobs back to the United States, a process that could take years.  If Trump follows through on his tariffs, stock prices may need to fall much more than 10% from their all-time high in order to reflect the recession that could follow, along with the hit to profits that U.S. companies could take. The S&P 500 is now down 11.8% from its record set in February.  A trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Thursday, April 3, 2025.

     Trump offered an upbeat reaction after he was asked about the markets drop as he left the White House to fly to his Florida golf club on Thursday. I think its going very well, he said. We have an operation, like when a patient gets operated on and its a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Thursday, April 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) One wild card is that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in order to support the economy. Thats what it had been doing late last year before pausing in 2025. Lower interest rates help by making it easier for U.S. companies and households to borrow and spend. Yields on Treasurys tumbled in part on rising expectations for coming cuts to rates, along with general fear about the health of the U.S. economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.04% from 4.20% late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80% in January. Thats a huge move for the bond market. The Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like, though. While lower rates can goose the economy, they can also push upward on inflation. And worries are already worsening about that because of tariffs, with U.S. households in particular bracing  for sharp increases to their bills. The U.S. economy at the moment is still growing, of course. A report on Thursday said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. Economist had been expecting to see an uptick in joblessness, and a relatively solid job market has been the linchpin keeping the economy out of recession.  A separate report said activity for U.S. transportation, finance and other businesses in the services industry grew last month. But the growth was weaker than expected, and businesses gave a mixed picture of how they see conditions. Worries about a potentially stagnating economy and high inflation knocked down all kinds of stocks, leading to drops for four out of every five that make up the S&P 500.  Best Buy fell 17.8% because the electronics that it sells are made all over the world. United Airlines lost 15.6% because customers worried about the global economy may not fly as much for business or feel comfortable enough to take vacations. Target tumbled 10.9% amid worries that its customers, already squeezed by still-high inflation, may be under even more stress.  All told, the S&P 500 fell. 274.45 points to 5,396.52 The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1,679.39 to 40,545.93, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 1,050.44 to 16,550.61. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell sharply worldwide. Frances CAC 40 dropped 3.3%, and Germanys DAX lost 3% in Europe. Japans Nikkei 225 sank 2.8%, Hong Kongs Hang Seng lost 1.5% and South Koreas Kospi dropped 0.8%. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott, Elaine Kurtenbach and Darlene Superville contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-tariffs-52dbb020a4c41122e31669c2da236d67,business
Federal Reserve chief says Trump tariffs likely to raise inflation and slow US economic growth,"ARLINGTON, Va. (AP)  The Trump administrations expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth for the U.S. economy, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday.  Powell said that the tariffs, and their likely impacts on the economy and inflation, are significantly larger than expected. He also said that the import taxes will probably lead to at least a temporary rise in inflation, but added that it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.  Our obligation is to ... make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem, Powell said in remarks delivered to a conference of the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing.  Powells focus on inflation suggests that the Fed will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% in the coming months, rather than cut them anytime soon. Higher borrowing costs can help slow the economy and cool inflation. Wall Street investors, meanwhile, now expect five interest rate cuts this year, a number that has increased since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs Wednesday.  AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the Federal Reserves chairman predicting the economic impacts of the new tariffs. Powell also emphasized that the full impact of the tariffs on the economy arent yet clear, and the Fed will stay on the sidelines until it has more clarity about the economy. He acknowledged that many businesses have said they are holding off on new investments until they get a better sense of the tariffs impact. Theres a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us, Powell said during a question and answer session. And that just seems like the right thing to do in this period of uncertainty. 
        
     Trump, separately, urged Powell to cut rates, citing lower inflation and energy prices on his social media platform, Truth Social.  This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates, Trump wrote. CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS! Economists expect that the tariffs will weaken the economy, possibly threaten hiring, and push up prices. In that scenario, the Fed could cut rates to bolster the economy, or it could keep rates unchanged  or even hike them  to combat inflation. Powells comments suggest the Fed will mostly focus on inflation.  Powells remarks come two days after Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs that have upended the global economy, prompted retaliatory moves by China, and sent stock prices in the U.S. and overseas plunging.  Powells description of the impact of tariffs was more negative than just last month, when he said that any inflation resulting from the tariffs would likely be temporary.  Weaker growth and higher prices are a tricky combination for the Fed. Typically the central bank would reduce its key interest rate to lower borrowing costs and spur the economy in the event of slower growth, while it would raise rates  or keep them elevated  to slow spending and combat inflation.  The Fed is in a tough spot with inflation set to accelerate and the economy poised to slow, said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.  The Fed is required by law to seek maximum employment and price stability, which it defines as yearly inflation of 2%. Powell acknowledged that the tariffs, which could cause job losses and raise prices, could make both those goals harder to achieve.  The two goals ... are in tension  or they may be, he said.  Powell said the economy and hiring remain solid, for now, but he noted that consumers and businesses have become more pessimistic about the future. He also said inflation has fallen sharply from its peak in 2022, but said that recently progress toward the central banks 2% target has slowed. Some positive news arrived Friday when the government reported that hiring accelerated in March, with 228,000 jobs added, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%.  Yet those figures measure hiring in mid-March, before the scope of the duties became clear. The tariffs have also raised uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the coming months, which could limit businesses willingness to invest and hire.",https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-inflation-economy-trump-powell-490417656971634592bbeb3b2ade3593,business
US stocks dip after careening through a manic day following Trumps latest tariff threat,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks careened through a manic Monday after President Donald Trump threatened to crank his tariffs higher, despite a stunning display showing how dearly Wall Street wants him to do the opposite.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% at the end of a day full of heart-racing reversals as battered financial markets try to figure out what Trumps ultimate goal is for his trade war. If its to get other countries to agree to trade deals, he could lower his tariffs and avoid a possible recession. But if its to remake the economy and stick with tariffs for the long haul, stock prices may need to fall further. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349 points, or 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by 0.1%.  All three indexes started the day sharply lower, and the Dow plunged as many as 1,700 points following even worse losses elsewhere in the world. But it suddenly surged to a gain of nearly 900 points in the late morning. The S&P 500, meanwhile, went from a loss of 4.7% to a leap of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years.  The sudden rise followed a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs, one that a White House account on X  quickly labeled as fake news. That a rumor could move trillions of dollars worth of investments shows how much investors are hoping to see signs that Trump may let up on tariffs. Stocks quickly turned back down, and shortly afterward, Trump dug in further and said he may raise tariffs more against China  after the worlds second-largest economy retaliated last week  with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products.  
        
     Its a slap in the face to Wall Street because it suggests Trump may not care how much pain he inflicts on the market. Many professional investors had long thought that a president who used to crow about records reached under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent the Dow reeling. On Sunday Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasnt concerned about a sell-off and that sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. Trump has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years. Trump on Sunday said he wanted to bring down the numbers for how much more the United States imports from other countries versus how much it sends to them.  Indexes nevertheless did keep swinging between losses and gains Monday after Trumps latest tariff threat, in part because hope still remains in markets that negotiations may still come. Were not calling the all-clear at all, but when you have this type of volatility in the market, of course youre going to have back and forth in markets not just day to day but also hour to hour, said Nate Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management.  Were all waiting for the next bit of information, he said. Literally a Truth Social tweet or an announcement of some sort about real negotiations could dramatically move this market. This is the world we live in right now. All that seemed certain Monday was the financial pain hammering investments around the world for a third day after Trump announced tariffs in his Liberation Day.  Stocks in Hong Kong  plunged 13.2% for their worst day since 1997. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped below $60 during the morning for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel. Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week. Trumps tariffs are an attack on the globalization thats remade the worlds economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries. It also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero by slashing interest rates to protect the economy during every downturn. But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because inflation remains higher than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation. The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, wrote in his annual letter to shareholders Monday. Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth. In the bond market, Treasury yields rallied to recover some of their sharp drops from earlier weeks. Some of the big move may have been because of reduced expectations for cuts to interest rates by the Fed. Some analysts also said it could be due to investors outside of the United States wanting to pare their U.S. investments.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.20% from 4.01% late Friday.  Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 briefly fell more than 20% below its record set less than two months ago. If it finishes a day below that bar, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A bear market signifies a downturn thats moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10% drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious.  The S&P 500, which sits at the heart of many investors 401(k) accounts, is coming off its worst week since COVID  began crashing the global economy in March 2020. All told, the index fell 11.83 points Monday to 5,062.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 349.26 to 37,965.60, and the Nasdaq composite added 15.48 to 15,603.26. ___ Kurtenbach reported from Bangkok. McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.

Will the tariffs lead to a recession? Heres how to know if were in one,"WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trumps sharp tariff hikes last week have sent the stock market into a tailspin, raised alarm bells among Wall Street executives, and heightened many economists worries that the U.S. could tip into recession.  The tariffs, set to take effect Wednesday, include a 10% blanket duty on nearly all countries and additional import taxes on 60 nations. The increases are so large and are taking effect so rapidly that they are likely to be disruptive to the economy, economists say, even if they are partially rolled back through negotiations in the coming weeks or months.  Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession  where the economy shrinks and unemployment rises  to 45%, from 35% last week. And even that forecast assumes many of the duties are negotiated away or reduced. If not, we expect to change our forecast to a recession, Jan Hatzius, Goldmans chief economist, and his colleagues said in an analyst note.  Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently.  Should the tariffs remain in place for an extended period, they will likely raise costs and uncertainty for businesses, which could reduce their willingness to hire, invest in new equipment or software, or expand into new markets. Americans could cut back on their spending in the face of higher prices. The economy could start to shrink, after expanding 2.8% in 2024.  
        
     So far, most measures of the economy, such as job gains, remain solid. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, the government reported last week, and layoffs remain historically low.  Still, surveys show consumers and businesses are increasingly worried about the economic outlook. What everyone from Wall Street investors to economists to officials at the Federal Reserve will be watching closely is whether those concerns lead to a downturn.  Here are some questions and answers about recessions: Not yet. But one development that has sparked widespread fear is a real-time economy tracker maintained by the Federal Reserves Atlanta branch. It now indicates that the economy could shrink by 0.8% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4% in last years final quarter.  The Atlanta Feds tracker is not technically a forecast but instead a running tally that is updated as economic data is released.  Typically, a recession occurs when some short of shock hits the economy, such as the pandemic in 2020, or the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007. Its not yet clear that tariffs will have a large enough impact to knock the economy into reverse.  But economists at Wells Fargo, in a note on Friday, calculated that the average U.S. tariff would jump tenfold to about 23% when all the duties are in place, the highest since 1908. Such a shift practically overnight will throw sand in the gears of global supply chains in ways that we have not seen since the pandemic and perhaps since World War II, Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, wrote.  On Sunday, Trump told reporters that sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. Yet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the same day said there doesnt have to be a recession and that the administration is focused on building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. The governments weekly report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, which is released every Thursday, is being closely watched for signs of rising layoffs. So far, applications for aid remain quite low by historical standards.  Torsten Slok, chief economist for Apollo, an asset management firm, is watching a range of real-time data and sees some signs the economy is weakening. The number of people filing for bankruptcy has risen, while visits to Las Vegas have declined a bit. Weekly visits to movie theaters this year are below their levels in recent years, he said.  The Trump administration is plowing ahead with widespread job cuts in federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, and says it will cut government spending. Both could weigh on the economy, at least in the short run.  And even if some of the tariffs imposed April 2 are pulled back or reduced, the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administrations trade policies are likely to discourage spending by businesses or consumers. Its unclear, for example, whether companies will build more factories in the U.S.  as the tariffs are intended to encourage  if they dont know how long the tariffs will last.  Another factor could be overseas boycotts of U.S. goods and travel. Slok has noted that airline bookings data point to a 70% drop in trips from Canada to the U.S. in the next six months. While the effect on the overall economy is likely to be minor, Goldman Sachs estimates such changes could shave 0.2 percentage points off growth this year.  Many economists now expect the Fed will cut their key interest rate at their meeting in June and implement at least three reductions this year.  But the Fed is in a difficult position: With inflation seemingly stuck above its target of 2%, even before the tariffs take effect, the central bank would typically want to keep borrowing costs high to slow spending and cool inflation.  Yet if tariffs weaken the economy and lead to job losses, the Fed would normally slash its key rate to stimulate borrowing and spending. Since tariffs could worsen inflation, however, it is unlikely to do so until there are clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown.  They cant really be proactive here because they do have inflation to worry about, said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. What were looking at is a Fed that is going to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. On Friday, Chair Jerome Powell said the tariffs could worsen inflation and added that the Feds main obligation was to keep prices in check. His comments suggested the Fed will likely stay on the sidelines at its next meeting in May.  Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists whose Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months. The committee considers trends in hiring. It also assesses many other data points, including gauges of income, employment, inflation-adjusted spending, retail sales and factory output. It assigns heavy weight to a measure of inflation-adjusted income that excludes government support payments like Social Security. Yet the organization typically doesnt declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes as long as a year afterward.",https://apnews.com/article/recession-tariffs-economy-inflation-5a24ff198dcd6813b53f44c662354b6a,business
What to know about this years Social Security cost-of-living adjustment,"NEW YORK (AP)  Tens of millions of older Americans will see an increase in benefits this January when a new cost-of-living adjustment is added to Social Security payments. The 2.5% raise is intended to help meet higher prices for food, fuel, and other goods and services. The average recipient will see an increase of about $50 per month, according to agency officials. Social Security recipients received a 3.2% increase in their benefits in 2024, and some retirees are concerned that this years increase is not big enough to meet their needs.  The Social Security Administration will begin notifying recipients about their new benefit amount by mail starting in early December. Adjusted payments to nearly 7.5 million people receiving Supplemental Security Income will begin on December 31. Supplemental Security Income provides monthly payments to adults and children who have income below specific financial limits and qualify to receive Social Security benefits.  Heres what to keep in mind: About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, get Social Security benefits. The program is funded by taxes on income subject to Social Security payroll taxes. The government uses taxes from working people to pay benefits to people who have already retired, people who are disabled, the survivors of workers who have died, and dependents of beneficiaries. In 2025, the Social Security payroll tax will be assessed on the first $176,100 of income, up from $168,600 this year While the money is used to pay people currently receiving benefits, any unused money goes to the Social Security trust fund. Some of the money in the trust, together with the Social Security contributions of people in the workforce, pays for future benefits. To determine what amount of Social Security youll receive, the government calculates a percentage of your highest wages from your top 35 years of earning, factoring in when you choose to start receiving benefits. 
        
     The COLA is calculated according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, but there are calls to use a different index  one that measures price changes based on the spending patterns of the elderly  like healthcare, food and medicine costs. The smaller increase for 2025 is because inflation is slowing. That means prices arent increasing as fast as they were at the height of the COVID pandemic. Recipients got a historically large 8.7% benefit increase in 2023 because of record high inflation.  Future problems with the fund have long been predicted, largely because of demographic shifts. As birthrates decline, fewer people become workers, which results in fewer payments of payroll taxes. Meanwhile, more Baby Boomers are retiring and collecting Social Security. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in May said the programs trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. If the trust fund is depleted, the government will be able to pay only 83% of scheduled benefits, the report said. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Why you shouldnt store your money in payment apps,"NEW YORK (AP)  Connor Tomasko grew up wary of credit cards. As she taught herself more about managing money, she realized that many people also have bad habits when it comes to payment apps. Tomasko, 31, a freelance software consultant in Chicago, understands why people appreciate the ease of the apps, which typically only require you to know someones username in order to send money. But she realized that keeping money in the apps could be risky and means losing out on the interest from a high yield savings account. She now immediately transfers any payments out of the apps and encourages friends to do the same. Im definitely the one that is always harping about high yield savings accounts, Tomasko said. But if youre in an industry dealing with a lot of cash  bartending, say  sometimes youre just worried about finding a place to deposit it. Its not always a fun thing to talk about. As use of payment apps has grown in recent years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued guidance on best practices to avoid pitfalls. For example, funds stored on Venmo or Cash App typically lack the deposit insurance youd get from a bank, except in certain cases.  Popular digital payment apps are increasingly used as substitutes for a traditional bank or credit union account, but lack the same protections to ensure that funds are safe, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a bulletin last year. 
        
     In 2022, transaction volume on these apps was an estimated $893 billion, according to the CFPB, and thats projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2027. More than three-quarters of US adults say they have ever used one of four popular payment apps, according to a 2022 survey from the Pew Research Center. Of consumers ages 18 to 29, 85% said theyve used a service such as PayPal, Venmo, Apple Cash, Google Pay, or Zelle, according to a March 2022 study by Consumer Reports. The apps are popular because you dont have to give your personal information, like a phone number, if you just got drinks with someone once but youre never going to see them again  a date that didnt go well, Tomasko said. I get the benefits in that sense  to be able to send money that way. Heres what you should know: It may be tempting to leave money sitting in peer-to-peer lending accounts so that youre ready to pay your friends when they request money to cover your portion of a dinner bill... (but) there are a few reasons why we wouldnt suggest doing that, said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma. Funds stored in payment apps often lack deposit insurance, the CFPB has found. FDIC-insured banks protect depositors against the loss of their insured deposits up to at least $250,000 if a bank fails, and a similar framework protects credit unions. While funds stored on payment apps resemble funds stored on deposit accounts, those funds are not typically covered until they have been transferred back to an FDIC-insured bank or insured credit union. The Financial Technology Association, an industry group that includes many payment apps as members, noted that Cash App and PayPal both offer separate high-yield, FDIC-insured savings products. In select circumstances, deposit insurance does cover payment apps. With Cash App, funds are eligible for insurance if consumers link their account to a Cash App debit card. And with Venmo, funds added to an account via direct deposit or check cashing are covered. Still, the CFPB has found that funds stored in a payment app may be at significantly higher risk of loss for a consumer than if it is deposited in an insured bank or credit union account. Consumers should be aware of these risks if they choose to leave a balance on these nonbank payment apps, the agency wrote in its report last year. To minimize risks, the CFPB said consumers should transfer their balances back to federally insured accounts.  Some payment app companies are able to invest users funds in loans and bonds, earning money on the investments while generally paying no interest on users balances, the CFPB found. To maximize your own funds, immediately transfer any deposits to an account where you can collect interest. Leaving money sitting in those accounts is leaving potential interest from a high-yield savings account on the table, said Alev. All of that interest adds up over time, so your money could be growing elsewhere. Tomasko said she always uses the 1-3 business day option to transfer funds when using Venmo, to avoid incurring fees, while Cash App has a setting that users can select to automatically route money back to their bank accounts, which she uses. Theres definitely room for improvement in the space, she said. With Venmo, every time I receive a payment, I go in to actively transfer it out. The Financial Technology Association said in a statement that tens of millions of Americans use payment apps every day to send money to friends and family, cover routine expenses, and manage their finances.  Consumers choose these apps because they are safe, convenient, and transparent, said FTA CEO and President Penny Lee. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the name of Apples peer-to-peer payment app. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"JPMorgan logs Q1 profit of $14.6 billion as CEO warns of uncertainty over global trade, other events","NEW YORK (AP)  JPMorgans net income rose 9% to $14.6 billion in the first quarter and the New York bank beat Wall Streets profit and revenue targets, but its chief executive warned of global economic uncertainties ahead due to President Donald Trumps ongoing trade war and other geopolitical tensions. CEO Jamie Dimon said a strong performance by the banks markets division helped lift it to another strong quarter, but he added trade tensions to his list of potential negatives facing the bank and broader economy.  JPMorgans earnings per share rose to $5.07 per share from $4.44 a year ago. The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.63 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $46 billion, up from the $41.9 billion a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $44 billion. Trumps herky-jerky tariff increases  currently bumped up by 10% for most U.S. trading partners and 145% for China  have sent financial markets into dizzying fluctuations for weeks and created an enormous amount of uncertainty about where the global economy is headed. Thats bad for banks, which thrive on stability and healthy consumers and businesses borrowing money.  JPMorgans trading desk thrived in the first three months of 2025, helped by the markets volatility, which began well before Trump rolled out his massive Liberation Day tariffs on April 2. The banks markets revenue rose 21% in the period, with equities revenue up 48% from a year ago. 
        
     Consumer and community banking revenue rose 4% from the same period last year, to $18.3 billion. With regard to China, which further escalated its tariffs on imports from the U.S. to 125%, JPMorgan executives said it was too early to make any long-term projections or statements about the impact of the ongoing trade war on its business there. We really have to see how things play out, said Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. In the near term, that business is performing fine and we are not seeing any effect. JPMorgan set aside $3.3 billion to cover bad loans, up from $1.9 billion a year ago, while repurchasing $7 billion of common stock and boosting its dividend 12%. JPMorgan shares rose 2% in morning trading, while broader Wall Street indexes shifted between small losses and gains and were, so far, absent of the wild swings theyve seen in recent weeks. Investment bank Morgan Stanley also beat Wall Streets first-quarter projections. The New York bank also cited a strong performance from its equities trading division, helping boost its net income to $4.3 billion and revenue to a record $17.7 billion. Its shares were down 1.6%. Wells Fargo also reported early Friday, with the San Francisco bank posting first-quarter net income of $4.89 billion, or $1.39 per share. That topped analysts forecast for earnings of $1.23 per share. In a statement, CEO Charles Scharf said: We support the administrations willingness to look at barriers to fair trade for the United States, though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions, adding that the bank is prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025. Wells shares fell 4% in the morning.",https://apnews.com/article/jpmorgan-bank-earnings-economy-tariffs-profit-be31f6305b847f5f555edb2f251e36c2,business
Wall Street drifts through a rare quiet day following weeks of tariff turmoil,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks drifted Tuesday through a rare quiet day for financial markets. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 155 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%. The modest moves offered some respite following the huge swings that have battered Wall Street recently, not just day to day but also hour to hour. The day before, the S&P 500 went from a gain of 1.8% to a slight loss and back to a gain as it struggled to keep up with shifts in President Donald Trumps trade war, which economists warn could cause a global recession unless its scaled back.  Perhaps more importantly, the U.S. bond market  also showed more signs of calm after its sudden and sharp moves last week raised worries that investors worldwide may no longer see U.S. government bonds as a no-brainer go-to when times are scary. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.33% from 4.38% late Monday. It had pulled back to there from 4.48% at the end of last week after surging from just 4.01% a week earlier. A drop in yields is what usually happens when investors are scared, and this weeks moves offer a return to form for what historically had been seen as one of the safest investments possible.  The value of the U.S. dollar also steadied after tumbling last week, which had raised more worries that Trumps trade war was degrading its status as a safe-haven investment, as with U.S. Treasury bonds. The dollars value ticked higher against the euro and Swiss franc, though it slipped against the British pound. 
        
     On Wall Street, Albertsons stock fell 7.6% despite reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company behind Safeway, Vons and other grocery stores gave a forecast for profit in the upcoming year that was short of analysts. DaVita sank 3% for a second straight drop after it said a ransomware attack is affecting some of its operations. The health care company said its still investigating the attack, which it learned about Saturday, and that it cant yet know the full scope, nature, and potential ultimate impact.  On the winning side of Wall Street was Bank of America, which climbed 3.6% after the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.  Most big U.S. banks have been reporting strong results for the start of the year, boosted by their stock trading desks taking advantage of all the huge swings caused by Trumps on-again-off-again tariff announcements. Citigroup also topped analysts expectations, and its stock rose 1.8%.  Palantir Technologies climbed 6.2% for a second day of gains after NATO said it would use the companys artificial-intelligence capabilities in its allied command operations.  All told, the S&P 500 slipped 9.34 points to 5,396.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 155.83 to 40,368.96, and the Nasdaq composite edged down by 8.32 to 16,823.17. Even with the markets modest moves Tuesday, worries continue about the trade war. The United States and China, the worlds two largest economies, have been announcing ever-increasing tariffs on each others goods, along with other countermeasures to raise the stakes.  Trump has said he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, and he also wants to trim how much more his country exports to other countries than it imports. Chinas leadership, meanwhile, has been trying to present itself as a source of stability and certainty as it visits countries across Southeast Asia this week. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Germanys DAX returned 1.4%, and the FTSE 100 in London climbed 1.4%.  Automakers helped drive indexes higher in Asia, where Japans Nikkei 225 added 0.8% and South Koreas Kospi rose 0.9%.

US stocks drop as Nvidia slides and the fog of Trumps trade war thickens,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks fell Wednesday after Nvidia warned new restrictions on exports to China will chisel billions of dollars  off its results, while companies around the world said President Donald Trumps trade war  is clouding forecasts for how they and the economy will do this year.  The S&P 500 sank 2.2% after falling as much as 3.3% earlier. Such an amount would have vied for one of its worst losses in years before the historic, chaotic swings that have upended Wall Street in recent weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 699 points, or 1.7%, and the Nasdaq composite sank a market-leading 3.1%. Losses accelerated after the head of the Federal Reserve said again  that Trumps tariffs appear to be bigger than it expected, which could in turn slow the economy and raise inflation more than it had earlier thought. But Jerome Powell also said again that the Fed will need more time before deciding whether to lower interest rates, which could help the economy but make inflation worse, or to do the opposite.  All of this is highly uncertain, Powell said. Were thinking now, really before the tariffs have their effects, (about) how they might affect the economy. Thats why were waiting really to see what the policies ultimately are, and then we can make a better assessment of what the economic effects will be. Some companies are already seeing big effects because of changes from Washington. 
        
     Nvidia dropped 6.9% after it said the U.S. government is restricting exports of its H20 chips to China, citing worries that they could be used to build a supercomputer. The restrictions could mean a hit of $5.5 billion to Nvidias results for the first quarter, covering charges related to inventory and purchase commitments.  Advanced Micro Devices sank 7.3% after it said U.S. limits on exports to China for its own chips may mean a hit of up to $800 million for inventory and other charges.  In Amsterdam, ASMLs stock sank 5.2%. The Dutch company, whose machinery makes chips, said demand for artificial-intelligence technology is continuing to drive growth. However, the recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment and the situation will remain dynamic for a while, CEO Christophe Fouquet said.  The uncertainty around Trumps trade war has been scrambling plans for companies across industries and around the world. Its so dynamic that United Airlines gave two different financial forecasts for how it may perform this year, one if theres a recession and one if not.  The airline said it made the unusual move to give twin forecasts because it believes its impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence.  Uniteds stock finished roughly flat even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.  Many investors are bracing for a possible recession  because of Trumps tariffs, which he has said he hopes will bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States and trim how much more it imports from other countries than it exports. A survey of global fund managers by Bank of America found expectations for recession are at the fourth-highest level in the last 20 years.  The World Trade Organization said Wednesday  it expects tariffs to cause a 0.2% decline in the volume of world merchandise trade for 2025. Thats if the tariff situation remains as it was on Monday. Trade could shrink by 1.5% this year if conditions worsen, the WTO said. The enduring uncertainty threatens to act as a brake on global growth, with severe negative consequences for the world, the most vulnerable economies in particular, Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.  One U.S. company that moves products around the continent, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, tumbled 7.7% for one of Wall Streets sharper losses, even though it reported slightly stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.  All told, the S&P 500 fell 120.93 points to 5,275.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 699.57 to 39,669.39, and the Nasdaq composite sank 516.01 to 16,307.16. Tariffs could also drive up inflation, at least temporarily, by pushing U.S. importers to pass along the higher costs to their customers.  Fears about such price hikes drove a spending binge last month, and sales at U.S. retailers accelerated  by more than economists expected. Economists said much of that was likely because of U.S. shoppers rushing to buy automobiles, electronics and other items before their prices could rise due to possible tariffs.  Recent surveys have shown U.S. households are feeling more pessimistic  about the economy because of tariffs, and a fear is that it could lead them to pull back on their spending eventually, which could cause a recession by itself. Treasury yields eased in the bond market, taking a leg lower following the comments from the Feds chair. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.28% from 4.35% late Tuesday and from 4.48% at the end of last week.  Its another notable move for the bond market and somewhat of a return to form after an unusual rise in yields last week rattled investors and Trump. Treasury yields typically fall when investors are worried about the economy, and last weeks climb raised concerns that the trade war may be causing investors to second-guess the reputation of U.S. government bonds as one of the worlds safest possible investments.  In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia and were mixed in Europe. Stocks dropped 1.9% in Hong Kong, 1% in Tokyo, 1.2% in Seoul and 0.1% in Paris.  The FTSE 100 rose 0.3% in London after the government said inflation in the U.K. fell for the second month running in March, largely as a result of lower gas prices.  ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-tariffs-aeb0ed831602ab06235065aace6df5ec,business
"Harassed by Assassins Creed gamers, a professor fought back with kindness","HANOVER, N.H. (AP)  Sachi Schmidt-Hori has never played Assassins Creed Shadows, but facing an onslaught of online harassment from its fans, she quickly developed her own gameplay style: confronting hate with kindness. Schmidt-Hori, an associate professor of Japanese literature and culture at Dartmouth College, worked as a narrative consultant on the latest installment in the popular Ubisoft video game franchise. The game launched March 20, but the vitriol directed at Schmidt-Hori began in May 2024 with the release of a promotional trailer. Once I realized that I was by myself  nobody was defending me  I just decided to do what I knew would work, she said. Its very difficult to hate someone up close. Set in 16th century Japan, the game features Naoe, a Japanese female assassin, and Yasuke, a Black African samurai. Furor erupted over the latter, with gamers criticizing his inclusion as wokeness run amok.  They quickly zeroed in Schmidt-Hori, attacking her in online forums, posting bogus reviews of her scholarly work and flooding her inbox with profanity. Many drew attention to her academic research into gender and sexuality. Some tracked down her husbands name and ridiculed him, too. Imagine that! Professional #WOKE SJW confirms fake history for Ubisoft, one Reddit user said, using an acronym for social justice warrior. Another user called her a sexual degenerate who hate humanity because no man want her. 
        
     Learning Yasuke was based on a real person did little to assuage critics. Asian men in particular argued Schmidt-Hori was trying to erase them, even though her role involved researching historical customs and reviewing scripts, not creating characters. I became the face of this backlash, she said. People wanted to look for who to yell at, and I was kind of there. Ubisoft told her to ignore the harassment, as did her friends. Instead, she drew inspiration from the late civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis. I decided to cause good trouble, she said. I refused to ignore. Schmidt-Hori began replying to some of the angry emails, asking the senders why they were mad at her and inviting them to speak face-to-face via Zoom. She wrote to an influencer who opposes diversity, equity and inclusion principles and had written about her, asking him if he intended to inspire the death threats she was getting.  If somebody said to your wife what people are saying to me, you wouldnt like it, would you? she asked. The writer didnt reply, but he did take down the negative article about Schmidt-Hori. Others apologized. It truly destroyed me knowing that you had to suffer and cancel your class and received hate from horrible people, one man wrote. I feel somehow that you are part of my family, and I regret it. Im sorry from the bottom of my heart. Anik Talukder, a 28-year-old south Asian man living in the United Kingdom, said he apologized at least 10 times to Schmidt-Hori after accepting her Zoom invitation to discuss his Reddit post about her. On May 16, feeling surprised and disappointed about Yasuke as a protagonist, he posted a screenshot that included photos of Schmidt-Hori, her professional biography from the Dartmouth website and a description of a book she wrote. I felt like maybe they were doing too much of like racial inclusion and changing things, he said in an interview. An Asian male could have been the role model for so many people. Though he didnt criticize Schmidt-Hori directly, others responded negatively and the image was picked up and shared in other forums.  He was shocked the professor reached out to him and hesitant to speak to her at first. But they ended up having a thoughtful conversation about the lack of Asian representation in Western media and have stayed in touch ever since. I learned a massive lesson, he said. I shouldnt have made this person a target for no reason whatsoever. Ubisoft officials declined to be interviewed about the criticism of the game or the harassment Schmidt-Hori faced. In a statement, the company said it carefully researches historical settings and collaborates with internal and expert witnesses, but the games remain works of fiction and artistic liberties are taken. We do not condone harassment or bullying in any form, the company said. We are committed to creating a supportive and collaborative environment and were constantly learning how we can improve this process. We commend and appreciate Sachi Schmidt-Hori for addressing these topics directly and are grateful for her approach and expertise. Unlike the professor at Dartmouth, in Hanover, New Hampshire, most people who become the target of online hate end up retreating to protect themselves, said Kate Mays, an assistant professor of public communication at the University of Vermont.  Online forums allow people to post anonymously without seeing how their words are received and algorithms boost more aggressive content, she said, creating a perfect storm for people to become hateful. The intervention that she did was pretty brilliant in terms of sort of stopping that toxic train in its tracks and putting another spin on how people are engaging with her, Mays said. Shes sort of breaking the spell of that online disinhibition community involvement and forcing people to address her as a human and an individual. ____ Associated Press video journalist Amanda Swinhart contributed to this report from Burlington, Vermont.",https://apnews.com/article/assassins-creed-video-game-harassment-4b68890b7ed9ead8dbe3ad09dbee9859,business
Massive repair job on leaky NYC aqueduct will take a few more years to finish,"A $2 billion project to fix a massive leak in a water tunnel that supplies about half of New York Citys water that was already paused recently due to drought conditions, wont be completed for a few more years, city officials said Monday. Department of Environmental Protection officials have been planning for years to temporarily shut down a section of the Delaware Aqueduct north of the city to address the leak of up to 35 million gallons per day, almost all of it beneath the Hudson River. The planned eight-month shutdown will allow workers to hook up a bypass tunnel that has been constructed under the river. City officials announced the shutdown of the aqueduct last fall, timing the cutoff of water from the Catskill region for when seasonal demands are lower. But the work was paused in November due to a drought warning and low levels in the citys other reservoirs. The delay means the environmental agency will have to enter into a new contract for the construction work. Officials also remain concerned about below-average precipitation and plan to upgrade the aqueducts pumps. So they dont expect the project to be completed until after 2027. A new contract must take every contingency into account to ensure we meet our critical responsibility of providing the highest quality water possible to nearly 10 million New Yorkers every day, without exception, Commissioner Rohit T. Aggarwala said in a prepared release. 
        
     The aqueduct is the longest tunnel in the world and carries water for 85 miles (137 kilometers) from four reservoirs in the Catskill region to other reservoirs in the northern suburbs. It serves more than 8 million New York City residents. The sprawling system also serves some upstate municipalities.",https://apnews.com/article/new-york-water-delaware-aqueduct-43fef3b9380c2485137d6ec8aad0cfbd,business
Warren Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire Hathaway when Greg Abel takes over as CEO in 2026,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  When Greg Abel becomes Berkshire Hathaways new CEO next year he will of course take on additional responsibilities, but with Warren Buffett remaining as chairman, the surprise change announced at the annual meeting over the weekend is in some ways just another milestone in the companys succession plans. Shareholders have been worrying about how to replace the worlds greatest investor for decades  even before the 94-year-old hit a typical retirement age. So years ago, Berkshires board started devoting part of every meeting to the succession question.  Then in 2018, Buffett began publicly handing over the reins when he put Abel in charge of all of Berkshires dozens of manufacturing, retail, railroad and utility businesses. Fellow Vice Chairman Ajit Jain was given responsibility for the insurance companies including Geico, while Buffett kept responsibility for investing Berkshires billions. Berkshire confirmed that Abel would be Buffetts successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at a shareholder meeting. Starting next year, Abel will have the final say on all of Berkshires companies and investments, but he will also still have Buffett, Jain and two investment managers  Ted Weschler and Todd Combs  coming to the office every day to help. And the CEOs of Berkshires many different subsidiaries handle all the day-to-day operations. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Warren Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire Hathaway when the new CEO takes over. Gregs already been doing it for a couple of years, so his job really doesnt change. His title does, but his jobs not really changing that much, said Bob Miles, who has taught a course about Buffett and Berkshire at the University of Nebraska-Omaha for 15 years. 
        
     Berkshires board approved the 62-year-old Abels promotion to CEO and kept Buffett as chairman on Sunday. Berkshire Class B shares fell more than 5% Monday in response to the news after hitting an all-time high Friday, but many investors praised the plan.  I think it gives Warren a little more bandwidth instead of running this conglomerate, Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an interview with The Associated Press. It gives Greg more transparency on the opps with also Warren still being his mentor as chairman,  In six decades at the helm, Buffett turned a Massachusetts textile company into a sprawling but nimble conglomerate that owns everything from Daily Queen and Sees Candies to BNSF Railway and massive insurance and utility companies. As the company grew, Buffetts reputation grew with it as shares of Berkshire Hathaway climbed steadily, exceeding major indexes by wide margins and returning an average 19.9% each year to investors versus 10.4% for the Standard & Poors 500.  The decision to continue with the Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is known, as head of the board differs from the succession plans laid out in the event of Buffetts death. The billionaire has long said that Howard Buffett, the second-born of his three children, should become chairman when he is gone to protect Berkshires culture.  Abel will take over in a precarious time as the U.S. launches trade wars against friend and foe alike, which Buffett has called a mistake. But that could also create investment opportunities for Berkshire if there is a crisis. Then there is Berkshires $348 billion in cash.  Buffett says he doesnt see many bargains to invest that money in now, not even Berkshires own stock, but he assured some of the estimated 40,000 attendees of the companys annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, over the weekend that one day the company would be bombarded with opportunities. Abel, a low-key Canadian with a love a hockey who makes it a priority to coach his kids teams, said Saturday that he wouldnt change Berkshires approach to investing, which he learned from Buffett. Maintaining Berkshires fortress-like balance sheet will always be a priority, he said. Eventually, Berkshire might have to consider paying a dividend, which Buffett always resisted because he believed he could deliver better returns by reinvesting the cash. For now, Buffett and Abel want to keep building cash, so they are prepared when opportunities arise. Buffett endorsed Abel, vowing to keep all of his shares that give him control of 30% of Berkshire Hathaway. Abel is a more hands-on manager than Buffett, asking managers tough questions and encouraging them to collaborate with other subsidiaries when it makes sense. Its way better with Greg than with me because I didnt want to work as hard as he works and I can get away with it because weve got a basically good business -- a very good business  and I wasnt in danger of you firing me by virtue of the ownership and the fact that we could do pretty well, Buffett said. The fact that you can do pretty well doesnt mean you couldnt do better, and Greg can do better at many things, he said.  The CEOs of Berkshire subsidiaries who report to Abel have praised his management style of personal accountability, but also autonomy. Sees Candy CEO Pat Egan worked with Abel at Berkshires utility unit for years before he took over the candymaker six years ago and said Abel makes sure hes considered every contingency. Hes allowed me to make a lot of decisions that he may or may not have agreed with, but hell support us at the end of the day, no matter what as long as were operating with integrity and principles and the long game, Egan said.  But Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren wrote that Buffetts succession announcement left him with plenty of questions and Abel will have to prove himself. Abel, in our view, will be held to a different standard than Buffett, with a greater focus on how well Berkshire is performingespecially with it being likely that there will be some churn in the companys shareholders as we move past the end of an era for the firm, Warren said. Buffett has always delegated the decisions about how to distribute his fortune, worth nearly $160 billion, to others through annual share donations to the Gates Foundation and four family foundations run by his children.  The Gates Foundation has received the biggest donations worth more than $40 billion since he started giving away his fortune in 2006.  He said last summer that his three children will decide how to distribute his remaining fortune after his death, but donations to the Gates Foundation will end. Buffett has said he expects it to take a decade to give away all his shares after his death, ensuring extended support for Abel from the family. ____ AP Business writer Bernard Condon is in New York City.

The grace period for student loan payments is over. Heres what you need to know,"NEW YORK (AP)  The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended on Sept. 30. The on-ramp period helped borrowers who are struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting their credit score. The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make payments, said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.  Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5 trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal challenges.  With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added Yu. Student loan borrowers who havent been able to afford their monthly payments must consider their options to avoid going into default. If you have student loans, heres what you need to know. 
        
     The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the borrowers transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to accumulate.  Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling behind ultimately on repaying your loans, said Abby Shaforth, director of National Consumer Law Centers Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who dont make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for nine months, go into default.  Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to accrue.  Borrowers who cant or dont pay risk delinquency and eventually default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible for additional aid and government benefits.  If a borrower missed one months payment, they will start receiving email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasnt been paid for three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the borrower hasnt paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into default.  If youre struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by visiting the Federal Student Aid website. If youve worked for a government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives student debt after 10 years.  When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days  roughly 9 months  the loan appears on your credit report as being in default.  Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of Social Security checks and other benefit payments.  If your budget doesnt allow you to resume payments, its important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid. If youre in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance  allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrowers discretionary income. If a borrowers earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan, the income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower courts.  Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan dont have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was unaffected. The next court hearing about this case will be held on Oct. 15.  The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on Sept. 30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits.

Fishermen sue Mississippi over plan to lease oyster reefs,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP)  A group of more than 20 fishermen, led by Mississippi Commercial Fisheries United Inc., a nonprofit trade organization, are suing the state over its attempts to lease historically public oyster reefs in the Mississippi Sound.  In a statement, MSCFU cited a 2024 bill that allows private individuals and companies to lease up to 80% of Mississippis natural oyster reefs.  Over the past several years, the Mississippi State Legislature has attempted to implement an unconstitutional private leasing regime, the statement read. These vague and discriminatory acts, if implemented, would unjustly exclude our current oyster fishing families from their direct access to harvest from reefs that they rely upon for their livelihoods.  The lawsuit, filed in Harrison County on Thursday, also names the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources and its Executive Director Joe Spraggins as defendants.  When reached for comment, MDMR referred The Associated Press to the Mississippi Attorney Generals office, which said it could not comment on active litigation.  MDMR frames the leasing plan as a way to increase oyster production while ensuring compliance and environmental and conservation requirements.  The lawsuit comes as the states oyster industry is recovering after massive freshwater flooding, released through Louisiannas Bonnet Carr Spillway, killed almost all the oysters on Mississippis most productive reefs in 2019.",https://apnews.com/article/oyster-lawsuit-mississippi-fishermen-lease-0d3ec2966107718be921b58ebf319da8,business
Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. Heres what we know,"NEW YORK (AP)  President Donald Trump is eyeing Hollywood for his next round of tariffs, threatening to levy all films produced outside the U.S. at a steep rate of 100%. Over the weekend, Trump accused other countries of stealing the movie-making capabilities of the U.S. and said that he had authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to immediately begin the process of implementing this new import tax on all foreign-made films. But further specifics or dates werent provided. And the White House confirmed that no final decisions had been made as of Monday. Trump later said that he would meet with industry executives about the proposal but a lot remains unclear about how an import tax on complex, international productions could even be implemented.  If imposed, experts warn that such a tariff would dramatically hike the costs of making movies today. That uncertainty could put filmmakers in limbo, much like other industries that have recently been caught in the crosshairs of todays ongoing trade wars. Unlike other sectors that have recently been targeted by tariffs, however, movies go beyond physical goods, bringing larger intellectual property ramifications into question. Heres what we know. 
        
     Trump is citing national security concerns, a justification hes similarly used to impose import taxes on certain countries and a range of sector-specific goods. In a Sunday night post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump claimed that the American movie industry is DYING to a very fast death as other countries offer all sorts of incentives to draw filmmaking away from the U.S.  Trump has previously voiced concern about movie production moving overseas. And in recent years, U.S. film and television production has been hampered between setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Incentive programs have also long-influenced where movies are shot both abroad and within the U.S., with more production leaving California to states like Georgia and New Mexico -- as well as countries like Canada. But unlike other sectors targeted by Trumps recently-imposed tariffs, the American film industry currently holds a trade deficit thats in the U.S.'s favor. In movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelmingly dominate the domestic marketplace. Data from the Motion Picture Association also shows that American films made $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus in 2023  with a recent report noting that these films generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the world for the U.S. Last year, international markets accounted for over 70% of Hollywoods total box office revenue, notes Heeyon Kim, an assistant professor of strategy at Cornell University. She warns that tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries impacting this industry could result in billions of dollars in lost earnings and thousands of jobs. To me, (this) makes just no sense, she said, adding that such tariffs could undermine otherwise a thriving part of the U.S. economy. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers across the U.S. and Canada, said in a statement Monday that Trump had correctly recognized the urgent threat from international competition that the American film and television industry faces today. But the union said it instead recommended the administration implement a federal production tax incentive and other provisions to level the playing field while not harming the industry overall. Thats anyones guess. Traditional tariffs apply to physical imports crossing borders, but film production primarily involves digital services  shooting, editing and post-production work that happens electronically, notes Ann Koppuzha, a lawyer and business law lecturer at Santa Clara Universitys Leavey School of Business. Koppuzha said that film production is more like an applied service that can be taxed, not tariffed. But taxes require Congressional approval, which could be a challenge even with a Republican majority. Making a movie is also an incredibly complex  and international  process. Its common for both large and small films to include production in the U.S. and in other countries. Big-budget movies like the upcoming Mission: Impossible  The Final Reckoning, for instance, are shot around the world. U.S. studios frequently shoot abroad because tax incentives can aid production costs. But a blanket tariff across the board could discourage that or limit options, Kim said  hurting both Hollywood films and the global industry that helps create them. When you make these sort of blanket rules, youre missing some of the nuance of how production works, added Steven Schiffman, a longtime industry veteran and adjunct professor at Georgetown University. Sometimes you just need to go to the location, because frankly its way too expensive just to try to create in a soundstage Schiffman points to popular titles filmed outside the U.S.  such as Warner Bros Harry Potter series, which was almost entirely shot in the U.K. The cost to have done that would have like literally double to produce those movies under this proposed tariff, he said. Overall, experts warn that the prospect of tariffing foreign-made movies ventures into uncharted waters. Theres simply no precedent or sense for applying tariffs to these types of creative services, Koppuzha said. And while the Trump administration could extend similar threats to other forms of intellectual property, like music, theyd encounter the same practical hurdles. But if successful, some also warn of potential retaliation. Kim points to quotas that some countries have had to help boost their domestic films by ensuring they get a portion of theater screens, for example. Many have reduced or suspended such quotas over the years in the name of open trade  but if the U.S. places a sweeping tariff on all foreign-made films, these kinds of quotas could come back, which would hurt Hollywood film or any of the U.S.-made intellectual property, Kim said. And while U.S. dominance in film means there are fewer substitutes for retaliation, Schiffman notes that other forms of entertainment  like game development  could see related impacts down the road. Others stress the potential consequences of hampering international collaboration overall. Creative content distribution requires thoughtful economic approaches that recognize how modern storytelling flows across borders, notes Frank Albarella, U.S. media and telecommunications sector leader at KPMG. The question hanging over every screen: Might we better nurture American storytelling through smart, targeted incentives, or could we inadvertently force audiences to pay more for what could become a narrower creative landscape? __________ AP Writers Jake Coyle and Jill Colvin in New York, Aamer Madhani in Palm Beach, Florida and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-foreign-movies-films-8008248fc08c748a7e8a174306ba66ba,business
"Stocks rally worldwide after Trump eases some of his tariffs on electronics, for now","NEW YORK (AP)  Stocks rose worldwide Monday after President Donald Trump relaxed some of his tariffs, for now at least, and as stress from within the U.S. bond market  seems to be easing.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.8%, though trading was still shaky, and it briefly gave back all of its big early gain of 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6%. Apple and other technology companies helped lift Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs, which could ultimately more than double prices for U.S. customers of products coming from China. Such an exemption would mean U.S. importers dont have to choose between passing on the higher costs to their customers or taking a hit to their own profits. Apple climbed 2.2%, and Dell Technologies rose 4%. Automakers also rallied after Trump suggested he may announce pauses on tariffs next for the auto industry. General Motors rose 3.5%, and Ford Motor rallied 4.1%.  All told, the S&P 500 rose 42.61 points to 5,405.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 312.08 to 40,524.79, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 107.03 to 16,831.48. But such relief may ultimately prove fleeting. Trumps tariff rollout has been full of fits and starts, and officials in his administration said this most recent exemption on electronics is only temporary.  
        
     That could keep uncertainty high for companies, which are trying to make long-term plans when conditions seem to change by the day. Such uncertainty sent the U.S. stock market last week to chaotic and historic swings, as investors struggled to catch up with Trumps moves on tariffs, which could ultimately lead to a recession if not reduced.  Chinas commerce ministry nevertheless welcomed the pause on electronics tariffs in a Sunday statement as a small step even as it called for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. Chinas leader Xi Jinping on Monday said no one wins in a trade war as he kicked off a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia, hoping to present China as a force for stability in contrast with Trumps frenetic moves on tariffs.  Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs rose 1.9% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It joined other big banks in doing so, such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.  Perhaps more encouragingly for Wall Street, the bond market  also showed signs of increasing calm. Treasury yields eased following their sudden and scary rise last week, which seemed to rattle not only investors but also Trump. Treasury yields usually drop when fear is high in the market because U.S. government bonds have historically been seen as some of the worlds safest investments, if not the safest. But last week, yields rose sharply for Treasury bonds in an usual move. The value of the U.S. dollar also fell against other currencies in another move suggesting investors may no longer see the United States as the best place to keep their cash during moments of stress. Trump noted the moves in the bond market, which suggested investors were getting a little queasy, after he announced a 90-day pause  on many of his tariffs last week.  That Trump acted only after the bond market made its scary move, but not after U.S. stock market began trembling, reveals this administrations Achilles heel, according to Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased back to 4.37%. It had jumped to 4.48% on Friday from 4.01% the week before.  Yields sank after the bond market got an encouraging update on expectations for inflation among U.S. consumers. While U.S. households raised their expectations for inflation in the year ahead, their expectations for inflation three and five years in the future were either unchanged or lower, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Thats potentially good news for the Federal Reserve, which hates to see fast-rising expectations for longer-term inflation. Such expectations could kick off a feedback loop that drives behavior among consumers that only worsens inflation.  The value of the U.S. dollar, though, remained under pressure. It slipped against the euro and Japanese yen, while inching higher against the Canadian dollar.  In stock markets abroad, indexes climbed 2.4% in France, 2.9% in Germany, 1.2% in Japan and 1% in South Korea. In China, stock indexes rose 2.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after the government reported that Chinas exports surged 12.4% in March from a year earlier in a last-minute flurry of activity as companies rushed to beat increases in U.S. tariffs. ___ AP Writers Jiang Junzhe and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/markets-stocks-rates-trump-china-0a5c13b5a515a7af0d108c7375995511,business
Germanys economy is expected to be more or less stagnant this year,"BERLIN (AP)  Germanys economy is likely to be more or less stagnant in 2025 after shrinking for two years and the impact of U.S. tariffs could weigh down an already unimpressive showing, leading think tanks forecast Thursday. Germany has Europes biggest economy and is the 27-nation European Unions most populous member. Five economic institutes said in a regular update that they expect minimal growth of 0.1% this year  down from the 0.8% they forecast in September. They predicted growth of 1.3% in 2026. However, they pointed to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administrations trade policy. U.S. tariffs on aluminum, steel and vehicle imports are likely to reduce German economic growth this year and next by 0.1 percentage points each, an effect that the new forecast already takes into account, according to their report. The sweeping tariffs announced last week by President Donald Trump and then largely put on hold could double that hit to gross domestic product, the economists said. But they added that the specific effects are difficult to quantify, as tariff rates have never been raised so sharply in the worlds current globalized economy. Germanys prospective new government, which hopes to take office next month after months of political drift in the country, aims to revitalize the economy. Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor, and his would-be allies presented their coalition agreement on Wednesday.",https://apnews.com/article/germany-economy-stagnation-us-tariffs-ee9b40410c4148fe09d81c41fc4ec208,business
USDA bans school lunch fees for low-income families,"NEW YORK (AP)  The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027.  School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge processing fees for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  For families with lower incomes who cant afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. The new Agriculture Departments policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.  USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. While todays action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.  
        
     The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.  Its just massively inconvenient, said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. A dollar here and there, I expected, she said. But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower  as are the salaries  is a lot. Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a childs account.  While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate. Just three companies  MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect  dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices, the agency said, including those that may violate federal consumer protection law. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Trump is swiftly undoing transgender protections in HUDs housing policies,"The Trump administration is swiftly remaking housing policy as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development retreats from long-established fair-housing protections for transgender people. In recent months, HUD has been targeting the Obama-era Equal Access Rule that expanded protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Also in the bulls-eye are fair-housing complaint investigations and federally funded homeless shelters. This administration wants to pretend trans people dont exist, said Hannah Adams, a senior staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project. Whatever theyre doing is not in line with HUDs supposed mission to provide a safety net for families that are struggling in this country.  HUD said in a statement that it is upholding the landmark Fair Housing Act that guarantees equal access to housing for all Americans, as well as implementing what it called Trumps executive order restoring biological truth to the federal government. Here are key takeaways about how HUD is taking on the battle over transgender rights. 
        
     The Fair Housing Act identifies sex as one of seven protected classes for housing discrimination. But it wasnt until the Obama administration established the Equal Access Rule in 2012 that those protections were extended to cover sexual orientation, gender identity and marital status.  In 2016, the rule was expanded to include transgender people seeking help at federally funded emergency shelters. Four years later, a 2020 Supreme Court ruling established that a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment. Housing advocates and HUD in 2021 under the Biden administration interpreted that as broader affirmation that LGBTQ+ people were also protected in the fair housing law.  Kim Johnson, public policy manager at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said transgender people experience homelessness at a disproportionately higher rate despite being less than 1% of the general population. The spirit of the Fair Housing Act is to protect everyone who is vulnerable to discrimination, she said, even if the text of the law does not explicitly include gender identity as a protected class. We really need to ensure were upholding what the law means, and the fact is that transgender people are some of the most marginalized people in this country, Johnson said. President Donald Trump listens during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump listens during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Since President Donald Trump appointed Scott Turner to take the helm at HUD, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has instructed staff to pause investigations of all gender identity discrimination cases, according to two HUD attorneys who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or benefits. One said letters were then issued closing the cases for lack of jurisdiction.  HUD has not disclosed how many cases have been dropped. A National Fair Housing Alliance report identified at least 195 discrimination complaints involving gender identity in 2023, though HUD has not specified how many cases are still outstanding.  With changes to the Equal Access rule and other guidance still unclear, what happens now often depends on where a case is filed. In blue states with laws offering protections beyond federal law, HUD can direct tenants facing LGBTQ+ discrimination to state-run offices still taking cases, said a HUD employee who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the hot-button topic.  To Sasha Samberg-Champion, HUD deputy general counsel in the Biden administration and now special counsel for civil rights at the National Fair Housing Alliance, There is no public policy justification for permitting discrimination in the housing market against people because they are transgender. None. Community leaders say theyre facing seemingly contradictory requirements in new HUD contracts with nonprofits that find permanent housing for the homeless and run shelters.  One section stipulates that nonprofits cant promote gender ideology while at the same time another requires compliance with anti-discrimination law, according to a copy provided to the AP. In Memphis, Tennessee, a nonprofit that provides emergency shelter for transgender people is looking to increase capacity because of the uncertainty.  Kayla Gore, executive director of My Sistahs House, said it can do that because it doesnt take federal funding. But other shelters are removing information from their websites about serving the LGBTQ+ community, fearful that federal funding will be stripped if they dont, she said. People are confused, Gore said. They dont know what to do because they want to protect their bottom line. Soon after being sworn in as HUD secretary in February, Turner announced he was halting enforcement of the Equal Access Rule and quietly filed a proposal to revise the policy. HUD officials have declined to say what the proposed changes are. In 2020, the first Trump administration unsuccessfully moved to relieve shelters of any obligation to accommodate transgender people.  With Trump back for a second term, advocates fear his administration will feel even more emboldened to go further and forbid shelters from accommodating gender identity altogether. Unfortunately, its making an already vulnerable class of people more vulnerable, said Seran Gee, an attorney for Advocates for Trans Equality.  Our protections cant be a pingpong ball that changes every four years.",https://apnews.com/article/transgender-hud-fair-housing-trump-lgbtq-turner-003a354b933592303a4eea350ebbc804,business
How to avoid financial stress during the holiday season,"NEW YORK (AP)  The holidays are meant to be a time of celebration with family and friends. But they can also bring pressure to spend money on gifts, gatherings and plane tickets home, exacerbated by brand emails, social media influencers and family expectations.  With credit card debt rising and prices for many items still high due to inflation, overspending during the holiday season can add to the financial stress many Americans are already experiencing, said Dr. Marketa Wills, CEO and medical director of the American Psychiatric Association.  The idea that one is on the hook for buying gifts for all their friends and families adds an enormous amount of stress on someone trying to have a perfect holiday, Wills said.  But there are ways to get through the holidays without spending more than you can afford. From setting expectations with your family to making a budget to gifting experiences rather than things, here are expert recommendations to avoid financial stress this holiday season: To avoid overspending on gifts for family and friends, set a specific goal, said Matt Watson, CEO of Origin, a financial planning app. Ask yourself what your spending limit is before you start shopping. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on spending during the holidays. People get into justification mode where you have a general sense of what you want to spend but then you see this really nice thing and all of the sudden youve done that a few times and you spend twice as much as you thought you might, Watson said. Watson also recommends that you include in your budget calculations how much youll pay for taxes and shipping.  
        
     In many families, the holidays mean going all out with gift-giving. But this can quickly become stressful if your finances make it hard to keep up. Managing expectations is key.  You can avoid feeling inadequate, or like youre not doing a good job, by having an honest conversation about where your finances are, Watson said. Being open about your money can be difficult, but sharing if you are struggling with debt or other financial issues can help family and friends understand that they should prioritize low-cost gifts or activities.  Planning your holiday shopping ahead of time can make it easier to stick to your budget,.  When people feel rushed, oftentimes theyre going to buy more expensive things, said Watson, who also pointed out that shipping costs increase closer to Christmas.  As you budget for the holidays, make a list of the items you want to purchase and slowly start buying them. This way, you divide your costs among several paychecks and avoid relying on credit for last-minute expenses.  Wills recommends that people opt for homemade gifts if they want to show appreciation for their loved ones without overspending. Homemade gifts dont always have to be crafts, they can also be actions.  I will do babysitting for you, I will cook a meal for you, Wills said. Those kinds of things take a financial pressure off and make for a more joyous holiday season.  In recent years, shopping expert Trae Bodge has noticed that younger people prefer to gift each other experiences rather than items. She recommends finding affordable, fun activities to do with your loved ones.  Examples include going ice skating, hiking or hosting a potluck. You could also gift a photoshoot or framed pictures or digital albums to commemorate happy experiences. Expectations or traditions you grew up with, such as buying expensive gifts for every member of your extended family, can cause stress during the holidays. This is what Bodge refers as keeping up with the Joneses, which refers to trying to keep up with the expectations of other people rather than what is realistic for you to spend.  Sometimes you may have a family member that is very financially well-off and they love to treat you to big, extravagant things. If youre not in that same financial position, you should not feel compelled to return the favor, Bodge said.  When creating your own new traditions, Watson recommends sharing the financial goals you have, such as saving for a house or paying off debt. This will help your loved ones understand why youre looking to limit expenses during the holidays.  Wills also recommends cutting costs by being selective with your expenses. For example, when it comes to hosting, even having a small group of people can be very expensive if youre expected to pay for everything. If youre in this situation, you could propose that everyone brings a dish.  Think about having a potluck meal for the holiday. Have everybody bring something to the event to help share the cost, she said.  If you are having financial difficulties, it can help to talk about it with your family and friends. Sharing about stress can in and of itself be therapeutic for the individual who may be having concerns for that during the during the holiday season, Wills said. Making room to listen to your loved ones feelings is equally important, she said. And if the holidays are a tough time for you, Wills recommended that you prioritize your mental health and good habits such as resting well and exercising.  Its the season where social events are happening every weekend but if they are causing you too much financial stress or hurting your mental health, its okay to be selective. Additionally, if you start feeling uncomfortable about certain conversations with your family, Wills recommends you take some time for yourself by taking a walk or removing yourself from the conversation.  If you are experiencing mental health struggles, there are several resources you can use to find professional help. In the U.S., you can dial 211 to speak with a mental health expert, confidentially and for free. Other mental health resources include: Veterans Crisis Line: call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) Crisis Text Line: Text the word Home to 741-741 The Trevor Lifeline for LGBTQ Youth: 1-866-488-7386 The Trans Lifeline: 1-877-565-8860 ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Asian markets are mostly higher as Wall Street is stuck in trade war doldrums,"BANGKOK (AP)  Asian shares were mostly higher in thin Good Friday trading after a bumpy ride on Wall Street, where the Dow industrials lost 1.3% as UnitedHealth shed more than a fifth of its value due to a weaker-than-expected profit report.  U.S. stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday.  Tokyos Nikkei 225 gained 1% to 34,730.28, while the Kospi in South Korea rose 0.5% to 2,483.42.  Taiwans Taiex gained 0.3% and regional tech companies advanced after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts expectations. Perhaps more importantly, it also said it hasnt seen a drop-off in activity from its customers because of President Donald Trumps trade war, as some other companies have suggested.  Still, the company known as TSMC was cautious. While we have not seen any changes in our customers behavior so far, uncertainties and risks from the potential impact from tariff policies exist, Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. TSMCs stock that trades in the United States added 0.1% on Thursday.  The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.1% to 3,276.73. Bangkoks SET rose 0.6%. Many other markets were closed Friday for holidays ahead of Easter.  On Thursday, the S&P 500 edged up by just 0.1%, even though three of every four stocks climbed in the index.  The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1% in a mostly steadier performance following its sell-off the day before. 
        
     Nvidia weighed on the market after sinking a second straight day following its disclosure that new export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. It sank 2.9% and was the second-heaviest weight on the S&P 500.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 527 points as insurer UnitedHealth Group fell 22.4%, its worst drop since 1998. The company cut its forecast for financial results this year and said its Medicare Advantage customers were getting more care than expected from doctors and outpatient services. Stocks of companies in the oil-and-gas industry rallied after the price of crude recovered some of its sharp losses taken this month. Diamondback Energy jumped 5.7%, and Halliburton climbed 5.1%. On Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $2.18 to $64.01 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up $2.11 to $67.96 per barrel.  Oil trading was paused Friday for the Easter weekend.  U.S. President Donald Trumps trade war remains a source of deep uncertainty. Economists worry his use of sharp tariff hikes could cause a recession if fully implemented and left in place for a while. Trump on Thursday offered some encouraging signals that negotiations with other countries could lead to lower tariffs. But that was countered by his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who reiterated Wednesday that the tariffs are larger than what the central bank was expecting and could slow the economy and reignite inflation.  The tariffs create a dilemma for the Fed. If it cuts interest rates to help encourage more borrowing and spending, that would push prices higher. Trump criticized that stance  Thursday, saying the Fed is always TOO LATE AND WRONG. He also said, Powells termination cannot come fast enough! An independent Fed able to act without influence  from the White House a primary reason the United States has a reputation as a safe place to invest. History suggests central banks with more autonomy tend to have economies with lower and more stable inflation.  In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.29% late Wednesday. It had been easing for much of this week, following a climb last week that raised concerns that Trumps trade war may be undermining confidence in U.S. investments as the worlds safest.  Reports on the U.S. economy came in mixed. One said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected, suggesting the job market remains relatively solid. But a second report said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly flipped to contraction from growth.  In Europe on Thursday, indexes slipped 0.6% in France and 0.5% in Germany. The European Central Bank cut its main interest rate. That usually pushes stock prices higher, but investors had already been expecting the move.  Early Friday, the U.S. dollar bought 142.37 Japanese yen, down from 132.44 yen on Thursday.

Chinas export orders dip in April as Trumps tariffs begin to bite,"Higher tariffs on U.S. imports of products from China are taking a toll on the worlds second-largest economy as export orders sink, according to monthly surveys of Chinese factory managers released Wednesday.  The official survey by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing shows export orders slowed sharply in April, with Beijing and Washington in a standoff after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered combined tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods.  China has imposed duties of up to 125% on U.S. products, with some exemptions. It has also ordered other retaliation, such as tighter restrictions on exports of some strategically important minerals used for high-tech products such as electric vehicles.  American businesses are cancelling orders from China and postponing expansion plans as they watch to see what comes. The official manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to a 16-month low of 49.0 from 50.5 in March. Thats on a scale where 50 marks the break between expansion and contraction. A private survey by the financial information group Caixin fell to 50.4 from 51.2.  The sharp drop in the PMIs likely overstates the impact of tariffs due to negative sentiment effects, but it still suggests that Chinas economy is coming under pressure as external demand cools, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.  Large manufacturers are likely to be hit harder than smaller ones that are more labor intensive, since China still enjoys a cost advantage for such products, economists at ANZ Research said.  
        
     Chinas manufacturing cost for light industries may be one-fifth that of the U.S., which is unlikely to change, they said in a report.  Earlier this week, senior Chinese economic officials convened a news conference where they showcased Beijings support for the economy and its capacity to do more to counter the impact of the tariffs.  The economy expanded at a solid 5% annual pace in 2024 and the ruling Communist Party has set a target for growth at about that level this year.  But that was before Trump escalated his trade war, piling on still higher tariffs with an aim of compelling manufacturers to rebase production to the United States.  Overall, in April, the expansion in supply and demand slowed, with exports stunted and employment shrinking slightly. Manufacturers sought to reduce stocks, logistics were delayed, and prices remained under pressure. Market optimism weakened significantly, Wang Zhe, wrote senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. Business sentiment was at one of the lowest levels on record, Wang said.  Private economists have downgraded their forecasts for the economy this year and next. Capital Economics estimates the economy will expand only 3.5% in 2025.  The economy grew 5.4% from a year earlier in the first quarter of the year, as companies rushed to beat the higher tariffs. Chinese exports surged more than 12% year-on-year in March.  Although some Chinese exports will likely be diverted to other countries, Trumps trade war has raised the risk of recession in the U.S. and its impact is expected to ripple across the global economy.  The International Monetary Fund said in a recent update that the outlook for the U.S. and global economies this year and next has significantly worsened.  It forecast the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its estimate in January of 3.3%.",https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-tariffs-exports-trump-534bbbc0cbdafa70c43fb90ee5f5ae94,business
"After disasters, people are especially vulnerable to scams. Heres how to protect yourself","NEW YORK (AP)  During natural disasters like wildfires and floods, scammers often emerge to prey on victims.  People in heightened emotional states in the wake of a catastrophic event should be extra careful of impersonators asking for identifying details, according to Karina Layugan, an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission based in Los Angeles, where firefighters in the region are battling blazes that have already destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Scammers sometimes pretend to be from the utility company or the Federal Emergency Management Agency and ask to verify information. If someone uses that phrase, ask why the individual needs that information and always contact the company or agency directly, she said. Thats information those organizations should already have. Its something thats unfortunately very common, Layugan said. After disasters, people are also particularly vulnerable to people saying you need to act fast and using urgency to pressure people into taking actions that might not be in their best interest. Layugan stresses that FEMA will never charge fees for applications for aid, and that people should be skeptical of anyone who says theyll help others get FEMA relief soon and who charges up-front fees. The same goes for contractors. After a disaster, people looking to rebuild will get a flood of contractors coming to them and saying they can help and they know the system. Sometimes theyre looking for a quick payout, Layugan said. Be skeptical of anyone who promises immediate clean-up or immediate repairs. Oftentimes those types of individuals seek cash payments up front or do things without written contracts. Be very wary if anyone who wants cash up front or who urges you to act immediately. 
        
     Online review sites and searches for the contractors name with the word scam or complaints can help, as can confirming the license and insurance information of anyone you work with.  Always do your own research and get a second estimate, Layugan said.  In 2023 alone, roughly 1 million people reported identity theft, 2.6 million people reported fraud, and 1.9 million reported other types of scams to the FTC. Here are some ways to protect yourself from identity theft and scams, especially after disasters: It can take time to realize your data has been stolen. According to the FTC, signs include:  A phone, electricity, or gas account opened in your name  Debt collection calls for accounts you didnt open  Bills for things you didnt buy  Medical bills or insurance charges for procedures you didnt have  Inaccurate information on your credit report  Denial of loan applications  Mail that stops coming to, or is missing from, your mailbox  A missing tax refund or government benefits If you notice any of the above, heres what to do: Contact:  The FTC online at IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877-438-4338. The FTC will provide you with an individualized recovery plan. Prompts and questions will ask you how the thief has used your data  whether to open credit card accounts, get a car loan or lease in your name, or to file for government benefits.  The three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Ask them to place fraud alerts and a credit freeze on your accounts to prevent further misuse of your data.  The fraud department at your credit card issuers, bank, and other places where you have accounts, such as a medical insurance account. By acting quickly, you can prevent consequences to your credit score and financial health. False information on your credit report can cause lasting damage if not addressed promptly. After youve done the above, continue to review credit card and bank account statements. Watch for and report any unauthorized or suspicious transactions. The FTC recommends doing the following to keep your personal identity safe:  Collect your mail every day and place a hold on your mail when youll be on vacation or away.  Store personal information, including your Social Security card, in a safe place. Do not carry it in your wallet.  Never share your bank account number or Social Security number, especially over the phone to unknown callers or via email or text. While disasters can lead scammers to take advantage of vulnerable groups by impersonating representatives from relief and government agencies, or with contracting scams, other types of fraud and impersonation can also surround these events. If youre already feeling vulnerable, you may be more likely to fall for other types of fraud, such as:  Tax and medical information theft Medical ID theft and tax ID theft are common forms of identity theft, especially during tax season and Medicare re-enrollment periods.  ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

IRS is sending out automatic stimulus payments. Who is getting them?,"The IRS is distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who didnt receive their COVID stimulus payments. By the end of January, approximately 1 million taxpayers will receive special payments of up to $1,400 from the IRS.  The IRS said its distributing these payments to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who did not receive one or more Economic Impact Payments (EIP), also known as stimulus payments. Looking at our internal data, we realized that one million taxpayers overlooked claiming this complex credit when they were actually eligible, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. One taxpayer who benefitted was Ginny Bultman, 61, from Colorado. Bultman and her husband didnt receive a stimulus payment back in 2021. After reading about the latest IRS payments, she realized she qualified for the Recovery Rebate Credit. A day later, she got her check in the mail. It was a pleasant surprise, said Bultman, who owns a locksmith business in her town. The Bultman family received three late stimulus payments, including one for their underaged son, which amounted to $4,200 at the end of December. Heres what you need to know about the IRS payments.  The special payments announced by the IRS are being sent to those taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return but left the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit blank or they filled it out as $0 when they were actually eligible for the credit. 
        
     Payments will vary but the maximum amount will be $1,400 per individual. In total, the IRS will be distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns.  The IRS has posted information online about eligibility and how the payment was calculated. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who didnt receive the Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus payments, during 2020 and 2021.  The IRS announced this initiative after reviewing its internal data and finding that many eligible taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return didnt claim the credit. To minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, were making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it, said Werfel.  If you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you dont have to take any action. The IRS plans to send letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January. Theyll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayers 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.  You still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to the IRS. There were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents.  In March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In March 2021, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 per income tax filer and $1,400 per child under the American Rescue Plan Act. __ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

US gives initial approval for $3.5 billion missile sale to Saudi Arabia before Trumps planned visit,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  The United States has given initial approval to sell $3.5 billion worth of air-to-air missiles for Saudi Arabias fighter jets, the latest proposed arms deal for the region ahead of President Donald Trump s planned trip to the region later this month.  The sale, announced early Saturday, likely will be one of several heralded by Trump on his visit to the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has already said it wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, likely as a way to woo Trump to again pick the kingdom for his first formal trip as president. Trump traveled to Italy briefly for Pope Francis funeral.  Trumps 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of modern U.S. presidents typically first heading to Canada, Mexico or the United Kingdom for their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administrations close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region. The arms sale involves 1,000 AIM-120C-8 advanced medium range air-to-air missiles, guidance sections and other technical support. The missiles will be built by RTX Corp of Tucson, Ariz. The Royal Saudi Air Force has the worlds second-largest fleet of F-15 fighter jets after the U.S. This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that contributes to political stability and economic progress in the Gulf Region, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement. 
        
     The proposed sale now goes to the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers typically weigh in on such sales and, in some cases, can block them. Saudi Arabia has faced intense Congressional scrutiny for years, first for launching a war on Yemens Houthi rebels back in 2015 that saw the kingdoms airstrikes kill civilians. Then a Saudi assassination team killed Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018.  The U.S. intelligence community concluded the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who likely will meet Trump on his visit this month and met with President Joe Biden in his term, ordered the operation against Khashoggi. The kingdom insists the prince was not involved in the killing.  Trump maintained close ties to the Gulf states after leaving office. His second administration has already given initial approval for the energy-rich Mideast nation of Qatar to buy eight armed MQ-9B Reaper drones for its military, a purchase estimated to be worth nearly $2 billion.",https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-arms-sale-trump-visit-c7fdc0b4f345431c6bdff9436e2f8ea1,business
Heres why May the 4th is celebrated as Star Wars Day across the galaxy,"It didnt begin a long time ago or in a galaxy far far away, but every May 4 it feels like images, memes and promotional deals involving Star Wars have an inescapable gravity. May 4  or May the 4th, as fans say  has evolved over the years into Star Wars Day, an informal holiday celebrating the space epic and its surrounding franchise.   Star Wars Day was created by fans as a sly nod to one of the films most popular catchphrases, May the force be with you. Get it? Good, now May the 4th be with you too. Its not an official holiday but has become so well-known that even former President Joe Biden marked it last year when Star Wars actor Mark Hamill dropped by the White House a day beforehand. This year, the Trump administration marked the occasion with a Star Wars-themed meme.

(AP Photo/Hiro Komae, File) I think its a very clever way for fans to celebrate their passion and love for Star Wars once a year, said Steve Sansweet, founder and executive chairman of Rancho Obi-Wan, a nonprofit museum in California that has the worlds largest collection of Star Wars memorabilia.

(AP Photo/Haven Daley) The phrase May the 4th be with you was used by fans in the years after the first film was released in 1977, and even appeared in a British political ad in 1979 celebrating Margaret Thatchers victory as prime minister on May 4 that year. For some fans, the official Star Wars Day comes on May 25, the date of the first films release. The Los Angeles City Council even declared the date to be Star Wars Day in 2007, although the California Legislature voted in 2019 to designate May 4 as Star Wars Day.   May the 4th caught on informally among fans through inside jokes shared on social media and viewings of the films to mark the occasion. Businesses eventually joined in on the fun, with brands ranging from Nissan to Jameson Whiskey running ads or posting on social media about it. Disney, which acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, embraced the day as a way to further promote the franchise with merchandise, special screenings and other events surrounding the brand. Not all Star Wars fans are enthused about how ubiquitous the once-underground joke has become. Chris Taylor, a senior editor at Mashable and author of How Star Wars Conquered the Universe, labels himself a May the 4th grinch in part because of its commercialization.

(AP Photo/Haven Daley) I love a good dad joke as much as anyone, but my God you can take it too far, Taylor said. In western Germany, a Protestant congregation held a Star Wars-themed service Sunday, German news agency dpa reported. Pastor Samuel Drr and some of his congregants wore costumes and decorated their church in Bensberg.  The day is being celebrated on a large and small scale this year. Disney+ is launching the new series Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld on the date, and it comes as the second season gets underway for another franchise series, Andor. It also follows the announcement that a new stand-alone Star Wars film installment starring Ryan Gosling will be released in 2027. Disney marks the day with the launch of new Star Wars merchandise, ranging from lightsaber sets to jewelry. Most Major League Baseball teams have marked the day in recent years with special events incorporating Star Wars characters. For example, the San Francisco Giants sold special tickets for Saturdays game that included a bobblehead portraying pitcher Logan Webb as Obi-Webb Kenobi.  Its hard to find a place where May the 4th celebrations arent occurring, from bakeries serving cookies with a Star Wars theme to concerts featuring the memorable scores of the films.

The town of about 2,600 people, located 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Philadelphia, plans to have costumed characters throughout town with restaurants serving themed items like a YodaRita. I would always joke around and wish people May the 4th  but taking it to this level, Ive definitely upped my Star Wars nerdiness, said Michael Sklar, president of the Greater New Hope Chamber of Commerce. The White House posted an AI-generated image of a muscular Donald Trump in a jedi robe and wielding a red lightsaber. The image on X was accompanied by a Star Wars-themed broadside. Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy.

Musk gets his Texas wish. SpaceX launch site is approved as the new city of Starbase,"McALLEN, Texas (AP)  The South Texas home of Elon Musks SpaceX rocket company is now an official city with a galactic name: Starbase. A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a lopsided margin among the small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musks employees at SpaceX. With all the votes in, the tally was 212 in favor to 6 against, according to results published online by the Cameron County Elections Department.  Musk celebrated in a post on his social platform, X, saying it is now a real city!

(AP Photo/Valerie Gonzalez) Natalia Salinas holds a piata of Elon Musk during a protest at Boca Chica beach, Texas, on Saturday afternoon, May 3, 2025, hours before polls closed for the incorporation election that would turn Starbase into an official Texas city. (AP Photo/Valerie Gonzalez) Starbase is the facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program that is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA that hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars. Musk first floated the idea of Starbase in 2021 and approval of the new city was all but certain. Of the 283 eligible voters in the area, most are believed to be Starbase workers. The election victory was personal for Musk. The billionaires popularity has diminished since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trumps federal job and spending cuts, and profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted.  SpaceX has generally drawn widespread support from local officials for its jobs and investment in the area.  But the creation of an official company town has also drawn critics who worry it will expand Musks personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. 
        
     Companion efforts to the city vote include bills in the state Legislature to shift that authority from the county to the new towns mayor and city council.  All these measures come as SpaceX is asking federal authorities for permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year. The city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest midcentury homes.  SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they to want a company town and did not respond to emailed requests for comment.  We need the ability to grow Starbase as a community, Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders wrote to local officials in 2024 with the request to get the city issue on the ballot. The letter said the company already manages roads and utilities, as well as the provisions of schooling and medical care for those living on the property.

(AP Photo/Valerie Gonzalez) SpaceX officials have told lawmakers that granting the city authority to close the beach would streamline launch operations. SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base requires the closure of a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach. Critics say beach closure authority should stay with the county government, which represents a broader population that uses the beach and park. Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino, Jr. has said the county has worked well with SpaceX and there is no need for change. Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesnt comply with an order to evacuate the beach.  The South Texas Environmental Justice Network, which has organized protests against the city vote and the beach access issue, held another demonstration Saturday that attracted dozens of people. Josette Hinojosa, whose young daughter was building sandcastle nearby, said she was taking part to try to ensure continued access to a beach her family has enjoyed for generations.  With SpaceX, Hinojosa said, Some days its closed, and some days you get turned away,  Organizer Christopher Basald, a member of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas tribe, said his ancestors have long been in the area, where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf.  Its not just important, he said, its sacred.  ___ Vertuno reported from Austin, Texas.",https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-starbase-texas-city-7863bf3bac65e9718eef19b27978933b,business
NPR stations targeted for cuts by Trump have provided lifelines to listeners during disasters,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP)  After Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville, North Carolina, the sound coming from open car windows as residents gathered on a street at the top of a ridge trying to get cell service last fall was Blue Ridge Public Radio. And as they stood in line for water or food, the latest news they had heard on the station was a frequent topic of conversation. The public radio station was alerting people what was going on, said Lisa Savage, who volunteered at an area church after the hurricane.  Now public radio stations are being targeted for cuts by President Donald Trump. This week, he signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to NPR and PBS, alleging bias in the broadcasters reporting.  Public radio stations have been a lifeline for residents during natural disasters that take out power, the internet and cell towers. And in many remote and rural areas across the U.S., they can be a lone source of local news. About a week after she had volunteered in the Asheville area, Savage recalled driving through another hard-hit community and hearing updates on Blue Ridge Public Radio on where residents could pick up water.  So that was crucial, Savage said. In the West Texas desert, Marfa Public Radio provides listeners with a mix of local and national news and music. It is based in Marfa, a city of about 2,000 that draws tourists to its art scene. Marfa Public Radio is the only radio service in a lot of the geographic area that we cover, said Tom Livingston, the stations interim executive director. So its really essential in terms of if theres news events, if theres safety things that happen in the community. Trumps order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies to cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS and further requires that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the private CPB, which has said that it is not a federal executive agency subject to Trumps orders. The heads of PBS, NPR and CPB all suggested Friday that the order was illegal, and a court fight seems inevitable. The White House has also said it will be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. Local stations operate on a combination of government funding, donations and philanthropic grants, and stations in smaller markets are particularly dependent on the public money. WMMT, based in the eastern Kentucky community of Whitesburg, can be heard in parts of five Appalachian states. The stations general manager, Teddy Wimer, said listeners want to hear people that sound like folks that they know from Appalachia, and the station, which currently operates from a renovated Winnebago called the Possum Den, relies on CPB funding. Were in an economically disadvantaged area of the country, Wimer said. Most of our listeners who really rely upon our programming dont have the funds to ramp up their support. Livingston said about 30% of their funding comes from the CPB. Right now, he says, its too early to know if the cuts will actually happen or what they would impact if they do come through. Along the West Virginia-Virginia border, more than three hours from Washington, D.C., residents can pick up signals from radio stations far away. But those arent going have the local flavor and impact that we do, said Scott Smith, general manager of Allegheny Mountain Radio. This is the only game in town for that sort of thing. In his home base of Monterey, Virginia, Smith said theres about a 4 -square-mile (10.3-square-kilometer) area of cell coverage with one cell tower. The station has proven to be a vital source of information during natural disasters. In 2012, residents relied on it after a derecho knocked out power to 680,000 customers across West Virginia and it took nearly two weeks for some areas to get their service restored. Yeah, we play music. Yeah, we get on the air and joke around, he said. But were here providing basic level services of information, emergency information, that sort of thing, to our communities. And as part of that, were a pretty critical link in this area for the emergency alert system. Smith has a staff of 10 people at Allegheny Mountain Radio, which receives 68% of its annual budget from CPB. What CPB does fund the most is small rural radio, Smith said. When you take 60% of our income away, thats not readily or easily replaceable. Smith calls it a wait-and-see game on whether Congress will act on the CPB funding. The answer to how we move forward is vague, Smith said. We will still continue to be here as long as we can be. ___ Stengle reported from Dallas.

Play your cardinals right: Betting on next pope gains popularity ahead of the conclave,"ROME (AP)  Next weeks conclave to elect the successor to Pope Francis as leader of the worlds 1.4 billion Catholics is a solemn affair steeped in centuries-old traditions. But far from the Sistine Chapel where cloistered cardinals will cast votes, people are placing bets on who will be chosen as the next pope. From cash bets on websites to online games modeled after fantasy football leagues and casual wagers among friends and families, the popularity of guessing and gambling on the future of the papacy is increasing worldwide, experts and participants say.  Its even topped the Europa League soccer tournament and Formula One drivers championship, said Sam Eaton, U.K. manager for Oddschecker, a leading online platform analyzing odds across sports, events and other betting markets.  Theres a huge level of interest globally, he said. I dont think weve had a market like this where weve had so many countries interested in seeing odds. 
        
     Hundreds of thousands of people from some 140 countries have visited Oddschecker to review each cardinals chances of becoming the next pope, Eaton said. He noted special eagerness in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.  In the U.K., about 30,000 pounds (almost $40,000) have been wagered with one leading online betting platform as of this week, Eaton said  a far cry from 1.2 million pounds on the singing contest Eurovision but still noteworthy as a trend, with the conclave days away.  Betting on the next pope is definitely a niche market in the grand scheme of things, but it generates global interest, said Lee Phelps, a spokesman for William Hill, one of the U.K.s biggest bookmakers. 
        
     Since April 21, weve taken thousands of bets, and its the busiest of all our non-sports betting markets, said Phelps, who expects a surge in interest once the conclave begins Wednesday. Betting on elections, papal conclaves and all manner of global events is almost a tradition of its own in the U.K., but such betting is not legal in the United States. BetMGM, one of the worlds top sports-betting companies, said it would not have any bets up. But Eaton noted that in the unregulated, illegal space, one of the biggest sites has $10 million wagered so far in pope bets.  In Italy, betting on the papal election  and all religious events  is forbidden.  Some people in Rome are making friendly, informal wagers  the equivalent of $20 on a favorite cardinal, with the loser pledging to host a dinner or buy a pizza night out. Others are turning to an online game called Fantapapa, or Fantasy Pope, which mimics popular fantasy football and soccer leagues. More than 60,000 people are playing, each choosing 11 cardinals  as if for a soccer team  whom they believe have the best shot at becoming the next pope.  They also draft the top contender, or captain. As with online wagers, the No. 1 choice for fantasy players has been Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, closely followed by Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. Its a really fun game to play with friends and have a laugh, Italian student Federico La Rocca, 23, said. Initially my dad sent it to me ironically, but now that its going to be the conclave, I decided to have a go and try it.  La Rocca said he chose Tagle because he looks like a nice guy and fun person.  Players selections determine the number of points they rake in. But whats the jackpot?  Eternal glory, joked Mauro Vanetti, who created the game when Francis was hospitalized earlier this year.  Vanetti said he and his co-founder are against gambling, but they wanted to create something fun around the event.  It seems like in Italy theres a certain inquisitiveness about the mechanisms of the Catholic hierarchy, but its a critical curiosity, a sarcastic and playful curiosity, so we were interested in this jesting spirit for such a solemn event, Vanetti said. In some ways it deflates the sacredness, in a nonaggressive way. Beyond simply picking who the next pope will be, players and gamblers also can guess how many tries it will take the cardinals to choose the leader, which day of the week hell be elected, what new name he will decide on, or where his priorities will land on the progressive-conservative scale.  While the game and some of the bets have a novel or fun nature, anti-gambling advocates have raised overall concerns about legal gaming and the growing popularity of wagering on all manner of events.  A study published last fall found that 10% of young men in the U.S. show behavior that indicates a gambling problem, which is a rising concern in other parts of the world, too. And for gambling around the papacy in general, some have raised religious concerns. Catholic teaching doesnt go so far as to call games of chance or wagers sinful, but its Catechism warns that the passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement.  It says gambling becomes morally unacceptable if it gravely affects a persons livelihood.  ___ Hui reported from London.

Warren Buffetts profits fall on wildfire losses as thousands line up to listen to him Saturday,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  Warren Buffetts company reported just over one-third of last years profit Saturday a few hours before Buffett announced plans to retire as Berkshire Hathaways CEO at the end of the year.  Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel will take over as CEO as Buffett has long planned. Abel has already been overseeing all of Berkshires noninsurance businesses for years, but he will now take on responsibility for also overseeing the many insurance companies and deciding how to invest all of the conglomerates cash. The profit numbers were weighed down by a major drop in the value of its investments and $860 million in insurance losses related to policies that its insurance companies wrote before the devastating Southern California wildfires. Berkshire said it earned $4.6 billion, or $3,200 per Class A share, in the first quarter. Thats down from $12.7 billion, or $8,825 per Class A share, last year.  But Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshires operating earnings because those exclude the value of its investments, which can vary widely from quarter to quarter. Berkshire must include the value of its investments in its bottom line numbers even though it hasnt sold most of them. By that measure, Berkshires earnings were still down 14% at $9.6 billion, or $6,703.41 per A share. Last year, the conglomerate reported operating earnings of $11.2 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share. 
        
     The analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted Berkshire would report operating earnings of $7,076.90 per Class A share. Buffetts comments were the main attraction Saturday and his surprise retirement announcement overshadowed everything else. But investors have been wondering why Berkshire is now sitting on $347.7 billion cash as of the end of the first quarter, up from $334.2 billion at the end of the year. Buffett told shareholders that he just isnt finding any attractive deals for companies he understands. And he said the market didnt really drop enough in April to catch his attention. Buffett told shareholders that he nearly spent $10 billion on a deal recently but that fell through and he didnt disclose the details. Many of Berkshires myriad businesses like BNSF railroad and its assortment of manufacturing and retail businesses tend to follow the economy. Berkshire said Saturday that its future results may be affected by geopolitical events and trade policy, but its impossible to predict what will happen.  The pace of changes in these events, including international trade policies and tariffs, has accelerated in 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events, Berkshire said in the report.  But during the quarter, earnings improved at BNSF and Berkshires utility division while the manufacturing and retail businesses held steady. The main area where operating profits fell was in insurance underwriting, weighed down by the wildfire losses. Geicos underwriting profits were actually up at $2.2 billion from last years $1.9 billion. The results at reinsurance and primary insurance groups dragged down the insurance results. But Berkshire managers  just like every CEO  are worrying about the potential impact of tariffs on their business. Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said their restaurants should be able to weather the trade war OK even thought they have thousands of locations in China because most of its ingredients are sourced locally. But the tariffs are a greater concern to other Berkshire businesses like Brooks Running, which makes all of its shoes in Vietnam and Indonesia. Brooks CEO Dan Sheridan said his company will likely have to raise its prices because of the tariffs, but he is still waiting to see exactly which tariffs go into effect.  Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said the results appear solid outside of the wildfire losses, but Berkshire continued to be a net seller of stocks by unloading $1.5 billion more than it bought during the quarter. That contributed to the growing cash pile thats more than double where it was a year ago as Buffett has largely stayed on the sidelines while selling off much of Berkshires Apple stake. But Buffett still praised Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is attending the Berkshire shareholders meeting, for all the money he has made Berkshire. Berkshire Hathaway owns dozens of companies, including Geico, BNSF railroad, a collection of massive utilities and an assortment of retail and manufacturing businesses including well-known brands like Sees Candy. It also holds a massive stock portfolio.",https://apnews.com/article/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-shareholders-annual-meeting-c48c85fc5e1aa24f5dd64b271e57ab2e,business
Warren Buffett shocks shareholders by announcing his intention to retire at the end of the year,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  Billionaire Warren Buffett shocked an arena full of shareholders Saturday by announcing that he will retire at the end of the year, bringing the curtain down on a six-decade run leading Berkshire Hathaway that made him the most influential investor in the world. Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaways board on Sunday that Vice Chairman Greg Abel should replace him.  I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end, Buffett said. Abel has been Buffetts designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshires noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed that he would not take over until after Buffetts death. Previously the 94-year-old Buffett always said he had no plans to retire. Buffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question and answer period without taking any questions about it. He said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning. Abel returned an hour later without Buffett to conduct the companys formal business meeting, and he responded to the news. I just want to say I couldnt be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward, Abel said. Many investors have said they believe Abel will do a good job running Berkshire, but it remains to be seen how good he will be at investing Berkshires cash. Buffett endorsed him Saturday by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company. 
        
     I have no intention  zero  of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually, Buffett said. The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Gregs management than mine. Thousands of investors in the Omaha arena gave Buffett a prolonged standing ovation after his announcement in recognition of his 60 years leading the company. During that period Berkshire nearly doubled the returns of the S&P 500, with a 19.9% compounded annual growth rate compared with the indexs 10.4% gain. Buffett had such a devoted following among investors that markets would move when his investments were disclosed because so many people copied him. CFRA research analyst Cathy Seifert said it had to be hard for Buffett to decide to step down. This was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms, Seifert said. I think there will be an effort at maintaining a business as usual environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined. In many respects, Abel has already been running much of the company for years. But he hasnt been managing Berkshires insurance operations or deciding where to invest all of its cash. He will now take those tasks on, but Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will remain to help oversee the insurance companies. Investment manager Omar Malik of Hosking Partners in London said before Buffetts announcement that he wasnt worried about Berkshires future under Abel. Not really (worried). Hes had such a long time alongside Warren and a chance to know the businesses, Malik said about Abel. The question is will he allocate capital as dynamically as Warren? And the answer is no. But I think hell do a fine job with the support of the others. Cole Smead of Smead Capital Management said he wasnt surprised Buffett is stepping down after watching him Saturday because the 94-year-old wasnt as sharp as in past years. At one point, he made a basic math mistake in one of his answers. At other points, he got off track while telling stories about Berkshire and his investing without answering the question he was asked.  Abel is well regarded by Berkshires managers and Buffett has praised his business acumen for years. But he will have a hard time matching Buffetts legendary performance, and since he doesnt control 30% of Berkshires stock like Buffett does, he wont have as much leeway. I think the challenge hes going to have is if anyone is going to give him Buffett or (former Vice Chairman Charlie) Mungers pass card? Not a chance in Gods name, Smead said. Buffett always enjoyed a devoted following among shareholders. Buffett has said that Abel might even be a more hands-on manager than he is and get more out of Berkshires companies. Managers within the company say they have to be well prepared before talking to Abel because they know he will ask tough questions. Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, said he never thought he would see Buffett retire. I didnt think he would retire while his mind is still working so well, nor did I think itd happen at the annual meeting, Check said. But overall Im very happy for him. Earlier Saturday, Buffett warned of dire global consequences from President Donald Trumps tariffs while telling the thousands of investors gathered at his annual meeting that trade should not be a weapon but theres no question that trade can be an act of war.  Buffett said Trumps trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.  Its a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who dont like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done, Buffett said as he addressed the topic on everyones mind at the start of the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting. While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesnt think Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous. Buffett said he just doesnt see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, so Berkshire is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for. Buffett said the recent turmoil in the markets that generated headlines after Trumps tariff announcement last month is really nothing. He dismissed the recent drop as relatively small. He cited when the Dow Jones industrial average went from 240 on the day he was born in 1930 down to 41 during the Great Depression as a truly significant drop in the markets. Currently the Dow Jones Industrial Average sits at 41,317.43. This has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort, he said. Buffett said he hasnt bought back any of Berkshires shares this year either because they dont seem to be a bargain either. Investor Chris Bloomstran, who is president of Semper Augustus Investments Group, told the Gabelli investment conference Friday that a financial crisis might be the best thing for Berkshire because it would create opportunities to invest at attractive prices. Berkshire needs a crisis. I mean Berkshire thrives in crisis, Bloomstran said.  The meeting attracts some 40,000 people every year who want to hear from Buffett, including some celebrities and well-known investors. This year, Hillary Rodham Clinton also attended. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly because he has shied away from politics and any controversial topic in recent years for fear of hurting Berkshires businesses.  One investor even camped outside the arena overnight to be first in line. Devan Bisher, 72, said he has faith in Berkshires future and does not plan to sell the stock he started buying in the 1980s.  Its been a good train to ride, Bisher said, and Im going to stay with it.",https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-shareholders-annual-meeting-a421061233f99859673fb131ce020d4d,business
Dont have a REAL ID yet? That could cause travel headaches after May 7,"NEW YORK (AP)  The deadline to get a REAL ID is almost here, after nearly two decades of postponements and delays. While it was initially said that you would not be able to fly domestically without a REAL ID or other TSA-approved form of identification once the May 7 deadline hits, the head of Homeland Security said Tuesday that travelers will still be able to fly, but should be prepared for additional steps at TSA. If you still dont have your REAL ID and are confused about how to get one, or are wondering why you even need one in the first place, here are some things to know: Its a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that the DHS says is a more secure form of identification. Thats because getting a REAL ID requires more personal documentation than whats required to obtain a regular license. Besides needing a REAL ID to fly domestically, you will also need one to access certain federal buildings and facilities. When the REAL ID Act was signed into law in 2005, it enacted a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission that the government set security standards for state-issued drivers licenses and IDs. REAL ID is a coordinated effort by the federal government to improve the reliability and accuracy of drivers licenses and identification cards, John Essig, the Transportation Security Administrations Security Director for airports in the New York City region said in a press release on April 3. The improvements are intended to inhibit terrorists ability to evade detection by using fraudulent identification. 
        
     The REAL ID Act was supposed to begin rolling out in 2008, but has faced repeated delays due to state implementation challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic, said Nina Ruggiero, senior editorial director for Travel + Leisure. The combination of varying state processes and shifting deadlines has added to the overall confusion around REAL IDs and likely led some travelers to take the deadlines less seriously. If youve gotten a new ID in the last few years, it could already be REAL ID-compliant. I also hear from travelers who are confused as to whether or not they already have a REAL ID, Ruggiero said. Some people who have recently renewed their license may already have a compliant ID and not know it, so you may want to double-check yours before starting the process. A REAL ID-compliant drivers license has a symbol ( in most states, a star ) in the top corner of the card. If you live in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont or Washington, its possible you could have an enhanced ID card instead, which permits you to both fly domestically and cross land and sea borders into Mexico and Canada from the U.S. It does not, however, allow you to fly into either of those countries. Enhanced IDs will have an American flag icon, as well as the word enhanced at the top of the card. The requirements vary by state, so you will need to visit the website of your states drivers licensing agency to find out the specific steps, including whether youll need to make an appointment at a DMV and what documentation youll need when you get there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Tuesday that those who still lack an identification that complies with the REAL ID law may be diverted to a different line, have an extra step. Noem also said that security checkpoints will be accepting passports and tribal identification when the deadline hits Wednesday in place of a REAL ID. But people will be allowed to fly, she said. We will make sure its as seamless as possible. In mid-April, a group of state senators from Kentucky asked the agency to delay implementing the new requirements yet again. They said the state has limited appointments available to people seeking the new cards and that there has been a rush to meet the May 7 deadline. However, TSA spokesperson Dan Velez told the AP that the agency does not intend to delay the REAL ID deadline again. As of late April, 81% of travelers at TSA checkpoints were presenting acceptable identification, including a state-issued REAL ID, according to DHS.",https://apnews.com/article/real-id-tsa-dhs-air-travel-5005fc6ad2b59bc96d1ee43db08e0ea4,business
"United Airlines cuts 35 daily flights at Newark airport, citing shortage of air traffic controllers","NEW YORK (AP)  Passengers with flights to or from Newark Liberty International Airport encountered long delays and cancellations Saturday due to an air traffic controller shortage, a nationwide problem the Trump administration has pledged to fix. The busy airport outside New York City experienced disruptions all week. Faulting the Federal Aviation Administrations alleged failure to address long-simmering challenges related to the air-traffic control system, United Airlines cut 35 daily flights from its Newark schedule starting Saturday.  United CEO Scott Kirby said the technology used to manage planes at the New Jersey airport failed more than once in recent days. The flight delays, cancellations and diversions the equipment problems caused were compounded when more than one-fifth of Newarks traffic controllers walked off the job, he said.  This particular air traffic control facility has been chronically understaffed for years and without these controllers, its now clear  and the FAA tells us  that Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead, Kirby wrote in a letter to customers.  Airport status reports from the FAA said staffing issues were causing average delays of nearly two hours and ones as long as five hours for flights scheduled to arrive at Newark on Saturday morning. Departures were delayed by an average of 45 minutes. , and average delays of 45 minutes for departures on Saturday morning, according to the status reports.  
        
     By late afternoon, arriving flights were running more than three hours behind schedule, while the delay for departing flights had shortened to a half-hour on average. The misery map maintained by flight tracking company FlightAware showed the ripple effect on airports in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, Dallas and other cities.  United Airlines operates the most flights out of Newark by far, and 35 flights represents about 10% of the round-trip domestic schedule operated by the carrier and its regional United Express network, according to information on the companys website.  Newark Liberty International Airport pointed to both staffing issues and construction when it warned travelers about delays on Thursday.  The Trump administration says its been trying to supercharge  the air traffic controller workforce and make moves to address the nations shortage of controllers. The U.S. transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, on Thursday announced a program to recruit new controllers and give existing ones incentives not to retire. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a workers union, said at the time that those moves could help address staffing shortages, but it also said the system is  long overdue for technology and infrastructure upgrades. Duffy said on Friday that he visited with our hard working air traffic controllers as we work to fix these equipment outages caused by outdated technology.  Uniteds decision to pare back its flight schedule in Newark come at an already uncertain time for U.S. airlines. Potential customers across the industry are reconsidering whether to fly for work or for vacation given all the unknowns about what President Donald Trumps trade war will do to the economy.  Uncertainty is so high that United recently made the unusual move to offer two separate forecasts for how it could perform financially this year: one if there were a recession, and one if not.  From Newark, United flies to 76 U.S. cities and 81 international destinations.",https://apnews.com/article/newark-airport-flight-delays-cancellations-united-d0f8a2fbc8844a05ab9e7d577922c141,business
"Who is Greg Abel, the executive picked to be successor to Warren Buffett?","OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  When Warren Buffett announced at his annual shareholder meeting Saturday that he is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, he elevated a low-key 62-year-old Canadian executive named Greg Abel who has long been one of his top lieutenants. For the past seven years, Abel has been overseeing Berkshires BNSF railroad and its treat makers Sees Candies and Dairy Queen along with dozens of other manufacturing and retail businesses that Buffett acquired over the years. He grew up in Canada as a hockey player and learned the value of hard work as he redeemed discarded bottles and worked for a small company filling fire extinguishers. Now he finds himself at the top of the food chain in the investment world. Berkshire confirmed Abel as Buffetts successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at the annual meeting. Since then, Abel has largely remained in Buffetts shadow although shareholders have had a chance to get to know him a bit when he appeared alongside Buffett at the annual meetings and in interviews. Berkshires board will now vote on whether to formally approve Abel as the new CEO to take over at the end of 2025. At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote. Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshires eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerates massive stock portfolio. Buffett and members of Berkshires board who for years have devoted much of their time to finding Buffetts successor have praised Abels brilliance and knack for understanding all kinds of businesses. 
        
     Buffett once said Berkshire is so damn lucky to have Abel ready to take over, but he will have trouble coming close to Buffetts remarkable track record of outpacing the market. Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshires massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerates bottom line. Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett that made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson said two days before the announcement that he believed Abel was ready to take over. Is he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know. But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren, Olson said. He is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker. Buffett has said for years that Abels main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshires unique decentralized culture built on independence, integrity and trust. In fact, Mungers comment that gave away Abels future role was that Greg will keep the culture. Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and hes always available when they need him though he will challenge them. When I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts, Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said Friday. The intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well. Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into his background to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honored him in 2018. Abels family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfathers Omaha grocery store as a kid. I think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely, Abel said in 2018.  Abel lives about two hours from Buffetts hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralized that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.",https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-greg-abel-berkshire-hathaway-successor-6a4abcce5a472878074c9b66d8da4771,business
Driver of Ctour Holiday van involved in Idaho crash was licensed in California,"WEST YELLOWSTONE, Mont. (AP)  Idaho State Police said Saturday that the driver of the tour van involved in a deadly collision with a pickup truck was licensed in California and the company that organized the trip was Ctour Holiday LLC, a large tour operator that provides international travel services. The pickup truck driver and six people in the Mercedes van were killed in the crash, which occurred Thursday evening on U.S. Highway 20 near Henrys Lake State Park in eastern Idaho as the tour group was headed to Yellowstone National Park.  Police identified the pickup driver as 25-year-old Isaih Moreno of Humble, Texas. They have not said whether the driver of the van was among the dead. Ctour Holiday did not immediately respond Saturday to messages seeking comment.  The van passengers included 12 people of Chinese nationality and one Italian. Police said they were working closely with Ctour Holiday and in contact with the two countries consulates.  The Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco said via email that five Chinese citizens were killed and eight were injured.  The consulate immediately activated its emergency mechanism to provide consular protection and assistance to the injured and the families of the victims, it added.  The crash remains under investigation, and police said the bodies would be taken to the Ada County Coroners Office for autopsies and formal confirmation of their identities.  
        
     Three people were seriously injured: Two were flown to an Idaho Falls hospital and one to a hospital in Bozeman, Montana, according to police. Information on their conditions was not released, and the hospitals did not immediately respond to messages seeking updates.  Others were taken to local hospitals with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. Due to privacy considerations, no information regarding the medical status of the injured will be released, police said in a statement.",https://apnews.com/article/tourist-crash-yellowstone-fatal-crash-79cf53a0d675e598e328d9cf615a7ea0,business
Rain Barrel Village gives visitors a taste of old Florida and a photo op with a giant lobster,"ISLAMORADA, Fla. (AP)  A holdover of the once numerous roadside attractions that lined U.S. 1 from Jacksonville to Key West, the Rain Barrel Village is collection of eccentric, colorful buildings serving as a home for artists and art sellers in the Florida Keys.  While the rustic outpost might be easy for travelers on the Overseas Highway to pass without notice, the giant lobster out front is not. Rain Barrel Village, on an Islamorada island, promises visitors a unique experience filled with paintings, sculptures, jewelry, clothing, handcrafted goods and island-inspired souvenirs. Besides shops offering original artwork, the Village is home to Betsy, a 30-foot-tall, 40-foot-long (9-meter-tall, 12-meter-long) sculpture of a Florida Keys spiny lobster. Sande Keil, who owns Rain Barrel Village with her husband, said the Keys became part of her familys heartbeat after the Miami couple bought a vacation home on Islamorada in 1978.

I just knew it needed someone to preserve it and to help grow it. Named after the large cisterns that once provided drinking water to the Keys, Rain Barrel Village isnt just about selling souvenirs, it is about supporting a community, Keil said. As an artist herself, Keil is proud to support other artists, artisans and small business owners and give them a space where they also can build something real. Weve poured love, hard work and intention into the Rain Barrel, Keil said. Weve created something that reflects who we are.

(AP Photo/David Fischer) While artists make up the soul of the Village, the face is undeniably Betsy. She is among the most photographed landmarks in the Florida Keys, second only to the Southernmost Point Buoy in Key West. Jennifer Cullen, property manager and owner of a souvenir shop called the Tipsy Octopus, said Betsy definitely prompts people to pull over as they make their way down to Marathon or Key West. People love to take pictures with her, Cullen said. Shes a great roadside attraction. We love her. Artist Richard Blaze completed Betsy in 1985. The fiberglass statue originally was commissioned for a local restaurant, but the business had closed by the time Betsy was done. The giant lobster was placed at another Islamorada attraction, Treasure Village, but she ended up in storage after the location became a charter school. Betsy was relocated to Rain Barrel Village in 2009. After stopping to see Betsy, visitors can discover the cluster of small, unique shops, along with a garden area and two cafes. Megan Stennes was visiting the Keys with her family in April and made sure they stopped at Rain Barrel Village on their way back to Palm Beach Gardens. She knew her mother would enjoy all the stores, which she discovered by accident on a previous visit. I just wanted a picture with Betsy, and then I realized that they had all the shops back here, Stennes said. So we came in, and we actually were here longer than I expected to be. William Purser, owner of Sculptured Glass, has been at the Rain Barrel Village for more than two decades. Visitors can watch as he shapes molten glass into detailed figurines of fish, birds and other wildlife common to the Florida Keys.  He discovered the village while visiting art galleries in the Keys and liked the idea of being surrounded by other artists. We all have something in common, and doing your artwork is what its all about, whatever your media is, Purser said. We all want the same things from our work. You want to progress, you dont want to stay stagnant. You just keep growing and growing. A place like Rain Barrel Village is great for visitors because the inventory is always changing depending on what the artists are inspired to create, he said.

Were always constantly making different pieces. Judith Chesher, owner of Art on a Whim, sells work from about 30 different Keys artists at her store. I try to find unique and different things, which is not hard because the Keys are full of artists doing all kinds of weird things, Chesher said. The free-spirit nature of the Keys has a long history of attracting artists and those communities tend to strengthen and encourage each other, she said. Its a good atmosphere, Chesher said. The thing about the Keys is you dont usually get hassled. Just dont break any real serious laws, and you dont have to wear shoes.",https://apnews.com/article/rain-barrel-village-florida-lobster-statue-cf8a41b8a05fc463dd80d6f27cea87fb,business
Arizona communities bank on Trumps push for coal to ensure theyre not forgotten,"JOSEPH CITY, Ariz. (AP)  Brantley Baird never misses a chance to talk history, from how his great-grandmother helped settle the town of Snowflake long before Arizona was granted statehood to tales of riding to school bareback and tethering his horse outside the one-room schoolhouse. His family worked the land and raised livestock, watching the railroad come and go and cattle empires rise and fall. Then came the coal-fired power plants, built throughout northern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico to power progress in distant Western cities. The plants would play their own role in the history of the region and could wind up at the center of its uncertain future. The Cholla Power Plant stands just down the road from where Baird, 88, has been building a museum to showcase covered wagons, weathered farm implements and other remnants of frontier days. For years the plant powered the local economy, providing jobs and tax revenues for the unincorporated community of Joseph City, its schools and neighboring towns, but now the vapors from its stacks have dissipated. These days, change is in the air. Cholla is the latest in a long line of U.S. coal-fired plants to retire, shutting down in March. Arizona Public Service said it had become too costly to operate due to strict environmental regulations. The mandates were aimed at reining in coal-burning utilities, long viewed by scientists as major contributors to warming the planet. Last month, however, President Donald Trump reversed course, signing new executive orders aimed at restoring  beautiful, clean coal  to the forefront of U.S. energy supplies. He urged his administration to find ways to reopen Cholla and delay the planned retirements of others. As part of his push toward energy independence, Trump has pledged to tap domestic sources  coal included  to fuel a new wave of domestic manufacturing and technology, namely innovations in artificial intelligence. 
        
     In the West, where the vision of far-off politicians sometimes crashes against reality, Baird and many of his neighbors were encouraged that Trump put Cholla in the spotlight, but theres some skepticism about what the utilities will do with the plants. As many jobs as it gives people, as much help just to our school district right here that we get out of there, were hoping that it will come back, too, said Baird, who used to work at the Cholla plant and has served on the Joseph City School Board. Yet, he and others wonder if its too late for coal. Just weeks before Trump announced his plans, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected a 65% increase in retirements of coal-fired generation in 2025 compared with last year. The largest plant on that list is the 1,800-megawatt Intermountain Power Project in Utah. Its being replaced by a plant capable of burning natural gas and hydrogen. Utilities, already looking to increase capacity, arent sure Trumps orders will lead them back to coal. I think its safe to say that those plants that are scheduled or slated to retire are probably still going to move in that direction, for a couple of reasons, said Todd Snitchler, CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents power plant owners. One of which is its very difficult to plan multimillion- or billion-dollar investments for environmental retrofits and other things on an executive order versus a legislative approach. Last month, Republicans in the Arizona Legislature sent a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum warning that the economic fallout from the 2019 closure of the Navajo Generating Station is still reverberating. The stacks were demolished, and the mine that supplied the plant closed. At the San Juan Generating Station in northwestern New Mexico, operations ended in 2022. Stuck in the middle are Joseph City and other communities where life revolves around a power plant. Residents hope Trump can help keep them in the energy race for another generation. From Joseph City to Springerville, theyve been preparing to absorb major hits to the job market, tax rolls and school enrollment. Options are slim in Apache and Navajo counties  two of Arizonas poorest. Utility executives told Arizona regulators recently that reopening Cholla would be costly for customers and that they plan to push ahead with renewable energy. The plants infrastructure would be preserved as a possible site for future nuclear or gas-fired power generation, and the Springerville Generating Station could be repurposed once the last units are retired in 2032. The utility that runs the coal-fired Coronado Generating Station, just 30 miles (48 kilometers) away in St. Johns, also has plans to convert to natural gas. In Springerville, the idea of spoiling the surrounding grasslands and ancient volcanic fields with 112 wind turbines  with blades standing taller than Seattles Space Needle  provokes outrage. Banners and posters objecting to the proposal are plastered around town. They all know that this wont work, that we cant rely on wind and solar, said Doug Henderson, a Springerville plant retiree who now sits on the town council. He says coal-fired generation can accommodate swings in demand, regardless of whether theres sunshine or wind. Springerville Mayor Shelly Reidhead and others are fighting to keep the wind farm from happening, saying repurposing the Springerville coal plant would mean more jobs and preserve the surrounding landscape. We also survive on tourism and people dont want to come here and look at that, Reidhead said of the turbines. The Western Drug and General Store is adorned with tiny American flags tacked up outside. A sign advertises canning supplies, but locals joke that you can get anything here  from slippers to rifles. Andrea Hobson works the register and knows everyone by name. She moved to Springerville about 20 years ago from California and says its hard to imagine the community without the power plant. It would be a ghost town. It really would, she said. Thats the heart of this town. Springervilles leaders have lost sleep trying to figure out what industries might fill the void. At stake are about 350 jobs, dozens of contract employees and the businesses they support  from the general store and the new frozen yogurt shop to the hospital and local churches. Some workers drive an hour to the Springerville plant every day, meaning other communities also will lose out, said Randel Penrod, a former crew manager at the plant. With retirement looming, the plant has trimmed its workforce. Henderson, the Springerville town council member, fears it could take years to permit a new plant. Reidhead is more hopeful after attending meetings with members of Arizonas congressional delegation and utility executives. She thinks the Trump administration can reduce the red tape and get new plants up and running. The development of artificial intelligence and its thirst for power gives the mission a sense of urgency. I think our politicians at a state level have realized with AIs need for the power, that if we dont get on board and get on board soon were going to be left behind, she said. Some energy analysts say Trumps support of coal is mostly symbolic, since utilities hold the keys. Others say diversifying energy sources is a must as the U.S. sees increases in power demand predicted for the first time in decades. AI may be artificial, but the electricity it needs is very real  and in some regions, coal still keeps the lights on when other sources may blink, said Scott Segal, a partner with the Washington D.C.-based firm Bracewell LLP. He said power markets dont care about politics  just reliability, affordability and sustainability. Just outside of Joseph City, crews are building what will be one of the largest solar and battery storage projects in Arizona. The solar panels will be installed on leased private land, including Bairds sprawling ranch. While not a fan of all the dust being kicked up, Baird knows the advent of solar is just another of many changes he has seen in his lifetime  and he has no idea what the next 100 years might look like. Hell, who knows? he said. You know, when it comes right down to it, well just wait and see. ___ Associated Press writer Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-coal-power-plants-arizona-new-mexico-1b4c706e3005de79e2a4fe9700a6286b,business
"Amid Cinco de Mayo celebrations, a tax on Mexican tomatoes looms","Guacamole has been spared from tariffs for now. But salsa may not be so lucky. While President Donald Trump put threatened tariffs on Mexican avocados on pause, the U.S. government plans to put a nearly 21% duty on fresh Mexican tomatoes starting July 14. A duty  like a tariff  is a tax on imports, and this one would impact the 4 billion pounds of tomatoes the U.S. imports from Mexico each year. Proponents say the import tax will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure the produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70% of U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Unless we even the playing field in terms of fair pricing, youre not going to have a domestic industry for fresh tomatoes in the very near future, Robert Guenther, the trade groups executive vice president, said. Florida and California are the top U.S. producers of tomatoes, but most of Californias crop is turned into sauces and other products. Opponents say the duty will make fresh tomatoes more expensive for U.S. buyers. NatureSweet, a San Antonio-based company that grows tomatoes in Mexico as well as the U.S., said it will be paying millions of dollars each month in duties if the decision isnt reversed. We will look for ways to adapt or streamline our operations, but the truth is, we are always doing that so we run an efficient business already, said Skip Hulett, NatureSweets chief legal officer. Produce is not a large-margin business. Were determining what portion of the cost we could absorb, but these added costs will most certainly need to be passed on to the consumer. 
        
     Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, expects U.S. retail prices for tomatoes to rise by around 10.5% if the duty goes through. Mexicos government said last month it was convinced it could negotiate over the issue. But if the tomato tax takes effect, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has hinted her country may impose duties on chicken and pork legs imported from the U.S. The tug-of-war over tomatoes has a long history. In 1996, shortly after the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, the U.S. Department of Commerce investigated allegations that Mexico was exporting tomatoes to the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping. The U.S. government agreed to suspend the investigation if Mexico met certain rules, including selling its tomatoes at a minimum price. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides always reached an agreement that avoided duties. But last month, the Commerce Department announced its withdrawal from the latest agreement, saying it had been flooded with comments from U.S. tomato growers who want better protection from Mexican imports. Guenther, of the Florida Tomato Exchange, said even though Mexican exporters are required to charge a minimum price, shipments are only spot-checked, so exporters can get around that. But more generally, Mexico hurts the U.S. industry because it costs 40% to 50% less to grow tomatoes there, Guenther said. Land is cheaper, labor is cheaper and inputs like seeds and fertilizer cost less, he said. Tomatoes are a labor-intensive crop, Guenther said, and the U.S. industry typically relies on immigrant workers through the H-2A visa program. That program required farmers to pay workers an average of $16.98 per hour last year, an amount that has jumped as labor has become harder to find. Richards estimates that workers on Mexican tomato farms earn about one-tenth that rate. NatureSweet acknowledges that its more cost-effective to grow tomatoes in Mexico, but says climate is one of the biggest reasons. The companys Mexican greenhouses dont need lighting, heating or cooling systems because of the year-round weather conditions. You can relocate some industries, but you cant relocate climate agriculture, Hulett said. Lance Jungmeyer, the president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes, said Florida doesnt produce the vine-ripened tomatoes that U.S. consumers increasingly favor. Florida tomatoes are picked when theyre green and shipped to warehouses to ripen, he said. Florida doesnt grow the kinds of specialty tomatoes that have taken off, but they want to get protection, Jungmeyer said. Their market share is dropping for reasons of their own choice. Guenther disagrees. If you put a Florida tomato up against a Mexican tomato, I think it would do very well in taste test, he said. Adrian Burciaga, co-owner of Don Artemio, an upscale Mexican restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, wouldnt want to switch to a U.S. producer. He compares it to fine wine; if he wants a good cabernet sauvignon, he gets it from Napa, California. If he wants a good tomato that reminds him of his childhood, he gets it from Mexico. We know the flavors they are going to bring to the salsas and moles. We dont want to compromise flavors, Burciaga said. Burciaga said his restaurant uses 300 to 400 pounds of Roma tomatoes from Mexico every week. He currently pays $19 for a 25-pound crate of tomatoes. He doesnt relish paying the additional cost, but he feels he has no choice. Burciaga said the tomato duty  and the threat of Trump implementing the paused 25% tariff on many other products from Mexico  are making it difficult to run his business. The uncertainty part concerns us. A small or medium restaurant budgets things out. We know in advance that in six months things will increase, so were able to adjust, he said. But we dont know these things in advance. How do you plan and how do you react? ___ AP Reporter Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/tomatoes-tariffs-duties-mexico-20526c2691a35b1bff53c2dedb0fa4f5,business
"Trump, in a new interview, says he doesnt know if he backs due process rights","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)  President Donald Trump is circumspect about his duties to uphold due process rights laid out in the Constitution, saying in a new interview that he does not know whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens alike deserve that guarantee. He also said he does not think military force will be needed to make Canada the 51st state and played down the possibility he would look to run for a third term in the White House. The comments in a wide-ranging, and at moments combative, interview with NBCs Meet the Press came as the Republican presidents efforts to quickly enact his agenda face sharper headwinds with Americans just as his second administration crossed the 100-day mark, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Trump, however, made clear that he is not backing away from a to-do list that he insists the American electorate broadly supported when they elected him in November. Here are some of the highlights from the interview with NBCs Kristen Welker that was taped Friday at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida and aired Sunday.

     Critics on the left have tried to make the case that Trump is chipping away at due process in the United States. Most notably, they cite the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was living in Maryland when he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and imprisoned without communication.  Trump says Abrego Garcia is part of a violent transnational gang. The Republican president has sought to turn deportation into a test case for his campaign against illegal immigration despite a Supreme Court order saying the administration must work to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Asked in the interview whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, Trump was noncommittal. I dont know. Im not, Im not a lawyer. I dont know, Trump said when pressed by Welker.  The Fifth Amendment provides due process of law, meaning a person has certain rights when it comes to being prosecuted for a crime. Also, the 14th Amendment says no state can deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Trump said he has brilliant lawyers ... and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. He said he was pushing to deport some of the worst, most dangerous people on Earth, but that courts are getting in his way. I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it, Trump said.

Before his White House meeting on Tuesday with newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump is not backing away from the rhetoric that has angered Canadians.  Trump, however, told NBC that it was highly unlikely that the U.S. would need to use military force to make Canada the 51st state.  He offered less certainty about whether his repeated calls for the U.S. to take over Greenland from NATO-ally Denmark can be achieved without military action. Something could happen with Greenland, Trump said. Ill be honest, we need that for national and international security. ... I dont see it with Canada. I just dont see it, I have to be honest with you. Trump said the U.S. economy is in a transition period but he expects it to do fantastically despite the economic turmoil sparked by his tariffs. He offered sharp pushback when Welker noted that some Wall Street analysts now say the chances of a recession are increasing. Well, you know, you say, some people on Wall Street say, Trump said. Well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that were going to have the greatest economy in history. He also deflected blame for the 0.3% decline in the U.S. economy in the first quarter. He said he was not responsible for it.  I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because hes done a terrible job, referring to his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. Trump doubled down on his recent comments at a Cabinet meeting that children might have to have two dolls instead of 30, denying that is an acknowledgment his tariffs will lead to supply shortages. Im just saying they dont need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They dont need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.

(Kevin Lamarque/Pool Photo via AP) The president has repeatedly suggested he could seek a third term in the White House even though the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution says that No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. Trump told NBC there is considerable support for him to run for a third term. But this is not something Im looking to do, Trump said. Im looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.  Trumps previous comments about a third term sometimes seem more about provoking outrage on the political left. The Trump Organization is even selling red caps with the words Trump 2028. But at moments, he has suggested he was seriously looking into a third term. In a late March phone interview with NBC, Trump said, Im not joking. There are methods which you could do it.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump said in the interview that Vice President JD Vance is doing a fantastic job and is brilliant. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom Trump last week tasked to simultaneously serve as acting national security adviser, is great, the president said. But Trump said it is far too early to begin talking about his potential successor. He is confident that his Make America Great Again movement will flourish beyond his time in the White House. You look at Marco, you look at JD Vance, whos fantastic, Trump said. You look at  I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now just sitting here. No, I think we have a tremendous party. And you know what I cant name? I cant name one Democrat. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz speaks during a television interview at the White House, Thursday, May 1, 2025, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been under fire for his participation in Signal text chains in which sensitive information about military planning was shared. But Trump said he is not looking to replace his Pentagon chief.  No. Not even a little bit. No. Petes going to be great, Trump said. Hegseths job is totally safe. The president also said his decision to nominate national security adviser Mike Waltz to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was not punishment for starting the chain to which Waltz inadvertently added a reporter. No. I just think hell do a nice job in the new position, Trump said. He said his decision to have Rubio take over Waltzs duties will likely be temporary. Marcos very busy doing other things, so hes not going to keep it long term. Were going to put somebody else in, Trump said, adding that it would nonetheless be possible to do both jobs indefinitely. You know, theres a theory. Henry Kissinger did both. Theres a theory that you dont need two people. But I think I have some really great people that could do a good job. One person he said he is not considering for the post? Top policy aide Stephen Miller. Well, Id love to have Stephen there, but that would be a downgrade, he said. Stephen is much higher on the totem pole than that, in my opinion. Trump denied he is profiting from the presidency, even as he continues to promote a series of business ventures, including cryptocurrency holdings. Im not profiting from anything. All Im doing is, I started this long before the election. I want crypto. I think cryptos important because if we dont do it, Chinas going to. And its new, its very popular, its very hot, Trump said, adding that he hasnt even even looked at how much hes made from the venture. Just days before taking office, Trump launched his own meme coin, which surged in value after it announced that top holders would be invited to an exclusive dinner at the presidents Washington-area golf club later this month and a tour of the White House. He also helped launch World Liberty Financial, another cryptocurrency venture, last year. Thats in addition to a long list of other business ventures, from Trump Media & Technology Group, which runs his Truth Social site, to branded sneakers, watches and colognes and perfumes. Being president probably cost me money if you really look, Trump said. In fact, I do something that no other president has done, they think maybe George Washington has done.  He added: I contribute my entire salary to the government, back to the government. And Im doing it again. Trump said he is open to extending the deadline for a deal on TikTok once again.  Id like to see it done, he said. I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok. TikTok is  its very interesting, but itll be protected.  He later added: If it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension, might not need it. Last month, Trump used executive action to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for another 75 days to give his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership. White House officials had believed they were close to a deal in which the apps operations would have been spun off into a new company based in the U.S. and owned and operated by a majority of American investors. But Beijing hit the brakes after Trump slapped wide-ranging tariffs on nations across the globe. We actually have a deal. We have a group of purchasers, very substantial people. Theyre going to pay a lot of money. Its a good thing for us. Its a good thing for China. Its going to be, I think, very good, he said. But because of the fact that Ive essentially cut off China right now with the tariffs that are so high that theyre not going to be able to do much business with the United States. But if we make a deal with China Im sure thatll be a subject, and itll be a very easy subject to solve. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-due-process-canada-greenland-military-action-8da3e853b6cec944ec373fae4d317ac4,business
Thunderbolts kicks off the summer movie season with $76 million at the box office,"NEW YORK (AP)  Marvel Studios Thunderbolts opened with $76 million in domestic ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, kicking off the summer box office with a solid No. 1 debut that fell shy of Marvels more spectacular launches. All eyes had been on whether Thunderbolts  a team-up of antihero rejects similar to Avengers  could restore the Walt Disney Co. superhero factory to the kind of box office performance the studio once enjoyed so regularly. The results  similar to the debuts of The Eternals ($71 million) and Ant-Man and the Wasp ($75 million)  suggested Marvels malaise wont be so easy to snap out of. Some had expected a bigger opening for Thunderbolts because of the films good word-of-mouth. Unlike most recent MCU entries, reviews (88% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been excellent for Thunderbolts, directed by Jake Schreier and starring Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Sebastian Stan. Audiences gave it an A- CinemaScore.

(Photo by Scott A Garfitt/Invision/AP) That kind of response should power the movie to strong business in the coming weeks. Though bigger MCU films  including 2024s Deadpool vs. Wolverine (with a $211 million opening on the way to $1.34 billion worldwide)  have monopolized movie screens immediately, Thunderbolts could gather steam more steadily. Or, it could go down as another example of Marvel struggling to rekindle its golden touch. Marvel spent about $180 million to produced the movie, which added $86.1 million in overseas sales. The film also teases the next MCU chapter, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, due out July 25. 
        
     Marvel set the bar so high for so many years that a $76 million opening may seem to some like it should have done $100 million or something like that, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. This is a great reset. Theyre hitting the reset with Thunderbolts. The great reviews and the word-of-mouth should hold it (in) good stead. The Walt Disney Co. also might not have expected such stout competition from Ryan Cooglers Sinners. The Warner Bros. release, which had led the box office the last two weeks, continued to hold remarkably well. In its third week, it grossed $33 million, a dip of only 28%. Sinners, a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown, has proven a spring sensation in theaters. It has collected $179.7 million domestically and $236.7 million globally thus far. Warner Bros. also nabbed third place with A Minecraft Movie, the smash-hit video game adaptation. In its fifth weekend, it rung up another $13.7 million to bring its North American gross to nearly $400 million. Worldwide, it has totaled $873.4 million. Warner Bros. added Block Party Edition screenings over the weekend for a sing-along and meme-along experience. The film has seen some rowdy screenings from TikTok-inspired moviegoers. More than three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on set, the Alec Baldwin western Rust arrived in theaters. Its release brought some closure to one of Hollywoods greatest tragedies. Distributor Falling Forward Films didnt report box office, but estimates suggested Rust grossed approximately $25,000 in 115 theaters.  Following Hutchins death, the films armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was sentenced to prison for involuntary manslaughter. First assistant director David Halls was sentenced to probation after pleading no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon. Involuntary manslaughter charges against Baldwin, a co-producer on the film, were twice dismissed, in 2023 and again in 2024.  Director Ryan Coogler, left, and Michael B.

Also opening over the weekend was The Surfer, starring Nicolas Cage as a man trying to surf a locals-only Australian beach. The Madman Films release collected a modest $674,560 from 884 theaters.  With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. Thunderbolts, $76 million.  2. Sinners, $33 million.  3. A Minecraft Movie, $13.7 million.  4. The Accountant 2, $9.5 million.  5. Until Dawn, $3.8 million.  6. The Amateur, $1.8 million.  7. The King of Kings, $1.7 million.  8. Warfare, $1.3 million.  9. Hit: The Third Case, $869,667. 10.

"Apple posts stronger-than-expected Q2 results, says majority of US iPhones sold will come from India","Apple CEO Tim Cook said Thursday that the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. in the current fiscal quarter will be sourced from India, while iPads and other devices will come from Vietnam as the company works to avoid the impact of President Trumps tariffs on its business.  Apples earnings for the first three months of the year topped Wall Streets expectations thanks to high demand for its iPhones, and the company said tariffs had a limited effect on the fiscal second quarters results.  Cook added that for the current quarter, assuming things dont change, Apple expects to see $900 million added to its costs as a result of the tariffs, but Cook said the company remains confident in this business.  The Cupertino, California-based company earned $24.78 billion, or $1.65 per share, in the first three months of the year, up 4.8% from $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the same period a year earlier.  Revenue rose 5.1% to $95.36 billion from $90.75 billion.  Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.62 per share on revenue of $94.19 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.  The numbers for the January-March period provide a snapshot of how Apple was faring before President Trumps unveiling of sweeping tariffs in April that rattled the financial markets amid fears a trade war would reignite inflation and shove the U.S. economy into a recession. While it is likely that some of the sales growth was driven by consumers accelerating purchases ahead of expected tariff increases, margins remained healthy on the other side of the balance sheet, said Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com. He added that the company still has room for maneuver regardless of the economic backdrop and will likely not need to significantly deplete cash reserves to keep moving the needle. 
        
     Apples reliance on Chinese factories to make its iPhones and other devices thrust the technology trendsetter into the crosshairs of Trumps trade war. The exposure caused Apples stock price to plunge 23% shortly after the president announced the severity of the reciprocal tariffs, temporarily erasing $773 billion in shareholder wealth in the process. Most of those losses have since been recovered after Trump temporarily exempted iPhones and other electronics from the reciprocal tariffs, but Apples stock remains down by nearly 5% since the April fusillade of tariffs. Besides the trade war, Apple has been hurt by its inability to live up to its own hype surrounding artificial intelligence features on the iPhone 16 lineup that came out last fall. The technology wasnt ready when the iPhone 16 went on sale. Some AI features have rolled out in parts of the world as part of software updates, but Apple still hasnt been able to live up to its original promise to make Siri smarter and more versatile. The missteps prompted Apple to pull advertising campaigns promoting AI breakthroughs on the iPhone, although the company still intends to release more features powered by the technology at some point. Apple had been counting on its late entry into the AI craze to revive demand for the iPhone after last years sales dipped 2% from 2023s levels. Apple said Wednesday that its phone sales climbed 1.9% to $46.84 billion for the first three months of the year. Wall Street had expected iPhone sales of $45.62 billion.  But the company continues to see its China business decline, with revenue from the Greater China region down 2.3% to $16 billion for the quarter. Other regions, including the Americas, Europe and the rest of Asia, saw sales increases.  When Trump initially indicated his 145% tariffs on Chinese-made goods would apply to the iPhone, U.S. consumers rushed to stores to buy new devices rather than risk prices spiking higher after the duties began driving up costs. But the flurry of panic buying wont show up until Apple reports its results for the April-June quarter this summer. Trumps trade war has ramped up the pressure on Cook to work the same diplomatic sleight of hand that enabled the iPhone to avoid being stung by the China tariffs that the president imposed during his first administration. Cook signaled his intention remain on good terms with Trump by arranging private meetings with him and personally donating $1 million to the presidents second inauguration ceremony before sitting on the dais when Trump was sworn into office on January 20. Apple subsequently announced plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. while hiring 20,000 workers during the next four years. Trumps trade war also is prompting a push to Apple to shift all the production of the iPhones that it sells in the U.S. from China to India, where the company has been building up its supply chain for the past seven years, according to a recent story in the Financial Times. But the complicated logistics of making such a huge move likely couldnt be completed until next year, at the earliest, leaving Apple vulnerable to the vagaries of Trumps trade war. Apples stock fell $5.81, or 2.7%, to $207.51 in after-hours trading.",https://apnews.com/article/apple-iphone-second-quarter-earnings-70e4b60e081814ca11a75fe02622535b,business
TikTok fined $600 million for China data transfers that broke EU privacy rules,"LONDON (AP)  A European Union privacy watchdog fined TikTok 530 million euros ($600 million) on Friday after a four-year investigation found that the video sharing apps data transfers to China put users at risk of spying, in breach of strict EU data privacy rules.  Irelands Data Protection Commission also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users about where their personal data was being sent and ordered the company to comply with the rules within six months.  The Irish national watchdog serves as TikToks lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the companys European headquarters is based in Dublin.  TikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU, Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement.  TikTok said it disagreed with the decision and plans to appeal.  The company said in a blog post that the decision focuses on a select period ending in May 2023, before it embarked on a data localization project called Project Clover that involved building three data centers in Europe.  The facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm, said Christine Grahn, TikToks European head of public policy and government relations. The decision fails to fully consider these considerable data security measures. 
        
     TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal information of its users amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk over user data sent to China. In 2023, the Irish watchdog also fined the company hundreds of millions of euros in a separate child privacy investigation.  The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address potential access by Chinese authorities to European users personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counterespionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as materially diverging from EU standards. Grahn said TikTok has has never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them.  Under the EU rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection.  Grahn said TikTok strongly disagreed with the Irish regulators argument that it didnt carry out necessary assessments for data transfers, saying it sought advice from law firms and experts. She said TikTok was being singled out even though it uses the same legal mechanisms that thousands of other companies in Europe does and its approach is in line with EU rules.  The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikToks privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved remote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China. TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information throughout the inquiry by saying that it didnt store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasnt until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers.  Doyle said that the watchdog is taking the recent developments very seriously and considering what further regulatory action may be warranted.",https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ireland-european-union-data-privacy-regulation-d386ec74becc716905d7f686d6a448e2,business
Harrods becomes latest UK retailer to face cyber threat as M&S struggles persist,"LONDON (AP)  British retailer Marks & Spencer said Friday that its working day and night to resolve a cyberattack nearly two weeks ago that has left it unable to process any online orders, a day after luxury London department store Harrods confirmed it had become the latest target.  With Co-op also having shut down some of its information technology systems as a precaution following a hack, there are growing concerns within the retail sector that hackers are taking calculated risks by trying to replicate the actions of others to cause as much disruption as they can. According to reports, a hacking group known as Scattered Spider is said to be behind the M&S attack, although this hasnt been confirmed. It remains unclear if the three attacks are linked. So far, M&S has been the most high-profile victim of the recent spate of attacks, and its chief executive Stuart Machin told customers that he is really sorry about the disruption. We are working day and night to manage the current cyber incident and get things back to normal for you as quickly as possible, he said.  M&S first reported the issue over the Easter weekend two weeks ago and has seen its operations impacted for more than a week. Initially, the company saw contactless payments and click and collect orders affected, though contactless has since been restored.  Last Friday, it also said it would no longer be able to take orders through its website or app in order to deal with the problem. And the company, which has around 65,000 employees, has been unable to hire new workers after pulling job postings from its website. 
        
     Londons Metropolitan Police force has launched an investigation into the attack on M&S. M&Ss latest update comes a day after Harrods said it had restricted internet access across its sites as a precautionary measure following an attempt to gain unauthorized access to its systems.  We are not asking our customers to do anything differently at this point, and we will continue to provide updates as necessary, Harrods said in a statement. Coming on the heels of recent breaches at Co-op and M&S, it highlights an alarming trend, said Cody Barrow, chief executive of cybersecurity experts EclecticIQ. The flurry of attacks showed cybercriminals are becoming bolder, exploiting weaknesses across complex, highly interconnected supply chains. Experts are saying that generative artificial intelligence is accelerating the threat landscape, and that firms and individuals have to stay on top of developments and shore up their defenses against cyberattacks. The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre said that it was working with organizations affected as well as providing expert advice to others in the sector. These incidents should act as a wake-up call to all organizations, agency CEO Richard Horne said.",https://apnews.com/article/uk-retailers-cyberattacks-marks-spencer-harrods-7d3c01faa7380775598a517df4db1250,business
Nigel Farage takes aim at the UKs dominant parties with hefty gains in local elections,"LONDON (AP)  The hard-right party Reform UK led by Nigel Farage snatched a seat in Parliament from the governing Labour Party and won hundreds of local council seats from the opposition Conservatives in elections that Farage hailed Friday as a turning point towards ending the two parties political dominance. Reforms Sarah Pochin was declared winner of the seat of Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by six votes after a recount, defeating Labour candidate Karen Shore by the narrowest of margins. It was a significant defeat for Labour, which easily won the district in last years national election. The special election was held because Labour lawmaker Mike Amesbury was forced to quit after he was convicted of punching a constituent in a drunken rage. Farage said that its a very, very big moment indeed that shows Reform can win against both Labour and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives. This marks the end of two-party politics as weve known it for over a century, he said. The Runcorn victory gives Reform, which garnered about 14% of the vote in the 2024 national election, five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, compared to 403 for Labour and 121 for the Conservatives. But Reform appears to have momentum. National polls now suggest its support equals or surpasses that of Labour and the Conservatives, and it hopes to displace the Conservatives as the countrys main party on the right before the next national election, due by 2029. 
        
     The local elections held Thursday in many areas of England were a sobering rebuff to Prime Minister Keir Starmers center-left Labour government, 10 months after it was elected in a landslide. Farages party is targeting working-class voters who once backed Labour. Starmers popularity has plunged as his government struggles to kick-start a sluggish economy. The government has raised the minimum wage, strengthened workers rights and pumped money into the state-funded health system  but also hiked employer taxes and cut welfare benefits. Starmer said that he understood why many voters are discontented. My response is: We get it, he said. I am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see. The results were an even bigger blow to the Conservatives, whose voters switched to Reform in droves. Reform, which didnt exist when these areas last voted four years ago, won more than 600 seats in the elections for 1,600 seats on 23 local councils, mostly at the Tories expense. Reform won control of several county-level local authorities, including previous Conservative strongholds Staffordshire and Lincolnshire in central England, Durham in the north and Farages home county of Kent in the southeast. Farage told supporters that the Conservatives are over, they are finished, they have literally been gutted in these counties. Reform candidate Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative lawmaker, was elected mayor of the Greater Lincolnshire region of east-central England, and Reform also took the mayoralty of neighboring Hull. Labour retained three other mayoralties and the Conservatives won one. The victories will bring pressure for Reform to deliver on transport, garbage collection, potholes and all the other unglamorous demands of everyday politics. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who could now face a party revolt, said voters, who ejected the party from power last year, are still not yet ready to trust us. The results give only a partial snapshot of voter sentiment. Many areas, including London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, didnt hold elections. Turnout for local polls is typically much lower than in a national election. And Reform isnt the only story. The centrist Liberal Democrats made big gains in south and southwest England by winning more affluent, socially liberal voters away from the Conservatives. Reform UK is the latest in a series of parties led by Farage, a veteran populist politician who was crucial in taking Britain out of the European Union through a 2016 referendum. He is a charismatic but divisive figure who has said that many migrants come to the U.K. from cultures alien to ours. Reform blends Farages long-standing political themes  strong borders, curbing immigration  with policies reminiscent of U.S. President Donald Trumps administration. Farage said that he plans a DOGE for every county in England, inspired by Elon Musks contentious spending-slashing agency. University of Strathclyde political scientist John Curtice said that the results showed that politics in Britain, long dominated by the two big parties, has fragmented.  Reform is now posing a big threat to both Conservative and Labour, he told the BBC. As to whether two-party dominance will continue, the question mark on that has just got three or four times bigger, Curtice said.",https://apnews.com/article/uk-local-elections-runcorn-reform-farage-33fa773d553d022c6af527656e54ac21,business
Japans finance minister calls US Treasury holdings a card in tariff talks with Trump,"TOKYO (AP)  Japans massive holdings of U.S. Treasurys can be a card on the table in negotiations over tariffs with the Trump administration, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said Friday.  It does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision, Kato said during a news show on national broadcaster TV Tokyo. Kato did not elaborate and he did not say Japan would step up sales of its holdings of U.S. government bonds as part of its talks over President Donald Trumps tariffs on exports from Japan.  Earlier, Japanese officials including Kato had ruled out such an option.  Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, at $1.13 trillion as of late February. China, also at odds with the Trump administration over trade and tariffs, is the second largest foreign investor in Treasurys.  Kato stressed that various factors would be on the negotiating table with Trump, implying that a promise not to sell Treasurys could help coax Washington into an agreement favorable for Japan.  Trump has disrupted decades of American trade policies, including with key security allies like Japan, by i mposing big import taxes, or tariffs, on a wide range of products. A team of Japanese officials was in Washington this week for talks on the tariffs. The U.S. is due to soon begin imposing a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts, as well as an overall 10% baseline tariff. The bigger tariffs will hurt at a time when Japanese economic growth is weakening. 
        
     Asian holdings of Treasurys have remained relatively steady in recent years, according to the most recent figures.  But some analysts worry China or other governments could liquidate their U.S. Treasury holdings as trade tensions escalate.  U.S. government bonds are traditionally viewed as a safe financial asset, and recent spikes in yields of those bonds have raised worries that they might be losing that status due to Trumps tariff policies.",https://apnews.com/article/japan-treasurys-trump-tariffs-44b9b37bf7a290701201322f69bade2e,business
"Homeownership further out of reach as rising prices, high mortgage rates widen affordability gap","LOS ANGELES (AP)  Homeownership is receding further out of reach for most Americans as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices stretch the limits of what buyers can afford. A homebuyer now needs to earn at least $114,000 a year to afford a $431,250 home -- the national median listing price in April, according to data released Thursday by Realtor.com The analysis assumes that a homebuyer will make a 20% down payment, finance the rest of the purchase with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and that the buyers housing costs wont exceed 30% of their gross monthly income  an often-used barometer of housing affordability. Based off the latest U.S. median home listing price, homebuyers need to earn $47,000 more a year to afford a home than they would have just six years ago. Back then, the median U.S. home listing price was $314,950, and the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hovered around 4.1%. This week, the rate averaged 6.76%. The annual income required to afford a median-priced U.S. home first crossed into the six figures in May 2022 and hasnt dropped below that level since. Median household income was about $80,600 annually in 2023, according to the U.S. Census bureau. In several metro areas, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Boston, the annual income needed to afford a median-priced home tops $200,000. In San Jose, its more than $370,000. 
        
     Rock-bottom mortgage rates turbocharged the housing market during the pandemic, fueling bidding wars for homes that pushed up sale prices sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars above a seller initial asking price. U.S. home prices soared more than 50% between 2019 and 2024. The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from their pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. In March, they posted their largest monthly drop since November 2022. Its not all bad news for prospective homebuyers. Home prices are rising much more slowly than during the pandemic housing market frenzy. The national median sales price of a previously occupied U.S. home rose 2.7% in March from a year earlier to $403,700, an all-time high for March, but the smallest annual increase since August. In April, the median price of a home listed for sale rose only 0.3% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. Buyers who can afford current mortgage rates have a wider selection of properties now than a year ago.  Active listings  a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale  surged 30.6% last month from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. Home listings jumped between 67.6% and 70.1% in San Diego, San Jose and Washington D.C. As properties take longer to sell, more sellers are reducing their asking price. Some 18% of listings had their price reduced last month, according to Realtor.com. Sellers are becoming more flexible on pricing, underscored by the price reductions were seeing, and while higher mortgage rates are certainly weighing on demand, the silver lining is that the market is starting to rebalance, said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. This could create opportunities for buyers who are prepared.",https://apnews.com/article/housing-affordability-home-prices-real-estate-f17aa54776a04e4622d0c5afa9f09ff8,business
The White House seeks sharp spending cuts in Trumps 2026 budget plan,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The White House released President Donald Trumps 2026 budget proposal Friday, hoping to slash, if not zero out, spending on many government programs. It seeks a sweeping restructuring of the nations domestic priorities, reflective of the presidents first 100 days in office  and sudden firing of federal workers. Trumps plan aims for steep cuts to child care, disease research, renewable energy and peacekeeping abroad, many already underway through Elon Musks Department of Government Efficiency, all while pumping up billions for the administrations mass deportation agenda. The budget drafters echo Trumps promises to end woke programs, including preschool grants to states with diversity programs. And they reflect his vow to stop the weaponization of government by slashing the Internal Revenue Service, even as critics accuse him of using the levers of power to punish people and institutions he disfavors Overall, its a sizable reduction in domestic accounts  some $163 billion, or 22.6% below current year spending, the White House said. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talks to reporters just after House Republicans narrowly approved their budget framework, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, April 10, 2025.

Scott Applewhite) Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talks to reporters just after House Republicans narrowly approved their budget framework, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, April 10, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) At the same time, the White House said it is relying on Congress to unleash $375 billion in new money for for the Homeland Security and Defense departments as part of Trumps big, beautiful bill of tax cuts and spending reductions. His goal is to repel when he calls a foreign invasion, though migrant arrivals to the U.S. are at all-time lows. House Speaker Mike Johnson welcomed the proposal as a bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the commitment to American strength and prosperity. Budgets do not become law, but serve as a touchstone for the coming fiscal year debates. Often considered a statement of values, this first budget since Trumps return to the White House carries the added weight of defining the Republican presidents second-term pursuits, alongside his party in Congress. It comes as Trump has unilaterally imposed what could be hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases in the form of tariffs, setting off a trade war that has consumers, CEOs and foreign leaders worried about a possible economic downturn. Trump, in an interview with NBC News Meet the Press taped Friday, pushed back against recession talk. Asked by Meet the Press host Kristen Welker about Wall Street analysts who have expressed concerns that the chances of a recession are increasing, Trump insisted the economy will do fantastically. Well, you know, you say, some people on Wall Street say, Trump said. Well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that were going to have the greatest economy in history. Democrats assailed the budget as a devastating foreshadowing of Trumps vision for the country.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: he wants to outright defund programs that help working Americans, said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. This, she said, while he shovels massive tax breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with his reckless tariffs. The White House Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025 from the conservative Heritage Foundation, provided contours of a so-called skinny version of topline numbers only.  It covers only the federal governments discretionary spending, now about $1.83 trillion a year on defense and nondefense accounts. Trumps team drops that spending by $163 billion, to $1.69 trillion, a portion of the nations nearly $7 trillion budget that includes far more programs and services. Federal budgets have been climbing steadily, as have annual deficits that are fast approaching $2 trillion, with annual interest payments on the debt almost $1 trillion. Thats thanks mostly to the spike in emergency COVID-19 pandemic spending, changes in the tax code that reduced revenues and the climbing costs of Medicare, Medicaid and other programs, largely to cover health needs as people age. The nations debt load, at $36 trillion, is ballooning. We need a budget that tells the full story, and it should control spending, reduce borrowing, bring deficits down, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.   Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought walks after a television interview at the White House, Tuesday, April 15, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought walks after a television interview at the White House, Tuesday, April 15, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Among some of the White Houses proposed highlights:  The State Department and international programs would lose 84% of their money and receive $9.6 billion, reflecting deep cuts already underway, including to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Health and Human Services Department would be cut by $33.3 billion and the Education Departments spending would be reduced by $12 billion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health would all face steep reductions. The Defense Department would get an additional $113.3 billion and Homeland Security would receive $42.3 billion more. Much of that is contingent on Congress approving Trumps big bill. That approach drew criticism from leading defense hawks, among them the former GOP Leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. McConnell called the proposed boost in defense money in the presidents budget a gimmick. America cannot expect our allies to heed calls for greater annual defense spending if we are unwilling to lead by example, McConnell said in a blistering statement. Fortunately, Presidential budget requests are just that: requests. Congress will soon have an opportunity to ensure that American power  and the credibility of our commitments  are appropriately resourced. Its Congress, under its constitutional powers, that decides the spending plans, approves the bills that authorize federal programs and funds them through the appropriations process. Often, that system breaks down, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap spending bills to keep the government funded and avoid federal shutdowns. Congress is already deep into the slog of drafting Trumps big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered funds for the administrations mass deportation effort  a package that, unlike the budget plan, would carry the force of law.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Vought is also expected on Capitol Hill in the weeks ahead as the Trump administration presses its case. Among the more skilled conservative budget hands in Washington, Vought has charted a career toward this moment. He served during the first Trump administration in the same role and, for Project 2025, wrote an extensive chapter about the remaking of the federal government. Vought has separately been preparing a $9 billion package that would gut current 2025 funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which involves the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Trump signed an executive order late Thursday that instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for PBS and NPR. Vought has said that a package of so-called budget rescissions would be a first of potentially more, as the Trump administration tests the appetite in Congress for lawmakers to go on record and vote to roll back the money. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that the administration is proposing to cut the Health and Human Services budget by $33.3 billion, not $33.3 trillion.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-budget-taxes-spending-vought-4549eb165410186da001c8cdce462492,business
Profits at American oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron fall in tandem with waning energy demand,"Exxon Mobils first quarter profit slumped to the lowest level in years, stung by weaker crude prices and higher costs.  The oil and gas giant earned $7.71 billion, or $1.76 per share, for the three months ended March 31. It earned $8.22 billion, or $2.06 per share, in the year-ago period. The results topped Wall Street expectations, but Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected earnings of $1.74 per share. Revenue totaled $83.13 billion, which fell short of the $84.15 billion that analysts were calling for.  Chevron also reported its lowest first-quarter profits in years, with per-share adjusted profit falling to $2.18 per share on revenue of $47.61 billion. Similar to Exxon, Chevron does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. Analysts predicted earnings of $2.15 per share on revenue of $48.66 billion. The last time first-quarter profits were this low for Exxon was in 2022 and for Chevron, in 2021. This week, a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude fell below $60, a level at which many producers can no longer turn a profit.  In this uncertain market, our shareholders can be confident in knowing that were built for this, Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement Friday. The work weve done to transform our company over the past eight years positions us to excel in any environment. 
        
     U.S. benchmark crude is down 18% this year and Brent, the international benchmark, is right about there as well. This week, BP and Shell also reported falling first quarter profits.  Oil prices plummeted last month, at one point sinking to a four-year low in anticipation of slowing economic growth due to a burgeoning trade war.  U.S. crude and Brent fell again Friday by more than 1%. A barrel of U.S. crude now costs $58.30, down almost 30% from this time last year.  Trump announced far-reaching tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners April 2 and then reversed himself a few days later after a market meltdown, suspending the import taxes for 90 days. Amid the uncertainty for both U.S. consumers and businesses, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank 0.3% from January through March, the first drop in three years. Tariffs on steel and other materials, used for everything from tools to drilling and storage, can have an outsized impact on oil companies and amplify the detrimental effect of falling oil and gas prices.  Those falling oil prices signal pessimism about economic growth and can be a harbinger of a recession as manufacturers cut production, businesses cut travel costs and families rethink vacation plans.  And there appears to be little appetite for turn off the spigots by some of the worlds largest producers.  In December eight members of the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries signaled they would not cut production as they compete with production from non-allied oil producing countries.  The OPEC+ members decided at the time to postpone production increases that had been scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. The plan had been to start gradually restoring 2.2 million barrels per day over the course of 2025. That process was pushed back to April 1 and production increases will gradually take place over 18 months until October 2026.  Shares of Exxon Mobil, Chevron and BP fell after the opening bell, while Shell rose.",https://apnews.com/article/exxon-mobil-oil-trump-tariff-recession-8fc6bfd4de13db80b62be1df6c0fb23c,business
Worlds collide: R.E.M. rereleases Radio Free Europe single to benefit the threatened news service,"The rock band R.E.M. is putting out a special rerelease of its first single, Radio Free Europe, to benefit  wait for it  the actual Radio Free Europe. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is among the U.S. government-funded media services that deliver news in overseas markets. President Donald Trumps administration, claiming they are wasteful and promote a liberal point of view, is trying to choke off their funding. A federal judge this week ordered the Republican administration to restore $12 million to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that was appropriated by Congress. Lawyers for the service, which has been operating for 75 years, said it would be forced to shut down in June without the money. In the first line of its song Radio Free Europe, R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe sings: Decide yourself if radios gonna stay. Whether its music or a free press  censorship anywhere is a threat to the truth everywhere, Stipe said on Friday. On World Press Freedom Day, Im sending a shout-out to the brave journalists at Radio Free Europe. RFE/RLs president, Stephen Capus, said R.E.M.'s music has always represented a celebration of freedom to him. He said inspiring and upholding freedom to audiences that might not always experience it is the goal of his organizations journalists. Released on a tiny independent label, the Radio Free Europe single was the first the world had heard from the Athens, Georgia-based band, whose career eventually took it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band called it quits in 2011. 
        
     The song was later inducted into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry for setting the pattern for independent rock releases at the time. The five-song EP will include the original recording of the song and a remix made this year by the bands collaborator Jacknife Lee. It will also contain three other songs made at the same time: the singles B-side, Sitting Still; the instrumental Wh. Tornado; and a previously unreleased Radio Free Dub remix. The producer of the original recording session, Mitch Easter, is supervising this years rerelease. Its available for streaming on Friday, and a special vinyl pressing can be bought at independent record stores and R.E.M.'s mail order store.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will visit Trump at the White House on Tuesday,"TORONTO (AP)  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday that he will visit U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The high-stakes meeting comes as Trump continues his trade war and annexation threats.  Carneys Liberal Party scored a stunning comeback victory in a vote widely seen as a rebuke of Trump, whose trade war and attacks on Canadian sovereignty outraged voters.  We are meeting as heads of our government, Carney said. I am not pretending those discussions will be easy. In his first comments since election night, Carney said that Canadians elected a new government to stand up to Trump and build a strong economy. Carney also said that King Charles III will deliver a speech outlining the Canadian governments priorities on May 27, when Parliament resumes. Charles is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies. Queen Elizabeth II delivered the speech twice, in 1957 and 1977. That clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country, Carney said. Carney has emphasized Canadas founding nations, the United Kingdom and France, since becoming prime minister after the resignation of Justin Trudeau. Carney repeated that the old relationship with the U.S. based on steadily increasing integration is over. On Tuesday, I had a very constructive call with President Trump, and we agreed to meet next Tuesday in Washington, Carney said. My government will fight to get the best deal for Canada. 
        
     Carney previously said that Canadas close friendship with the U.S. has ended and that the 80-year period when the U.S. embraced the mantle of global economic leadership and forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect is over. Trump mocked Carneys predecessor by calling him Governor Trudeau. He hasnt trolled Carney.  Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations, said that Carney shouldnt go to Washington, because he risks Trump insulting Canada and him too. There is absolutely no reason to. You cant bargain with Trump. His word is not his bond. Its like writing on the water of a pond, a scummy pond. We have nothing to gain, Bothwell said.  Carney also outlined the priorities of his new government four days after Canadians voted in the Liberals for a fourth mandate. He said that a new Cabinet would be sworn in on May 12.  Now the election is over, and we are in a once-in-a-lifetime crisis. Its time to come together, to put on our Team Canada sweaters, and win big, Carney said. Now is the time for ambition, to be bold, to meet this crisis with the overwhelming, positive force of a united Canada. He said that he will call for an election for a specific district as soon as possible if the opposition Conservatives want Pierre Poilievre, who lost his own seat in the election, to run in a by-election so he can sit in the House of Commons.  No games, nothing like that, Carney said.  The Conservative Party announced shortly after that a current Conservative member of Parliament from Alberta will resign so Poilievre can run in that district.  Carney said that he had a constructive conversation with Poilievre about Canadas strategy with the Americans.  I am in politics to do big things, not to be something, Carney said.",https://apnews.com/article/carney-canada-trump-white-house-7beb2dad7b36d6d719438ba7d064ecc1,business
Hegseth keeps 2 aircraft carriers in Middle East for another week for battle with Yemens Houthis,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier to remain in the Middle East for a second time, keeping it there another week so the U.S. can maintain two carrier strike groups in the region to battle Yemen-based Houthi rebels, according to a U.S. official. In late March, Hegseth extended the deployment of the Truman and the warships in its group for a month as part of a campaign to increase strikes on the Iran-backed Houthis. The official said Hegseth signed the latest order Thursday and it is expected the Truman and its strike group warships will head home to Norfolk, Virginia, after the week is up.  Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, requested that the Truman be extended again, according to officials. The San Diego-based USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and its strike group arrived in the region a few weeks ago and are operating in the Gulf of Aden. The Truman, along with two destroyers and a cruiser in its strike group, is in the Red Sea. The officials spoke Friday on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. The U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use overwhelming lethal force until the Houthis stop their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a vital trade corridor.  
        
     According to Central Command, the U.S. has been waging an intense and sustained campaign against the Houthis. In a statement over the weekend, the command said the U.S. has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen since Operation Rough Rider began. It hasnt provided details on the targets or how the data is compiled. It has been rare in recent years for the U.S. to have two aircraft carriers in the Middle East at the same time. Navy leaders have generally been opposed to the idea because it disrupts ship maintenance schedules and delays time at home for sailors strained by the unusually high combat tempo. If there are no additional extensions and the Truman and its warships leave the region next week, those sailors could be back home by next month. Last year, the Biden administration ordered the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier to remain in the Red Sea for an extended time as U.S. warships waged the most intense running sea battle since World War II. Prior to that, it had been years since the U.S. had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.  The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the groups leadership has described as an effort to end Israels war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.  The group paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. In another action, Hegseth on Friday ordered the Defense Department to produce a new national defense strategy and gave leaders until the end of August to have a final draft. The strategy is the main blueprint that lays out the departments priorities as it moves to confront national security threats around the world. It will be Hegseths opportunity to highlight what he wants the U.S. military to focus on for the next several years and how the Pentagon will shift toward Trumps America First doctrine. The draft also will have to reflect the impact of Hegseths sweeping personnel cuts and decisions to merge a number of military commands.",https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-navy-aircraft-carrier-extension-middle-east-f1404c010bff572f4d0a35fdf99e5910,business
F1 signs 10-year extension with Miami Grand Prix that keeps race on calendar through 2041,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  Formula 1 announced a 10-year extension with the Miami Grand Prix on Friday that will ensure the event remains on the calendar through 2041. From our standpoint, it enables us to say that this event is here to stay for a very long time, said Tom Garfinkel, managing partner of the Miami Grand Prix. Securing a 10-year extension with Formula 1 through 2041 is an extraordinary milestone for all of us at South Florida Motorsports and a true testament to the hard work of our team, the strength of our partnerships, the support of our community and the growth of the sport in the United States. The race debuted in 2022 as the second F1 race in the United States on the schedule. Sundays running will be the fourth in what was originally a 10-year contract between Miami promoters and F1. There are now three F1 races in the U.S. every year. Las Vegas was added to the schedule in 2023 and F1 also makes a stop at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. F1 president Stefano Domenicali stressed how vital Miami is to the series portfolio as it continues to grow dramatically in the U.S. In just three years, the Miami Grand Prix has established itself as one of the most important and spectacular events on our calendar, an extraordinary example of quality and vision that truly represents the spirit and ambition of Formula 1 in the United States, Domenicali said. Extending this agreement until 2041 is a strategic milestone of enormous importance, which strengthens our presence in America and consolidates the ever-deepening bond with our fan base there, which is constantly growing and passionate like never before. 
        
     The Miami extension comes two days after F1 announced a three-year extension with Mexico City. The difference, though, is that Mexico City in the final year of its existing contract. The Miami race, meanwhile, was touted as a key event in F1s focus on North American growth, as well as the impact the race has on South Florida. The Miami Grand Prix has generated more than $1 billion in economic impact in its first three runnings. South Florida Motorsports, the official promoter, has established internship programs, worked with local charities, and promoted home-grown businesses each year to build a community relationship around the grand prix. South Florida Motorsports was named 2024 F1 Promoter of the Year. Promoters claim a record 275,000 spectators attended three days of activities last year and the race attracted the largest U.S. F1 television audience of all time, with 3.1 million viewers. The Miami Grand Prix is held around Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, home of the Miami Dolphins, the ATP and WTA Miami Open, and seven matches at next years soccer World Cup. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-miami-extension-2041-e5e97f2a14f8e5c57cb1bb3e788cb894,business
Desperate children and adults in Gaza struggle to get food as Israel blocks aid,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP)  Screaming in anguish as the desperate crowd crushes them against a barrier, young children and adults frantically wave pots and pans at charity workers, begging for a portion of some of the last food aid left in Gaza: Rice. The chaos at the community kitchen in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Friday was too overwhelming for Niveen Abu Arar. She tried and tried, but the 33-year-old mother of eight didnt get to the front of the crowd in time. She left with her pot empty, and her eyes full of tears.  Until when will life be like that? Were slowly dying. We havent eaten bread for a month and a half. There is no flour. There is nothing, said Abu Arar, whose ninth child, a 1-year-old boy, was killed in an Israeli strike near their home at the start of the war in 2023. We dont know what to do  We dont have money. What do we get for them? 
        
     She cradled a toddler in her lap as she spoke. With no milk to provide, she poured water into a baby bottle and pressed it into her youngest daughters mouth, hoping to stave off the babys hunger pangs.

Israel has said that the blockade and its renewed military campaign aim to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages it still holds and to disarm. Aid groups stress that blocking humanitarian aid is a form of collective punishment and a violation of international law. Israeli authorities didnt immediately respond when asked about accusations that starvation was being used as a weapon of war, but in the past they have accused the Hamas militant group governing Gaza of stealing aid.  In an emergency call with reporters on Friday to discuss Gazas humanitarian crisis, aid groups described a territory nearly out of food, water and fuel, with prices for the meager supplies remaining skyrocketing beyond the reach of many. With nearly the entire population reliant on humanitarian aid, according to the United Nations, warehouses are empty, community kitchens are closing down, and families are skipping meals. A 25-kilogram (55-pound) bag of flour now goes for 1,300 shekels ($360), said Ghada al Haddad, Oxfams media coordinator in Gaza.  Mothers in Gaza now feed their children one meal per day, dinner, so they dont wake up and complain they are starving, she said. Amjad Shawwa, the director of the Palestinian NGO network, said that more than 70 of their community kitchens inside Gaza would close within the week if the Israeli blockade continues. Israeli airstrikes have also taken out large swaths of Gazas agricultural land and livestock, making it nearly impossible for the territory to produce its own food, said Gavin Kelleher, a humanitarian manager with the Norwegian Refugee Council who recently left Gaza. Even fisherman have been targeted, he said, killed in small fishing boats by Israeli naval forces.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana,File) FILE.- Palestinians wait for donated food at a distribution center in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza Strip, Sunday, March 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana,File) Israel has engineered a situation where Palestinians cannot grow their own food or fish for their own food, he said. Kelleher, whose organization coordinates the provision of shelter to Gaza, said that not a single aid group has any tents left to distribute  as 1 million people inside Gaza remain in need of shelter given the devastation caused by the nearly 19-month war. In Khan Younis, Mustafa Ashour said he had walked for an hour to get to the charity community kitchen, and waiting for another two hours before he managed to get food.  The situation is hard in Gaza. The crossings are closed. Its a full siege, said Ashour, who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah. There is no food. There is no water. There are no life necessities. The food being sold is expensive and very little. As for Abu Arar and her family  left without a handout from the charity kitchen  another family in a neighboring tent took pity, and shared their own meager portions of rice.  Keller of the NRC said that if Israel continues its blockade, thousands of people will die, there will be a complete breakdown of order, telecommunication networks will come down and we will struggle to understand the situation because it will be unfolding in the dark.

Six Flags America in Maryland to close at the end of 2025 season,"BOWIE, Md. (AP)  After more than a quarter century of thrills and fun, Six Flags America and Hurricane Harbor in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., will close at the end of this season. The approximately 500-acre (202-hectare) property in Bowie will be marketed for redevelopment, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation announced Thursday. As part of a portfolio review, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company determined that the parks are not a strategic fit with the companys long-term growth plan, Six Flags President and CEO Richard A. Zimmerman said in a statement. The final day of operations will be Nov. 2. Six Flags America and Hurricane Harbor have been an important part of the local community, and this final season will be an opportunity to celebrate the decades of fun that guests have enjoyed at the property, Zimmerman said. Six Flags America employs about 70 full-time associates, and severance and other benefits will be provided to eligible associates, the company said.  A wildlife preserve that operated on the site in the 1970s later became an amusement park, The Washington Post reports. It opened as Six Flags America in 1999, according to a company spokesperson. The park features many attractions and rides, including nine roller coasters. The Wild One is one of the oldest wooden roller coasters in the country, the spokesperson said. Acting Prince Georges County Executive Tara H. Jackson lamented the loss of the parks. 
        
     For decades, Six Flags has been more than just a theme parkit is a cherished part of our countys identity, a source of joy for families, and a hub of economic activity, Jackson said in a statement. We are committed to working closely with Six Flags and other stakeholders to guide a thoughtful and inclusive redevelopment process that supports jobs, growth and long-term community benefit.",https://apnews.com/article/six-flags-america-closing-bowie-maryland-62ef4332725123422303c6e3c51e1a8a,business
Trump administration asks Supreme Court to let DOGE access Social Security systems,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to clear the way for Elon Musk s Department of Government Efficiency to access Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans.  The emergency appeal is the first in a string of applications to the high court involving DOGEs swift-moving work across the federal government.  It comes after a judge in Maryland restricted the teams access to Social Security under federal privacy laws. The agency holds personal records on nearly everyone in the country, including school records, bank details, salary information and medical and mental health records for disability recipients, according to court documents. The government says the team needs access to target waste in the federal government. Musk, now preparing to step back from his work with DOGE, has been focused on Social Security as an alleged hotbed of fraud. The billionaire entrepreneur has described it as a  Ponzi scheme  and insisted that reducing waste in the program is an important way to cut government spending.  Solicitor General John Sauer argued Friday that the judges restrictions disrupt DOGEs important work and inappropriately interfere with executive-branch decisions. Left undisturbed, this preliminary injunction will only invite further judicial incursions into internal agency decision-making, he wrote. He asked the justices to block the order from U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland as the lawsuit plays out.  
        
     An appeals court previously refused to immediately to lift the block on DOGE access, though it split along ideological lines. Conservative judges in the minority said theres no evidence that the team has done any targeted snooping or exposed personal information. The lawsuit was originally filed by a group of labor unions and retirees represented by the group Democracy Forward. The Supreme Court asked them for a response to the administrations appeal by May 12.  More than two dozen lawsuits have been filed over DOGEs work, which has included deep cuts at federal agencies and large-scale layoffs.  Hollander found that DOGEs efforts at Social Security amounted to a fishing expedition based on little more than suspicion of fraud.  Her order does allow staffers to access data that has been made anonymous, but the Trump administration has said DOGE cant work effectively with those restrictions.  Elizabeth Laird with the nonprofit group Center for Democracy and Technology said wide-ranging access to sensitive personal data poses a serious threat. If DOGE gets a hold of this information, it opens the floodgates on a host of potential harms. It also normalizes a very dangerous practice for other federal agencies, she said. The nations court system has been ground zero for pushback to President Donald Trumps sweeping conservative agenda, with about 200 lawsuits filed challenging policies on everything from immigration to education to mass layoffs of federal workers. Among those that have reached the Supreme Court so far, the justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration but have rejected the governments broad arguments in other cases.",https://apnews.com/article/doge-social-security-trump-administration-supreme-court-a38db8e9908e56b01265432f4d46e8e3,business
"How major US stock indexes fared Friday, 5/2/2025","Wall Street extended its gains to a ninth straight day, marking its longest winning streak since 2004 and reclaiming the ground it lost since President Donald Trump escalated his trade war in early April.

Musks next task? Reviving Tesla in Europe where sales have plunged by more than half in a year,"NEW YORK (AP)  Tesla sales plunged by more than half last month in several European countries in a sign that Elon Musk could struggle to revive the company after he shifts from his Washington work to running the automaker again. Tesla sales collapsed in April by more than two-thirds from a year earlier in Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, according to auto groups and government agencies Friday. Sales at the Austin, Texas, company dropped by 59% in France and 38% in Norway.  The countries are not major drivers of sales overall, but they are the first to report April results and thus a foretaste of possible trouble elsewhere as Tesla reels from protests and boycotts over Musk wading into politics.  In Germany, where he told voters their country was lost if they didnt vote for a candidate widely derided for her extreme views, sales plunged 62% in the first three months this year. German sales for April are not out yet. Financial analysts covering Tesla are worried about the Musk backlash but caution its not clear exactly how much to blame politics for the hit. Other factors suppressing sales include Teslas aging model lineup and new offerings from rival electric vehicles makers, such as China BYD.  Tesla also had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply. And the company is still waiting for European regulators to approve its partial self-driving features in its cars, a big selling point in the U.S. and China.  
        
     We could see sales come back once they get it, said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, though he added about the April figures, Its never a good thing when you have large sales declines like this. The disappointing numbers come a little over a week since Musk told investors on a first-quarter conference call that he would be stepping back from his work in Washington as President Donald Trumps chain-saw wielding cost-cutting czar. Musk has shut down whole government departments as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and thrown tens of thousands of public workers out of their jobs.  On the call, Musk said he would be spending only one or two days a week on DOGE work starting in May, acceding to demands that he refocus on his job as Teslas chief executive officer.  The stock has been rising since that announcement despite crumbling financial figures. Profits in the first quarter fell 71%.  The sales hit in April was the worst in Sweden, where Mobility Sweden said they fell 81%. That was followed by a 74% plunge in the Netherlands and a 67% drop in Denmark, according to the Dutch trade association BOVAG and Mobility Denmark respectively.  The Norwegian Road Traffic Information Council reported a 38% drop in that country.  One bright spot: Tesla was able to sell more cars in Italy, according to an Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transportation report, registering a 3% gain for the month.",https://apnews.com/article/tesla-musk-trump-doge-evs-protests-boycott-5f7bcec268d5e40b94c2d9db35198bbf,business
Steelmaker Cleveland Cliffs to idle 3 steel plants in Pennsylvania and Illinois,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)  Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs will indefinitely idle three steel plants this summer, saying Friday that it is being buffeted by sluggish demand and pricing for some products, including high carbon steel sheets. The company said the idling of two Pennsylvania plants, one in Steelton and one in Conshohocken, and one in Riverdale, Illinois, is due to insufficient demand and pricing and nothing to do with President Donald Trumps tariffs. These temporary, indefinite idles are a necessary response to insufficient demand and pricing for the products the affected facilities produce, including rail, specialty plate, and high-carbon sheet; all of which fall outside of Cliffs core business focus, the company said. The idlings will be indefinite, and start around June 30, at the end of a 60-day notice period required by federal law. About 950 workers will be out of work during the shutdowns, Cleveland Cliffs said. It said its flat-rolled steel production levels will not be affected.  Cleveland Cliffs in recent weeks had announced that it will idle or partially idle two iron ore mines in Minnesota, affecting 630 workers. It also said in March that it will idle a steel plant in Dearborn, Michigan, affecting about 600 workers, citing weak automotive production in the United States. We believe that, once President Trumps policies take full effect and automotive production is re-shored, we should be able to resume steel production at Dearborn, it said. Cleveland Cliffs did say, however, that it plans to resume operation at its blast furnace in Cleveland, which was idled last year.",https://apnews.com/article/cleveland-cliffs-steel-plants-idling-pennsylvania-illinois-7b63bde12c23efb8e4befc62d79ca097,business
Hawaii lawmakers raise the states hotel tax to help the islands cope with climate change,"HONOLULU (AP)  Hawaii lawmakers passed on Friday first-of-its-kind legislation that will increase the states lodging tax to raise money for environmental protection and strengthening defenses against climate change -fueled natural disasters. Gov. Josh Green supports the bill, indicating he will sign it. The bill adds a 0.75% levy to the states existing tax on hotel rooms, timeshares, vacation rentals and other short-term accommodations. It also imposes a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually. They say the money will be used for projects like replenishing sand on eroding Waikiki beaches, promoting the use of hurricane clips to secure roofs during powerful storms and clearing flammable invasive grasses like those that fed the deadly wildfire that destroyed downtown Lahaina in 2023. The House and Senate, both controlled by large majorities of Democrats, both passed the measure by wide margins.  Experts say this is the nations first state lodging tax that raises money for the environment and coping with climate change. Hawaii already levies a 10.25% tax on short-term rentals. As of Jan. 1, the tax will rise to 11%. Hawaiis counties separately charge a 3% lodging tax, and travelers also have to pay the 4.712% general excise tax that applies to all virtually all goods and services. The cumulative tax bill at checkout will climb to 18.712%, among the highest in the nation.  
        
     Green said people have told him the increase is small enough people wont notice. He observed many people come to Hawaii to enjoy the environment and predicted they will welcome committing dollars to protect shorelines and communities. The more you cultivate good environmental policy, and the more you invest in perfecting our lived space, the more likely it is were going to have actually lifelong, committed travelers to Hawaii, he said in an interview. Only funds raised by the 0.75% addition and the new tax on cruise ship stays will go exclusively toward natural resources and climate change. Revenue from existing state lodging taxes would continue to flow into states general fund and to help pay for the construction of Honolulus rail line.  Zane Edleman, a visitor from Chicago, said he could envision the extra cost prompting some travelers to head elsewhere else like Florida. But he said it would depend on how the state shares information about what it does with the money. If you really focus on the point  this is to save the climate and actually have proof that this is where the funds are going, and that theres an actual result thats happening from that, I think people could buy into it, Edleman said.  The first draft of the legislation called for a larger increase, but lawmakers pared it back.  We heard the concerns about how do we make sure that we are able to sustain our industry as well as find new resources to address the needs for environmental sustainability, said Democratic Rep. Linda Ichiyama, vice speaker of the House. So it was a balance. John Pele, the executive director of the Maui Hotel and Lodging Association, said theres broad agreement that the money raised will go to a good cause. But he wonders if Hawaii will become too expensive for visitors. Will we be taxing on tourists out of wanting to come here? he said. That remains to be seen.",https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-hotel-tax-tourists-climate-d59223dacc7ca513471b77bbcd2b798a,business
Head Start survives Trump administration budget proposal,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The Trump administration apparently has backed away from a proposal to eliminate funding for Head Start, the early education program that serves some of the nations neediest preschoolers.  Backers of the six-decade-old program, which educates more than half a million children from low-income and homeless families, had been fretting after a leaked Trump administration proposal suggested defunding it. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation and co-authored by President Donald Trumps current budget chief, also called for cutting Head Start.  But the budget summary released Friday, which outlined programs set to receive drastic cuts or boosts, did not mention Head Start. On a call with reporters, an administration official said there would be no changes to it. The official insisted on anonymity to preview the budget plan on a call with reporters. Still, teachers, families and advocates remain concerned about the stability of Head Start. The Trump administration is closing several regional offices and laying off the staff who support the program, which has led to funding delays that threatened to close individual preschools. A document accidentally emailed to grant recipients this week called for eliminating funding for research on Head Start and other child care programs. And before Trump took office, staffing shortages and rising costs had forced some programs to cut the number of students they served, or shutter altogether.  Advocates say other cuts to education and social-safety-net programs would also hurt families served by Head Start.  
        
     While Head Start is grateful that it was not explicitly eliminated in this skinny budget proposal, we are concerned about the significant cuts that threaten access to health services, education, and support for hundreds of thousands of families, said Yasmina Vinci, executive director for the National Head Start Association, in a statement. ____ The Associated Press education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Court sides with Fortnite maker Epic as Apple sanctioned for defying order in App Store case,"Apple says it plans to appeal a federal judges ruling that the iPhone maker willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by Fortnite maker Epic Games. Apple, which reports its quarterly earnings Thursday, said it strongly disagrees with the decision. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. On Wednesday she found that Apple violated a 2021 injunction that, she wrote, sought to restrain and prohibit the iPhone makers anticompetitive conduct and pricing.  Apples continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated, Gonzalez Rogers said in the ruling, which held Apple in contempt.  She ordered that Apple no longer impede developers ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.  Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said on X the company will return Fortnite to Apples U.S. App Store next week.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Epic first filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020 alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system collecting commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce. 
        
     Although Gonzalez Rogers had rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. The Supreme Court rejected Apples appeal in the case in January 2024. In stark contrast to Apples initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option, the judge wrote Wednesday. She accused the companys Alex Roman, vice-president for finance, of outright lying under oath.  Internally, (longtime Apple executive) Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction, but (CEO) Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly, Gonzalez Rogers wrote. The judge referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.",https://apnews.com/article/apple-epic-games-ruling-antitrust-violated-69b16572d2b2c990f6b69d4bbad9b57b,business
Ukraine and the US have finally signed a minerals deal. What does it include?,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP)  After months of tense negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine signed a deal that is expected to give Washington access to the countrys critical minerals and other natural resources, an agreement Kyiv hopes will secure long-term support for its defense against Russia. According to Ukrainian officials, the version of the deal signed Wednesday is far more beneficial to Ukraine than previous versions, which they said reduced Kyiv to a junior partner and gave Washington unprecedented rights to the countrys resources. The agreement  which the Ukrainian parliament must ratify  would establish a reconstruction fund for Ukraine that Ukrainian officials hope will be a vehicle to ensure future American military assistance. A previous agreement was nearly signed before being derailed in a tense Oval Office meeting involving U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. President Donald Trump, right, meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 28, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/ Mystyslav Chernov, File) President Donald Trump, right, meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 28, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/ Mystyslav Chernov, File) We have formed a version of the agreement that provides mutually beneficial conditions for both countries. This is an agreement in which the United States notes its commitment to promoting long-term peace in Ukraine and recognizes the contribution that Ukraine has made to global security by giving up its nuclear arsenal, Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who signed the deal for Ukraine, said in a post on Facebook. The signing comes during what U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said would be a very critical week for U.S.-led efforts to end the war that appear to have stalled. Ukraine sees the deal as a way to ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally stays engaged and doesnt freeze military support, which has been key in its 3-year-old fight against Russias full-scale invasion.  
        
     This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who signed for the U.S., said in a statement. Here is a look at the deal. The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraines government. It does not include resources that are already a source of revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new investments. Ukrainian officials have also noted that it does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits from the fund will likely not go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous support. Officials have also emphasized that the agreement ensures full ownership of the resources remains with Ukraine, and the state will determine what can be extracted and where.  It does not mention any explicit security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression that Ukraine has long insisted on. The text of the deal lists 55 minerals but says more can be agreed to.  Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraines rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, such as titanium, lithium and uranium.  They are a group of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles. China is the worlds largest producer of rare earth elements, and both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing, Trumps chief geopolitical adversary. They include elements such as lanthanum, cerium and scandium, which are listed in the deal.  The agreement establishes a reconstruction investment fund, and both the U.S. and Ukraine will have an equal say in its management, according to Svyrydenko. The fund will be supported by the U.S. government through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation agency, which Ukraine hopes will attract investment and technology from American and European countries.  Ukraine is expected to contribute 50% of all future profits from government-owned natural resources into the fund. The United States will also contribute in the form of direct funds and equipment, including badly needed air defense systems and other military aid.  Contributions to the fund will be reinvested in projects related to mining, oil and gas as well as infrastructure. No profits will be taken from the fund for the first 10 years, Svyrydenko said. Trump administration officials initially pushed for a deal in which Washington would receive $500 billion in profits from exploited minerals as compensation for its wartime support. But Zelenskyy rejected the offer, saying he would not sign off on an agreement that will be paid off by 10 generations of Ukrainians. Ukraines rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits, and the war. The industrys potential is unclear since geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to businessmen and analysts. In general, however, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The countrys reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europes largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europes largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass. In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the countrys gross domestic product and 30% of exports. An estimated 40% of Ukraines metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that its in Trumps interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-rare-earth-minerals-deal-8566241ea0e121a30437d845357055d8,business

But as they streamed onto the show floor at Bostons convention center, greeted by a remote-controlled humanoid made by Chinese company Unitree, it was hard to ignore the shadow of President Donald Trumps far-reaching global tariffs and retaliatory measures from Trumps biggest target, China.  Tariffs are the No. 1 topic that were discussing in the hallways and at the water cooler with people that Ive known for a long time, said event organizer Steve Crowe, chair of the annual Robotics Summit & Expo. I think its definitely top of mind, because theres so much uncertainty about what is going to come. That concern is rooted in a robots complex anatomy of motors and actuators to move their limbs, computers to power their artificial intelligence, and sensing devices to help them react to their surroundings. Sensors, semiconductors, batteries and rare earth magnets are among the array of components most sensitive to global trade disputes.  Tesla CEO and billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk warned investors last week that Chinas countermeasures restricting shipments of rare earth magnets will delay Teslas development of its Optimus humanoid robots. 
        
     At the summit on Wednesday and Thursday, some humanoid makers were looking at a potential bright side to the geopolitical shifts as American businesses look harder for domestic supplies of parts and the development of U.S.-based robots that can automate factories and warehouses.  Its added some inconveniences to our own supply chain. But its also opened up opportunities, said Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer at Oregon-based Agility Robotics, in an interview. The company is starting to deploy its humanoid robot, called Digit, at a U.S. plant run by German manufacturer Schaeffler, a maker of ball bearings and other components key to the auto industry. Al Makke, a director of engineering for Schaefflers chassis systems, said tariffs could push many companies toward onshoring production of a variety of items in the U.S. Al Makke, Director of Engineering at Schaeffler Group USA, gestures during an interview at the Robotics Summit & Expo, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Boston.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) And if that does happen, then local companies have to deal with high labor costs and a shortage of labor and so automation gets pushed further, Makke said. And one of those faces of automation is humanoids. Most of the big industrial robots employed in the U.S. are used to help make cars, and are imported from countries such as Japan, Germany or South Korea. Automakers in the U.S. installed 9.6% more robots in their plants than a year before, according to new data from the International Federation of Robotics, a trade group. For now, humanoids are still a niche but one that invites intense curiosity, in part thanks to popular science fiction. Saunders, of Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, presented an update Wednesday on the development of its Atlas humanoid robot but didnt bring a physical prototype, instead showing off a more familiar pack of its four-legged Spot robots contained in a pen on the show floor.

Marketed for $16,000 and remote-controlled by an employee standing nearby, the robot fluidly shook hands, waved back at people and walked around the show floor, but it wont be moving totes or working in a factory anytime soon.  Its main customers outside China are academic researchers and some social media influencers, and Trumps current tariffs totaling 145% on China would raise its cost to American buyers to roughly $40,000, said Tony Yang, a Unitree vice president of business development who manages its North American sales. Nevertheless, Unitrees strategy to rapidly develop its hardware and software is a long-term one.  Its still a very narrow market, but I think theres still a huge potential market on the industry side, like for manufacturing and factory and even home use, Yang said. At a full pickleball court on the show floor, some conference attendees took a break to grab a racket and swing at balls tossed by a wheeled robot. Asked to describe whats inside the Tennibot robot, its maker also had tariffs on the mind.

The supply chain gets very complex. We get parts from all over the world. Tariffs are adding a lot of uncertainty. Its not just the U.S.-China trade rivalry that was weighing on some attendees. Francesca Torsiello, of the recruitment firm Adapt Talent, said shes also hearing more wariness from Canadian robotics and engineering candidates about taking jobs in the U.S. amid a tense political environment.

Georgia is the 8th state sued over age verification for children on websites,"ATLANTA (AP)  Georgia on Thursday became the eighth state to see its law requiring parental consent for children to use social media challenged in court. NetChoice, a technology industry trade group, sued in federal court in Atlanta to overturn the law, which is scheduled to take effect on July 1. Similar laws have been overturned by federal judges in Arkansas and Ohio and temporarily blocked in Utah. Litigation is pending against laws in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. The fight pits a growing movement that social media use is harmful to children and teens against constitutional protections for free speech. While the laws in Georgia and other states require parental consent, Australia, a country without constitutional free speech protections, has banned social media for children younger than 16 altogether. Some in the U.S. Congress have also proposed parental consent for minors. Georgias SB 351 unconstitutionally blocks access to protected online speech and forces Georgians to surrender their private information just to use everyday digital services, Paul Taske, NetChoice associate director of litigation, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. Thats unconstitutional, as several other states have now been told by courts. Were fighting to keep online communication safe and free in the Peach State. The suit asks U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg to declare the law unconstitutional because it violates First Amendment rights to free speech and 14th Amendment rights to due process. 
        
     Georgia officials said they will defend the measure. Its a shame that the industry would rather file a lawsuit than partner with us to protect children from online predators, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican running for governor in 2026, said in a statement. Republican state Sen. Jason Anavitarte, the bills sponsor, said in a statement that he wont stop working to give Georgias parents the tools they need to help keep kids safe online. NetChoice spokesperson Krista Chavez said the group is not challenging a separate section of the Georgia law that requires age verification for users of online pornography sites. A number of states have made laws aimed at pornography, and a challenge to Texas law is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. Georgias law says social media services must use commercially reasonable efforts to verify someones age by July 1. Services would have to treat anyone who cant be verified as a minor. Parents of children younger than 16 would have to consent to their children joining a service. Social media companies would be limited in how they could customize ads for children younger than 16 and how much information they could collect on those children, a provision that Thursdays lawsuit also argues is illegal. To comply with federal regulations, social media companies already ban kids under 13 from signing up for their platforms. Parents have many existing tools they can choose from to regulate whether and how their minor children use the internet, the lawsuit states. But children have been shown to easily evade the bans. Up to 95% of teens aged 13 to 17 report using a social media platform, with more than a third saying they use them almost constantly, the Pew Research Center found.",https://apnews.com/article/georgia-social-media-parent-age-verification-269b7ceb84613772234111984799d4ef,business
"With outlook uncertain, the Bank of England joins the US Fed in putting interest rates on hold","LONDON (AP)  The Bank of England kept its main U.K. interest rate unchanged at 4.50% on Thursday even though the economy is barely growing and the nation faces more uncertainty in light of the tariff policies being enacted by the Trump administration in the U.S. The decision by the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee was widely expected, and comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged.  Minutes from the meeting showed that eight members voted to keep policy unchanged, with one backing a quarter-point reduction. The rate-setting panel has reduced the Bank of Englands main rate from a 16-year high of 5.25% by a quarter of a percentage on three occasions since last August, most recently in February, after inflation fell from the multi-decade highs of over 10% reached in the wake of the sharp spike in energy prices following Russias full-blown invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 . However, inflation, at 3%, remains above the banks 2% target and is set to push higher in coming months, even without accounting for any tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Many economists think it could rise as high as 4% in the coming months as businesses are raise prices as a result of a big increase in the minimum wage and higher payroll taxes. Theres a lot of economic uncertainty at the moment, said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. We still think that interest rates are on a gradually declining path, but weve held them at 4.5% today. 
        
     If policymakers continue to pursue their recent gradual approach, then another cut is likely in May, when they will be armed with the banks latest economic projections and Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey next holds a press conference.  Bailey said rate-setters will be looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving and that whatever happens, its our job to make sure that inflation stays low and stable. The U.S. Federal Reserve, which kept borrowing rates unchanged Wednesday, also expressed uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trumps tariff policies, which economists worry would lower global growth and lead to an uptick in prices.  The British economy, the sixth-largest, eked out modest growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter, a hugely disappointing outcome for the new Labour government, which has made boosting growth its number one economic policy. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the British economys growth performance has been notably below its long-run average. Critics say Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is partly responsible for the gloomy economic news since Labour returned to power in July after 14 years, because she was overly downbeat when taking on her role and has since increased taxes, particularly on businesses. Reeves, who on March 26 will deliver a keenly-watched statement on the state of the public finances to lawmakers, will be hoping that the Bank of England does cut borrowing rates further over coming months as it will likely help shore up growth. Economists said the latest update from the bank did little to clear up the outlook, though most said a further quarter-point reduction in May remained on the cards. But beyond that, much will depend on trade policy out of the U.S. and the fiscal announcements coming from the Chancellor, said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.",https://apnews.com/article/britain-interest-rates-economy-9588247bed030487d3500f23a6c92ca5,business
Stock market today: Wall Street rallies as pressure eases from the bond market after Fed decision,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks climbed Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said the economy still looks healthy enough to keep interest rates where they are. Wall Street also got a boost from easing yields in the bond market. The S&P 500 jumped 1.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 383 points, or 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.4%.  The rally followed weeks of sharp and scary swings for the U.S. stock market. Uncertainty is high about how much pain President Donald Trump  will allow the economy to endure in order to remake the system. Hes said he wants manufacturing jobs back in the United States and far fewer people working for the federal government.  Trumps barrage of announcements on tariffs and other policies have created so much uncertainty that economists worry U.S. businesses and households may freeze and pull back on their spending. Markets are waiting for details about interest rates. Heres more from AP business correspondent Seth Sutel. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the rising pessimism among U.S. consumers and companies shown by recent surveys, but he also pointed to data showing the economy is solid at the moment, such as a relatively low unemployment rate. He said its possible to have periods where people say downbeat things about the economy and then go out and buy a new car. Given where we are, we think our policy is in a good place to react to what comes, and we think that the right thing to do is to wait here for greater clarity about what the economys doing, Powell said. 
        
     The Fed has been holding interest rates steady this year, after cutting them sharply through the end of last year. While lower rates can help give the economy a boost, they can also push inflation upward. Fed officials indicated theyre still penciling in two cuts to the federal funds rate by the end of this year, just as they were forecasting at the end of last year. But they are also seeing weaker growth for the U.S. economy and higher inflation than they were before. More than anything, the message from the Fed seemed to be how much uncertainty is clouding everything.  What would you write down? Powell said when asked about the continued forecasts for two cuts to rates this year. Its really hard to know how this is going to work out. Powell, though, pushed back against fears about whats called  stagflation, where the economy stagnates but inflation remains high. The Fed doesnt have good tools to fix such a toxic combination. The last time the U.S. economy suffered through it was in the 1970s, and Powell said, I wouldnt say were in a situation thats remotely comparable to that. Stocks also got a boost from lower Treasury yields in the bond market. When Treasurys are paying investors less in interest, they can encourage investors to pay higher prices for stocks.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.24% from 4.31% just before the Fed announced its decision. The Fed said it will also begin paring the monthly reductions of its trove of Treasurys beginning in April. Such a move can help keep longer-term yields lower than they would otherwise be. Powell repeated several times that the move was more technical than a hint about coming changes in policy. It isnt sending a signal in any hidden way, he said. Yields for shorter-term Treasurys also fell as traders built up expectations for the Fed to deliver as many as three cuts to rates by the end of this year. Theyre betting on a 55% chance of that, up from 44% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.  On Wall Street, Nvidia helped support the market after rising 1.8% to cut its loss for the year so far to 12.5%. It hosted an event  Tuesday where it largely did a nice job laying out the roadmap and fighting back against speculation the artificial-intelligence industry is seeing a slowdown in demand for computing power, according to UBS analysts led by Timothy Arcuri.  Tesla rose 4.7%, following two straight losses of roughly 5%. Its still down 41.6% for 2025 so far. Its been struggling on worries that customers are turned off by CEO Elon Musks leading efforts to slash spending by the U.S. government.  On the losing side of Wall Street was General Mills, which fell 2.1% despite reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.  The cereal and snack makers revenue fell short of analysts targets, in part because of a slowdown in sales for snacks. General Mills also cut forecasts for revenue and profit over its full fiscal year, partly because it expects macroeconomic uncertainty to continue to affect its customers. All told, the S&P 500 rose 60.63 points to 5,675.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 383.32 to 41,964.63, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 246.67 to 17,750.79. In stock markets abroad, Japans Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% after the Bank of Japan held steady on its own interest rates, as was widely expected. Japan also reported a trade surplus  for February, with exports rising more than 11% as manufacturers rushed to beat rising tariffs imposed by Trump.

"Stock market today: Wall Street slips following Trumps latest tariffs, despite solid economic data","NEW YORK (AP)  Wall Street edged lower Thursday after getting pulled in opposite directions as President Donald Trumps  latest tariff escalation creates winners and losers among auto stocks. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% after drifting between small gains and losses several times through the day. Better-than-expected  data on the economy also helped support the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 155 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%. General Motors sank 7.4% for one of the markets sharper losses after Trump announced 25% tariffs on imported cars. Ford Motor dropped 3.9%.  Even U.S. automakers  selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) There are still a lot of unknowns, but if this remains in place, there will clearly be some pain for the companies to digest, according to UBS analyst Joseph Spak.  The APs Seth Sutel reports stocks are drifting in early trading. Among the uncertainties are how the U.S. government will determine how to apply tariffs to parts that are compliant with the free-trade agreement that the United States and Mexico and Canada have, but are not made entirely within the United States. Tracking parts could be difficult, according to Spak. Automakers based outside the United States also sank. In Seoul, Hyundai Motor dropped 4.3%. In Tokyo, Honda Motor fell 2.5%, and Toyota Motor lost 2%.  
        
     But U.S. electric-vehicle makers Rivian and Tesla held up much better. They look to face less pressure from Trumps tariffs because more of their production happens in the United States. Rivian rallied 7.6%, and Elon Musks Tesla  added 0.4% after paring an earlier, bigger gain.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) Companies that could benefit from drivers opting against buying new cars also revved higher. Among auto parts retailers, AutoZone gained 4%, and OReilly Automotive climbed 3.1%. CarMax, which sells used autos, rose 2.5%.  Expectations are high for stock markets worldwide to remain shaky as an April 2 deadline approaches for tariffs. Thats what Trump has called Liberation Day, when he will roll out tariffs tailored to the United States trading partners. In each case, he said the reciprocal tariff will match the burden the other country places on the United States, including things like value-added taxes.  Hopes are still high that Trump may ultimately opt for more targeted or milder tariffs that are less painful for the global economy than feared. But even if he does, all the talk about tariffs has already made U.S. consumers and businesses feel more cautious and pessimistic. If such sour moods convince them to pull back on their spending, it could hurt the economy. So far, the economy has seemed to be holding up. One report on Thursday said slightly fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week than economists expected. Its the latest sign the job market may be settling into a low fire, low hire state.  A second report said the U.S. economys growth during the final three months of last year was slightly stronger  than earlier estimated.  The better-than-expected data helped Treasury yields in the bond market remain relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.36% from 4.35% late Wednesday.  On Wall Street, Petco Health & Wellness jumped 31.6% after the retailer reported slightly stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected.  All told, the S&P 500 slipped 18.89 points to 5,693.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 155.09 to 42,299.70, and the Nasdaq composite fell 94.98 to 17,804.03. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.  Japans Nikkei 225 fell 0.6% following the losses for many of its automakers, and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday, We strongly request that tariff measures not be applied to Japan.  In China, stocks rose 0.1% in Shanghai and 0.4% in Hong Kong. Chinese automakers and parts manufacturers have been expanding sales around the world, but not in the United States, so any impact from the tariffs announcement would be an indirect one.  ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott and AP Videographer Ayaka McGill contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-tariffs-rates-autos-df6909dce420a676fa8e74d161451ad3,business
Stock market today: Wall Street edges lower despite solid data on the economy,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stock indexes edged lower Thursday following another reminder that big, unsettling policy changes are underway because of President Donald Trump, along with more signals suggesting the U.S. economy remains solid for now.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% after flipping between modest gains and losses through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped by 11 points, or less than 0.1 %, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%.  Wall Street has been swinging for weeks on a roller-coaster  ride, as stock prices veer on uncertainty about what Trumps trade war will do to the economy. Stocks got a boost Wednesday  after the head of the Federal Reserve said the economy remains solid enough at the moment to leave interest rates where they are.  More data arrived Thursday to bolster that view. One report said slightly fewer U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits  last week than economists expected. Its the latest sign of a potentially low fire, low hire job market.  The APs Seth Sutel reports stocks opened in positive territory. A separate report said sales of previously occupied homes  were stronger last month than economists expected, while a third said manufacturing growth in the mid-Atlantic region appears to be better than economists expected.  But Fed Chair Jerome Powell also stressed on Wednesday that extremely high uncertainty is making it difficult to forecast what will happen next. Its not just uncertainty about the trade war affecting Wall Street. Accenture fell to one of the markets larger losses Thursday even though the consulting and professional services company reported slightly better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.  
        
     Worries are rising about the hit Accenture may take to its revenue from the U.S. government as Elon Musk leads efforts to cut federal spending. The federal government accounted for 17% of Accentures North American revenue last fiscal year, and its stock sank 7.3%.  The broad U.S. stock market was likely due for its recent drop, which took it more than 10% below its all-time high  in just a few weeks, after prices climbed much faster than corporate profits to make it look too expensive, according to Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel.  He said the S&P 500 could bounce higher in the near term, particularly after Fed officials indicated Wednesday they see room to cut interest rates twice this year. Lower interest rates would give a boost to the economy, as well as prices for investments. The market has also traditionally had relief rallies after major, long-term upward runs for stocks cracked, Bannister said.  But he expects stock prices to remain under pressure as the economys growth slows more sharply in the second half of the year and as inflation remains stubbornly high. That could create a mild form of stagflation, which is something the Fed doesnt have good tools to fix. The Fed could lower interest rates further to help the economy, but that would also push upward on inflation.  On Wall Street, Darden Restaurants climbed 5.8% after reporting profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts expectations. That was despite what the company behind Olive Garden, Ruths Chris Steak House and other restaurant chains called a challenging environment. All told, the S&P 500 slipped 12.40 points to 5,662.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11.31 to 41,953.32, and the Nasdaq composite fell 59.16 to 17,691.63. In stock markets abroad, Londons FTSE 100 fell 0.1% after the Bank of England held its main interest rate steady. Indexes fell more sharply across much of the rest of Europe, and German stocks in the DAX lost 1.2%. The drop was even worse in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index fell 2.2% following heavy pressure on tech-related stocks.

"Groceries are expensive, but they dont have to break the bank. Here are some tips to save","NEW YORK (AP)  If youve noticed that youre paying more than before for the same amount of groceries, youre not the only one. Inflation is easing, but grocery prices are still high  up 21%, on average, since inflation started to surge more than three years ago. Unlike some other items, you cant just stop buying groceries when they get pricey. Theres nothing you can do about inflation, but you can find ways to save on groceries so they dont heavily affect your wallet or your eating habits. These include using coupons, budgeting and buying in bulk.  Heres are some expert recommendations for saving on groceries:  Kiersten Torok started using coupons back when she was in high school, after her parents lost their jobs during the 2008 recession. She began relying on them even more in 2020, when she lost her own job during the pandemic. Now shes using her social media platform to help others learn how to save. When times like these come up, coupons are a necessity for so many Americans, said Torok, known on Instagram and TikTok as Torok Coupon Hunter.  Many might think that using coupons means cutting them out of a magazine. While you can certainly still do that, there are now easier ways to get the discounts. Many stores, like Walmart and Target, have coupons available on their apps.  All you have to do is scan an item in a store, the coupons pop up on your app and then they automatically apply in the register, Torok said. Its become much more streamlined.  One of Toroks coupon golden rules is: Never pay big for toothpaste  theres always a combination of coupons and offers available. For anyone who wants to try couponing, Torok recommends that you first start using them at your favorite store and never buy things you dont need, even if theres a big discount.  Apps like Flipp, which lets you browse for coupons from all major grocery stores, and Ibotta, an app that gives you cashback for using coupons, can make your journey with couponing easier.  
        
     Making a budget is a key to keeping grocery spending under control, and the first step is to track how much youre already spending. Start by reviewing how much you have spent on the last few times youve gone grocery shopping, recommended David Brindley, deputy editor for AARP Bulletin.  If you dont keep receipts from past grocery runs, try looking at your bank account statement and adding up the grocery charges. Once you know how much you spend on groceries, set a goal, for example, staying within a specific budget or reducing your spending.  You need a plan, but before you make one, ensure you know what you currently have in your fridge and your pantry. Sarah Schweisthal, personal finance expert and social media manager at budgeting app YNAB, recommends taking everything out and making an inventory so you dont buy duplicates of things you already have on hand. Brindley also recommends planning to cook multiple meals with similar ingredients, which saves money and also cuts down on food waste.  Once youve tracked your spending and inventoried what you already have, the next step is to make a plan. Write down the items youre looking to buy and your estimated cost, making sure you stay on budget. Meal planning for the week or month can be a good way to stay on top of your spending, Schweisthal said.  Going up and down the aisles can sometimes make you crave things that you havent planned for, like a snack or a new dish. If you foresee that itll be hard for you to stick to your list, include some flexibility in your plan, such as allotting a specific amount to buy snacks or a random item you see at the checkout line.  I think having flexibility in a plan actually helps you stick to it more, Schweisthal said. Making a plan can be as simple as writing down a list on paper or in your phones notes app. Or, you can use apps that specifically help you with meal planning such as AnyList or Mealime.  If you tend to wander off your grocery list because every time you go to the store you buy things you dont need, shopping online and picking up curbside is a good workaround.  I 100% recommend sitting down Sunday morning and just looking at the stores and comparing the items you need for the week, especially with things you can get for curbside pickup, Torok said.  If you buy your groceries from multiple stores because each has better prices on some items, ordering ahead of time can also save time.  If you are in charge of buying groceries for your entire family, it can be beneficial to include them in your grocery budgeting routine. For Torok, this has meant teaching her children how to scan coupons while they shop. Since buying in bulk can be very cost-effective. Brindley also recommends that you team up with a friend or a family member to buy specific items in bulk and share the discount.  Lastly, you can save money by using food-sharing apps such as Olio, which connects people around their community to share extra grocery items, and Too Good to Go, where you can buy surplus food at a discount. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Wrongful death suit against Disney serves as a warning to consumers when clicking I agree,"A wrongful death lawsuit against Walt Disney Parks and Resorts is serving as a reminder to consumers of the importance of reading the fine print when signing up for a streaming service or smartphone app. The lawsuit was filed by the family of a New York woman who died after eating at a restaurant in Disney Springs, an outdoor dining, shopping and entertainment complex in Florida owned by Disney. Disney is arguing that the lawsuit should be dropped because the plaintiff, the womans husband, once signed up for a trial subscription of the Disney+ streaming service. That service, they argue, includes a subscriber agreement in which the customer agrees to settle any lawsuits against Disney out of court through arbitration. Such agreements, which customers quickly consent to by clicking I agree when downloading an app or a streaming service, are so stacked against the consumer that its often difficult to offer good legal advice, said John Davisson, director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  The consumer is presented with this contract and really doesnt have an opportunity to negotiate the terms, Davisson said. Its yes or no. 
        
     Kanokporn Tangsuans family says in the lawsuit that the 42-year-old New York doctor had a fatal allergic reaction after eating at an Irish pub in Disney Springs. The lawsuit claims Tangsuan and her husband, Jeffrey Piccolo, and his mother decided to eat at Raglan Road in October 2023 because it was billed on Disneys website as having allergen free food.  The suit alleges Tangsuan informed their server numerous times that she had a severe allergy to nuts and dairy products, and that the waiter guaranteed the food was allergen-free. About 45 minutes after finishing their dinner, Tangsuan had difficulty breathing while out shopping, collapsed and died at a hospital, according to the lawsuit. A medical examiner determined she died as a result of anaphylaxis due to elevated levels of dairy and nut in her system, the lawsuit said. Disney said in a statement this week that it is deeply saddened by the familys loss but stressed that the Irish pub, which also is being sued, is neither owned nor operated by the company. More notably from a consumer protection standpoint, Disney argues that Piccolo had agreed to settle any lawsuits against Disney out of court through arbitration when he signed up for a one-month trial of Disney+ in 2019 and acknowledged that he had reviewed the fine print. The first page of the Subscriber Agreement states, in all capital letters, that any dispute between You and Us, Except for Small Claims, is subject to a class action waiver and must be resolved by individual binding arbitration, the company wrote in a motion seeking to have the case dismissed.  Arbitration allows people to settle disputes without going to court and generally involves a neutral arbitrator who reviews arguments and evidence before making a binding decision, or award. Piccolos lawyer, in a response filed this month, argued that it was absurd to believe that the more than 150 million subscribers to Disney+ have waived all rights to sue the company and its affiliates in perpetuity  especially when their case has nothing to do with the popular streaming service. While its difficult to give consumers actionable advice when such agreements are so lopsided in favor of companies, Davisson suggested supporting lawmakers and regulators who are attentive to these issues. The Federal Trade Commission has historically supported the idea of disclosure terms protecting companies, even though the agreements are often dense and hard for typical consumers to comprehend. But Davisson says there has been a shift among policymakers and federal regulators. Generally, its understood that it is literally impossible for consumers to read and interpret and fully understand all of the contracts that theyre being asked and expected by the law to agree to and abide by as they go about their day, he said. Especially in an increasingly online world in which were interacting with dozens or hundreds of platforms and services a day. ___ Lewis reported from New York and Murphy from Oklahoma City.",https://apnews.com/article/disney-allergy-death-lawsuit-nyu-doctor-florida-8a6256b58311a01226d167fa80d37aad,business
How to prepare for the Feds forthcoming interest rate cuts,"NEW YORK (AP)  The Federal Reserve is poised to cut its benchmark interest rate next month from its 23-year high, with consequences for consumers when it comes to debt, savings, auto loans and mortgages. Right now, most experts envision three quarter-point Fed cuts  in September, November and December  though even steeper rate cuts are possible. The time has come for the Fed to reduce interest rates, Powell said Friday in his keynote speech at the Feds annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Based on Powells remarks and recent economic data, the central bank is expected to cut its key rate by a quarter-point when it meets next month and to carry out additional rate cuts in the coming months. Heres what consumers should know: According to Greg McBride, chief credit analyst for Bankrate, savers should lock in attractive yields right now, before the expected rate cuts begin.  For those who might be looking at Certificates of Deposit or bonds  you want to jump on that now, he said. There is not a benefit to waiting because interest rates are going to be moving lower. McBride stressed that anyone closer to retirement has a good opportunity to lock in CDs at the current relatively high rates.  If you do so, youll provide yourself a predictable flow of interest income at rates that should outpace inflation by a pretty healthy margin, said McBride. 
        
     Your credit card bill is not going to plunge the day after the next Fed meeting, cautions LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz. Nobody should expect miracles. That said, the declining benchmark rate will eventually mean better rates for borrowers, many of whom are facing some of the highest credit card interest rates in decades. The average interest rate is 23.18% for new offers and 21.51% for existing accounts, according to WalletHubs August Credit Card Landscape Report. Still, its really important for people to understand that rates probably arent going to fall that quickly, Schulz said.  He said its important to take steps such as seeking a 0% interest balance transfer or a low-interest personal loan. You can also call your credit card issuer to see if you can negotiate a better rate. In the short term, those things will have a much bigger effect than falling interest rates, Schulz said. The Federal Reserves benchmark rate doesnt directly set or correspond to mortgage rates, but it does have an influence, and the two tend to move in the same direction, said LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel. In recent weeks, mortgage rates have already declined ahead of the Feds predicted cut, he pointed out.  It goes to show that even when the Fed isnt doing anything and just holding steady, mortgage rates can still move, Channel said. Melissa Cohn, the regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, echoed this, saying that the most important thing is what signal the Fed is sending to the market, rather than the rate change itself.  Ive heard from a lot of people who locked in (their mortgage rate) over the course of the past 18 months, when rates were at their peak, already asking whether its time to refinance and what savings they could have, she said. I think that the outlook is good, and hopefully that spills into the real estate market, and we get more buyers in the market. Channel said that the majority of Americans have mortgages at 5%, so rates may have to fall further than their current average of 6.46% before many people consider refinancing.  With auto loans, its good news that rates will be falling, but it doesnt change the basic blocking and tackling of things, which is that its still really important to shop around and not just accept the rate that a car dealer would offer you at the dealership, said Bankrates McBride. Its also really important to save what you can and be able to try to put as much down on that vehicle as you can. McBride does predict that the beginning of rate cuts and the avoidance of a recession will lead to lower auto loan rates in 2024  at least for borrowers with strong credit profiles. For those with lower credit profiles, double digit rates will likely persist for the remainder of the year.  Last week, the government reported that consumer prices rose just 2.9% in July from a year ago, the smallest increase in over three years. Employment data, however, gives some economists pause. New data has showed hiring in July was much less than expected and the jobless rate has reached 4.3%, the highest in three years  one measure of a weakening economy. That said, robust retail sales have helped quell fears of a recession.  The rate at which the Fed continues to cut rates after September will depend in part on what happens next with inflation and the job market, in the coming weeks and months.  ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck may not have had a prenuptial agreement, but you should consider one","NEW YORK (AP)  Longtime celebrity watchers may not have been shocked when Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, but what was surprising was that Lopezs divorce petition did not include any mention of a prenuptial agreement. A prenup is a legal document for soon-to-be-married couples that lays out how they will divide their assets during their marriage and if they divorce. Theyre common for celebrities and very wealthy couples, but divorce law attorney Raiford Dalton Palmer says you should consider one even if you dont have a lot of money.  Prenups are not just for rich people, said Palmer, who is a managing shareholder of STG Divorce Law. They can be very important for people that dont have as much money because every dollar spent on attorneys fees is a dollar that youre not able to spend on your children or yourself. If you plan to get married soon, heres what you need to know about prenuptial agreements: When approaching the topic with your significant other, timing is key. Family law attorney Linda J. Ravdin recommends that you have the conversation sooner rather than later and dont wait until youre halfway through organizing your wedding. As soon as they start talking about marriage, the person who wants the prenup should be saying something, Ravdin said.  Its also important to be aware of your states deadline to submit a prenuptial agreement. For example, California has a seven-day rule, which means that one person needs to present a preliminary prenuptial agreement seven days before the other person can sign it. This is meant to make sure the other person has enough time to review the document.  
        
     Talking about prenuptial agreements can be especially difficult since it involves full transparency about your finances. To avoid conflict or hurt feelings, attorney Julia Rodgers recommends approaching the conversation gently.  Its just as much an emotional document as it is a legal one, said Rodgers, who is the CEO of Hello Prenup, an online prenuptial agreement platform.  Rodgers recommends discussing why you want a prenup and your fears surrounding it. One common reason younger people cite for wanting a prenup is witnessing how difficult their parents divorces were. You should discuss what assets you have and how you would divide them if you happen to divorce. This is also the time to have important conversations about expectations during your marriage.  Rodgers recommends asking the following questions:   Do you want kids? If so, are both people going to continue working?   If you dont want kids, what kind of lifestyle do you want?   Do you want to buy a house or rent?   How often do you want to take a long vacation?   What type of debt do you have?   Do you want to open a business in the future?  Prenuptial agreements can be equated to estate planning, Palmer said. Couples dont get married expecting they will divorce, but planning in case it does happen can save them headaches and money.  Its really appropriate for people that want to make divorce less painful, less expensive and they have property they wish to protect, Palmer said.  With or without a prenuptial agreement, going through a divorce will take lots of time and money. But having a prenup can ease the conversations about the division of property, alimony and debt. However, prenuptial agreements dont include child support or any other topics related to children.  A common misconception about prenups is that they benefit the highest-earning spouse, but this is not true, Rodgers said. Because prenuptial agreements are drafted by both parties, with their respective lawyers, they ideally protect both spouses.  Prenuptial agreements are not only useful if the couple divorces. Because they lay out finances and future planning, they can also be used to lay out expectations from both parties during the marriage and in case of death.  If you dont have a prenup, what happens when you divorce will depend on the law in your state. Every state has default laws that establish how the division of property is handled in divorces. These laws typically try to divide the assets equally, but thats not always the case, Palmer said. Any debt or new property acquired during the marriage would also be divided according to state law.  If you take on student loan debt during your marriage, that student loan debt could be considered marital or community property, depending on what state youre in, Rodgers said.  In some states, like California, if a couple doesnt have a prenuptial agreement, they are required to divide their assets in half. In other states, such as Iowa and Colorado, the distribution will be proportional but not equal. Oftentimes in these states, aspects like earning potential and financial needs are considered. Once youre ready to start drafting a prenup, you each need a lawyer to help you write or review it. Ravdin first asks clients to fill out a worksheet where they can lay down what theyre looking for in the prenuptial agreement and use this as a blueprint for the draft.  If its clear what they want or whats acceptable to both of them, I can go ahead and draft the agreement, Ravdin said.  The price of the prenuptial agreements process depends on your state and your attorney. In many cases, prenuptial agreements start from $1,000. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Did Donald Trump  or ABC News choose who would interview the president? Why does it matter?,"NEW YORK (AP)  During a contentious exchange about deportations in his interview with ABC News Terry Moran this week, President Donald Trump brought up  from his perspective  how Moran had gotten into the White House in the first place. Theyre giving you the break of a lifetime, you know, Trump said in Tuesdays prime-time broadcast. Youre doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but thats OK. Emphasizing again that it was his choice that Moran was there, the president scolded, Youre not being very nice. From an ethics perspective, its considered a breach for a news organization to let a newsmaker dictate who will conduct an interview. In the real world of competitive journalism, things arent always so simple.  This image provided by ABC shows Terry Moran posing for a portrait, Nov. 15, 2018 (Pawel Kaminski/ABC via AP) This image provided by ABC shows Terry Moran posing for a portrait, Nov. 15, 2018 (Pawel Kaminski/ABC via AP) We dont know. ABC on Thursday would not talk publicly about what arrangements were discussed after Trump agreed to speak to the network about the first 100 days of his administration. ABC privately pushes back against the notion that Trump was given a list of potential interviewers, but its unclear whether other names came up. On its face, Moran would seem an unexpected choice. At 65, hes been with the network since 1997 and was chief White House correspondent during George W. Bushs first term. He had nine one-on-one interviews with Barack Obama. But his profile at ABC News has diminished. Hes an anchor for the ABC News Live streaming service and covers the Supreme Court for the network.  
        
     There would seem to be more obvious alternatives, like World News Tonight anchor David Muir, effectively the face of the news division. Mary Bruce is the current chief White House correspondent. Jonathan Karl has written three books about Trump and rotates as a host of the This Week Sunday show with Martha Raddatz.  Only George Stephanopoulos would seem off the table, since Trump sued him for defamation in a case settled last December.  Why would a news organization not want to cede the choice of an interviewer to the president? It undermines our independence as journalists, said Kelly McBride, a media ethics expert and senior vice president at the Poynter Institute. When we make decisions of what questions are going to be asked, whos doing the interview and how we edit the interview, we do it in service to the audience. If we let the powerful person that we are attempting to get information from choose who does the interview or select the questions, were breaking our promise to the audience that we would be acting on their behalf, she said.  Practically speaking, however, a president has a great deal of power in these dynamics. Whatever the well-established challenges inherent in interviewing Trump, news organizations prize an exclusive interview with the president, any president. At any given moment, his press office likely has many requests for interviews, usually with a specific journalists name attached. He already has choices. The Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to wield more control over who questions the president. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has invited new, mostly friendly, journalists into the White House briefing room and talked about further changes in who is allowed there. The administration sparked a court fight with The Associated Press over access to the Oval Office. When he worked as a news executive at CNN and NBC News, Mark Whitaker said he would discuss interviews with the White House involving certain journalists, but the idea of giving a choice is not something I ever saw. he said. Andrew Heyward, a former CBS News president, said he understands the principle of not ceding the decision of who asks the questions, but as a practical matter, its often a negotiation. Heyward stressed he had no inside information about what happened with ABC News this week.   In some cases, the importance of landing an interview ahead of a competitor can take precedence over the principle of controlling who does the asking. Its value is illustrated in the ratings: nearly 4 million people watched Morans interview with Trump on Tuesday, the largest audience of anything on television that night, the Nielsen company said. There was even more at stake during the Wild West days of television networks competing for big celebrity interviews, primarily at the end of the last century. Shamefully, the interviewee was in the drivers seat whenever it came to the flavor-of-the-week or the most sought-after new interview, said veteran broadcast journalist Connie Chung. It was one of the reasons why I despised getting the so-called get. It was a matter of who could grovel better. On many of those occasions, news organizations didnt always speak with one voice; Diane Sawyer and Barbara Walters often competed fiercely for the same interviews when they both worked at ABC News. In 2001, Chung recalled that Walters was designated by ABC to interview scandal-scarred U.S. Rep. Gary Condit, but the congressmans representative said they were going to another network unless Chung did the story. Chung got the interview. So what if the days big celebrity is the president of the United States? It is a bit of a gray area, Heyward said. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

State parks in Florida appear off-limits to development as lawmakers react to outcry,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP)  State parks would be protected from pickleball courts, golf courses and hotel development under a bill passed unanimously by the Florida House on Thursday in response to last summers statewide outcry over plans for these kinds of projects. The bill now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis for final approval, and his office hasnt said if hell sign it. The Republican governor distanced himself from the proposal following the backlash, saying he never saw or approved plans to allow resorts and sports facilities on state park land. DeSantis leads and appoints the heads of all state agencies.  The issue created a dilemma for Republican lawmakers who have traditionally defended the governors administration, and increased scrutiny of DeSantis record on environmental conservation.  Protections for state parks are reflected loud and clear in the bill, said state Rep. John Snyder.  Weve put real plans in place to make sure that, for generations to come, our state parks will be preserved, said Snyder, who represents a district about an hour north of Palm Beach. He noted the parks are enjoyed by millions of residents and tourists alike. The bill doesnt ban all types of development. But any projects must be conservation-based recreational uses that support things like hiking, swimming, horseback riding, boating, studying nature and other similar activities, according to a House staff analysis. 
        
     Snyder said the bills language was strengthened by an amendment proposed in the Senate, which also added a name change for a state park in Tallahassee. The public first got wind that DeSantis environmental agency was looking for recreational development plans in state parks when the Great Outdoors Initiative was leaked last August. Hundreds of people protested at parks and the states environmental protection headquarters, waving signs like Parks Over Profit and Save Dont Pave. Before the month was over, the governor said the Department of Environmental Protections plans were going back to the drawing board.  The environment secretary at the time, Shawn Hamilton, eventually stepped down after facing intensified scrutiny and bipartisan criticism of the initiative. In November, DeSantis appointed a new head of the agency, Alexis Lambert.",https://apnews.com/article/florida-state-parks-development-desantis-efa876a2540dd4291899aa53f5d56991,business
60 Minutes report that prompted Trump lawsuit is nominated for an Emmy Award,"It got 60 Minutes sued by the man who became president of the United States. Now its up for a major award  for precisely the same aspect of it that so enraged Donald Trump. Last falls 60 Minutes story on Kamala Harris  the subject of Trumps $20 billion lawsuit against CBS  was nominated for an Emmy Award Thursday for outstanding edited interview. Trump, in his lawsuit, complained that the interview was deceptively edited to make his Democratic election opponent look good. The annual News & Documentary Emmys will be awarded in late June. 60 Minutes is competing against interviews with singer Celine Dion, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Pope Francis and WNBA star Brittney Griner. The fallout over the Harris interview still hangs over CBS News. The news division claims to have done nothing wrong, but its parent company, Paramount Global, is reportedly negotiating a settlement with Trump. Many CBS News journalists oppose a settlement. Former 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens, who has fought against such a deal, resigned last month. Owens cited in his resignation the corporate restrictions placed on him in the wake of the Harris story, which is also the subject of an investigation by President Trumps FCC chairman. Trump complained about the interview again on Wednesday in a Truth Social post. This time, his anger spread to The New York Times, which in a story on Tuesday said that legal experts have called the suit baseless and an easy victory for CBS. 
        
     They dont mean that, they just have a non curable case of TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, the president wrote, saying hes looking into potential legal action against the newspaper.

US House votes to block Californias nation-leading vehicle emissions rules,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  The Republican-controlled U.S. House voted Thursday to block California from enforcing first-in-the-nation rules phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.  The move comes a day after the chamber voted to halt California standards to cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.  The passage of these resolutions is a victory for Americans who will not be forced into purchasing costly EVs because of Californias unworkable mandates, House Republicans Brett Guthrie of Kentucky and Morgan Griffith of Virginia, said in a statement. If not repealed, the California waivers would lead to higher prices for both new and used vehicles, increase our reliance on China, and strain our electric grid. California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal governments. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 announced plans to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035, as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.  State regulators then formalized the rules, some other states announced plans to follow them, and the Biden administration approved the states waiver to implement them in December, a month before President Donald Trump returned to office. This weeks House votes fell largely along party lines, though some Democrats joined Republicans to advance them. That would be against the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian, who sides with the U.S. General Accountability Office in saying Californias policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House. 
        
     Republicans used the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked Californias ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but Biden later restored the states authority.  But the California standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, wrote in a letter to Congress in March. Newsom said the effort is another signal of Republicans ideological shift over the decades from an era in which former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan signed landmark environmental laws to one in which Trump is pushing for environmental rollbacks on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Clean air didnt used to be political, Newsom said in a statement. Our vehicles program helps clean the air for all Californians, and well continue defending it. A spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, which passed the vehicle emission standards, said the agency will continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution. It is unclear what will happen in the Senate. The Senate Parliamentarian in April reaffirmed the GAOs findings that Californias Clean Air Act waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, according to California Sen. Adam Schiffs office. We will fight this latest attack on Californias power to protect its own residents, and I will urge my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the severe implications of proceeding with this violation of states rights, as well as the dangerous precedent it would set by flouting the unanimous opinion of Congress trusted arbiters, the Democrat said in a statement. Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversitys Safe Climate Transport Campaign, called the use of the Congressional Review Act a backdoor move that shows just how recklessly Republicans behave. Republicans may regret opening this Pandoras box, inviting attacks on many other non-rules in the future when theyre no longer in charge, Becker said in a statement.  But the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers applauded Thursdays vote, calling it a huge win for U.S. consumers. Californias unlawful ban should never have been authorized, and Governor Newsom should never have been allowed to seize this much control over the American vehicle market, Mike Sommers, the institutes president and CEO, and Chet Thompson, the manufacturers groups president and CEO, said in a joint statement. ___ Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro in Washington and Trn Nguyn in Sacramento contributed to this report. ___ Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Midwest carbon dioxide pipeline could face new hurdle as some Iowa lawmakers question eminent domain,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)  A proposed carbon-capture pipeline that would traverse through several Midwestern states could face more hurdles in Iowa as a dozen Republican state senators try to force the issue to a vote. Summit Carbon Solutions already will likely have to readjust plans for their estimated $8.9 billion, 2,500-mile (4,023-kilometer) project after South Dakotas governor signed a ban on the use of eminent domain  the government seizure of private property with compensation  to acquire land for carbon dioxide pipelines. Now, after several proposals advanced through the Republican-controlled Iowa House, 12 GOP state senators have told their Republican leaders that they will not vote on any budget, which the Legislature is constitutionally required to approve, until they bring a pipeline bill to the floor.  The people of South Dakota emphatically stated that eminent domain will never be granted for this pipeline to cross South Dakota, and it is past time for lowa to do the same, the senators wrote in a joint letter, saying they believe addressing eminent domain is more important than the budget or any other priority for the 2025 session. Its unclear if the demands will be met or what a measure that passes the full chamber would look like, given the wide range of views on the issue among the 34 Senate Republicans, who hold a supermajority in the chamber. The proposed 2,500-mile pipeline would carry carbon emissions from ethanol plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota to be stored underground permanently in North Dakota. 
        
     By lowering carbon emissions from the plants, the pipeline would lower their carbon intensity scores and make them more competitive in the renewable fuels market. The project would also allow ethanol producers and Summit to tap into federal tax credits. The project received permit approvals in Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota, but it does face various court challenges, and its application was rejected in South Dakota last month. Summit Carbon Solutions has invested four years and nearly $175 million on voluntary agreements in Iowa, signing agreements with more than 1,300 landowners and securing 75% of the Phase One route, Summit spokesperson Sabrina Zenor said in a statement. We are committed to building this project, committed to Iowa, and remain focused on working with legislators  including those with concerns. Some Midwest farmers, despite loyalty to the ethanol industry, have voiced strong opposition to the pipeline since its inception, objecting to its presence on or near their land and questioning the safety of having the pipeline in their backyards. Then, a slew of eminent domain legal actions in South Dakota to obtain land provoked a groundswell of opposition in the state, sending the issue to the governors desk. Lee Enterprises and The Associated Press reviewed hundreds of cases, revealing the great legal lengths the company went to get the project built. Iowa state Sen. Kevin Alons said the senators who are forcing the issue want an amendment to the bill that mimics South Dakotas new law, but it remains to be seen what provisions, if any, would be included in a final version or whether Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds would give it her signature. A number of Republican Senators are working on policy surrounding eminent domain and pipeline issues and I am optimistic we will find a legislative solution, Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver said in a statement. The Iowa House has sent several proposals to the Senate. During debate on the House floor, state Rep. Steven Holt expressed plenty of disappointment that the Senate had not taken up the issue in the past.

FACT FOCUS: Trump claims the US subsidizes Canada. Experts say the numbers dont add up,"Newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited the White House on Tuesday in search of common ground during an ongoing trade war that has shattered decades of trust between the his country and the U.S. Although the conversation was civil, President Donald Trump repeated erroneous rhetoric about how the U.S. provides Canada with billions of dollars in subsidies. Its hard to justify subsidizing Canada to the tune of maybe $200 billion a year, he said. We protect Canada militarily, and we always will. We not going to, you know, thats not a money thing. But we always will. But, you know, its not fair. But why are we subsidizing Canada $200 billion a year or whatever the number might be? Its a very substantial number. Heres a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: The U.S. subsidizes Canada with subsidies of about $200 billion per year. THE FACTS: This is false. According to the White House, the number is based on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and higher military spending by the U.S., including expenditures associated with the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD. An exact total is difficult to discern because there is no publicly available data on NORAD spending. But even the most generous estimates do not put the total costs anywhere close to what Trump claims.  A trade deficit occurs when the cost of a countrys imports are higher than its exports. Using seasonally adjusted data, the U.S. deficit with Canada for both goods and services was $35.661 billion in 2024. It was higher for just goods, ranging from $63.336 billion to $70.603 billion. 
        
     The White House put the goods and services deficit with Canada at $53.5 billion. This is closer to the figure from 2022  $57.565 billion. Either way, economists agree that describing a trade deficit as a subsidy is wrong. Thats never been the definition of a subsidy, a subsidy is defined as a gift without any compensation in return, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. So whatever the number is, the concept is way off base. Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institutions Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, said a trade deficit occurs based on relative demand in different countries and what they specialize in. In terms of military spending, the White House also pointed to how much the U.S. and Canada spend on their militaries and what percentage of their gross domestic product that is. This appears to be a reference to NATOs investment guideline. Member countries agreed in 2006 to commit to spending a minimum 2% of their GDP on their own defense. Some countries, including Canada, have not yet met that guideline, a lapse which Trump often criticizes. Canada spent $29.3 billion on defense in 2024, which amounted to 1.3% of its GDP. The U.S., which is 13 times bigger than Canada, spent significantly more at $997 billion, or 3.4% of its GDP, exceeding the NATO guideline. Those numbers were slightly lower in 2023  the data cited by the White House  at $27.2 billion and $916 billion respectively, though the percentages of GDP for both were the same. According to the International Monetary Fund, Canadas GDP in 2024 was about $2.241 trillion. This means that the country would have needed to spend $44.82 billion total on defense order to meet the 2% NATO guideline, making it short by approximately $15.52 billion. No, they dont owe us that money, but they arent paying their fair share, and thats a fair criticism. said Mark Cancian, a senior advisor in the Center for Strategic and International Studies defense and security department. Discounting whether they should be deemed subsidies, adding the trade deficit for goods and services in 2024 to Canadas gap in defense spending the same year results in a total of only about $51 billion. Using the highest calculation of the goods deficit only for 2024 pushes the total up, to approximately $86 billion. The White Houses final point was that the U.S. covers about 60 percent of the bill for NORAD. Created in 1954 as a means of defense against possible long-range attacks from the Soviets, NORAD is a bi-national organization jointly run by the U.S. and Canada that is charged with preventing air and maritime attacks against North America. There is no publicly available data on NORAD spending by the U.S. or Canada. The 60% figure cited by the White House refers to a 1985 cost-sharing agreement for the operations and support of NORADs North Warning System that is still in place today. In 2022, then-Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand announced a $4.9 billion (US $3.52 billion) investment in NORAD over six years and $38.6 billion (US $27.72 billion) over 20 years on an accrual basis. Defense economists Binyam Solomon and Ross Fetterly quantified NORAD burden sharing by the U.S. and Canada in a paper first published in 2023 by the journal Defense and Peace Economics titled, Canada and NORAD: Economics and Burden Sharing. The pair found that the numbers change drastically depending on how they are calculated. One estimate found that the U.S. shoulders about 97.6% of the North American defense burden while receiving about 64% of the benefits. Canada, meanwhile, contributes about 2% of the burden while enjoying about 36% of the benefits. But leaving out the variable of Canadas vast exposed border means that the U.S. shoulders the same burden while enjoying 91% of the benefits. In this instance, Canada enjoys just 9% of the benefits. A sizable portion of NORAD warning and control systems are in Canadian territory, according to the paper. Cancian explained that the U.S. needs Canadas help to effectively defend North America from its own land because if air defenses started at the U.S. border, it would be too late to prevent many threats. Even if the Canadians pulled out, wed have to have something like that in place, he said of NORAD. So I would not consider that a subsidy at all. Canadians can make a fair argument that we owe them. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-us-canada-trade-deficit-military-norad-spending-1417673f38f1829334a4e571ea058e03,business
What your net worth statement is telling you,"A summary of all your assets and liabilities is a crucial first step toward getting a better handle on your finances. Before you start putting together a net worth spreadsheet, gather as much information as you can to get the best sense of what it can tell you. The ultimate insight from a net worth statement is exactly what it says: the net worth number, which is simply assets minus liabilities. The number in isolation doesnt tell you too much, but it is a useful benchmark to track over time. A negative net worth figure would obviously indicate room for improvement. To calculate your debt ratio, youll need to add up all required monthly debt payments, including mortgage payments, student loans, auto loans, and credit card debt. Then take the total and divide it by your monthly gross (pretax) income. Lower is better for this number, and any number greater than 43% will likely create problems in obtaining or refinancing a mortgage. Most financial advisors recommend keeping at least three to six months worth of monthly living expenses in cash or other low-risk, highly liquid assets to cover a sudden job loss or other unforeseen events, such as car repairs, appliance replacement, or other home repairs. Some investors may want to keep closer to 12 months worth of expenses in cash if variable pay makes up a significant portion of their total compensation. This question normally comes up in the context of divorce, but it can be worth considering for couples who plan to remain married, as well. Depending on your states estate-tax limits  and potential future changes to federal estate-tax laws it can be beneficial for couples to try to balance out the assets owned by each individual. Its also important for each member of a couple to have their own retirement assets.  
        
     Theres no particular reason why the allocations need to be exactly one third each, but the principle of equitable distribution helps avoid assets that are out of balance in any particular area. In particular, its wise to avoid an overly large concentration in residential real estate because its not particularly liquid. Investors should generally direct most of their savings toward tax-deferred retirement accounts, but once those have accumulated a healthy balance, it can make sense to steer some savings toward taxable accounts. If any one stock accounts for a large share of your net worth, that might be cause for concern. Thats particularly true in the case of employer stock because it means that your human capital  your ability to generate income and earn a living  and financial capital both depend on the fortunes of one company.  For most assets, valuation is straightforward. But things get a bit trickier for collectibles that arent liquid, such as antiques and baseball cards. For any physical assets, make sure all of these assets are both securely stored and itemized on their homeowners insurance policy. Life is complicated enough without having a bunch of financial accounts scattered across different institutions. Its easy to accumulate multiple accounts if you changed jobs and never moved assets from a previous employers plan or set up different IRAs at different times. But the hassle of keeping track of account numbers, passwords, and updated account balances may not be worth it. Thats particularly true for investors approaching age 72 when required minimum distributions kick in. Investors dont have to take RMDs from each account but will need to base their withdrawals on the account totals in every covered account. Having a limited number of accounts to deal with also makes things easier for family members if you die or become incapacitated. __ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

"Wall Street loses ground, breaking a 9-day winning streak, and crude oil prices tumble","NEW YORK (AP)  Stocks closed lower on Wall Street Monday, breaking a nine-day winning streak, as oil prices hit a four-year low after the OPEC+ group announced plans to increase output. The losses came amid a relatively calm day of mostly mixed trading. They follow several weeks of gains that helped the market wipe away its losses since the ongoing trade war began. The S&P 500 fell 36.29 points, or 0.6%, to 5,650.38. The decline broke the benchmark indexs longest winning streak since 2004. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 98.60 points, or 0.2%, to 41,218.83. The Nasdaq composite fell 133.49 points, or 0.7%, to 17,844.24. Technology companies and other big stocks were among the heaviest weights on the market. Apple slumped 3.1%, while Amazon fell 1.9% and Tesla slipped 2.4%. Berkshire Hathaway fell 5.1%. Legendary investor Warren Buffett announced over the weekend that he would step down as CEO by the end of the year after six decades at the helm. Buffett will still be chairman of the board of directors. The APs Seth Sutel reports stocks stumble to start the week. The OPEC+ group of eight oil producing nations announced over the weekend that it will raise its output by 411,000 barrels per day as of June 1.  U.S. crude oil prices fell 2% to $57.13 per barrel. Many producers can no longer turn a profit once oil falls below $60. Prices are down sharply for the year over worries about an economic slowdown. The energy sector led the losses within the S&P 500. Exxon Mobil shed 2.8%. 
        
     Markets have been absorbing the shock of tariffs and the growing trade war. President Donald Trump has imposed import taxes on a wide range of imports, prompting retaliation from global trading partners. Many of the more severe tariffs that were supposed to go into effect in April were delayed by three months, with the notable exception of tariffs against China. The delays have provided some relief to Wall Street, though uncertainty about the impact from current and future tariffs continues to hang over markets and the economy.  Uncertainty remains elevated and economic data will likely weaken in the coming months, meaning further bouts of volatility are likely, said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. That uncertainty will overshadow the Federal Reserves meeting this week. The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday. It cut the rate three times in 2024 before taking a more cautious stance. The central bank was concerned that inflation, while easing, was still stubbornly hovering just above its target rate of 2%. Concerns about inflation reigniting have only grown amid the global trade war sparked by Trumps tariff policy. The economy has shown some signs that it is feeling the impact from tariffs and the uncertainty over Trumps policy. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3% in the first quarter, marking the first drop in three years. The economy is still showing signs of resilience, however. Consumers have grown more cautious, but still continue to spend. Economic activity in the services sector continued expanding in April, according to a survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The services sector survey and the latest consumer confidence updates also reflect growing concerns over the economys direction. Trumps rapidly shifting policies on trade have kept the Fed and markets on edge. Tariffs have been imposed, only to be pulled or delayed, sometimes on a daily basis. The on-again-off-again approach has left businesses, households and economists at a loss in trying to forecast where the economy might be headed and planning accordingly. The latest salvo in the trade war from Trump came Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform. He said he has authorized a 100% tariff on movies that are produced outside of the U.S. The impact is unclear, as it is common for films to include production at multiple locations around the world. Netflix slumped 1.9% and Warner Bros. Discovery fell 2%. Shoemakers posted gains following the announcement that Skechers is being acquired for $9 billion and taken private by the investment firm by 3G Capital. Skechers jumped 24.3%, while Crocs rose 3.4%. Deckers Outdoor, which owns the Ugg and Teva brands, rose 1.2%. Treasury yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.35% from 4.31% late Friday. ___ AP business writers Jiang Junzhe and Matt Ott contributed to this story.",https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-oil-rates-earnings-trump-98ebdfdb18d490c9e01b6c53c49caad5,business
US stocks sink again as more companies detail damage theyre taking because of Trumps trade war,"U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday as quarterly results show more companies are scrubbing their forecasts for upcoming profits because of uncertainty created by President Donald Trumps tariffs. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, its second drop after breaking a nine-day winning streak, its longest such run in more than 20 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite finished 0.9% lower. Palantir Technologies was one of the heaviest weights on the market as it sank 12%. The company, which offers an AI platform for customers, dropped even though it reported a profit for the latest quarter that met analysts expectations and raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. AI-related companies have been finding it more difficult recently to convince investors to support their stocks after theyve already shot so high. Palantirs stocks price remains near $110, when it was sitting at only $20 less than a year ago.  The APs Seth Sutel tells us the markets are sinking again. The return to Earth for AI stocks is happening as Trumps tariffs change the economic landscape for other companies.  Clorox CEO Linda Rendle said her company saw changes in shopping behavior during the first three months of the year, for example, that led to lower revenue. The company reported both weaker revenue and profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Clorox expects the slowdowns to continue in the current quarter, and its stock fell 2.4%. Mattel, meanwhile, said its pausing its financial forecasts for 2025, in part because the evolving U.S. tariff landscape is making it difficult to predict how much U.S. shoppers will spend over the holiday season and the rest of this year.  
        
     The toymaker closed 2.8% higher after also reporting better results for the latest quarter than analysts feared. Ford Motor said its expecting to take a $1.5 billion hit this year because of tariffs. The automaker also said its cancelling financial forecasts for the full year because of tariff-related uncertainty. The stock rose 2.7%. Theyre the latest companies to join a lengthening list that have yanked their forecasts for the year given uncertainty about what Trumps on-again, off-again rollout of tariffs will do to the economy. The hope is that Trump will relent on some of his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries. Without them, many investors expect the economy to fall into a recession. Regardless, all the will-he-wont-he uncertainty around tariffs has already made U.S. households more pessimistic about the economy and could affect their long-term plans for purchases. That uncertainty has helped fuel a surge in imports ahead of potentially more severe tariffs ahead.  The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of tariffs that went into effect in April and others that have been postponed until July. That follows another update from last week showing that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace during the first quarter of the year because of a surge in imports. Some companies say theyre already seeing impacts to their business from the uncertainty created by tariffs. Food processing giant Archer Daniels Midland said that operating profit for agricultural services slumped 31% during its most recent quarter because of trade policy uncertainty. The stock rose 1.7%. DoorDash fell 7.4% after reporting weaker revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter, though it may have also offered a more encouraging snapshot of how U.S. households are doing. The company said order growth in its U.S. marketplace remained healthy and consistent with average growth over the last year. All told, the S&P 500 fell 43.47 points to 5,606.91. The Dow dropped 389.83 points to 40,829, and the Nasdaq lost 154.58 points to close at 17,689.66. Treasury yields closed broadly lower in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.31% from 4.36% late Monday. The Federal Reserve is beginning a two-day meeting, and it will announce its next move on interest rates Wednesday. Virtually no one expects it to do anything to its main rate, even though Trump has been advocating for cuts. While the possibility still exists for potential rate cuts later this year, the economic picture is complicated, and its too early to know if or when those cuts might happen, said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research and consulting at TransUnion. Lower interest rates could help goose the economy, but they could also give inflation more fuel. And worries are already simmering that Trumps tariffs could push inflation higher. Markets were mixed across Europe and Asia. Indexes rose 1.1% in Shanghai and 0.7% in Hong Kong. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-fed-trump-tariffs-bf90daa13604b67ab355ab63a43e166f,business
"Wall Street climbs in choppy trading after Fed warns of rising risks for economy, holds rates steady","NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks ticked higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left its main interest alone, as was widely expected, but also warned about rising risks for the U.S. economy.  The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, coming off a two-day losing streak that had snapped its nine-day winning run. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 284 points, or 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. Indexes swiveled repeatedly through the day, and the Dow briefly climbed as many as 400 points on hopes that the United States and China may be making the first moves toward a trade deal that could protect the global economy. The worlds two largest economies have been placing ever-increasing tariffs on products coming from each other in an escalating trade war, and the fear is that they could cause a recession unless they allow trade to move more freely. The announcement for high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials this weekend in Switzerland helped raise optimism, but some of that washed away after President Donald Trump said he would not reduce his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods as a condition for negotiations. China has made the de-escalation of the tariffs a requirement for trade negotiations, which the meetings are supposed to help establish. Such on-and-off uncertainty surrounding tariffs has helped create sharp swings within the U.S. economy, including a rush of imports in the hopes of beating tariffs. Underneath those swings, as well as surveys showing U.S. households are growing much more pessimistic about the future, the Fed said it continues to see the economy running at a solid pace at the moment. 
        
     Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that gives the central bank time to wait before making any potential moves on interest rates, even if Trump has been lobbying for quicker cuts to juice the economy. Theres so much that we dont know, Powell said. So like the rest of Wall Street and the world, the Fed is waiting to see what will actually end up happening in Trumps trade war and whether his tariffs, which were much stiffer than expected, will hit as proposed.  Thats particularly the case after the trade war seems to be entering a new phase, Powell said, where the United States is conducting more talks on trade with other countries.  To be sure, the Fed also said it appreciates that risks to the economy are rising because of tariffs, which could both weaken the job market and push inflation higher.  If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment, Powell said.  That could ultimately put the Fed in a worst-case scenario called stagflation, where the economy is stagnating while inflation remains high. Such a combination is hated because the Fed has no good tools to fix it. If the Fed were to try to cut interest rates to bolster the economy and job market, for example, it could raise inflation further. Raising rates would have the opposite effect.  In the meantime, big U.S. companies continue to produce fatter profits for the start of 2025 than analysts expected.  The Walt Disney Co. jumped 10.8% after easily beating analysts profit targets, raising its profit forecast and adding more than a million streaming subscribers.  Companies, though, are also continuing to warn about how uncertainty in the economy is making it more difficult for them to forecast their own finances. Chipmaker Marvell Technology slumped 8% after it postponed its investor day from June to an undetermined date because of uncertainty over the economy. All told, the S&P 500 rose 24.37 points to 5,631.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 284.97 points to 41,113.97, and the Nasdaq composite gained 48.50 to 17,738.16. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell following the Feds announcement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.27% from 4.30% late Tuesday. Markets in Europe mostly lost ground, while markets in Asia rose. Indexes rose 0.1% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after Beijing rolled out interest rate cuts and other moves to help support the Chinese economy and markets as higher tariffs ordered by Trump hit the countrys exports.  ___ AP business writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-trump-661b6e8cfef85034c732c430cefb24aa,business

Wall Street rises on hopes for trade deals that could forestall a recession,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks rose Thursday after the United States and United Kingdom announced a deal on trade that would lower some tariffs between the two countries, the first of what Wall Street hopes will be enough agreements to keep a recession from hitting the economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% for its 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 254 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1%.  It wasnt just stocks. Bitcoin jumped back above $101,000, and crude oil prices climbed, while the price of gold eased back as investors felt less need for safety. Treasury yields rose on bets that more trade deals with other countries may mean the Federal Reserve wont need to cut interest rates as sharply as feared in order to prop up the economy.  Stocks and other financial markets have been swinging for weeks with hopes that President Donald Trump could reach such deals that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked. Trump on Thursday lauded what he called a maxed-out trade deal with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10% tariffs on U.K. products but would lower taxes on U.K. automobiles in exchange for greater access in the U.K. market for U.S. beef, ethanol and other products.  Trump said it may take weeks to finalize all the details in the U.K. deal, but he also gave potentially encouraging updates on talks pending with an even bigger trading partner, China.  
        
     The worlds second-largest economy is set to meet with high-level U.S. officials in Switzerland this weekend. China has been calling for the United States to cancel its tariffs, while Trump has said that he wouldnt reduce his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods as a condition for negotiations.  Asked on Thursday whether he would consider lowering tariffs on Chinese imports if this weekends talks go well, Trump said, It could be. Were going to see. Right now, you cant get any higher. Its at 145. So we know its coming down. He also said he expects the talks in Switzerland to be substantive. Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from U.S. companies have also helped to drive the S&P 500 closer to its all-time high set in February.

Axon Enterprise, the company that sells Tasers, body cameras and other public safety equipment, jumped 14.1% after joining the list.

It credited new, younger customers in North America, among other things. Molson Coors, though, described a different landscape when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts expectations. Its stock fell 4.5%.  The global macroeconomic environment is volatile, CEO Gavin Hattersley said. Uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade policy, including the impacts on economic growth, consumer confidence and expectations around inflation, and currencies has pressured the beer industry and consumption trends.  It became the latest company to either lower or pull its financial forecasts for 2025 given the uncertainty. Krispy Kreme tumbled 24.7% after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year. The doughnut seller said it made the move in part because of macroeconomic softness and because its pausing the rollout of sales of its doughnuts at more McDonalds restaurants.

But another said productivity for U.S. workers slowed by more than economists expected at the start of the year. That could keep upward pressure on inflation, when tariffs could be set to raise prices for all kinds of imported products.  Treasury yields rose following the reports, and the 10-year yield climbed to 4.38% from 4.26% late Wednesday.  The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for action by the Fed, leaped to 3.89% from 3.78%. Traders pared back expectations for how many times the Fed may cut interest rates later this year.  In stock markets abroad, the FTSE 100 slipped 0.3% in London after the Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.  Indexes rose across much of the rest of Europe and Asia. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/markets-interest-rates-federal-reserve-trump-tariffs-inflation-8ebf3f0d6c5bb0b0d90852cca08263ef,business
Democrats block stablecoin bill as they raise concerns about Trumps crypto ventures,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Senate Democrats have blocked legislation to regulate stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency, after arguing that the bill needed stronger protections and airing concerns that it could help President Donald Trump enrich himself. The bill, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had previously won some Democratic support. But it failed 49-48 on a procedural vote Thursday after Democrats said that they needed to see more changes to the legislation before they could back it.  Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans would work with Democrats if they allowed the bill to move forward, but they refused. All Democrats voted not to bring it up. The vote is a blow to one of Trumps top legislative priorities and a setback for the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last years election and has been emboldened to cement its influence in politics and the mainstream financial system. The legislation would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws. Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrencys notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset to make commercial transactions than other forms of crypto. While some Democrats agree that regulation is needed, and several voted to move the bill out of committee, Trumps involvement in the crypto industry has complicated the legislations path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And earlier this week, Trump promoted a dinner hes set to attend on May 22 thats open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins. 
        
     Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the worlds largest cryptocurrency exchange. Among other proposed changes, Democrats said that elected officials and their families should be barred from owning, controlling or promoting stablecoin business ventures. The Senate should not pass a bill that facilitates Trumps breathtaking corruption and lines his pockets and welcomes other elected officials to do the same, said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. A former skeptic turned zealous promotor, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previously enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industrys top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation. The legislation could still move forward if the two parties can come to a deal. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who has been helping negotiate the legislation, said in a statement after the vote that he would continue to work on it.  I remain fully committed to getting this right, Warner said. A group of nine Democrats, including Warner, said in a release over the weekend that they could not support the legislation until it included stronger provisions on money laundering, foreign issuers and accountability for those who violate it, among other concerns. They did not mention Trump.  We recognize that the absence of regulation leaves consumers unprotected and vulnerable to predatory practices, the Democrats said. Thune, the Republican leader, questioned Democrats motives, speculating that they just wanted to deny Trump a bipartisan win.  It makes you wonder if this is about the bill at all, he said of their opposition.  ___",https://apnews.com/article/senate-cryptocurrency-trump-bill-stablecoins-regulation-blocked-b38d40abff48b48902f8249eb4ef626b,business
Fishermen battling with changing oceans chart new course after Trumps push to deregulate,"STONINGTON, Maine (AP)  Virginia Olsen has pulled lobsters from Maines chilly Atlantic waters for decades while watching threats to the states lifeblood industry mount. Trade imbalances with Canada, tight regulations on fisheries and offshore wind farms towering like skyscrapers on open water pose three of those threats, said Olsen, part of the fifth generation in her family to make a living in the lobster trade.  Thats why she was encouraged last month when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that promises to restore American fisheries to their former glory. The order promises to shred fishing regulations, and Olsen said that will allow fishermen to do what they do best  fish.  That will make a huge difference in communities like her home of Stonington, the busiest lobster fishing port in the country, Olsen said. Its a tiny island town of winding streets, swooping gulls and mansard roof houses with an economy almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing, some three hours up the coast from Portland, Maines biggest city. Olsen knows firsthand how much has changed over the years. Hundreds of fish and shellfish populations globally have dwindled to dangerously low levels, alarming scientists and prompting the restrictions and catch limits that Trumps order could wash away with the stroke of a pen. But shes heartened that the livelihoods of people who work the traps and cast the nets have become a priority in faraway places where they often felt their voices werent heard. I do think its time to have the conversation on what regulations that the industry does need. Were fishing different than we did 100 years ago, she said. If everything is being looked at, we should be looking at the regulations within the fishing industry. But if fishing and lobstering interests finally have a seat at the table, the questions become how much seafood can be served there  and for how long. Trumps April 17 order, called Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness, promises an overhaul of the way America fishes, and cites a national seafood trade deficit of more than $20 billion as the reason to do it. The order calls on the federal government to reduce the regulatory burden on fishermen by later this month. It arrives at a time when conservation groups and many marine scientists say the ocean needs more regulation, not less. One oft-cited 2020 study led by a scientist at the University of British Columbia looked at more than 1,300 fish and invertebrate populations and found that 82% were below levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields. The university said the study discovered global declines, some severe, of many popularly consumed species. Trumps order prioritizes commerce over conservation. It also calls for the development of a comprehensive seafood trade strategy and a review of existing marine monuments, which are underwater protected zones, to see if any should be opened for fishing. At least one, the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, has already been reopened. Many commercial fishermen and fishing trade groups lauded the order. Members of the industry, one of the oldest in the country, have long made the case that heavy regulations  many intended to protect the health of fish populations  leave the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage to the fleets of countries that dont bear the same kind of burden. That disadvantage is a big piece of why America imports more than two-thirds of its seafood, they argue. The presidents executive order recognizes the challenges our fishing families and communities face, and we appreciate the commitment to reduce burdensome regulations and strengthen the competitiveness of American seafood, said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermens Association. Some fishermen, including Maine lobsterman Don McHenan, said theyre looking forward to members of the industry being able to fish in areas of the ocean that have been closed off to them for years. McHenan said hes also hopeful the pace of new regulations will slow. As long as they dont put any more onto us, McHenan said. Well see  time will tell. But the support for deregulation is not unanimous among fishermen. Some say strong conservation laws are critical to protecting species that fishermen rely on to make a living. In Alaska, for example, Matt Wiebe said the executive order terrifies him. A commercial fisherman with more than 50 years of experience fishing for salmon, he said the order could potentially harm the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery, which has received praise from sustainability organizations for careful management of the fish supply. Absent that management, he said the worlds largest sockeye salmon fishery could go the way of the New England cod fishing business, which collapsed due in large part to overfishing and has never recovered. Since New England fishers lost their cod fishery due to overfishing, many other fisheries came to respect and depend on conservation efforts, Wiebe said. We fish because its what we do, and conservation efforts mean we and our kids can fish into the future. The executive order arrived at a time when Americas commercial fishermen are coping with environmental challenges and the decline of some once-marketable species. Maines historic shrimp fishery shuttered more than a decade ago, Californias salmon industry is struggling through closures and the number of fish stocks on the federal overfished list has grown in recent years. There is also the looming question of what Trumps trade war with major seafood producers such as Canada and China will mean for the U.S. industry  not to mention American consumers. To many in Maines lobster and fishing business, the answer is clear: Cut regulations and let them do their thing. We definitely feel the industry is over-regulated as a whole, said Dustin Delano, a fourth-generation Maine lobsterman who is also chief operating officer of the New England Fishermens Stewardship Association. We hope that this will help for sure. It does seek to initiate that America-first strategy in the fishery. ___",https://apnews.com/article/trump-seafood-climate-change-fishing-regulations-abd37f0baaeaf6897a2926902eba10e6,business
Whats in the US-UK trade deal? A broad agreement with limited details,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The Trump administration announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom Thursday in grandiose terms, but with only limited details about what it will achieve.  The agreement will open up the British market to American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products, the White House said. It will also allow British cars and steel better access to U.S. consumers.  The pact provides some support for President Donald Trumps arguments that his steep tariffs could lead to agreements that open up overseas markets. But economists initial reactions were cool, with many noting that the United Kingdom isnt a large enough trading partner for the U.S. to really move the needle for the U.S. economy. Its more symbolic than economic, Beata Caranci, chief economist at the bank TD Economics, said in an email. What we have learned is that these initial announcements are going to be more fine-tuning around the edges and easing of pain points, rather than an end to the trade war.  Trump said in the Oval Office Thursday that additional details will be worked out in the coming weeks. But in a fact sheet the administration said the deal is historic and a great deal for America.  U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the deal would protect thousands of auto jobs and stressed the importance of the relationship between the two countries. The U.K. is the United States fourth largest export market, though has received just 4.5% of U.S. exports this year.  The United States will maintain the 10% duty on nearly all imports from the U.K., which Trump imposed April 2. Many economists had hoped that the tariff would be dropped as part of any trade deal, but Trump suggested that the 10% universal duty was likely to be a floor in any future talks with other countries.  The U.S. will cut its tariffs on car imports from the U.K. to 10% from 27.5%, according to the U.K. government, but only up to 100,000 cars. The U.K. exported 92,000 cars to the U.S. in 2024, which means the U.K. auto industry wont be able to boost its shipments without paying higher duties.  U.K. steel exports will enter the U.S. duty-free, rather than face the 25% tariff the White House has placed on imported steel.  The two countries have agreed to greater market access for each others beef, with both nations able to export 13,000 metric tons of beef to each others countries.  The U.K. will eliminate its tariff on ethanol from the U.S., up to 1.4 billion liters.  The U.S. will lift all duties on airplane engines and other aerospace parts from the U.K.'s Rolls Royce. In return, a U.K. airline will soon announce the purchase of $10 billion in planes from Boeing.  The U.K. will reduce its average tariff on U.S. goods to 1.8%, which would amount to a $200 million cut in duties, the British government said. The U.K. will also lower import taxes on about 2,500 U.S. products including olive oil, wine and sports equipment.  The U.K. will reduce or eliminate non-tariff barriers to U.S. exports, the White House said, though it did not provide details. The agreement creates opportunities for $5 billion in new exports of U.S. agricultural and other goods, according to the administrations fact sheet.  The agreement does not provide U.S. companies any additional access to the U.K.'s government-run national health service.  There also arent any changes on the U.K.'s digital services tax, which hits U.S. tech giants such as Amazon, Alphabets Google, and Facebook parent Meta. Trump has strongly criticized the tax. The U.K. government said, however, that the two nations have agreed to negotiate on a digital trade deal.  Trump said the deal did not exempt the U.K. from the 100% tariffs on foreign-made films he has proposed.  Negotiations are still ongoing in areas such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, critical minerals, copper and lumber, a British trade official said.",https://apnews.com/article/uk-trade-deal-us-trump-starmer-tariff-steel-f65fb13f17cfc14d0b5b8d267953d5c4,business
Melinda French Gates reflects on legacy of Gates Foundation as it announces it will close in 2045,"Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates. She petitioned heads of state and convened other billionaires. Along with Gates, she won the trust of one of Americas most admired investors, Warren Buffett, who has given more than $43 billion to the former couples foundation.  French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure.  At an ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, which also launched her new memoir, French Gates said she left, in part, to respond to the U.S. rollback of womens rights. I thought, I want to be much more nimble than this, and I want to be able to set the agenda by myself without having to ask anybody else, and do it with my partners, she said. French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press questions about the foundations 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 2045. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources. Ultimately, though, she wrote, the timeline was Bills decision to make with the board of trustees. The following responses have been edited for length. 
        
     A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundations work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account  and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.  A: I was excited for us to launch the Giving Pledge because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away  and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think its important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.  (As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary  if they were considered at all. Data wasnt collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.  There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women dont have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?  We opened a gender equality division, but not just that  we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.  A: When youre doing this kind of work, it doesnt take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people  especially women wouldnt use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didnt fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women  who account for half of all smallholder farmers  wouldnt buy it, because they didnt want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.  There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible  and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you. A: Its easy for people to forget  or maybe they didnt ever know  how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.  No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.  ____ The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and in statehouses from Melinda French Gates organization, Pivotal Ventures.  ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

US applications for jobless benefits fall last week despite elevated uncertainty over Trump tariffs,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trumps tariffs will impact the U.S. and global economies. Jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 to 228,000 for the week ending May 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. Thats in line with the 229,000 new applications analysts forecast. Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 decimated the economy and wiped out millions of jobs. Even though Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.  On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year. Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central banks dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.  Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.  There have been trade developments this week, with the U.S. and Britain expected to announce the framework for trade deal later Thursday. 
        
     No new deals have been reached with Americas largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Trump has left the highest tariffs in place on China, heightening tensions between the worlds two largest economies. Washington and Beijing are sending officials to Switzerland this weekend for an initial round of trade talks. Trump is attempting to reshape the global economy by dramatically increasing import taxes to rejuvenate the U.S. manufacturing sector. A contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trumps trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trumps massive tariffs went into effect. It was the first quarterly GDP decline in three years.  Like his pledge to institute tariffs, Trumps promise to drastically downsize the federal government workforce has occupied much of the early weeks of his presidency and is still in motion. Its not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency  or DOGE, spearheaded by Elon Musk  will surface in the weekly layoffs data. However, the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area. Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. Last week the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%, however, many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.  Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta. The Labor Department reported that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week gyrations, inched up by 1,000 to 227,000. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of April 26 fell to 1.88 million, a decrease of 29,000.",https://apnews.com/article/unemployment-benefits-jobless-claims-layoffs-labor-a95f2ba4f016b63a1c191ff080f29cf1,business
India and Pakistan dont fight wars like other countries. Heres why,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)  India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars since they gained independence from British India in 1947. Theyve also had dozens of skirmishes and conflicts, including one atop a glacier dubbed the coldest and highest-altitude battlefield in the world. The latest escalation follows a deadly gun attack on tourists that India blames Pakistan for  Islamabad denies any connection. But they dont fight wars like other countries. The dominant factor is their nuclear weapons arsenal, a distinct way of deterring major attacks and a guarantee that fighting doesnt get out of hand, even when the situation is spiraling. Heres how  and why  Pakistan fight the way they do: Pakistan and India have enough nuclear weapons to wipe the other side out several times over, says security analyst Syed Mohammed Ali, who is based in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. Their nuclear weapons create a scenario for mutually assured destruction. Both countries have deliberately developed the size and range of their stockpile to remind the other about the guarantee of mutually assured destruction, he adds. Neither country discloses their nuclear capabilities but each is thought to have between 170 and 180 warheads that are short-, long- and medium-range. Both countries have different delivery systems  ways of launching and propelling these weapons to their targets. The arsenals are a defensive move to prevent and deter further fighting, because neither side can afford to initiate such a war or hope to achieve anything from it, Ali says.

Youszai) Police officers stand guard at an entry point to Pindi Cricket Stadium following the crash of a suspected Indian drone in the parking area, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Thursday, May 8, 2025. (AP Photo/W.K. Youszai) It might not look this way to the outsider, but nuclear weapons are a reminder to the other side that they cant take things too far. But the secrecy around their arsenals means that its unclear if Pakistan or India can survive a first nuclear strike and retaliate, something called second-strike capability. This capacity stops an opponent from attempting to win a nuclear war through a first strike by preventing aggression that could lead to nuclear escalation.  Without this capability, there is, in theory, nothing to stop one side from launching a warhead at the other. India and Pakistan have each laid claim to Kashmir since 1947, when both gained independence, and border skirmishes have created instability in the region for decades. Each country controls a part of Kashmir, which is divided by a heavily militarized border. The two archrivals have also fought three wars over Kashmir, where armed insurgents resist Indian rule. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani governance or as an independent country.  Indian soldiers guard at a market in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan) Indian soldiers guard at a market in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan) Border flare-ups and militant attacks in India-controlled Kashmir have prompted New Delhi to take an increasingly tough position on Islamabad, accusing it of terrorism. In the latest conflict, India punished Pakistan by hitting what it said were sites used by Pakistan-backed militants linked to a gun massacre last month. India is one of the biggest defence spenders in the world, with $74.4 billion in 2025, according to the Military Balance report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Its also one of the worlds largest arms importers.  Pakistan is no slouch, spending $10 billion last year, but it can never match Indias deep pockets. India also has more than double the number of active armed forces personnel than Pakistan does.  While Indias armed forces are traditionally focused on Pakistan, it has another nuclear neighbor to contend with, China, and it is increasingly concerned with maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Those are two factors that Pakistan doesnt have to consider in its security paradigm.  Pakistans long and narrow shape, together with the outsized role of the military in foreign policy, makes it easier to move the armed forces around and prioritize defense. Neither Pakistan or India are in a hurry to announce their military moves against the other and, as seen in the current flare-up of hostilities, it can take a while for confirmation of strikes and retaliation to surface. But both launch operations into territories and airspace controlled by the other. Sometimes these are intended to damage checkpoints, installations, or sites allegedly used by militants.  They are also aimed at embarrassing or provoking  forcing leaders to bow to public pressure and respond, with the potential for miscalculation. Many of these activities originate along the Line of Control, which divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Its largely inaccessible to the media and public, making it hard to independently verify claims of an attack or retaliation. Such incidents raise international alarm, because both countries have nuclear capabilities, forcing attention back to India and Pakistan and, eventually, their competing claims over Kashmir.  The fear of nuclear war has put the two countries at the top of the agenda, competing with the papal conclave, U.S. President Donald Trumps policies, and the Sean Diddy Combs trial in the news cycle.

Strikes and retaliation are late at night or early in the morning and, with the exception of the drone attacks on Thursday, they mostly take place away from densely populated urban centers. It shows that neither country has the desire to significantly harm the others population. Attacks are either described as surgical or limited. Neither country is motivated by competition for resources. Pakistan has huge mineral wealth, but India isnt interested in these and, while there are stark ideological differences between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, they dont seek control or influence over the other.  Other than Kashmir, they have no interest in claiming the others territory or exercising dominance.",https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-india-military-explainer-0708bbf29ea81126aeae0d141f5a4026,business
The EU publishes a US product hit list and prepares for WTO action against Trumps tariffs,"BRUSSELS (AP)  The European Union published on Thursday a list of U.S. imports that it would target with retaliatory duties if no solution is found to end U.S. President Donald Trumps tariff war, which could include aircraft maker Boeing. The EUs executive branch, the European Commission, said it also would begin legal action at the World Trade Organization over the reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on countries around the world last month. The EU remains fully committed to finding negotiated outcomes with the U.S., commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. At the same time, we continue preparing for all possibilities. The commission manages trade deals and disputes on behalf of the 27 EU countries. In early April, Trump put a 20% levy on goods from the EU as part of his tariff onslaught against global trading partners. A week later, he paused them for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate solutions to U.S. trade concerns. A blanket 10% tariff still applies to EU imports. The commission drew up countermeasures to target 20.9 billion euros ($23.6 billion) of U.S. goods, roughly the equivalent of what Trump would be hitting in Europe. But it also put them on hold for 90 days to give negotiations a chance. The blocs top trade official has shuttled between Brussels and Washington trying to find a solution, but with little to show, the commission has made public a list of American imports for possible targeting worth 95 billion euros ($107 billion). 
        
     The list is broken down into sectors and broad categories of products rather than brand names. It contains 10.5 billion euros ($11.9 billion) worth of aircraft, 10.3 billion euros ($11.6 billion) in vehicle parts and 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in vehicles. European airlines are big Boeing customers: German airline Lufthansa has unfilled orders for 101 Boeing planes, and Irish airline Ryanair 184, for example. The American aerospace giant and Airbus, its European rival, dominate the global markets for commercial and military planes.  Boeing did not comment on the European Commissions announcement Thursday. CEO Kelly Ortberg told a U.S. Senate committee last month that 80% of Boeings commercial passenger planes go to airlines and other companies outside the U.S.  So its important that we continue to have access to that market and that we dont get in a situation where certain markets become closed to us, Ortberg said. Under the EUs proposed list, around 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in imports of U.S. wine, beer and spirits also could take a hit. European wine producershave been deeply concerned that Trumps tariffs would deal a severe blow to their sector, which relies on the U.S. as its top market. The commission gave interested companies and parties until June 10 to provide feedback, before it decides on the next steps. Boeing is very welcome to make comments on this list, a commission official said, briefing reporters on the list and the rationale for the EUs approach. Also Thursday, the commission approved 5 billion euros in insurance aid for French wine and spirits exports to the U.S. through July 8, after which the sweeping tariffs announced by Trump are scheduled to go into effect. The plan is mean to help protect French exporters from political risks during the next two months.  In parallel, the commission said that it would be taking legal action at world trades governing body, and would soon request consultations with the United States to try to resolve the issue, which must take place within two months. It said that this action would focus on Trumps universal reciprocal tariffs, and duties on cars and car parts. It is the unequivocal view of the EU that these tariffs blatantly violate fundamental WTO rules, a statement said. The commission estimates that 379 billion euros ($428 billion) of EU exports to the U.S. have been hit by new tariffs, including those on pause until mid-July, since Trump took office. It said they are already raising costs for business, stifling growth, fueling inflation and heightening economic uncertainty.",https://apnews.com/article/europe-trump-tariffs-wto-list-products-7ecab3aad84cb108c96cc6b242fcedc8,business
The construction of a road in Brazil draws criticism before first-ever climate talks in the Amazon,"BELEM, Brazil (AP)  In the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference, set to take place in Brazils Amazon in November, the construction of a road is drawing attention, with critics arguing it will lead to environmental degradation. Before the talks, called COP30, the state government of Para is building a 13-kilometer (8-mile) avenue designed to ease traffic on a major highway that runs parallel. The road was planned long before Belem, a metropolitan area of 2.5 million people that sits on the edge of the Amazon, was chosen as conference host. That hasnt spared it sharp criticism, however, because the road is expected to cut across the last remnants of rainforest in Belem.  Road building in the Amazon, which historically has often led to deforestation and development of surrounding areas, also stands in stark contrast to a central aim of climate conferences, and in particular this one: conservation of biodiversity.  Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who has made the slowing of deforestation a central focus of his administration, has frequently boasted that this will be the first such conference in the Amazon rainforest.

(AP Photo/Jorge Saenz, File) The Amazon is key to regulating the climate, because trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that heats the planet when released into the atmosphere.  We will hold the best COP in history because the topic of all the ones held in other countries was the Amazon, Lula said while visiting Belem worksites in February. This one will be in the Amazon. 
        
     An official project map shows a straight line dividing a green area through the citys outskirts. This protected area is slightly larger than Manhattan. It was designated in 1993 to protect two lakes, a river basin and to restore a degraded rainforest. However, its rules allow private properties, government-approved deforestation and public works. Two university campuses are located within its limits. Even with measures to reduce the damage, there are tough issues to address, said Roberta Rodrigues, a professor of architecture at the Federal University of Para. Its hard to imagine a road being built along the banks of the Guama River without it leading to illegal development. It may lead to the end of this protected area. The project dates back to 2020. Construction began in mid-2024, despite criticism over its impact on one of the citys few remaining green areas. The project drew wider attention in March, when the BBC reported that the avenue was being built for COP30. As the story was picked up by news outlets around the world, Brazils government issued a statement saying the avenue wasnt among the 33 infrastructure projects planned for COP30.  In a statement to The Associated Press, the state government of Para said that the avenue, named Liberdade, or Freedom, will be an expressway and development around it wont be permitted.

(AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) The chaotic growth of Brazilian cities, however, suggests its a promise that will be hard to keep. Countless public areas have been occupied for the irregular construction of housing  from modest structures to luxury condos  with the expectation that they will eventually be legalized, which often ends up happening. Belem is the capital of Para, which is run by Gov. Helder Barbalho, a politician from a traditional family who is an ally of Lula. Both support oil drilling in the nearby mouth of the Amazon River, likely a point of contention during COP30. The road is scheduled to be inaugurated just before the conference kicking off on Nov. 10.  ___ The Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Turkey and Iraq reaffirm commitment to work against Kurdish militants and other security threats,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP)  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening security cooperation on Thursday, vowing to work against threats, including Kurdish militants based on Iraqi territory. Al-Sudani arrived in Turkey as the neighboring countries are working to enhance cooperation and mend past tensions.  Relations between Turkey and Iraq were often strained over Turkish military incursions into northern Iraq for operations against the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, and the establishment of Turkish military bases there. Baghdad frequently condemned the incursions as a violation of its sovereignty, while Ankara accused Iraq of not doing enough to fight the PKK.  More recently, however, the two countries have deepened cooperation on security, including addressing the PKK presence in northern Iraq. Last year, Iraq announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization. Erdogan said the two reaffirmed our determination to fight against the Kurdish militants, the Islamic State group and against members of network that Turkey accuses of being behind a failed military coup in 2016.  We once again emphasized that terrorism has no place in the future of our region, Erdogan said.  
        
     Al-Sudani said: What affects Iraqs security affects Turkeys security and vice versa. According to our constitution, we do not allow any group to use Iraqi territory to attack neighboring countries, he said. On Thursday, officials inked 11 agreements, including in trade and defense, to advance cooperation between the two countries.  Erdogan stressed the urgency of resuming oil shipments through an Iraqi-Turkish pipeline. The oil pipeline running from the semi-autonomous Kurdish region to Turkey has been shut down since March 2023, after an arbitration court ruling ordered Ankara to pay Iraq $1.5 billion for oil exports that bypassed Iraqs central government in Baghdad. The sharing of oil and gas revenues has long been a contentious issue between Baghdad and Kurdish authorities in Irbil. Al-Sudani said water supplies to Iraq were also discussed. He said committees were continuing meetings to agree on mechanisms for water management projects.  We emphasized the need for a fair understanding that respects the interests of both sides, in accordance with principles of equity and good neighborliness, the Iraqi prime minister said. In recent years, Iraqi officials have complained that dams built by Turkey are reducing Iraqs water supply. The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which provide most of Iraqs fresh water, originate in Turkey. Experts fear that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing water shortages in Iraq. Our position is that water levels in the dams are at a minimum, and at the same time, Iraq has received very little rainfall this year, al-Sudani said.  The two also discussed steps to rapidly implement The Development Road Project - a large-scale infrastructure plan to connect the Persian Gulf with Turkey by constructing highways and rail links from southern Iraq to the Turkish border. The Iraqi prime ministers visit comes after the PKKs jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, called on his group to dissolve and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey. The group declared a unilateral ceasefire in March and is now expected to hold a congress in northern Iraq, during which it would announce its dissolution, Turkish officials have said. The PKK, which has maintained bases in northern Iraqs semiautonomous Kurdish region, has fought Turkey for an autonomous Kurdish state. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s. Turkey and its Western allies have designated the PKK a terrorist organization. Al-Sudani said: We welcome the political process and the disarmament path concerning the PKK. __ Abdul-Zahra reported from Baghdad.",https://apnews.com/article/turkey-iraq-prime-minister-visit-kurdish-militants-6ebdab07362d4402c6ec4d01c79c192b,business
Scrappy opera company Heartbeat thrives by reimagining the classics,"NEW YORK (AP)  Dan Schlosberg remembers the day 11 years ago when his upstart opera company put on its first performance  in a yoga studio before an audience of 30 people. We did Kurt Weills The Seven Deadly Sins accompanied by an upright piano that we got for free on Craigslist and a violin, recalled Schlosberg, the companys music director and one of its founders. They named their company Heartbeat Opera, from the idea that singers would be feet away from you, Schlosberg said. And so you would be experiencing their voices at arms length and that would make a resonance in your heart. Today, in an era when many opera companies are struggling financially, Heartbeat appears to be thriving, with an annual budget that just passed $1 million. But true to its initial vision, the company still performs in small venues, most with a seating capacity of about 200. Very few small companies take up the ambition to do the fullness of opera on a small scale, said Jacob Ashworth, another founding member and Heartbeats artistic director. We dont do small opera. We do big opera in a small space. And despite its success with critics and audiences  performances regularly sell out  the company has deliberately maintained a modest schedule. Theres typically an opera-themed drag show around Halloween and then two operas staged in New York City performance spaces in the winter and spring. Each work is condensed to 90-100 intermission-less minutes with new orchestrations that require just a few musicians. 
        
     Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, thinks Heartbeat is smart not to expand too quickly  a mistake that has caused some small companies to collapse. Growth itself shouldnt be a goal. Excellence should be a goal, he said. I always prefer companies to plan their trajectory as slow as possible so they dont overstretch and overstep. Unlike some small companies, Heartbeat doesnt focus on new work or on bringing to light neglected old rarities. Instead, its website promises incisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now. Its that reimagining that attracted Sara Holdren, a director, writer and teacher who first worked with the company on Bizets Carmen in 2017. Their approaches to the storytelling feel extremely of our world and about our world, she said, without falling across that line into a sort of trite topicality where you say, Oh yes, I understand a relevant-with-a-capital-R political point is being made here. For Beethovens Fidelio, Heartbeat went to prisons and recorded the voices of incarcerated people, who appeared on video singing the Prisoners Chorus. For Tchaikovskys Eugene Onegin, the two main male characters became lovers, reflecting the composers own sexuality. And for Richard Strauss Salome this season, the teenage title character was dressed in a frilly pink skirt and sneakers; John the Baptist was imprisoned on stage in a cage with transparent sides instead of in an underground cistern; and during the Dance of the Seven Veils, it was a lascivious Herod who stripped off his clothes, not Salome. Heartbeats casting for Salome reflected the premium it places on theatrical values in addition to vocal ability. Baritone Nathaniel Sullivan, who portrayed John the Baptist, recalled that a big part of the audition was just straight acting. And in the rehearsals, there was a real focus on the storytelling. I havent experienced that in a lot of other opera companies to that extent, he said. Soprano Summer Hassan, who was cast as Salome, admits she was nervous at first because I had never done a role like this where I am the title character. I was really doubting myself, thinking how do I make this girl look so young? she said. And they said, your physicality will do that on your own. Make her look confident and you will make her look like a confident child. They gave me the tools to figure out it was within me. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this Salome was the re-orchestration by Schlosberg. Instead of more than 100 players as called for in the original, he took a cue from the opening notes on a clarinet and scored the piece for eight clarinetists (who also played other instruments) and two percussionists. Heartbeats final local offering of the season will be Gounods Faust, to run at the Baruch Performing Arts Center from May 13-25. I had mentioned to Jacob that I really love devil stories, said Holdren, who is directing the production. And I was fascinated with the idea of taking something so big and so weighed down with history and assumptions and seeing how much we could crack it open and blow the dust off. She sees Mephistopheles less as a mustache-twirling villain and more as a figure of hunger and loneliness slipping into the vacuums that human beings create when they are so desperate or disgusted with life that theres an opening for him. Her production will be set in contemporary times, sung in French but with new English-language dialogue, and it will make heavy use of shadow puppetry. Its the first Heartbeat offering for which Schlosberg has not done the re-orchestration. That task fell to Francisco Ladrn de Guevara, a Mexican violinist and composer who has scored the opera for seven musicians, most of whom play two instruments, including Ashworth, who will play violin and mandolin and also conduct. Schlosberg will be back doing the arranging for a rare Heartbeat foray outside the city this summer. The company has been invited to stage a revised version of Samuel Barbers Vanessa at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts. Im really excited by what theyve been doing, particularly in reimagining the classics for contemporary times, said Raphael Picciarelli, co-managing director of the festival. For Heartbeats debut in Williamstown, the festival is setting up a new performance space that should make the company feel right at home. Its in an abandoned grocery store, and there will be seats for just over 200 people.",https://apnews.com/article/opera-heartbeat-small-performances-26194cba45dec032050456301c13c73b,business
"Average rate on a US 30-year mortgage holds steady at 6.76%, not far from highest levels this year","The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. held steady this week, not far from its highest levels this year, but below where it was a year ago.  The rate stood at 6.76% for the second week in a row, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 7.09%. Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, eased. The average rate dropped to 5.89% from 5.92% last week. Its down from 6.38% a year ago, Freddie Mac said. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserves interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors expectations about the economy and inflation. After climbing to a just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained above 6.62%, where it was just four weeks ago. It then spiked above 6.8% in the following two weeks and eased last week to 6.76%.  The recent swings in mortgage rates reflect volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield, which had mostly fallen after climbing to around 4.8% in mid-January, surged last month to 4.5% amid a sell-off in government bonds triggered by investor anxiety over the Trump administrations trade war.  The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.33% in midday trading Thursday, up from 4.26% late Wednesday. 
        
     Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices remain affordability hurdles for many would-be homebuyers, key reasons why the spring homebuying season is off to a lackluster start, even as the inventory of homes on the market is up sharply from last year. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in March, posting the largest monthly drop since November 2022.  The median monthly housing payment was $2,868 in the four weeks ended May 4, an all-time high, according to a new report from Redfin. Economists expect mortgage rates to remain volatile in coming months, though they generally call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6.5% this year. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left its main interest alone, as was widely expected, even as it noted an increased risk of higher unemployment and inflation. While the Fed doesnt set rates on home loans, its actions can influence the trajectory of mortgage rates. Looking ahead, the Feds wait-and-see approach is likely to keep mortgage rates at a high-6% in the near term, unless major policy developments or economic shifts occur, such as notable outcomes from the upcoming U.S.-China trade talks scheduled for this weekend, said Jiayi Xu, economist at Realtor.com.",https://apnews.com/article/mortgage-rates-housing-interest-financing-home-93b63e9f039dc387b0a8d3f830959d1b,business
Trumps tariffs have launched global trade wars. Heres a timeline of how we got here,"NEW YORK (AP)   Long-threatened tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into trade wars abroad  all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty. Trump is no stranger to tariffs. He launched a trade war during his first term, taking particular aim at China by putting taxes on most of its goods. Beijing responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. products. Meanwhile, Trump also used the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020. When President Joe Biden took office, he preserved most of the tariffs Trump previously enacted against China, in addition to imposing some new restrictions. But his administration claimed to take a more targeted approach. Fast-forward to today, and economists stress there could be greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide under Trumps more sweeping tariffs this time around  and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill. Theres also been a sense of whiplash from Trumps back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation seen over the last few months. Heres a timeline of how we got here: Trump is sworn into office. In his inaugural address, he again promises to tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. And he reiterates plans to create an agency called the External Revenue Service, which has yet to be established. On his first day in office, Trump also says he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1, while declining to immediately flesh out plans for taxing Chinese imports. 
        
     Trump threatens 25% tariffs on all Colombia imports and other retaliatory measures after President Gustavo Petros rejects two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants to the country, accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation.  In response, Petro also announces a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. But Colombia later reversed its decision and accepted the flights carrying migrants. The two countries soon signaled a halt in the trade dispute. Trump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China  10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency  ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking. The action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures. Trump agrees to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, as both trading partners take steps to appease Trumps concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trumps new 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S. still go into effect. China retaliates the same day by announcing a flurry of countermeasures, including new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google. Chinas 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% levy on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S., take effect Feb. 10. Trump announces plans to hike steel and aluminum tariffs starting March 12. He removes the exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, and also raises his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%. Trump announces a plan for reciprocal tariffs  promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that countries worldwide charge on imports for purposes of fairness. Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses. Trump signs an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the materials use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies. Trump signs an additional executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether tariffs on lumber and timber are also needed to protect national security, arguing that the construction industry and military depend on a strong supply of wooden products in the U.S. Trumps 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect, though he limits the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. He also doubles the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%.  All three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate. China, meanwhile, imposes tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of key U.S. farm exports, set to take effect March 10. It also expands the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. Trump grants a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The pause arrives after the president spoke with leaders of the Big 3 automakers  Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. In a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month. Trump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs. His actions also thaw relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government says its suspended a second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion). Chinas retaliatory 15% tariffs on key American farm products  including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef  take effect. Goods already in transit are set to be exempt through April 12, per Chinas Commerce Ministry previous announcement. Trumps new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports go into effect. Both metals are now taxed at 25% across the board  with Trumps order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminums levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes. The European Union takes retaliatory trade action promising new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during Trumps first term. The 27-member bloc later says it will delay this retaliatory action until mid-April. Canada, meanwhile, announces plans to impose more retaliatory tariffs worth Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) on U.S. imports, set to go into effect March 13. Trump threatens a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with its previously-announced plans for a 50% tariff on American whiskey. Trump says he will place a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, in addition to imposing new tariffs on the South American country itself, starting April 2.  The tariffs would most likely add to the taxes facing China, which in 2023 bought 68% of the oil exported by Venezuela, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a number of countries also receive oil from Venezuela  including the United States itself. Trump says he is placing 25% tariffs on auto imports. These auto imports will start being collected April 3  beginning with taxes on fully-imported cars. The tariffs are set to then expand to applicable auto parts in the following weeks, through May 3. Trump announces his long-promised reciprocal tariffs  declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports across the board starting April 5, as well as higher rates for dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the U.S. to take effect April 9. Among those steeper levies, Trump says the U.S. will now charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, 25% on South Korea, 24% on Japan and 32% on Taiwan. The new tariffs come on top of previously-imposed levies, including the 20% tax Trump announced on all Chinese imports earlier this year.  Meanwhile, for Canada and Mexico, the White House says USMCA-compliant imports can continue to enter the U.S. duty-free. Once the two countries have satisfied Trumps demands on immigration and drug trafficking, the White House adds, the tariff on the rest of their imports may drop from 25% to 12%. Trumps previously-announced auto tariffs begin. Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will match the 25% levies with a tariff on vehicles imported from the U.S. China announces plans to impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10, matching Trumps new reciprocal tariff on Chinese goods, as part of a flurry of retaliatory measures. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing says it will also impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products like computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. And the government adds 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls. Trumps 10% minimum tariff on nearly all countries and territories takes effect. Trumps higher reciprocal rates go into effect, hiking taxes on imports from dozens of countries just after midnight. But hours later, his administration says it will suspend most of these higher rates for 90 days, while maintaining the recently-imposed 10% levy on nearly all global imports. China is the exception. After following through on a threat to raise levies against China to a total of 104%, Trump says he will now raise those import taxes to 125% effective immediately  escalating tit-for-tat duties that have piled up between the two countries. The White House later clarifies that total tariffs against China are actually now 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs are accounted for. China upped its retaliation prior to this announcement  vowing to tax American goods at 84% starting April 10. Also earlier, EU member states vote to approve their own retaliatory levies on 20.9 billion euros ($23 billion) of U.S. goods in response to Trumps previously-imposed steel and aluminum tariffs. The EUs executive commission doesnt immediately specify which imports it will tax, but notes its counter tariffs will come in stages  with some set to arrive on April 15, and others May 15 and Dec. 1.  Separately, Canadas counter tariffs on auto imports take effect. The country implements a 25% levy on auto imports from the U.S. that do not comply with the 2020 USMCA pact. The EU puts its steel and aluminum tariff retaliation on hold for 90 days, to match Trumps pause on steeper reciprocal levies. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the commission wants to give negotiations with the U.S. a chance  but warns countermeasures will kick in if talks are not satisfactory. China says it will raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, in response to Trumps heightened levies. The new rate is set to begin April 12. Later, the Trump administration unveils that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, will be exempt from so-called reciprocal tariffs. But in the days following, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signals that this is only a temporary reprieve, saying that sector-specific levies on semiconductors will arrive in probably a month or two. And other, non-""reciprocal tariffs that tax some electronics, notably from China, remain. Trump says he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains. The Trump administration also launches investigations into imports of computer chips, chipmaking equipment and pharmaceuticals  signaling next steps toward imposing tariffs on these sectors. The U.S. Commerce Department posts notices about these probes, seeking public comment within the next three weeks. Separately, the Commerce Department says its withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into fresh tomato imports from Mexico. That termination, set to take effect July 14, means most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff. Trump signs executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts  aimed at easing import taxes for vehicles that are made with foreign parts, but assembled in the U.S.  For one year, the administration says it will provide a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales prices of a domestically-assembled car  a figure reached by putting the previously-imposed 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of that price. And for the second year, the rebate would equal 2.5% of the sales price, applying to a smaller share of the vehicles parts. The latest round of Trumps auto tariffs takes effect. The previously-announced 25% levies now apply to a range of imported auto parts. Trump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, while claiming that the movie industry in the U.S. is dying. It isnt immediately clear how such a tariff on international productions could be implemented, but Trump says hes authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to immediately begin the process. The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses tried to get ahead of Trumpstariffs. Federal data showed an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products. The deficit  which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys  has roughly doubled during the past year. Also, the U.S. government announced that top officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation over the weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Trump sparked a trade war. No country has been hit harder by Trumps trade war than China, the worlds biggest exporter and second largest economy. U.S. tariffs against China are set at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%.  The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged at 4.3%, saying that the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen due to uncertainty about how and when Trumps tariffs might impact the U.S. economy. Chair Jerome Powell underscored that the tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment and that theres currently too many unknowns to be able to predict how the Fed might adjust its monetary policy going forward. The United States and Britain announced a trade deal, potentially lowering the financial burden from tariffs while creating greater access abroad for American goods. The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., which would also streamline the processing of U.S. goods though customs. Trump said final details were being written up. In the coming weeks, well have it all very conclusive, Trump said. Britain said the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10%, with a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. It also eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. Separately, the European Union published a list of U.S. imports that it would target with retaliatory duties if no solution is found to end U.S. President Donald Trumps tariff war. The EUs executive branch, the European Commission, also said it would begin legal action at the World Trade Organization over the reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on countries around the world a month ago.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariff-england-trade-war-e8300b457256d4c23d64928c09ce2b63,business
White House overhaul of troubled US air traffic control system will cost lots of billions,"The Trump administration on Thursday proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of a U.S. air traffic control system that it said still relies on floppy disks and replacement parts found on eBay and has come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of recent deadly plane crashes  and technical failures.  The plan calls for six new air traffic control centers, along with an array of technology and communications upgrades at all of the nations air traffic facilities over the next three or four years, said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.  We use radar from the 1970s, said Duffy, who compared the proposal with upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) How much it will all cost wasnt immediately revealed. Duffy said hell work with Congress on the details. Its going to be billions, lots of billions, he said.  The plan has an aggressive timeline, calling on everything to be finished by 2028  although Duffy said it may take another year. Demands to fix the aging system that handles more than 45,000 daily flights have increased since the midair collision in January between an Army helicopter and a commercial airliner that killed 67 people over Washington, D.C. That crash  and a string of other crashes and mishaps  showed the immediate need for these upgrades, Duffy said in front of airline officials, union leaders and family members of those who died in the crash near Reagan National Airport.  
        
     The proposal sets out to add fiber, wireless or satellite technology at more than 4,600 locations, replace 618 radars and more than quadruple the number of airports with systems designed to reduce near misses on runways. Six new air traffic control centers also would be built under the plan, and new hardware and software would be standardized across all air traffic facilities.  The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week budgeted $12.5 billion to overhaul the system, but that estimate came out before the Transportation Department revealed its plan. Duffy said the final price tag will be higher. U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, who heads the House transportation committee, called the amount only a down payment.  To build the system quickly, as planned, Duffy said Congress must give the Federal Aviation Administration all the money up front and streamline the permitting process.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The system we have here? Its not worth saving. I dont need to preserve any of this. Its too old, Duffy said.  Trump said Thursday that the plan will revolutionize flying. The new equipment is unbelievable what it does, he said from the Oval Office. He began to say it may even alleviate the need for pilots before adding, In my opinion, you always need pilots. But you wouldnt even have to have pilots. The newly revealed proposal appears to have wide support across the aviation industry  from airline CEOs to the unions representing controllers and pilots  but this is just the beginning and many details havent been revealed. Duffy quickly said the plan will not involve privatizing the air traffic control system, as Trump had supported in his first term. Following the midair crash near Washington, Trump promised to fix what he called an old, broken system and to tackle the nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers while blaming the previous Biden administration for both problems.  But the weaknesses within the air traffic control system have been highlighted for years in hearings before Congress and government reports. The struggles to keep up with increasing air traffic has been recognized since the 1990s  long before either Trump or Biden took office. The Trump administrations overhaul plan will need enough funding to be more effective than previous reform efforts during the last three decades. Already more than $14 billion has been invested in upgrades since 2003 but none have dramatically changed how the system works.  The FAA has been working since the mid-2000s to make upgrades through its NextGen program.  One of the biggest challenges with a massive upgrade is that the FAA must keep the current system operating while developing a new system and then find a way to seamlessly switch over. Thats partly why the agency has pursued more gradual improvements in the past. The shortage of controllers and technical breakdowns came to the forefront in the last two weeks when a radar system briefly failed at the Newark, New Jersey, airport, leading to a wave of flight cancellations and delays. Without the planned upgrades, those breakdowns will be repeated around the nation, Duffy said. Newark has been a prime example of what happens when this old equipment goes down, he said. ___ Associated Press reporter Will Weissert in Washington contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/air-traffic-control-plane-crashes-trump-duffy-8e334139510f395c8ee093e134aae5fe,business
Ontario begins construction of 1st small reactor as it aims to lead in new nuclear technology,"Ontario has begun building the first of four new, small nuclear reactors, as Canada seeks to lead the Group of Seven industrialized nations in developing next-generation nuclear technology. Ontario Energy Minister Stephen Lecce announced Thursday at the site that the government approved Ontario Power Generations plan to begin construction. Behind Lecce, workers were already excavating the land for the first reactor and grading the site for the others. We are protecting Ontario by building the most resilient energy future any country has ever seen, Lecce said. We are taking our true place as a global clean energy superpower and a leader in nuclear innovation and technology. A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Canadas first commercial small modular reactor should be connected to the electrical grid by the end of 2030, Lecce said, putting them ahead of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the U.S., Bill Gates energy company is preparing a site in Wyoming for a next-generation nuclear power plant while the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews its application for a construction permit. Kairos Power is building a low-power demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Russia and China are the only countries that are already operating advanced reactors. Electricity demand in Ontario is expected to soar by 75% by 2050, primarily due to demand from industry and large data centers. Ontario Power Generation picked a boiling water reactor design from GE Vernova for the Darlington New Nuclear Project in Clarington, Ontario. When constructed, each reactor will provide enough electricity to power 300,000 Toronto homes, at 10% the size and complexity of a traditional boiling water reactor, according to GE Vernova. The first will cost $6.1 billion, along with $1.6 billion in costs for systems and services common to all four, Lecce said. The cost is expected to decline with each subsequent reactor. 
        
     Canada has historically been a net exporter of electricity, sending significant amounts of hydropower to the United States. In the fall of 2023, the electricity trade between the two countries became more balanced because of drought conditions that reduced the amount of hydropower available and lower natural gas prices in the United States that made U.S. electricity more competitive, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Now with a trade war and U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly saying that Canada should be the 51st U.S. state, Canadians are feeling like the alliance is broken. Ontarios Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy alluded to that at Thursdays nuclear announcement, saying their traditional relationship with the United States isnt going to be the same and Canada needs new, clean energy. The world economy is changing, he said, and its important that Canada be self-reliant. ___ The Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

California promised to boost mental health in schools. Why one key program is behind schedule,"California made a huge one-time investment in youth mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic as rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders surged among children and teens. One piece of the states plan included a way to keep money flowing for schools that wanted to expand mental health services for students.  It involved allowing K-12 schools and colleges to charge Medi-Cal and private health insurance for behavioral health care provided on campus, a change that would allow them to provide more services and hire additional mental health staff.  But that effort  among the first of its kind in the country  is off to a slow start, delaying dollars and resources for schools to help students with mental health challenges. Only 14 school districts and county offices of education have begun billing for behavioral health services under the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Fee Schedule Program, according to state health officials. Forty six school districts and county offices of education started the implementation process in January 2024 and were supposed to start billing last July. A total of 494 school districts, county offices of education and colleges have signed up to participate in the new billing program.  Some school officials are frustrated over program delays. They say the state was slow to release guidance and necessary training to submit claims for mental health services provided. Officials at schools that hired mental health staff say they may soon have to lay off recent hires because payments for services provided are not coming in as expected. This means students could lose newly gained access to services. There are so many unknowns and the timelines just keep getting pushed, said Trina Frazier, assistant superintendent of student services at the Fresno County Office of Education. And thats really sad because it has so much potential. 
        
     The California Department of Health Care Services, which is overseeing implementation of the program, told CalMatters in an email that while the target was to begin billing in mid-2024, the scale and complexity of implementation required adjustments to provide additional flexibilities to schools. Major reforms of this kind require time, coordination, and phased implementation, the department said in its email. The department said it continues to work with schools to address any outstanding challenges. Its new goal is for that first group of 46 districts and education offices to start billing by the end of the current school year. California and the nation have seen a surge in mental health disorders among students. For example, about 284,000 California children and teens deal with major depression, and two-thirds of them do not receive treatment, according to state estimates.  Despite the slow start for the new school billing program, other mental health efforts are underway through other components of the states $4.7 billion Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative that launched in 2021. That money has paid for mental health apps, education campaigns, and mental health workforce training programs, among a number of other efforts. About $400 million of that money was allotted in the form of one-time grants to education institutions to hire providers and prepare for this new billing program.  In response to delays in the billing program, a group of lawmakers recently sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a letter requesting bridge funding that they say would allow schools to keep building mental health services while the program comes up to speed. The letter does not specify a dollar amount. For the last 30 years and through a separate program, California schools have been able to get reimbursed by Medi-Cal, the states Medicaid program for low-income residents, for certain physical and mental health services. But theres long been a gap for children with private insurance. This new billing program is supposed to address that, as well as allow schools to expand the types of mental health services they can provide and charge for. Mental health experts regard school as an ideal setting for children to receive help. Its where they spend most of their weekdays and generally feel safe. Its also a logistics problem solver because schools resolve some potential barriers to care, like transportation to appointments, said Sarah Broome, a school Medicaid consultant. Also, teachers and staff see children every day and can notice when things are off.  Broome said that the challenges that the state and schools are facing in rolling out this new fee schedule program are somewhat predictable, partly because what California is doing is new. So its not even like you can call your peer states and be like, Hey, how did you guys figure out how to do this? You are creating a lot of this as you go. So theres absolutely real pain there. State legislators are hearing from frustrated local officials about the billing delays. The Fresno County Office of Education filed its first claim for reimbursement on Feb. 28, but as of last week continued to face challenges, according to Frazier.  Frazier told lawmakers in a hearing last week that the program rollout feels like building the plane while flying it. In Santa Clara County, the local office of education established 25 wellness centers across its schools and hired 50 new mental health workers, including clinicians and wellness coaches. But the delays prompted the office to notify its new staff about possible layoffs, Amanda Dickey, executive director of government relations for the Santa Clara County Office of Education, told lawmakers during the hearing. Because we didnt receive reimbursement for a single claim until 15 months after (starting program implementation)  as of March we were forced to pink slip 27 of our staff. So 27 of the approximately 50 that we hired, she said. Dickey told legislators that the state and the third party administrator contracted to process claims, Carelon Behavioral Health, did not give schools access to or training for the billing software used to file claims until late last year. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Office of Education told CalMatters that one of the challenges has been collecting students health insurance information  a new task for schools, and one that requires parents and caregivers to cooperate in sharing information about their health plan. (Mental health care provided at schools under this program should not result in any out-of-pocket costs for families, according to the state.)  Tanya Ward, a project director at the Los Angeles County Office of Education, said her office has yet to file mental health claims under this new program, but expects to do so later this month. The California Department of Health Care Services attributes the delays to a learning curve for both the state and schools.  According to the department, a number of factors contributed to the delays, including the fact that some schools requested edits to the contractual documents to participate in the program and that others expressed confusion about the process and needed additional support. The department said that districts are allowed to submit claims retroactively for dates of service back to July 1, 2024, as long as those claims are submitted by June 30. The 14 districts and education offices that are now able to file claims are starting to do so in larger numbers, Autumn Boylan, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships at the state health department, told lawmakers in last weeks hearing.  This is a significant change for the entire system, and changes of this magnitude take time, Boylan told lawmakers.  There is still work to be done, but I do think we are making progress, she said.  Testifying next to each other at last weeks hearing, Boylan and Frazier from Fresno couldnt agree on how much in claims had actually been paid out to the Fresno County Office of Education. Of the first 40 claims that had been processed for Fresno, 21 were denied, Frazier said. Boylan said that some claims are being denied because they are incomplete or not properly filed. Lawmakers questioned whether schools are filing claims incorrectly because they have not been adequately taught how to do so. This is brand new for schools, Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, said during the hearing. It is imperative on us, as government, to lead them in the right path if we want them to take on something thats completely out of their scope. ___ This story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",https://apnews.com/us-news/mental-health-california-gavin-newsom-school-curricula-health-care-costs-047a4f14fe132374436fcfbe11f4dfc6,business

Founder of crypto platform Celsius Network is sentenced to 12 years in prison,"NEW YORK (AP)  The founder and former CEO of the cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network was sentenced Thursday to 12 years in prison after a prosecutor labeled him a predator who preyed on hope by enticing vulnerable customers to risk their life savings for a supposedly safe investment. Alexander Mashinsky, 59, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, who said a substantial term in prison was necessary for someone who engaged in extremely serious crimes that enabled him to pocket over $45 million while some of his customers lost everything and suffered severe psychological harm. Celsius declared bankruptcy in 2022, exposing risky financial bets Mashinsky had made with some of the $20 billion that thousands of customers poured into the company. He had promised that their money would be safe and secure at Celsius, which pitched itself as a modern-day bank where crypto assets could earn interest. The defense blamed the collapse of Celsius on a cataclysmic downturn of cryptocurrency markets in May and June of 2022 and said in court papers that Mashinskys actions were never predatory, exploitative or venal. He never acted with the intent to hurt anyone. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Allison Nichols cast him as a financial predator, telling the judge Thursday that Mashinsky had deceived customers from the start by exaggerating Celsius ability to build momentum. 
        
     He preyed on hope, she said. Mashinsky knew exactly what he was doing  selling these people hope. She said the customers were not going to be made financially whole regardless of money that can be recovered through bankruptcy proceedings. Before he was sentenced, Mashinsky sobbed several times as he apologized to customers and referenced his difficult past as his family was able to leave a small Ukrainian town in the former Soviet Union with help from the United States when he was 7. The family moved to Israel, where Mashinsky served three years in the Israeli Defense Forces as a fighter pilot before coming to America. Mashinsky said he never meant to hurt anybody here after all this country has done for me. Im truly sorry, he said, describing himself as someone who came from nothing. When he pleaded guilty in December, Mashinsky admitted to misleading customers between 2018 and 2022 by promising their investments were safe even as he fabricated Celsius profitability and put customers funds at the mercy of uncollateralized loans and undisclosed risky market bets. His attorney, Marc Mukasey, said victim impact statements submitted to the court were rather brutal toward his client. We hear the intensity of their pain, he said. Our sympathies are with everyone. Several victims spoke at the sentencing hearing. Cameron Crewes, who serves on a victims committee, called for a harsh sentence, saying nearly 250 victims died before they could see justice served or get adequately compensated for losses. Many people have been wiped out, he said. In a statement, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Mashinsky made tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions. He added: Americas investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong, but it is not a license to deceive. The rules against fraud still apply.",https://apnews.com/article/cryptocurrency-celsius-mashinsky-sentencing-81bdbb8b0b445f1c4077b5eda7a4cc9e,business
Federal officials set timeline for Helene aid to farmers as Georgia enacts tax breaks,"FORSYTH, Ga. (AP)  Georgias governor signed a law Thursday to exempt federal crop insurance and disaster payments following Hurricane Helene damage from Georgia state income taxes, but it could be months more before some federal money starts flowing to farmers in the hardest-hit states. The U.S. Department of Agriculture published a schedule Wednesday to start disbursing disaster aid, part of a $100 billion package passed by Congress in December. The September storm cut a swath from Floridas Big Bend across eastern Georgia and upstate South Carolina before causing historic flooding in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.  Helene is the seventh-most expensive disaster in the United States since 1980, causing an estimated $78 billion in damage and 219 deaths. Officials have estimated that Helene caused billions in property and economic damage to agriculture, including $5.5 billion in Georgia and $4.9 billion in North Carolina.  Federal officials in March began handing out $10 billion designated in the bill for farmers nationwide harmed by low crop prices and high fertilizer prices. But billions more were set aside for farmers harmed by Helene and other natural disasters in 2023 and 2024. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was questioned about the timeframe Tuesday by lawmakers including Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia. He told Rollins that Time is of the essence. 
        
     Ive seen the devastation firsthand, Rollins said. It is heartbreaking to witness it. Some farmers have dipped into savings to pay for losses not covered by insurance. Others have unpaid debts from last year, restricting borrowing to plant 2025 crops. A few have sold equipment or land to generate cash. The schedule shows federal officials will open applications for some aid in stages from May 30 through Sept. 15. But states have to negotiate plans to distribute other aid through block grants. If state and federal officials agree on a plan by May 28, block grants would be finalized by June 13, federal officials said. If agreements can be reached by June 13, they would be finalized by June 30. After that, states must give out the money. Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said Thursday that he didnt know how much money Georgia would get in block grants. He said whether the state made the May 28 deadline depends on how our negotiations go with USDA over the next couple of weeks. Kemp on Thursday signed into law tax breaks for farmers and timber owners harmed by Helene that could be worth nearly $300 million. Farmers operate on extremely tight margins, and to rebuild from a storm of this magnitude could be impossible for some to shoulder, Kemp said at Georgia Forestry Association headquarters in Forsyth, saying Helene was a storm like no other in out state. The tax breaks come on top of $867 million in spending that Georgia lawmakers earlier allotted for Hurricane Helene relief .  The law exempts federal payments to farmers because of Helene from Georgia state income taxes. That could be worth $140 million.  Georgias law also lets private timberland owners claim a credit for damaged timber on state income taxes if they replant trees. The timberland tax break could be worth $83 million to $104 million through 2030, estimates show. Another tax break waives state and local sales taxes on building materials to rebuild chicken houses, barns, and fences.  A fourth program lets counties waive taxes when timber owners cut down trees for 15 months. Any county that waives taxes would refund any taxes collected since Oct. 1. The state could spend $17.4 million to reimburse counties lost tax money. Georgia lawmakers earlier approved $285 million for low-interest loans to farmers and to remove downed trees from private lands so they dont become a fire hazard. Theres also $25 million in grants to nonprofits that are supposed to go to help individuals. In South Carolina, Republican legislative leaders are discussing hundreds of millions in Helene relief as part of the states budget. North Carolina lawmakers agreed to a $524 million supplemental Helene relief in March, in part to provide more funds for agricultural needs. It was North Carolinas fourth Helene aid package.",https://apnews.com/article/georgia-hurricane-helene-farmers-federal-aid-tax-4c45f4398dc8b7d583c40e78bcb031b6,business
"Shohei Ohtani could have landed 15-year deal, agent says, but he didnt want to risk skills decline","INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP)  Shohei Ohtani could have pursued a 15-year contract through age 44, agent Nez Balelo said Thursday, explaining the two-way superstar didnt want to risk a decline in his skills while under the big deal. Balelo pulled back the curtain that shrouds Ohtani a bit when he spoke at Sporticos Invest West conference featuring decision-makers in sports, entertainment and finance at the new Intuit Dome, home of the NBAs Los Angeles Clippers. Ohtanis $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers that he signed in December 2023 was the largest in professional sports. He won his third MVP award and first World Series title in his first season after moving from the Los Angeles Angels. A year later, Juan Soto went even bigger. The left fielder landed a $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in which none of the money will be deferred. We wouldnt do anything different, Balelo said afterward. He won a championship. He went to the right team. No regrets. Ohtanis deal includes $680 million in deferred payments. Those deferrals reduce the net present value of the contract to about $461 million for baseballs luxury-tax system, instead of an average of $70 million a year had there been no deferrals. Ohtani will be 38 when the contract ends after the 2033 season. We could have went to 13, 14, 15 years, Balelo said. But Shohei wanted to always kind of keep the integrity of where hes at as a player. He just didnt want to have the end of his storybook career tail off and then on year 13, 14 and 15, its just like who is this guy? You cant even run down first and hes not a guy anymore. 
        
     Balelo prefers operating behind the scenes and carefully controlling the narrative around Ohtani. But even he couldnt tamp down a cottage industry of rumors about which team would land Ohtani and how much it would cost. It was quite a ride, he said in a discussion moderated by Ben Verlander, MLB analyst for FOX Sports. A social media frenzy ensued when it was reported Ohtani was on a plane to Toronto to sign with the Blue Jays. Well, that was reckless reporting. We actually tried to let the individual know, No, were not on a plane, Balelo said. I felt bad for the country of Canada. I felt horrible for the organization because clearly they knew we werent. Ohtanis goals were to keep his new team competitive by allowing the club money to sign other players and to allow him to win championships and continue to be a two-way player. The Dodgers gave us their word thats what they were going to do, said Balelo, who works for CAA Sports baseball division. Ohtani is MLBs top endorser, with his earnings jumping from $65 million in 2024 to $100 million this year. Yeah, absolutely, those are real numbers, Balelo said. It continues to take on a life of its own. According to Balelo, Ohtani endorses just over 20 brands that are carefully vetted and chosen based on his use or belief in the product and the people behind it. His priority is his on-the-field performance and the training that goes into it. He takes that very, very serious and everything really becomes secondary other than his family, Balelo said. We just have to make sure that we dont overexpose him or put him in a situation where its too heavy of a lift. Balelo first spotted the future superstar as a high school junior in Ohtanis native Japan and followed him closely as Ohtanis pro career began with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. There were some things that that I did differently than I typically would when I recruit, he said, declining to elaborate when asked afterward. It was definitely a battle, thats for sure, but we came out on top and I was very fortunate. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",https://apnews.com/article/shohei-ohtani-dodgers-13f40a19b9eeac3202e2546143c57008,business

Maryland board OKs plan to start demolition to rebuild Pimlico Race Course shortly after Preakness,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP)  A Maryland board approved a $14.3 million contract on Wednesday to begin the demolition and rebuilding of Baltimores storied but antiquated Pimlico Race Course, home to the second jewel of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.  The vote by the three-member Board of Public Works, which includes Gov. Wes Moore, was made 10 days before the 150th Preakness Stakes, which is scheduled for May 17. It will be the last time the annual horse race will be held with the existing structures in place before the track is rebuilt on the same site. The demolition will begin shortly after this years race. There cannot be a better time to announce the beginning of a transformation that will allow Pimlico to become a year-round hub for economic activity within the Park Heights community, Moore said of the Baltimore neighborhood and longtime home of the race. Under the plan, the Preakness will take place in Laurel Park, located just southwest of Baltimore, in 2026 while the new facility is built, before returning to Pimlico in time for the 2027 race.  Craig Thompson, the chair of the Maryland Stadium Authority which is overseeing the design of the new track, said the plan is to make Pimlico the home of Maryland thoroughbred racing. The track will go from hosting about 15 races a year to well over 100, Thompson said. This is more than just about a racetrack, as historic and important as it is, Thompson said. This is about bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in state investments to Park Heights. 
        
     Thompson also shared a preview of the design plans. They include a new clubhouse with architecture inspired by the Rawlings Conservatory in Baltimores Druid Hill park and the original Pimlico Clubhouse, which included a colonnade and rooftop balconies, Thompson said.  Last year, the board approved a deal to transfer ownership of Pimlico from The Stronach Group to the State of Maryland in order to ensure the Preakness remains in Baltimore. The state has been wrestling with what to do to restore the old racetrack for decades. Aptly nicknamed Old Hilltop, the track opened in 1870. Its where Man o War, Seabiscuit, Secretariat and many others pranced to the winners circle. But its age has long been a concern. In 2019, the Maryland Jockey Club closed off nearly 7,000 grandstand seats, citing the safety and security of all guests and employees.  The horse racing industry and other equine industries have been a cornerstone of Maryland agriculture, as well as an integral part of preserving green space.",https://apnews.com/article/preakness-pimlico-horse-race-course-demolition-rebuild-91f4ff91d019f380bf7062b153ee9390,business
"California regulator weakens AI rules, giving Big Tech more leeway to track you","Californias first-in-the-nation privacy agency is retreating from an attempt to regulate artificial intelligence and other forms of computer automation. The California Privacy Protection Agency was under pressure to back away from rules it drafted. Business groups, lawmakers, and Gov. Gavin Newsom said they would be costly to businesses, potentially stifle innovation, and usurp the authority of the legislature, where proposed AI regulations have proliferated. In a unanimous vote last week, the agencys board watered down the rules, which impose safeguards on AI-like systems. Agency staff estimate that the changes reduce the cost for businesses to comply in the first year of enforcement from $834 million to $143 million and predict that 90% percent of businesses initially required to comply will no longer have to do so. The retreat marks an important turn in an ongoing and heated debate over the boards role. Created following the passage of state privacy legislation by lawmakers in 2018 and voters in 2020, the agency is the only body of its kind in the United States.  The draft rules have been in the works for more than three years, but were revisited after a series of changes at the agency in recent months, including the departure of two leaders seen as pro-consumer, including Vinhcent Le, a board member who led the AI rules drafting process, and Ashkan Soltani, the agencys executive director. Consumer advocacy groups worry that the recent shifts mean the agency is deferring excessively to businesses, particularly tech giants. 
        
     The changes approved last week mean the agencys draft rules no longer regulate behavioral advertising, which targets people based on profiles built up from their online activity and personal information. In a prior draft of the rules, businesses would have had to conduct risk assessments before using or implementing such advertising. Behavioral advertising is used by companies like Google, Meta, and TikTok and their business clients. It can perpetuate inequality, pose a threat to national security, and put children at risk.  The revised draft rules also eliminate use of the phrase artificial intelligence and narrow the range of business activity regulated as automated decisionmaking, which also requires assessments of the risks in processing personal information and the safeguards put in place to mitigate them. Supporters of stronger rules say the narrower definition of automated decisionmaking allows employers and corporations to opt out of the rules by claiming that an algorithmic tool is only advisory to human decision making. My one concern is that if were just calling on industry to identify what a risk assessment looks like in practice, we could reach a position by which theyre writing the exam by which theyre graded, said board member Brandie Nonnecke during the meeting. The CPPA is charged with protecting the data privacy of Californians, and watering down its proposed rules to benefit Big Tech does nothing to achieve that goal, said Sacha Haworth, executive director of Tech Oversight Project, an advocacy group focused on challenging policy that reinforces Big Tech power, said in a statement to CalMatters. By the time these rules are published, what will have been the point? The draft rules retain some protections for workers and students in instances when a fully automated system determines outcomes in finance and lending services, housing, and health care without a human in the decisionmaking loop. Businesses and the organizations that represent them made up 90% of comments about the draft rules before the agency held listening sessions across the state last year, Soltani said in a meeting last year. In April, following pressure from business groups and legislators to weaken the rules, a coalition of nearly 30 unions, digital rights, and privacy groups wrote a letter together urging the agency to continue work to regulate AI and protect consumers, students, and workers.  Roughly a week later, Gov. Newsom intervened, sending the agency a letter stating that he agreed with critics that the rules overstepped the agencys authority and supported a proposal to roll them back. Newsom cited Proposition 24, the 2020 ballot measure that paved the way for the agency. The agency can fulfill its obligations to issue the regulations called for by Proposition 24 without venturing into areas beyond its mandate, the governor wrote. The original draft rules were great, said Kara Williams, a law fellow at the advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center. On a phone call ahead of the vote, she added that with each iteration theyve gotten weaker and weaker, and that seems to correlate pretty directly with pressure from the tech industry and trade association groups so that these regulations are less and less protective for consumers. The public has until June 2 to comment on the alteration to draft rules. Companies must comply with automated decisionmaking rules by 2027. Prior to voting to water down its own regulation last week, at the same meeting the agency board voted to throw its support behind four draft bills in the California Legislature, including one that protects the privacy of people who connect computing devices to their brain and another that prohibits the collection of location data without permission. ___ This story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",https://apnews.com/us-news/gavin-newsom-california-artificial-intelligence-privacy-general-news-9af726479bf65d2b183e88eb985e36d9,business
Washington governor signs rent-control bill into law,"Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a bill into law Wednesday that sets limits on rent increases, making the state among the first in the nation to provide protections for tenants. The rent stabilization measure, House Bill 1217, adds Washington to states like Oregon and California that have sought new ways to curb homelessness.  Bill sponsor Sen. Emily Alvarado, a West Seattle Democrat, said the measure sets common-sense guardrails on the states rental-housing market so that hardworking families and older adults dont get unchecked excessive rent increases. Housing is not a luxury. Its a basic human need, Alvarado said at the bill signing. And everyone in this state deserves a stable and affordable home. The measure caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10%  whichever is lower. The restrictions include single-family homes. The rent-increase cap for manufactured homes is 5%. Lawmakers approved the plan on a 54-44 vote, with five Democrats joining the Republican opposition.  Ferguson praised Alvarado and the many advocates across the state who worked hard to get the bill passed.  It almost didnt make it.  It successfully moved through both houses, but two amendments added on the Senate floor sent it into a conference committee. Those amendments increased the cap from 7% to 10% plus inflation and exempted single-family homes. Opponents of the bill argued that developers would leave the state if it became law and said similar policies in Oregon and California added to those states financial burdens instead of slowing the homeless crisis. 
        
     Oregons rent-control bill was passed in 2019 and later updated to cap rent increases at either 7% plus the annual 12-month average change in the consumer price index for the U.S. West, or 10%  whichever is lower. The conference committee got the cap down to 7% plus inflation or 10%  whichever is lower, and restored protections for the 38% of renters who live in single-family homes. With Fergusons signature, its now law. This law is a good beginning. Its long overdue and its urgently needed, Alvarado said. Forty percent of the people in the state of Washington are renters or manufactured homeowners and before today they had no protections over how high the rent can go, leading to pain and to devastating destabilization of families and communities. Ferguson also signed nine other bills to help homeowners and renters. He said when he campaigned for governor, affordable housing was the top issue voters raised, so he supports bills to help make it easier to secure housing. Lets make this the session of affordable housing, he said before signing the first measure.  The other measures included limits on certain provisions in rental agreements, notices for mobile home communities, and property tax relief for disabled veterans.",https://apnews.com/article/rent-control-homeless-rent-79008acf2e1641fda3b05f644903d73c,business
How a Chinese delicacy got caught in the crossfire of Trumps trade war,"SUQUAMISH, Wash. (AP)  For over two decades, Suquamish tribal member Joshua George has dived into the emerald waters of the Salish Sea looking for an unusually phallic clam thats coveted thousands of miles away. George is a geoduck diver. Pronounced gooey-duck, the worlds largest burrowing clam has been harvested in tidelands by Georges Indigenous ancestors in the Pacific Northwest since before Europeans arrived.  In recent years it has also become a delicacy in China, with Washington state sending 90% of its geoducks there, creating a niche yet lucrative American seafood export.  But the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is now crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks, leaving Washington state divers without work, Seattle exporters without business and Chinese aficionados with fewer of these prized clams. Suquamish Seafoods diver Joshua George returns to the F/V Carriere on April 21, 2025, after a sample harvest of geoducks to send in for testing on the waters of Puget Sound near Suquamish, Washington. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) Suquamish Seafoods diver Joshua George returns to the F/V Carriere on April 21, 2025, after a sample harvest of geoducks to send in for testing on the waters of Puget Sound near Suquamish, Washington. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) Its the first time in 24 years where I dont know when or if well be going back to work or if I have to find another job or what were going to do, George said. U.S. President Donald Trumps tariff-driven economic feud with China, which dates back to his first term in office, swiftly resumed in February within weeks of taking back the White House. By April, Trump had placed tariffs of at least 145% on China, which led China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S. Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since the latest tariffs were imposed, but it is unclear where those talks will lead.  
        
     Enter the geoduck, weighing about 2 pounds and so entrenched in local culture that it is the mascot for Evergreen State College in Olympia. The meaty mollusk is best described as sweet and briny, and its often sliced raw for crisp sashimi out west while China consumers prefer it chewy in stir-fries or hot pot soups. Pre-tariff costs were as high as $100 per pound in restaurants, so its a dish generally reserved for special occasions like Chinese New Year, or to celebrate a business gathering. Unlike other products with long-lasting shelf life and standing inventory, the trade war has had an immediate, direct effect on the delicate geoducks, which are shipped alive the same day of harvest. The whole market, everybody just had to stop, said Jim Boure, general manager of Suquamish Seafoods, an enterprise of the Suquamish Tribe. We started getting phone calls from buyers saying orders are canceled. 
        (AP Video/Manuel Valdes)
       The millions of pounds of geoducks shipped annually to China come from two main sources: wild harvests on tracts of seafloor that are split between the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and Puget Sound Treaty Indian Tribes, and tideland farms. The states share is auctioned to private exporters that often hire contract divers to harvest them.  As of late April, Washington state divers had only pulled about half of the expected harvest from the state tracts, said Blain Reeves, an aquatic resources division manager for the states Department of Natural Resources. Last year, the state and tribes collectively harvested about 3.4 million pounds of wild Washington geoduck for sale. The state generated $22.4 million in revenue for their half of the clams, which went toward paying for aquatic restoration projects locally. The state doesnt track how much is harvested by private farmers.  If only half the pounds that were contracted are harvested, then our revenue is halved, Reeves said. The Suquamish operation has no orders to harvest for at the moment, but it still must keep up with the maintenance to stay ready for business if and when China comes calling.  On a recent April day, Georges team made a quick trip to collect a handful of the clams for state lab testing. When were doing the job, and its not all this other political stuff behind the scenes and everything else, we love this, said George, adding that diving, which takes place early in the day so that the geoducks are on an airplane by evening, has allowed him to watch his kids grow up.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Fellow diver Kyle Purser said he cherishes his underwater job, but now fears its being taken away.  When youre watching your money disappear and youve got families to feed and not knowing when youre going to get your next paycheck, (its) very stressful, he said.   The geoduck import market was already facing weaker demand in recent years due to the Chinese economys struggle to regain post-pandemic momentum. While the tariffs have only exacerbated troubles for geoduck sellers in Washington, theres also been an unintended consequence: The American trade war has inadvertently boosted the Canadian geoduck business, which is facing a mere 25% tariff from China in comparison to the 125% for the U.S. Washington state in the U.S. and Canadas British Columbia province are the two primary places where the wild geoducks grow naturally for commercial harvest. The two countries did healthy business primarily serving Chinese appetites for decades, in part because quantities are limited. Its a labor-intensive and heavily-regulated harvest, as divers must go several feet below the surface to dig for them. They love the fact that it tastes like the sea, said James Austin, president of Canadas Underwater Harvesters Association. Its a product thats really a hit with the Chinese. Its all about the wild coastline. Its really prestigious. Two whole geoducks, left, are displayed with a sashimi preparation of the clam at right, at Chelsea Farms Oyster Bar in Olympia, Washington.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) Austin said he expects there will be 2.75 million pounds of Canadian geoducks harvested in 2025, worth approximately $60 million Canadian dollars ($43.4 million USD) in revenue.  While demand has been relatively low but still steady for Canadians geoducks, Austin said theyre now the leading exporters for China, which has helped them negotiate higher prices as a result. For example, after Canada got hit with a 25% tariff in March, export sale prices dropped to $12 per pound, and after the U.S. got hit with a 125% tariff in April, Canadian geoducks are now being sold for $17 a pound. We have no competitors right now, Austin said.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) We dont care about U.S. tariffs because we can get geoduck from other countries with stable prices, Yang said.  On their first week back to work since the tariff fight brought business to a standstill in Washington state, Derrick McRae and his brother pulled up about 800 pounds of wild geoducks in just one April day.  He donned a full-body diving outfit with an oxygen line tethered to his boat to dive under the cold waters of an inland sea channel west of Seattle. Kneeled on the seafloor, McRae used a water spray gun to move the sand covering the geoducks. In the cloud of sediment, he felt for the neck with his hand, pulling the clam and stuffing it in a net attached to him.  Were just kind of waiting on the edge of our seats to see what happens next, McRae said.  At one of the southernmost inlets, farmer Ian Child said the tariff disruption is not just hurting his bottom line but the entire farming process. He usually places young geoducks in the sand in the summer, but he cant mix new crops with any existing unharvested clams. I think that the demand is still over there for the product, he said of China. I think they still want it. Its just a matter of where the tariffs will land.  ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed from Beijing.",https://apnews.com/article/geoducks-china-us-tariffs-economy-849c8052fd0e679fa421c48d32ed1bc7,business
Long-haul carrier Emirates reports record profit of $5.2 billion as staff get 22-weeks pay as bonus,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Long-haul carrier Emirates reported on Thursday that it earned annual profits of $5.2 billion, with the state-owned firm declaring itself the worlds most profitable airline as global aviation fully returned to flight after the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The profits came as the Dubai-based carrier served 53.7 million passengers out of its hub of Dubai International Airport, compared to 51.9 million passengers in the fiscal year prior. It had aftertax profits of $4.7 billion that same period.  The overall Emirates Group, owned by Dubais sovereign wealth fund known as the Investment Corporation of Dubai, saw annual profits of $5.6 billion, compared to $5.1 billion the year before.  Our excellent financial standing enables us to continue building on and scaling up from our successful business models, said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktom, Emirates chairman and chief executive.  While some markets are jittery about trade and travel restrictions, volatility is not new in our industry, he said. We simply adapt and navigate around these challenges.  About 121,000 workers at the overall Emirates Group separately received word theyd receive a bonus worth 22 weeks of their annual salary. In 2024, they received a 20-weeks bonus. Emirates financial year runs from April 1 to March 31, including revenue from both 2024 and 2025. This past fiscal year marked the first for the company to be charged with the United Arab Emirates new corporate tax of 9%. 
        
     The carrier had revenues of $34.9 billion, compared to $33 billion the year prior. Those revenues put it behind other private carriers, like Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., which led the industry with revenue of $61.6 billion last year.  However, Emirates $5.2 billion in profit put it to the front of the pack. Emirates operates hand-in-glove with Dubai International Airport, flying at all hours from a hub in a country where unions are illegal. Falling crude oil prices also aids its profits, like other airlines.  The carrier said its 260 aircraft fly to 148 locations around the world. It has long relied on the Boeing 777 and the double-decker Airbus A380, though it has also begun introducing the Airbus A350 to its schedule. Its undertaking a multibillion-dollar retrofitting campaign for its aircraft and says it doesnt expect its first Boeing 777-9 until 2027. Emirates serves as a crucial link in East-West travel and is the crown jewel of what experts and diplomats refer to as Dubai Inc.  a series of interconnected companies overseen by the sheikhdoms ruling Al Maktoum family. The Emirates Group accounts for around 15% of Dubais entire gross domestic product in 2023, and includes coffee shops, restaurants, liquor sales and other industries. Emirates is not just a transport company; it is a tool for economic transformation for the UAE, a strategic bridge connecting the worlds continents and a developmental carrier flying us through the skies toward the future, wrote Dubais ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, on the social platform X. The Emirates results track with those for its base, Dubai International Airport. The worlds busiest airport for international travelers had a record 92.3 million passengers pass through its terminals in 2024.  The airport now plans to move to the city-states second, sprawling airfield in its southern desert reaches in the next decade in a project worth nearly $35 billion. A real-estate boom and the citys highest-ever tourism numbers have made Dubai a destination as well as a layover. However, the city is now grappling with increasing traffic and costs, pressuring both its Emirati citizens and the foreign residents who power its economy. As one of seven hereditarily ruled, autocratic sheikhdoms that make up the UAE, Dubai provided Emirates with around $4 billion in a bailout at the height of the pandemic. In its report on Thursday, Emirates said that it had repaid $3.6 billion of that loan.",https://apnews.com/article/dubai-carrier-earns-emirates-2ec4571f18189fc039dc6db4665533ae,business
Toyota reports booming sales but stays cautious on profit because of various costs,"TOKYO (AP)  Japans top automaker Toyota reported record sales for the fiscal year through March on Thursday, but its profit for the latest quarter faltered partly because of a certification scandal. Toyota Motor Corp.s January-March net profit totaled 664.6 billion yen ($4.6 billion), down from 997.6 billion yen the same period a year ago. Quarterly sales totaled 12.36 trillion yen ($85.9 billion), up from 11 trillion yen. Toyota has been strengthening the testing system of its vehicles after acknowledging wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. Akio Toyoda, Toyotas chairman and the grandson of the automakers founder, has apologized. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of vehicles already on roads, which include the popular Corolla subcompact and Lexus luxury vehicles. But the scandal has been a major embarrassment for a manufacturer whose brand has been synonymous for decades with quality and attention to detail. For the fiscal year through March, Toyota reported a 4.77 trillion yen ($33 billion) profit, down from 4.94 trillion yen the previous fiscal year. Annual sales reached a record 48 trillion yen ($333.6 billion), up from 45 trillion yen. Toyota is forecasting sales of 48.5 trillion yen ($337 billion) for the fiscal year through March 2026. 
        
     Its profit forecast was less bullish, citing costs to meet carbon neutrality demands, as well as the impact of President Donald Trumps U.S. tariffs on operating income, which was factored in tentatively at 180 billion yen ($1.3 billion), according to Toyota. That estimate covers April and May, meaning it could grow in coming months.  Consolidated vehicle sales for the fiscal year through March totaled 9.36 million vehicles, down slightly from 9.44 million vehicles the previous fiscal year. Cost reduction and marketing efforts worked as pluses countering the negatives, including the production shutdown spanning several months in the U.S. due to quality issues, Toyota officials said. Toyota also said the portion of electric vehicles it was selling was steadily growing. Sometimes Toyota has been criticized as falling behind in the global move toward EVs, partly because it has an extensive lineup of other kinds of green cars, including hybrids. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama",https://apnews.com/article/toyota-automaker-financials-sales-evs-japan-d3d473cfd03dfd04b487771ca20d14ad,business
"Yes, New Zealand still has more sheep than people. But humans are catching up","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)  The vast number of sheep in New Zealand relative to the countrys scant human population has long been the subject of jokes aimed at New Zealanders abroad. Its true: The country is one of a handful in the world thats still home to more sheep than people. But humans are catching up, according to new figures released Tuesday. With a population of 23.6 million sheep and 5.3 million people, there are about 4.5 sheep for each New Zealander, government statistics agency data showed. Thats down from 22 sheep per person in 1982, when farming sheep for meat and wool was New Zealands biggest earner. Now, years of falling wool prices prompted by a global shift to synthetic fibers have led farmers to change what they do with their land, the sectors biggest lobby group said. By land area, New Zealand is about the size of the United Kingdom, but it has a human population 13 times smaller than the U.K. That means theres plenty of room for sheep. For close to 150 years, the sheep industry was the backbone of New Zealands economy and numbers boomed  peaking in 1982 when there were more than 70 million sheep and just 3.2 million people. Before Lord of the Rings brought waves of tourists to the country, images of green fields filled with placid sheep against backdrops of snow-capped mountains dominated the countrys marketing abroad. But over years of decline for global wool prices since  and despite recent rallies  the national flock has steadily diminished. Now dairy holds the biggest share of New Zealands agriculture and horticulture-dominant export market. 
        
     In 2023, Stats NZ, a government agency, said New Zealand in 2022 dipped below five sheep per person for the first time. The national flock had lost a million more sheep in Tuesdays figures, which recorded livestock numbers as of June 2024. Toby Williams, a spokesperson for sector lobby group Federated Farmers, said sheep farmers have switched to more lucrative pursuits  dairy, or the conversion of land from farming to pine forestry in order to sell carbon offsets. If Im really honest, the wool industry is almost at that tipping point, if not already there, of not having a wool industry anymore, he said. The government has drawn up measures intended to slow the decline, including an announcement in 2024 that they will place limits on the scale of farmland that can be converted to carbon forestry. New government procurement guidelines launched in April urge the use of New Zealand wool products  such as carpets and insulation  in newly constructed or refurbished public buildings. But those measures are not expected to halt declining sheep numbers. Some sheep-farming countries are recording similar trends. New Zealands closest neighbor Australia  the source of most of the sheep jokes about New Zealanders  is also home to more sheep than people, but the national flock is shrinking there too. The gap is slimmer: There are about three sheep per Australian.",https://apnews.com/article/zealand-sheep-people-ratio-farming-wool-prices-cfd80216b660dd3a7c2e8408a98dab53,business
Nintendo promises stronger results with Switch 2 console going on sale in June,"TOKYO (AP)  Japanese video-game maker Nintendo on Thursday reported a 43% decline in profit for the fiscal year through March, but promised a turnaround as its Switch console upgrade goes on sale in June.

The fortunes of game companies tend to decline somewhat as time passes after a new game machine goes on sale since many people have already bought the machine, although new hit software helps boost the results. Much anticipation has been building over the rollout of the so-called Switch 2, which goes on sale June 5. Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026. Demand has dwindled for the current Switch, now in its eighth year after its debut. The number of Switch players around the world remains above 128 million people, according to Nintendo. Nintendo said attractive software was coming for the Switch 2 later this year, including The Legend of Zelda games, a Pokemon title and a Kirby game, as well as offerings from outside software companies. Also adding to the momentum is the opening of a Nintendo store in San Francisco and the Super Nintendo World amusement facility opening in Orlando, both set for this month, according to Nintendo. Nintendo is projecting a 300 billion yen ($2.1 billion) profit for the fiscal year ending in March next year, a nearly 8% improvement from the fiscal year just ended, on sales of 1.9 trillion yen ($13 billion), up 63% on-year. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama",https://apnews.com/article/nintendo-mario-japan-games-entertainment-console-7fb2773d7119f14f6c24ecb4580f51d5,business
"From Oval Office blowout to landmark minerals deal, how Ukraines diplomacy unfolded","KYIV, Ukraine (AP)  Last fall, weeks before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy floated a pitch that proposed, among other things,an economic deal that would allow Washington access to Ukraines largely untapped minerals and deepen strategic ties.  Under pressure from Western allies and amid global war fatigue, Zelenskyy saw that the days of Biden administration-era robust military aid might be numbered, and so the pitch was part of the Ukrainian leaders so-called victory plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It was an offer that would appeal to Trumps penchant for transactions-based diplomacy in hopes of ensuring a steady flow of future American support in return.  Seven months later, a landmark deal between Ukraine and the Trump administration on Ukraines mineral resources was inked. But the road in between was paved with mutual recriminations, a historic Oval Office blowout, hundreds of revisions, and finally, a chance meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis funeral. Despite last-minute snags, Ukraine secured a deal thats set to bring closer ties with the U.S. and provide a vehicle for future military assistance. Ukraines parliament voted unanimously to ratify the agreement on Thursday, and other documents pertaining to the deal are being finalized. It seems to me that this is the first time in history that the United States considers Ukraine as a long-term strategic partner, economically, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko told a media briefing in Kyiv on Thursday ahead of the parliament vote.  Heres a timeline of the deals conception and signing:  In response to rising pressure from Western allies and clear battlefield disadvantages, Zelenskyy outlined a so-called victory plan to end the war. The plan sought to strengthen Kyivs negotiating hand and proposed measures to boost its military potential, but also economic partnerships with Western allies. Ukraine is rich in natural resources, including critically important metals such as uranium, titanium, lithium, and graphite. Zelenskyy pitched the plan to the White House during a visit to Washington in late September, and later in a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower in New York.  Giving American companies preferential access to Ukraine would serve as leverage against Russia as most mineral deposits are located very close to front-line areas. Having U.S. companies on the ground, the thinking goes, would cement Washingtons interests in Ukraine and serve as a de facto security guarantee. Critical minerals used to manufacture weapons, aviation and batteries would also give the U.S. access to reserves in a global market dominated by China. Trump appeared captivated by the idea and very soon after his inauguration in January started touting the idea of getting Ukraines rare earth elements. By February, the White House and Ukraine appear to have made significant progress toward reaching an agreement that would provide the U.S. with access to Ukraines rare earth minerals.  On Feb. 12, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent became the first senior Trump administration official to visit Kyiv. Zelenskyy was expected to sign the deal that day amid a push by Washington quickly end the war. But the Ukrainian president decline d, saying elements of the draft didnt align with his countrys constitution. The deal would have given the U.S. 50% rights to Ukraines minerals and mentioned nothing of security guarantees.  I didnt let the ministers sign  because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest, Zelenskyy told The Associated Press at the Munich Security Conference in February.  Bessent later said that Zelenskyy blew up the deal. Zelenskyy shot back, saying Bessents approach had been disrespectful. My colleagues know that if someone taps their finger on an agreement and says, You must sign now  I could only say to him, Stop tapping your finger and lets have a proper conversation, Zelenskyy later told reporters. The two sides agreed to a new draft later in February. On Feb. 28, Zelenskyy arrived in Washington with the intention of signing the revised version of the deal. But Zelenskyy insists on adding explicit U.S. security guarantees to it, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldnt be trusted to comply with a ceasefire deal. A shouting match breaks out in the Oval Office, and Trump berates the Ukrainian president for not demonstrating gratitude for American support. Youre not in a good position. You dont have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards, Trump shouted. Zelenskyy left the White House with no deal and a deeply uncertain future with Washington. Shortly after, the U.S. pauses military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine. According to multiple Ukrainian and Western officials, results from ceasefire talks between Ukrainian and U.S. delegates in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 marked a turning point after the disastrous Oval Office meeting. Ukraine agrees to a U.S. proposal for a full and immediate 30-day ceasefire, pending approval by the Kremlin, which had so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict without accepting any concessions. By piling conditions on both proposals for both full and partial ceasefires, Putin began testing Trumps patience. Meanwhile, technical discussions over the minerals deal resume. But the Trump administration introduced a new clause demanding that Ukraine reimburse the full amount of U.S. aid provided since the start of the full-scale invasion. Trump mentions a $500 billion figure as compensation, an amount many times more than the sum of aid provided. Ukrainian officials continue lobbying for a more equitable structure that respects Ukraines strategic interests and state sovereignty. Zelenskyy spells out three core principles: The creation of a joint investment fund, 50-50 governance and the exclusion of debt repayment. Intensive negotiations continue, requiring Ukrainian and U.S. officials to work across time zones. Each day ushers in proposals and counterproposals. There were likely hundreds of revisions and dozens of draft revisions, a senior European official close to the talks said. Every morning meant a new batch of edits for each side. Svyrydenko said on April 18 that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent before a possible fuller agreement later. A draft, dated April 17 and obtained by the AP, called for creating a joint U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, incorporated as a partnership in Delaware. The draft document was a version marked up by the United States and showed that the Trump administration could be willing to cede on some demands that Ukraine opposed. The draft was notable because it called for the U.S. to make a significant initial cash investment in the fund, in addition to receiving credit in the form of equity that is equivalent to the billions in U.S. military assistance already spent. Earlier versions had the U.S. investing no additional capital in Ukraine while having exclusive rights to the countrys natural resources. A breakthrough moment came on April 26 in the form of a tete-a-tete between Trump and Zelenskyy in St. Peters Basilica at the sidelines of Pope Francis funeral. Zelenskyy described it as a turning point and the best conversation the two leaders have had to date.  The exchange paved the way for the signing of the minerals deal in Washington four days later, he said. In the end, Zelenskyy didnt get explicit security guarantees as part of the deal. Still, the final agreement was considered a victory for Ukraine after months of diplomatic work.  The signed deal crucially doesnt call for Kyiv to reimburse the U.S. for the aid it has already received  a concession from Trump. That concession was  That concession was extracted after Ukrainians argued that recognizing past aid as debt retrospectively would go against agreements that Ukraine has made to obtain that aid with the U.S., European Union, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka said. Instead, Ukrainians argued for future military assistance to count as part of investment into the fund.  Bessent acknowledged that the agreement was a tacit security guarantee because of the economic partnership.  Ukraines Parliament votes unanimously in favor of ratifying the minerals agreement with the U.S., setting the deal in motion.  ___ Illia Novikov in Kyiv, and Matthew Lee and Byron Tau in Washington, contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-mineral-deal-timeline-c2b95464127d4d0327a9088e116e9f47,business
India suspends flight operations and closes 24 airports as Pakistan resumes flights nationwide,"NEW DELHI (AP)  Airlines in India have suspended flight operations from two dozen airports across northern and western regions of the country amid heightened tensions with Pakistan. Indias Civil Aviation Ministry late Thursday confirmed in a statement the temporary closure of 24 airports.  Pakistan, meanwhile, resumed flights nationwide after a suspension at four airports, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. In advisories to passengers, Indias key domestic airlines said their flights would remain suspended until Saturday from airports including Amritsar in northern Punjab and Srinagar in India-controlled Kashmir, bordering Pakistan. Indigo, the countrys biggest domestic carrier, on Wednesday canceled 165 flights, while Air India and Air India Express had a similar number of cancellations. Air India diverted two of its international flights enroute from Amritsar, close to Lahore, to New Delhi, because of the sudden closure of the airport. India and Pakistan are teetering on the edge of a fresh military crisis after New Delhi launched missile strikes inside Pakistani territory Wednesday, targeting what it called terror training camps to avenge last months massacre of 26 Indian tourists in India-controlled Kashmir. India blames Pakistan for backing the gunmen, an accusation that Islamabad denies. Soon after the killings, the two countries swiftly moved to close their respective airspace last month, and India has shut some of its airports. The cancellation of flights has resulted in woes for passengers. 
        
     Rahul, a 32-year-old Indian businessman who goes by a single name, said his flight from Dubai to Chandigarh was canceld on Wednesday after closure of the Indian airport.

GOP centrists revolt against steep cuts to Medicaid and other programs in Trumps tax breaks bill,"WASHINGTON (AP)  When it comes to Medicaid, Rep. Juan Ciscomani is telling fellow Republicans he wont support steep cuts that could hit thousands of residents in his Arizona district  my neighbors, people my kids go to school with  who depend on it. Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the liberal-leaning blue dot of Omaha, Nebraska, is trying to protect several Biden-era green energy tax breaks. Hes warning colleagues that you cant pull the rug out from under businesses that have already sunk millions of dollars into renewable developments in Nebraska and beyond. And for Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, its simple: No Salt. No Deal. For Real. He wants to revive  and bump up  whats known as the SALT deduction, which allows taxpayers to write off a portion of their state and local taxes. Capping the deduction at $10,000 hurt many of his Long Island constituents. Governing is a negotiation, right? said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, another Republican who is also involved in the talks. I think everybody is going to have to give a little. As GOP leaders draft President Donald Trumps big, beautiful bill of some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and $1.5 trillion in spending cuts by Memorial Day, dozens of Republicans from contested congressional districts have positioned themselves at the center of the negotiating table. While its often the most conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus driving the legislative agenda  and they are demanding as much as $2 trillion in cuts  its the more centrist-leaning conservatives who could sink the bill. They have been hauled into meetings with Trump at the White House, some have journeyed to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and many are huddling almost daily with House Speaker Mike Johnson. 
        
     And they are not satisfied, yet. To get everybody politically and policy-wise on the same page is going to require more conversations, said LaLota, who is among five Republicans pledging to withhold their support unless changes to the SALT deduction are included. Diving into the gritty details of the massive package, the GOP leaders are running into the stubborn reality that not all the ideas from their menu of potential tax breaks and spending cuts are popular with voters back home. Moreover, their work of compiling the big package is not happening in a vacuum. It comes amid growing economic unease rippling across the country as Trump has fired thousands of federal workers, including some of their own constituents, and as his trade war sparks concerns of empty store shelves and higher prices. Brendan Buck, a former adviser to an earlier House speaker, Paul Ryan, warned in an op-ed Wednesday that all the partys energy is being poured into one bill, with questionable returns.  Many Republicans are hoping that the tax bill can blunt the economic damage caused by the Trump tariffs, Buck wrote in The New York Times, but that is highly unlikely. Democrats are ready for the fight, warning that Trump and his fellow Republicans are ripping away health care and driving the economy into the ditch  all to retain tax breaks approved during Trumps first term that are expiring at years end. What we see from Donald Trump and the Republicans is they are actually crashing the economy in real time, said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Why, the Democratic leader asked, are Republicans jumping through hoops to try to reduce Medicaid and food stamps used by millions of Americans?  Its all in service of enacting massive tax breaks for their millionaire donors like Elon Musk, he said.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Johnson has projected a calm confidence, insisting that House Republicans are on track to deliver on Trumps agenda. The speakers office has become a waystation with a revolving door of Republicans privately laboring to piece together the massive package. So far, GOP leaders have signaled they are walking away from some, but not all, of the steep Medicaid cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the proposals could result in millions of people losing their coverage. Instead, what appears to still be on the table are tougher work requirements for those receiving Medicaid and food stamp assistance and more frequent eligibility tests for beneficiaries.  Thats not enough for the conservatives, who also number in the dozens and are insisting on deeper reductions. Ciscomani, in his second term, signed onto a letter with Bacon and others warning House Republican leadership he cannot support a bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations. Our point is that we understand the need for reform, Ciscomani said. But anything that goes beyond that and starts jeopardizing rural hospitals in my district and their existence overall, then were running into an area where it will be very difficult to move forward. I think its very important they know that. Bacon, Ciscomani and others joined on a separate letter raising concerns about eliminating clean-energy tax credits, including those passed under President Joe Biden, a Democrat.  Go with a scalpel. Go pick out some things, Bacon told The Associated Press. He and the others warned that companies are already investing millions of dollars from the Inflation Reduction Acts incentives to green energy. You just cant do a wholesale throw it out, Bacon said. Democrats are also applying political pressure in Ciscomanis district and beyond.  As Republicans decline to hold town halls on the advice of their leaders, Democrats are stepping in to warn constituents about what could happen to programs they rely on for health coverage and to put food on the table. Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Cory Booker of New Jersey visited Ciscomanis Tucson-based district last month to offer harsh condemnations. Kelly asked how many in the room were represented by Ciscomani, and then he warned about how scores of residents in the district could lose their health care coverage. And for what? It is so Donald Trump could give a big, giant tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. It is not fair, Kelly said. Booker, fresh off his 25-hour speech on the Senate floor, was even more pointed, saying just three House Republicans have to change their mind to upend the GOPs effort in the House, with its narrow majority. I believe one of them has to be in this district right here, Booker said. Either he changes his mind or this district changes congresspeople. Its as simple as that. ___ Associated Press writer Leah Askarinam contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/tax-cuts-medicaid-cuts-food-stamps-tariffs-9adf4640c67535117c71165b106f6379,business
Beckham and Neville part of new ownership group at English soccer club Salford,"David Beckham and Gary Neville are part of a new consortium to have taken ownership of English fourth-tier soccer club Salford City. The club was previously owned by Beckham, Neville and other former Manchester United teammates in its so-called Class of 92  Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville  along with Singapore businessman Peter Lim. A new ownership group, containing Beckham, Gary Neville and other shareholders from the United States, India and England, has bought Salford and have committed to invest significantly in the club, the team and its facilities, Salford said on Thursday. Butt, Giggs, Scholes and Phil Neville are no longer shareholders but will continue to contribute to the next step of this journey with roles in the club, Salford said. Beckham grew up in Salford and said he had such fond memories of my time living there and the place and its people played such an important part in my early life in football. Salford City is at the heart of its community ... it has a rich history and I am delighted to be a part of the next chapter. Beckham also is a co-owner of Major League Soccer club Inter Miami. Neville said the consortium contains a diverse range of minds and expertise, held together by a love of football. Football will come first, however its critical that we drive the club towards sustainability in the next four, five years, Neville said. I cant wait for the next part of this journey. 
        
     Salford finished in eighth place  outside the playoff spots  in League Two this season. Beckham said he has been inspired by Wrexhams rise through English soccer under the ownership of Hollywood celebrities Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney since 2021. Im not saying this is why were doing it because its not, Beckham told The Athletic in an interview. But Ive spoken to Ryan about it so many times now and he said the feeling around the city, the feeling around the club, is so exceptional. Thats the kind of thing that we want to create. Beckham added that the dream was to take Salford to the Premier League. But theres a lot of hard work and a lot of investment to be done up until that point, he said. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/beckham-neville-salford-d215e9251cbd51eb0877000dc30af9d9,business
"Bill Gates pledges his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will close in 20 years","SEATTLE (AP)  Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. Today, that would be worth an estimated $107 billion.  The pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever  outpacing the historic contributions of industrialists like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie when adjusted for inflation. Only Berkshire Hathaway investor Warren Buffetts pledge to donate his fortune  currently estimated by Forbes at $160 billion  may be larger depending on stock market fluctuations. Gates donation will be delivered over time and allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. The foundation already has an endowment of $77 billion built from donations from Gates, Melinda French Gates and Buffett. Its kind of thrilling to have that much to be able to put into these causes, Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.  His announcement Thursday signals both a promise of sustained support to those causes, particularly global health and education in the U.S., and an eventual end to the foundations immense worldwide influence. Gates says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now, which will have positive ripple effects well beyond the foundations closure. It also makes it more likely that his intentions are honored.  
        
     I think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone, Gates said.  Bill Gates speaks during the Global Funds Seventh Replenishment Conference, Sept. 21, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Bill Gates speaks during the Global Funds Seventh Replenishment Conference, Sept. 21, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) The pledge is a welcome bit of boldness, at a time when optimism is in short supply said, Rhodri Davies, a philanthropy expert and author of the publication, Public Good by Private Means. This announcement seems like yet more evidence that norms in foundation philanthropy might be shifting away from a default of operating in perpetuity, he said. The Gates Foundation has long been peerless among foundations  attracting supporters and detractors but also numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.  In addition to the $100 billion it has spent since its founding 25 years ago, it has directed scientific research, helped develop new technologies, and nurtured long-term partnerships with countries and companies. About 41% of the foundations money so far has come from Warren Buffett and the rest from the fortune Gates made at Microsoft.  Started by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2000, the foundation plays a significant role in shaping global health policy and has carved out a special niche by partnering with companies to drive down the cost of medical treatments so low- and middle-income countries could afford them.  The foundation work has been way more impactful than I expected, Gates said, calling it his second and final career. The foundations influence on global health  from the World Health Organization to research agendas  is both a measure of its success and a magnet for criticism. For years, researchers have asked why a wealthy family should have so much sway over how the world improves peoples health and responds to crises. Gates said, like any private citizen, he can choose how to spend the money he earns and has decided to do everything he can to reduce childhood deaths.  Is that a bad thing? Its not an important cause? People can criticize it, he said, but the foundation will stick to its global health work. The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and statehouses from Melinda French Gates organization, Pivotal Ventures. The foundations most prized metric is the drop in childhood deaths from preventable causes by almost half between 2000 and 2020, according to United Nations figures. The foundations CEO Mark Suzman is careful to say they do not take credit for this accomplishment. But he believes they had a catalytic role  for example, in helping deliver vaccines to children through Gavi, the vaccine alliance they helped create. The foundation still has numerous goals  eradicating polio, controlling other deadly diseases, like malaria, and reducing malnutrition, which makes children more vulnerable to other illnesses. Gates hopes that by spending to address these issues now, wealthy donors will be free to tackle other problems later.  The Gates Foundation had planned to wind down two decades after Gates death, meaning todays announcement significantly moves up that timetable. Gates plans to stay engaged, though at 69, he acknowledged he may not have a say. In its remaining two decades, the foundation will maintain a budget of around $9 billion a year, which represents a leveling off from its almost annual growth since 2006, when Buffett first started donating.  Suzman expects the foundation will narrow its focus to top priorities.  Having that time horizon and the resources just puts an even greater burden on us to say, Are you actually putting your resources, your thumb down, on what are going to be the biggest, most successful bets rather than scattering it too thinly? Suzman said, which he acknowledged was creating uncertainty even within the foundation about what programs would continue.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena, file) Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Melinda French Gates smiles as she leaves June 23, 2023 the Elysee Palace in Paris. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena, file) Major changes preceded the foundations 25th year.  In 2021, Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates divorced, and Buffett resigned as the foundations trustee. They recruited a new board of trustees to help govern the foundation, and in 2024, French Gates left to continue work at her own organization.  French Gates said she decided to step down partly to focus on countering the rollback of womens rights in the U.S. At the ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, she said she wanted to leave the foundation at a high point. I so trusted Mark Suzman, the current CEO, she said. We had a board in place that I helped put in place, and I knew their values.  Even as the foundations governance stabilizes, the road ahead looks difficult. Enduring conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, global economic turmoil and cuts to foreign aid forecast fewer resources coming to global health and development. The greatest uncertainty for us is the generosity that will go into global health, Gates said. Will it continue to go down like it has the last few years or can we get it back to where it should be?  Even facing these obstacles, Gates and the foundation speak, as they often do, with optimism, pointing to innovations theyve funded or ways theyve helped reduce the cost of care.  Its incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we cant get them out to everyone who needs them, Gates said. So its going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The Gates Foundations first 25 years: How it changed global health and philanthropy,"SEATTLE (AP)  In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the worlds largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health  an accomplishment that carried both accolades and controversy. Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates had grand ambitions for their foundation, but little experience in global health or philanthropy. They were moved by stories like those written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about children dying from diseases caused by a lack of sanitation. In characteristic Gates style, they tackled these problems with rigor, data and close oversight.  As a result, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  formed in 2000 by the merger of two family foundations and funded by Gates Microsoft wealth and later, by tens of billions from investor Warren Buffett  inserted itself into the architecture of global health.  Along the way, the foundations leaders redefined what it means to be philanthropists. As I was learning about what children die of, you know, HIV and diarrhea and pneumonia, were all things that I was stunned how little was going into helping the poor countries, Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press. He responded in a way few others could, by pouring billions into the foundation, which spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with about half going toward global health. 
        
     Thanks to its largesse, as well as the expertise of its employees, its connections to governments and companies, and the profile of its founders, the Gates Foundation now garners at least the same influence, if not more, in almost any global health forum as many countries.  That era now has an end date. Gates announced Thursday that the foundation will close in 2045, pledging that he plans to donate 99% of his remaining fortune, which would be $107 billion today, to the nonprofit by then. Gates said the foundation can maintain its culture and workforce over that time.  Well be showing that were doing the most we can and give a lot of predictability to the field by (saying,) Well be here all of those 20 years, but not thereafter, he said. The foundations influence over global health policy and its partnerships with companies and other private sector actors have long drawn questions.  Researcher Linsey McGoey, a professor of sociology at the University of Essex, who wrote the book No Such Thing as a Free Gift  about the foundation, asks how charitable it is to give away money to a foundation the donor controls. Others like Anuj Kapilashrami, global health professor at the University of Essex, argue the foundations preference for low-cost treatments and interventions does not inherently help build the capacity of health systems.  We do not tackle the causes, the underlying drivers of what is producing ill-health, but we choose areas and health issues where we can just push these magic bullets: commodities, drugs (and) bed nets, she said. Mark Suzman, who has been with the foundation for 18 years and CEO since 2020, said close supervision of grantees and the foundations data-driven processes are key to its success. We are not a write the check, call us in three years and let us know what it looks like, kind of funder, Suzman said. Well be calling you up probably every week, and well have some opinions. But we want your opinions back. The foundation is proud of the many vaccines, medical devices and treatment protocols it has helped develop. It is optimistic about a pipeline of innovations, including potential vaccines for malaria and HIV, as possible accomplishments in its remaining 20 years. David McCoy, a physician who was then at the University College London, argued back in 2009 that only a small portion of the foundations spending went directly to organizations located in the countries where they work, with most going to international organizations like the World Health Organization or to groups located in the U.S. and Europe.  Suzman said he has been an internal champion of shifting more of the foundations work from Seattle to in-country offices.  The foundations flagship issue, and the main way it measures its success, is in reducing preventable childhood deaths. The Gates Foundation helped establish two major public-private partnerships: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that funds and distributes vaccines for children, and the Global Fund, which, along with governments, funds the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. The foundation says the two organizations have saved tens of millions of lives and are some of the most important examples of its impact. However, Amy Patterson, politics professor at The University of the South, Sewanee, says public-private partnerships like Gavi and the Global Fund diminish the power of civil society groups and citizens compared to public health systems. It certainly has moved us from thinking about health as a state responsibility, which raises questions about accountability and participation, said Patterson, who has researched the management of AIDS in African countries, including the role of civic groups. That is not to discount the millions of lives saved, or children immunized, or women who have access to reproductive health, or the innovations that have brought efficiency, Patterson said. But if you think about the social contract between states taking care of their people, how do we have that same kind of accountability in this type of a system? A huge moment in the early history of the foundation came in 2006 when Buffett pledged to donate a percentage of his Berkshire Hathaway shares annually, almost doubling the foundations resources. Buffett teamed with Gates and French Gates again in 2010 to launch a new commitment for billionaires: to give away more than half their money in their lifetimes or at the time of their death. The Giving Pledge now has more than 240 people agreeing to those terms, far exceeding Gates expectations. However, certainly not every billionaire has. Gates hopes others will surpass his giving.  Id love to be beat in all of this work, he said. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than Ive been. He acknowledged that cuts to foreign aid and health funding under President Donald Trumps current administration, wars, and economic turmoil significantly challenge the foundations hopes of eradicating polio, controlling malaria, and reducing the number of child and maternal deaths in the next 20 years.  The metric that we should be measured against is the success of the whole global health field. Did we draw people in? Did we keep governments engaged, and therefore, do we get childhood death rates down from the 5 million to cut it in half again? he said. I cant promise you we will, because without the partners, thats not doable. And the current trend line is not positive for that. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and in statehouses from Melinda French Gates organization, Pivotal Ventures. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

In his own words: Bill Gates on giving away the remainder of his wealth,"INDIAN WELLS, Ca. (AP)  Bill Gates is pledging 99% of his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will spend it all within 20 years. The funds will be delivered over time and will allow the foundation to spend another $200 billion by the time it closes in 2045. Theres still a little bit more that goes to the kids and some portion that, you know, I wont be wanting for anything for my consumption, Gates said. Even his climate-related investments, all of the profits that come from that work go into the Gates Foundation. In interviews with The Associated Press, Gates spoke about the foundations past work and future goals. His responses have been edited for length.  I hope other people wallop me. Even today, theres probably a dozen people richer than I am, because I dont count the money that Ive already got in the foundation. I have just a bit over $100 billion outside of the foundation. Id love to be beat in all of this work. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than Ive been. I think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone. It will be spent. Hopefully, many of these diseases are eradicated, so nobody even knows, What was malaria? What was polio? in the years ahead. You know, some foundations, if theyve been around 50 or 60 years, who knows how their work relates to the intent of the person who started that foundation? And I do think therell be more rich people in the future than there are today. So yes, it will create a vacuum in 20 years, and were letting people know way in advance thats what this will look like. Its by some measures the most generous gift ever given and a real vote of confidence from Warren, whos a great friend and has always given me phenomenal advice and is very driven by these inequity issues. And that was in 2006, and so its two years later that I give up my full-time work at Microsoft, and I move over. And Ive been full time at the foundation since 2008 for the rest of my life. Its my final, second career. You know, Warren, its hard to overstate the impact hes had on me. 
        
     That was a big hope, that the societal expectation for anybody who has a lot of money would be that they give the majority of it away, and that basically everyone would join into that. Now, were not at that level, but I think year by year, people are saying, Hey, the fairness of this system, the legitimacy of this system really benefits if those who both through skill and luck, the system has rewarded them, that they put a lot of their resources and even, some of their time and energy into improving society. Many things now are making it less clear how much progress well make in these 20 years we have remaining. The donors are being somewhat less generous as they feel squeezed by an aging population and demands for Ukraine, both refugee costs, defense costs, a lot of things. And so telling the story of the success and the moral and geopolitical value of taking 1% of rich country budgets and saying, No, this is to save lives for very, very, very little money. Were going to have to renew peoples understanding and prioritization of these things in order to keep that piece. We have a lot of things were optimistic about because we have new tools, new ways of protecting women from getting HIV, new ways of killing mosquitoes... And so its incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we cant get them out to everyone who needs them. So, its going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need. Melinda has made a phenomenal contribution to the foundation, helping us pick the right people and being in partnerships, traveling the world, bringing her perspective to things. I cant say enough good things about how she got us off on the right track. When we divorced, we hoped  I hoped  that she would choose to stay. She stayed for a period of time, continued to do great work, and then chose to do the philanthropy on her own.  Our work is for saving childrens lives. So its true, if they have other priorities, its hard to influence my commitment to not having mothers bleed to death or kids not dying from malaria. To be honest, the number of civil society actors that are in here trying to influence the work we do is so tiny. Its unbelievable. I mean, I could almost list their names on one piece of paper. Where are these people? We want more people second-guessing our work, criticizing our work. I mean, whats their idea about malnutrition? Whats their idea on how to deal with these funding cuts? What do they want us to do? ____ The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and in statehouses from Melinda French Gates organization, Pivotal Ventures.  ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Orthodox Church leader says faith is humanitys safeguard against the impending robotocracy,"ATHENS, Greece (AP)  The spiritual leader of the worlds Orthodox Christians has said that religious faith should serve as humanitys safeguard amid rapidly advancing technology and what he described as the impending robotocracy. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, 85, said that Orthodox tradition preserves valuable human-centric wisdom essential for navigating a world of accelerating technological change and automation. His comments during an event at Athens University reflect growing concerns across major branches of Christianity  and ongoing dialogue between them  about artificial intelligences potential impact on human dignity and social structures, as well as the dangers posed by autonomous weapons systems. In a world of rapid change, an upheaval of values, and dizzying technological advances  from artificial intelligence to the impending robotocracy  our Church proclaims that there is nothing more sacred than the human being, with whom God Himself shared His nature, Bartholomew said. The patriarch, who is based in Istanbul, Turkey, made the remarks late Wednesday in a speech published on Thursday. Religious tradition, the patriarch said, upholds the absolute priority of the person over systems  and the need for an education that cultivates and supports the spiritual nature of humanity. While not opposing technological advancement, Bartholomew emphasized the need for innovation to remain human-centered. 
        
     The comments echo similar concerns raised by other Christian leaders, who increasingly frame their responses to AI and robotics through theological perspectives on human uniqueness, free will, and spiritual nature. In guidance issued by the Vatican in January, the Catholic Church said applications of AI must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and promote the common good. The head of the Anglican Church traveled to Rome last year to sign the Call for AI Ethics  an initiative backed by the Italian government and supported by tech giants IBM and Microsoft. Bartholomew, who is on a weeklong visit to Greece, met Thursday with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis days after they both attended the funeral of Pope Francis.",https://apnews.com/article/greece-automation-religion-robots-orthodoxy-2d5765621d591fa4e58ac8f60df1a3d4,business
AI-generated video gave victim a voice at his killers sentencing in Arizona,"CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP)  There were dozens of statements submitted to the court by family and friends of Christopher Pelkey when it came time to sentence the man convicted of fatally shooting him during a road rage incident. They provided glimpses of Pelkeys humor, his character and his military service.  But there was nothing quite like hearing from the victim himself  even if it was a version generated by artificial intelligence. In whats believed to be a first in U.S. courts, Pelkeys family used AI to create a video using his likeness to give him a voice. The AI rendering of Pelkey told the shooter during the sentencing hearing last week in Phoenix that it was a shame they had to meet that day in 2021 under those circumstances  and that in another life, the two of them probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness and in God who forgives. I always have and I still do, Pelkeys avatar told Gabriel Paul Horcasitas. The Army dress uniform and photo of the late Christopher Pelkey is shown at his mothers home, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, in Chandler, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York) The Army dress uniform and photo of the late Christopher Pelkey is shown at his mothers home, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, in Chandler, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York) The AI version of Pelkey went on to encourage people to make the most of each day and to love each other, not knowing how much time one might have left.  While use of AI within the court system is expanding, its typically been reserved for administrative tasks, legal research and case preparation. In Arizona, its helped inform the public of rulings in significant cases.  But using AI to generate victim impact statements marks a new  and legal, at least in Arizona  tool for sharing information with the court outside the evidentiary phases.  
        
     Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang, who presided over the case, said after watching the video that he imagined Pelkey, who was 37 at the time of his killing, would have felt that way after learning about him. Lang also noted the video said something about Pelkeys family, who had expressed their anger over his death and had asked for Horcasitas to receive the maximum sentence.  Even though thats what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it, Lang said. This undated image shows Chris Pelkey with a fish at Crystal Lake in Coram, N.Y. (Tim Wales via AP) This undated image shows Chris Pelkey with a fish at Crystal Lake in Coram, N.Y. (Tim Wales via AP) Horcasitas, 54, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10.5 years in prison. Horcasitas lawyer, Jason Lamm, told The Associated Press they filed a notice to appeal his sentence within hours of the hearing. Lamm said its likely the appeals court will weigh whether the judge improperly relied on the AI video when handing down the sentence. The shooting happened the afternoon of Nov. 13, 2021, as both drivers were stopped at a red light. According to records, Pelkey was shot after getting out of his truck and walking toward Horcasitas car. Pelkeys sister, Stacey Wales, raised the idea of her brother speaking for himself after struggling to figure out what she would say. She wrote a script for the AI-generated video, reflecting that he was a forgiving person.  In Arizona, victims can give their impact statements in any digital format, said victims rights attorney Jessica Gattuso, who represented the family. Stacey Wales, sister of the late Christopher Pelkey, is shown at her mothers home, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, in Chandler, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York) Stacey Wales, sister of the late Christopher Pelkey, is shown at her mothers home, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, in Chandler, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York) Wales, a software product consultant, took the AI idea to her husband, Tim. He and his friend, who have work experience creating humanlike AI avatars. Using a video clip of Pelkey, they aimed to replicate his voice and speech patterns. They generated Pelkeys likeness through a single image of him, digitally manipulating it to remove glasses and a hat logo, edit his outfit and trim his beard.  Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Ann Timmer didnt address the road rage case specifically in an interview Wednesday. But she said the rise in popularity and accessibility to AI in recent years led to the creation of a committee to research best practices in the courts. Gary Marchant, a member of the committee and a law professor at Arizona State University, said he understands why Pelkeys family did it. But he warned the use of this technology could open the door to more people trying to introduce AI-generated evidence into courtrooms. Theres a real concern among the judiciary and among lawyers that deepfake evidence will be increasingly used, he said. Its easy to create it and anyone can do it on a phone, and it could be incredibly influential because judges and juries, just like all of us, are used to believing what you see. Marchant pointed to a recent case in New York, where a man without a lawyer used an AI-generated avatar to argue his case in a lawsuit via video. It took only seconds for the judges to realize that the man addressing them from the video screen didnt exist at all. In the Arizona case, Wales said the AI-generated video worked because the judge had nearly 50 letters from family and friends that echoed the videos message. Everybody knew that Chris would forgive this person, Wales said. ___ Yamat reported from Las Vegas.

Fighter jet goes overboard from USS Harry S Truman. Yemens Houthis assess Sanaa airport damage,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  An F/A-18 fighter jet landing on the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea went overboard, forcing its two pilots to eject, a defense official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The incident Tuesday marks the latest mishap to mar the deployment of the Truman, which has been essential in the airstrike campaign by the United States against Yemens Houthi rebels.  On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump and Omans foreign minister both said that a ceasefire had been reached with the Houthis, who would no longer target ships in the Red Sea corridor.  A Houthi spokesman early Thursday sought to portray the ceasefire as a victory for the rebels, describing it as America stopping aggression in exchange for stopping attacks. The rebels claimed a drone attack on Israel on Wednesday, something acknowledged by the Israeli military without it being attributed to the rebels. It is ridiculous for Washington to claim that Sanaa raised the flag of surrender, but this is not important, Hashem Sharaf al-Din said in a statement carried by the state-run SABA news agency. What is important is that Yemens victory represented a major shift in the balance of power in favor of Yemen, which was able to force America to halt its aggression and stop its attacks. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, said he expects the Houthis in Yemen to uphold their commitment to stop firing on cargo vessels in the Red Sea. 
        
     Hopefully thats over with, and theyll leave those ships alone, he said. We take their word for it. Meanwhile, the Houthis continue to assess the damage after daytime Israeli airstrikes targeted Yemens rebel-held capital of Sanaa.  The F/A-18 Super Hornet landed on the Truman after a flight, but the arrestment failed, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to speak publicly about the incident now under investigation. Arrestment refers to the hook system used by aircraft landing on carriers, which catches steel wire ropes on the flight deck. It remains unclear what part of the system failed. The two pilots on board were later rescued by a helicopter and suffered minor injuries in the incident, the official added. No one on the flight deck was hurt. CNN first reported on the incident.  Tuesdays incident was the latest to see the Navy lose an F/A-18, which cost about $60 million. In April, another F/A-18 fighter jet slipped off the hangar deck of the Truman and fell into the Red Sea. The crew members who were in the pilot seat of the Super Hornet and on the small towing tractor both jumped away.  In December, the guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 after ships earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Both aviators in that incident also survived. And in February, the Truman collided with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt. The Truman, based out of Norfolk, Virginia, has seen its deployment extended multiple times amid the Houthi airstrike campaign. It had been joined recently by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier operating out of the Arabian Sea.  Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell wrote on the social platform X that an investigation was underway and that this aircraft was not struck by the Houthis. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group remains fully mission-capable, he added. The Israeli attack on Tuesday that targeted Sanaa International Airport devastated the airfield. Khaled al-Shaif, the head of the airport, told the Houthis al-Masirah satellite news channel that the Israeli strike destroyed the airports terminal and left craters in its runway.  Satellite images from Maxar Technologies showed craters and destroyed aircraft on the taxiways of the airfield.  At least six passenger planes were struck, including three belonging to Yemenia Airways, the countrys flag-carrying airline, he said. That leaves the airline with only one functional aircraft, which was spared only because it had left earlier in the day on a flight to Amman, Jordan. He put overall damage there at $500 million. With the damage, the airport was now out of service, al-Shaif said.  The International Committee of the Red Cross said the strikes on the airport, as well as earlier Israeli strikes on Hodeidas seaport, affected vital gateways for humanitarian aid and basic essentials such as food and medical supplies. After more than a decade of conflict in Yemen, civilians and the infrastructure they rely on cannot endure any further strain, it added. The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the groups leadership has described as an effort to end Israels offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually. The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. Meanwhile, a wider, decadelong war in Yemen between the Houthis and the countrys exiled government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, remains in a statemate.",https://apnews.com/article/uss-harry-truman-fighter-jet-aircraft-carrier-pilots-eject-0c3f39a4a08d013a428f5f7559c16413,business
Sothebys postpones auction of jewels associated with Buddha after backlash from Indias government,"HONG KONG (AP)  Sothebys on Wednesday postponed an auction of jewels associated with Buddhas remains after the Indian government opposed the sale and demanded it be halted. The gems for auction were found buried together in reliquaries with the corporeal relics of the historical Buddha and discovered in northern India in 1898, the auction house said. They dated back to around 240-200 BC, it said.  But Indias Ministry of Culture said in a Facebook post on Tuesday it had issued a legal notice to Sothebys Hong Kong to demand the immediate halt of the sale, accusing the auction of violating Indian laws, international norms and UN conventions. In its letter to Sothebys Hong Kong dated Monday, posted on Facebook, it said the auction involves sacred Buddhist relics that constitute the inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community. It demanded the repatriation of the relics to the Indian government and a public apology from the auction house and Chris Pepp. Pepp is a great-grandson of British William Pepp, who excavated the relics.  The Indian government warned in the letter that failure to comply would result in legal actions and public advocacy campaigns highlighting the auction houses role in perpetuating colonial injustice and becoming a party to unethical sale of religious relics.  Sothebys announced the postponement in a statement on Wednesday, acknowledging the matters raised by the Indian government and saying it was done with the agreement of the consignors.  
        
     This will allow for discussions between the parties, and we look forward to sharing any updates as appropriate, it said.  Some of Sothebys webpages about the auction were no longer available on Wednesday.  The Indian Ministry of Culture said on Facebook on Wednesday it was pleased to inform that the auction was postponed after its intervention.",https://apnews.com/article/southebys-auction-india-hong-kong-postpone-buddha-bc8e57a840347b577e81afb717ecc16b,business
Automaker owned by Taiwans Foxconn to make EVs for Japans Mitsubishi Motors,"Foxtron, an automaker partly owned by Taiwan iPhone manufacturer Hon Hai Technology Group, and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan said Wednesday they have agreed to develop an electric vehicle to be sold in Australia and New Zealand.  Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, is one of a growing number of technology companies that are leveraging their knowhow in electronics and communications to try to break into the EV market, snapping up links in the automotive supply chain.  Foxtron is a joint venture between Hon Hai and Taiwans Yulon Motor Co. Yulon makes Nissan vehicles under license.  There was speculation earlier this year, when talks on a possible merger between Nissan and Honda Motor Corp. fell through, that Hon Hai might make a bid for Mitsubishis alliance partner Nissan Motor Co.  The two companies said Wednesday that the EV developed by Foxtron will be produced by Yulon and introduced in Oceania in the second half of 2026.  Foxtron and Mitsubishi Motors gave no financial details and said their memorandum of understanding would be followed by further talks.  Japanese automakers like Mitsubishi have been stepping up efforts to compete in the EV segment as they contend with intense competition from their Chinese rivals. Mitsubishi has set a target for having all of its product lineup be EVs or hybrids by 2035.  Foxtron showcased its Model B, a sleek EV hatchback, and its automotive electronics at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. Foxconn lists 11 vehicle models on its website, including its Model T bus, Model V pickup truck, Model N van, its Model B, and its luxury flagship Model E sedan.",https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-hon-ev-mitsubishi-japan-cea083c0c1ad944a792317963a62820d,business
Merz stresses European unity and defense during his first trip as German chancellor,"BERLIN (AP)  Friedrich Merz plunged straight into international crises on his first full day as Germanys new chancellor Wednesday, presenting a united front with France against U.S. President Donald Trumps trade war, demanding more aid for Gaza and announcing he soon would visit Ukraine. Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron  firm believers in the European Union and leaders of the continents largest economies  used their first meeting since the German leaders appointment Tuesday to show unity on Ukraine and other issues causing alarm in Europe. They vowed to strengthen the continents security and increase defense spending. The tandem of Germany and France has long underpinned the 27-nation bloc, but lost some of its vigor in recent months as leaders in both countries wrestled with domestic issues. In a joint news conference, Merz acknowledged that Europe still needs the U.S. for peace in Ukraine. It is our firm conviction that we cannot end this war in Ukraine without further political and military engagement by the United States of America, he said. The Europeans cannot replace this at present. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports a long, stressful day in Germany politics ends with a new chancellor. Both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been exerting pressure on the EU, forcing it to rethink its own security. It was not clear when Merz would visit Ukraine. Macron said that France and Germany will accelerate defense cooperation, including jointly developing new defense technologies necessary for the wars of tomorrow. He listed working together on tanks, long-range missiles and combat aircraft. He also said that the countries would start regular meetings of a French-German defense council. 
        
     Merz also visited Poland on Wednesday and addressed his new governments plans to station more police at Germanys border to curb illegal migration and even turn away some asylum-seekers. If we, everybody together in the European Union, give the signal to those who are setting out for Europe without valid opportunities for entry, if we give this signal especially to the traffickers, that these routes are going to get a lot more difficult and that we are going to close them, then that is a joint and good signal, Merz said during a joint news conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Merz and Macron also demanded that Israel allow humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza. Israel cut off all aid to the territory over two months ago to try to pressure the Hamas militant group. Israel is preparing to ramp up its campaign against Hamas in a devastating war now entering its 20th month. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Israels offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, who dont distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count. Merz urged Israel to be more responsible  striking comments given Germanys past and present support for Israel. Macron said that France couldnt, on the one hand, defend Ukrainians sovereign and territorial rights while ignoring the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, saying: We cannot have double standards. Both men sought stability between India and Pakistan, saying they view the latest exchange of fire between these two nuclear powers with the utmost concern. India fired missiles into Pakistani-controlled territory early Wednesday, killing at least 31 people in what Pakistans leader called an act of war. India said it struck infrastructure used by militants linked to last months massacre of tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. The German leaders trip to Paris came the day after his historic defeat in the first round of voting in the German parliament. No other postwar candidate for chancellor has failed to win on the first ballot. He won in the second. Traditionally, newly elected chancellors make a point of visiting their big neighbors in the west and east on the first day in office to stress European unity. Merzs Paris stop showed that the new chancellor was plunging into world affairs, sending a message that Germany is back after his predecessors more timid approach. Macron touted their meeting as a new page in the French-German partnership. In particular, France is looking for German backing for increased EU defense spending in the face of Russias threat as well as concerns that Trump is pivoting from its post-World War II relationship with Europe to focus on countering China. The French president also said France and Germany would act hand in hand in the face of Trumps tariffs and work for a united European response and a balanced outcome that respects our interests. The stops in Paris and Warsaw occurred on the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germanys unconditional surrender in World War II. The meeting with Macron was particularly loaded with symbolism for the two countries that were bitter enemies in World War I and II. The first war ended with an armistice agreement signed in a railway car north of Paris. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler then used that railway car in accepting Frances capitulation in 1940, after its defenses succumbed to the German invasion. German-French friendship is a gift, a gift of forgiveness and reconciliation, especially for us Germans, Merz said. Polands leader re-affirmed his support for a strengthened European defense, which would include a stronger German military. It is not easy, considering history, to say out loud, as a Polish prime minister, that I would very much like Germany to arm itself faster and more intensively, Tusk said. Armed Germany in Poland is not a popular slogan, but fortunately today we live in times when there is a different Germany, a different Poland, different threats. ___ Leicester reported from Paris.

South Korea remains confident about $18b nuclear deal put on hold by Czech court,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  South Korean officials on Wednesday downplayed a Czech courts decision to put on hold an $18 billion project for South Korea to build two nuclear reactors in the country, describing it as a temporary setback and expressing confidence that the deal will eventually proceed. A South Korean consortium led by the state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power had expected to finalize the deal this week with a subsidiary of CEZ, the Czech Republics largest electricity supplier. However, a Czech court blocked CEZ from signing the contract while it reviews a complaint from French company EDF, which lost the bid to the South Koreans. South Korean Industry Minister Ahn Dukgeun told reporters in Prague that the courts decision would only delay the signing of the official contract, and that all other procedures would proceed on schedule, assuming that the deal goes through. He said that the Czech government clearly didnt anticipate the courts decision to pause the agreement, and that CEZ plans to appeal. It is not clear when the Czech Supreme Administrative Court could rule on that appeal. The Czech government did not think of (EDFs claims) as a major problem and invited us for the scheduled signing ceremony, Ahn said. It seems that the Czech governments judgement did not align with the courts ruling. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Wednesday his government respects the courts decision, before adding: I believe that the judges and the court realize how important this decision is and its impact on security of the Czech Republic and our national interests.  
        
     Lee Ju-Ho, South Koreas acting president, said that Seoul would communicate closely with the Czech side to ensure that the deal is finalized quickly.  In July, CEZ selected KHNP over EDF as the preferred bidder to build two 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactors at the Dukovany plant. EDF filed a court complaint last week after the Czech Republics competition regulator rejected its appeal over the bidding process. Before he was ousted last month over an ill-fated martial law imposition in December, former conservative South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol had pledged to boost the countrys nuclear power exports, arguing that they had suffered under the previous liberal governments push to reduce domestic reliance on nuclear energy. Yoons government had set a goal of exporting 10 nuclear power reactors by 2030.",https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-czech-nuclear-power-deal-court-e88fef0f634c1ad2e40bff6705bf3f5a,business
Slovakias leader rejects an EU plan to halt Russian natural gas imports by the end of 2027,"BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP)  Slovakias populist leader on Wednesday blasted a European Union plan to halt imports of Russian natural gas by the end of 2027 to deprive President Vladimir Putin of revenue that helps fuel the war in Ukraine. The European Commission, the blocs executive branch, will present a detailed plan next month. It will seek to ban new gas contracts with Russia by the end of this year and phase out existing ones still in use in the 27-nation EU by the end of 2027. Slovakias Prime Minister Robert Fico said the plan is absolutely unacceptable for his country and that his government was ready to veto it. He said the move would be harmful for Slovakia and the entire EU, because the price of gas will increase as a result.  Slovakia has a gas delivery deal with Russia that expires in 2034, and Fico said that he would seek compensations for damages, if the plan proceeds. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is pressing ahead with the plan, told EU lawmakers that Russia has proven time and again that it is not a reliable energy supplier. Dependency on Russia is not only bad for our security, but also for our economy. Our energy prices cannot be dictated by a hostile neighbor, she told members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Fico also rejected a proposal to halt imports of oil and nuclear fuel from Russia to the European Union.  
        
     Hungary and Slovakia  whose leaders are considered to be Putins closest allies in Europe  have blocked EU military assistance to Ukraine and have been expected to oppose the European Commissions gas plans. Fico, a divisive figure at home and abroad, returned to power in 2003 after his leftist Smer (Direction) party won a parliamentary election on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform. Known for his pro-Russia views, he has openly challenged the EUs policies over Ukraine. He is set to become the only EU leader to travel to Moscow for festivities on Friday marking the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. It will be his second trip to Moscow since December. His government has faced vocal protests against its pro-Russian stance and other policies.",https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-fico-eu-plan-halt-russian-gas-aa37148e4b4461b9d30fa826387be02a,business

The same applies to electric power  the best-value electric performers cost more. But the vehicles listed here have other distinct advantages. All of the following prices include destination fees. Theres some irony in the first vehicle in a list of budget-performance cars not being a car at all. But Dodges Hornet isnt your usual small SUV. First off, it has an Italian heritage. Though you wouldnt know it by its styling, the Hornet shares much of its mechanical design with the Alfa Romeo Tonale small luxury SUV. Second, its genuinely powerful for a pint-size SUV. The GT version has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that cranks out 268 horsepower and is good enough to get you from 0 to 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. Another bonus: It has standard all-wheel drive for all-season driving and more cargo space than the typical performance car. 2025 Hornet starting price: $31,590 A Ford Mustang GT with its rumbly V8 is well beyond our $35,000 price cap. But the less expensive Ford Mustang EcoBoost is a viable substitute. Having a turbocharged four-cylinder under the hood might seem like heresy, but you cant argue with the output of 315 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. With its 10-speed automatic spinning the rear wheels, the Mustang EcoBoost can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in a quick 5.6 seconds. The newest Mustang provides a classic American driving experience while being comfortable, stylish and well equipped with the latest technology features.  2025 Mustang coupe starting price: $33,515 Youre as likely to see a Mazda MX-5 Miata roadster in the hands of a cool-headed retiree on lonesome canyon roads as you are spotting one ripping through cones at an autocross. In both cases, the Miatas appeal comes down to the fun-to-drive fundamentals. A four-cylinder engine directs 181 horsepower to the rear wheels through either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Thats not much, but you dont need much when the car is as light as the Miata. A manual-equipped Miata went from 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds at the Edmunds test track. Beyond the numbers, the Miata is all about playfulness. Quick steering, nimble handling and an easy-to-lower top combine to make any drive worthwhile. 2025 MX-5 Miata starting price: $30,715  The Subaru BRZ and Toyota 86 are mechanically related. Both use a four-cylinder rated at 228 horsepower that sends its power to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Edmunds found these cars can sprint to 60 mph in about 6 seconds when equipped with the manual. Theres enough power to be entertaining but not enough to get a new driver in too much trouble, making these fantastic beginners sports cars. And theres a low center of gravity and classic rear-wheel-drive balance to help drivers enjoyably learn about car control. But the Toyabaru twins dont stop being fun once you master them.  2025 Toyota GR86 starting price: $31,135; 2025 Subaru BRZ starting price: $32,380 The Volkswagen GTI is the quintessential budget performance hatchback. Its fun and engaging to drive yet practical and comfortable day to day. Few cars can do as many things as well as the GTI. Its turbocharged four-cylinder engine produces 241 horsepower. For 2025, every GTI has a seven-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Edmunds has found its good for a 5.9-second 0-60 mph sprint. Besides performance, the GTI has a spacious cabin and a generous cargo area for its size. The original hot hatch that traces its American lineage all the way back to 1983 is a solid performance value. Starting manufacturers suggested retail price: $33,640 Spending less than $35,000 can get you a fun vehicle to drive in 2025. Each model here has distinct advantages. Youll likely prefer the Hornet or Golf GTI if space and practicality are priorities. The Miata, BRZ and GR86 all provide a great feel and connection to the road; picking one of these comes down to whether you want a convertible top or the extra security of a coupe. The Mustang cant be beat for its classic pony car styling and heritage.  ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

Disney parks thrive in second quarter and company adds 1.4 million new streaming subscribers,"Disney posted solid profits and revenue in the second quarter as its domestic theme parks thrived and the company added well over a million subscribers to its streaming service.  The company also boosted its profit expectations for the year, sending shares up 11% Wednesday.  Disney also announced that it will build a seventh theme park in Abu Dhabi.  For the three months ended March 30, Disney earned $3.28 billion, or $1.81 per share. The Burbank, California, company lost $20 million, or a penny per share, a year earlier. Removing one time charges or benefits, earnings were $1.45 per share, easily topping the $1.18 that Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.  Revenue rose 7% to $23.62 billion, also topping projections.  Revenue for Disney Entertainment, which includes the companys movie studios and streaming service, climbed 9%, while revenue for the Experiences division, its parks, increased 6%.  Recent box office hits include Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Its latest film, Thunderbolts(asterisk), is currently sitting atop the box office. CEO Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said in prepared remarks that theyre confident in this years movie slate, which includes Lilo & Stitch, The Fantastic Four: First Steps and Avatar: Fire and Ash. Disney, however, faces potential ramifications from the trade war launched by President Donald Trump. Other U.S. corporations have noted blowback by consumers in overseas markets and on Monday, Trump opened a new salvo in his tariff war, targeting films made outside the U.S. 
        
     Trump on Monday said that he had he authorized a 100% tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. Disney is already under scrutiny by the Trump administration. In March the head of the Federal Communications Commission said that he was opening an investigation into Disney and its ABC television network to determine if they are promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination. As of now, Disneys streaming business continues to grow. Its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, posted quarterly operating income of $336 million compared with $47 million in the prior-year period. Revenue increased 8%. The Disney+ streaming service had a 2% increase in paid subscribers domestically, which includes the U.S. and Canada. There was a 1% rise internationally, which excludes Disney+ HotStar.  Total paid subscribers for Disney+ edged up 1% in the quarter to surprising 126 million subscribers, from 124.6 million in the first quarter. The Walt Disney Co. previously said that it expected a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter when compared with the first three months of the year. Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions totaled 180.7 million, up 2.5 million from the first quarter.  A perfect cocktail of content helped Disney deliver a better than expected quarter as the companys streaming business continues to grow profitability, Mike Proulx, Forrester vice president and research director said in an email. As Disney eyes investments in local international content, it could be a sign that its trying to more directly take on Netflix which is known for its strong international slate.  Disney has benefited doubly from success at the box office as those productions become content for its growing streaming service.  Moana 2"" has more than 139 million hours streaming since hitting Disney+ on March 12, making it the biggest Walt Disney Animation Studios premiere on the platform since Encanto, Iger and Johnston said. The first Moana film remains the most watched movie on Disney+ with more than 1.4 billion hours streamed.  The Moana franchise also drives traffic at Disneys properties, with character meet and greets at theme parks and on cruise ships and the Journey of Water at Epcot at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.  The Experiences division, which includes Disneys six global theme parks, its cruise line, merchandise and videogame licensing, reported operating income rose 9% to $2.5 billion. Operating income climbed 13% at domestic parks. Operating income dropped 23% for international parks and Experiences, due to softness at its Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks. While Disney continues to pull levers to successfully manage all of the different components of its business, it also continues to work on its search for a successor to Iger, the face of Disney for most of the past two decades.  Disney created a succession planning committee in 2023, but the search began in earnest last year when the company enlisted Morgan Stanley Executive Chairman James Gorman to lead the effort. Disney does have some time, as Iger agreed to a contract extension that keeps him at the company through the end of 2026. Disney is looking at internal and external candidates. The internal candidates are widely believed to include the chairman of Disney-owned ESPN, Jimmy Pitaro, Chairperson of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Josh DAmaro, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden. Disney is projecting full-year adjusted earnings of $5.75 per share, which is better than the $5.43 per share that analysts polled by FactSet are looking for. The companys previous guidance was for high-single digit adjusted earnings per share growth for fiscal 2025.",https://apnews.com/article/disney-iger-hulu-trump-12a484b389359d746c703898d71697c3,business
Czech central bank cuts key interest rate to 3.5% as inflation drops more than expected,"PRAGUE (AP)  The Czech Republics central bank cut its key interest rate again on Wednesday, with lower-than-expected inflation. The cut brought the interest rate down by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.50%. The bank had kept the rate unchanged at its previous policy meeting in March. Analysts predicted the cut was likely, but also said the uncertainty over the tariff policies of U.S. President Donald Trump was an argument in favor of no change. The bank started to trim borrowing costs by a quarter-point on Dec. 21, 2023, to boost the economy, and further cut rates by half or a quarter of a percentage point several times last year. Inflation dropped to 1.8% year-on-year in April, the lowest level in seven years, preliminary data by the Czech Statistics Office indicated on Tuesday. It was 2.7% year-on-year in March. The size of the Czech economy was up 1% in 2024 compared with the previous year. The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 20 countries that use the euro currency, lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25% on April 17 for the seventh time. The U.S. Federal Reserve was expected to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% later on Wednesday, despite weeks of harsh criticism and demands from Trump that the Fed reduce borrowing costs.",https://apnews.com/article/czech-central-bank-rates-50a3e17d19df95c65f8e6ee8f631debd,business
Less farmland is going for organic crops as costs and other issues take root,"SKANEATELES, N.Y. (AP)  Farmer Jeremy Brown taps the nose of a young calf. I love the ones with the pink noses, he says. This pink-nosed animal is just one of about 3,200 cattle at Twin Birch Dairy in Skaneateles, New York. In Browns eyes, the cows on the farm arent just workers: Theyre the boss, theyre the queen of the barn. Brown, a co-owner at Twin Birch, is outspoken on the importance of sustainability in his operation. The average dairy cow emits as much as 265 pounds (120 kilograms) of methane, a potent climate-warming gas, each year. Brown says Twin Birch has worked hard to cut its planet-warming emissions through a number of environmentally sound choices. Ruminants are the solution, not the problem, to climate change, he said.

He stepped over an electric manure scraper used to clean the animals barn.  
        
     The electric scraper means the dairy doesnt have to use a fuel-burning machine for that particular job. Twin Birch also recycles manure for use on crops, cools its milk with water that gets recirculated for cows to drink and grows most of its own feed.

(Caitlyn Daproza via AP) Despite all that, the farm has no desire to pursue a U.S. Department of Agriculture organic certification, Brown said. Doing so would add costs and require the farm to forego technology that makes the dairy business, and ultimately the customers jug of milk, more affordable, he said. He raises a question many farmers have been asking: Is organic farming just a word?  An increasing number of American farmers think so. Americas certified organic acreage fell almost 11% between 2019 and 2021. Numerous farmers who implement sustainable practices told The Associated Press that they have stayed away from the certification because its costly, doesnt do enough to combat climate change and appears to be losing cachet in the marketplace. Converting an existing farm from conventional to organic agriculture can cost tens of thousands of dollars and add labor costs. The rules governing the National Organic Program were published in 2000, and in the years after, organic farming boomed to eventually reach more than 5 million acres. But that has been declining in recent years. Any downward trend is significant, as organic farms make up less than 1% of the countrys total acreage, and organic sales are typically only a tiny share of the nationwide total.  Shannon Ratcliff, a farmer and co-owner of organically certified Shannon Brook Farms in Watkins Glen, New York, attributes the decline to a 2018 fraud case in Iowa involving a farmer selling grain mislabeled as certified organic. The whole thing went crazy  work requirements for farmers ramped up and inspection levels were higher, she said. Its also just a tough business, Ratcliff said.

(Caitlyn Daproza via AP) Frank Mitloehner, a professor in animal science in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at University of California Davis, said lack of flexibility and efficiency are driving farmers away from organic in an era of rising prices for farmers. He said organic standards need to be overhauled or the marketplace risks organic going away completely. I am in awe that so many organic farmers were able to produce that way for that long, he said. It seems that they are losing consumer base in these financially troubling times.  Still, there are consumers determined to buy organic. Aaron Swindle, a warehouse employee at a chain supermarket, spends every Sunday morning shopping for organic groceries at the Brighton Farmers Market. The taste quality is different when its growing nearby, Swindle said. He calls the Finger Lakes of New York a trifecta, a region that contributes dairy, produce, and meat for its residents. John Bolton, owner of Bolton Farms in Hilton, New York, said he has some reservations about organic certification, but hes pursuing it for his hydroponic farm, which grows produce in nutrient-rich water instead of soil. It produces greens such as kale and chard and is popular as a supplier for restaurants in western New York, and draws waves of regular customers at the Rochester Public Market on weekends. Bolton doesnt use pesticides. On a chilly day this spring, he was at his greenhouse unloading 1,500 ladybugs to do the work of eliminating the operations aphids. Thats the kind of practice organic farms use to earn the certification, he said. Bolton Farms owner John Bolton looks up as he works at the hydroponic farm Friday, March 21, 2025, in Hilton, N.Y.

"Disney to build its 7th theme park, this one in the United Arab Emirates","Disney will build its seventh theme park, this one in the United Arab Emirates, the entertainment company said Wednesday.  The waterfront resort will be built on Yas Island on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, already home to Formula Ones Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the Ferrari and Warner Bros. amusement parks, SeaWorld and a waterpark.  Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Home to 9 million people, it has leveraged its long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways to bring in more tourists over the years. A real-estate boom and the citys highest-ever tourism numbers have made Dubai a destination as well as a layover.  Disney and Miral, the Abu Dhabi developer overseeing the project, hope to capitalize on the 120 million airline passengers that travel through Abu Dhabi and Dubai each year.  While long viewed as more buttoned up than the beaches and raucous nightlife in neighboring Dubai, Abu Dhabi also is home to the Louvre Abu Dhabi and there are more museums currently under construction. The theme park announcement is being made ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the region next week. Trump has promised a series of business deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE. The theme park will be built and operated by Miral, but Disney will handle the design and development. Disney will also license its intellectual property and provide development and management services, according to a regulatory filing.  
        
     The California company will not be providing any capital for the project. It will earn royalties based on the resorts revenues. It will also earn service fees. Miral has been involved in the development of almost all of the entertainment complexes built on the island.  A projected opening date has not been announced. Shares of Disney, which also reported second-quarter financial results on Wednesday that beat Wall Streets expectations, jumped more than 9% in morning trading.",https://apnews.com/article/disney-abu-dhabi-miral-yas-uae-trump-831fe2e23068b5d487765c53a7d52e63,business
Moderna study shows immune response in older adults for a combo flu and COVID-19 shot,"A combination shot for flu and COVID-19 using messenger RNA generated antibodies in a study, but U.S. government regulators want to see data on whether the new vaccine protects people from getting sick. Researchers from vaccine-maker Moderna reported in a study published Wednesday that the new combo shot generated a stronger immune response against COVID-19 and most strains of flu than existing standalone shots in people 50 and older. Side effects were injection site pain, fatigue and headaches. Moderna previously reported a summary of the results from the company-sponsored trial in 8,000 people. The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. Moderna believes mRNA could speed up production of flu shots compared with traditional processes that use chicken eggs or giant vats of cells. A combo shot also might improve vaccination rates, the researchers wrote in the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. Greg Poland, who studies vaccine response at Mayo Clinic and was not involved in the new study, said hes not convinced that a combo shot would be popular. And while flu comes in seasonal waves, COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the year, Poland said, posing challenges for how to time the shots to keep protection strong. Hed also like to see data on how well the new shot protected people from infection and hospitalization. 
        
     The findings are based on measuring antibodies in participants blood after 29 days, an indication of short-term disease protection.  Last week, Moderna pushed its target date for the vaccines approval to 2026 after the Food and Drug Administration requested a more direct measure: how much the shot lowered the risk of disease. I agree in this case with FDA that efficacy data are important to see, Poland said. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cast doubt on the safety of mRNA vaccines, but Moderna President Stephen Hoge told investors in an earnings call last week that talks with the FDA were productive and business as usual. Also last week, Novavax said the FDA was asking the company to run a new clinical trial of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine after the agency grants full approval, sowing uncertainty about other vaccine updates. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Feds vow to overhaul US air traffic control system while fixing problems at troubled Newark airport,"A deadly midair collision in January between a military helicopter and a commercial airliner, several additional crashes and technical problems that resulted in mass cancellations at New Jerseys biggest airport have prompted officials to pledge a fix for the nations outdated air traffic control system and vow to hire more controllers. Doing so, they say, would help ensure safety and prevent the kind of problems that have plagued the Newark, New Jersey, airport since its radar system briefly failed last week.  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to unveil a multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nations air traffic control system Thursday, while the Federal Aviation Administration works to quickly solve technology and staffing problems in Newark and avoid similar crisis elsewhere. Amid turmoil, one thing seems clear: An aging system struggles to handle the nations more than 45,000 daily flights. Its uncertain whether Duffys plan that President Donald Trump supports will get the necessary congressional funding to be more effective than previous reform efforts during the last three decades. But Duffy says its necessary. Already more than $14 billion has been invested in upgrades since 2003 but none have dramatically changed how the system works. We are on it. We are going to fix it. We are going to build a brand new system for all of you and your families and the American people, Duffy said. 
        
     But details are scant. Its unclear whether the plan will involve privatizing the air traffic control system as Trump backed in his first term. Duffy has not highlighted that possibility. Thursdays announcement is expected to attract dozens of unions, which would likely oppose privatization, along with trade groups, industry representatives and family members of victims of the January crash. For years, the system has operated well enough to be largely neglected by every administration, said University of Illinois professor Sheldon Jacobson, who has studied risks in aviation. But well enough isnt good enough when it comes to air travel because peoples lives are at risk. Jacobson is skeptical Duffys proposal will succeed. But there could be renewed support following the collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter over Washington D.C. in January, and a plane that flipped and caught fire in Toronto. The weaknesses of the nations air traffic control system have for years been highlighted in reports and hearings. Most recently, a Government Accountability Office review released in March declared that 51 of the FAAs 138 systems were considered unsustainable and another 54 were potentially unsustainable. A 2023 outage in FAAs Notice to Airmen system forced the grounding of every flight nationwide for more than two hours.  Were dealing with an outmoded system and we have an outdated infrastructure, said former Continental Airlines CEO Frank Lorenzo, who helped establish a major hub in Newark that United Airlines still maintains years after acquiring Continental. We havent really given it the attention that it requires. The president of National Air Traffic Controllers Association told Congress that the majority of the FAAs telecommunications infrastructure at more than 4,600 sites relies at least in part on aging copper wires, instead of more reliable fiber optic lines that can handle more data. Unexpected outages related to those lines routinely cause ground stops at airports and appear to have led to the problems in Newark. The radar system air traffic controllers in Philadelphia use to direct planes in and out of the Newark airport went offline for at least 30 seconds on April 28. That facility relies on radar data sent over lines from New York that may have failed, some of which are old copper phone lines. The FAA relies on those lines because Newark controllers were moved from New York to Philadelphia last summer to address staffing issues. The FAA said Wednesday it plans to replace any old copper wires with fiber optics and add three new data lines between New York and Philadelphia. The agency is also working to get additional controllers trained and certified. It wasnt immediately clear how long either step will take, but Duffy has said he hopes the situation in Newark will improve by summer, which is when an ongoing runway construction project is scheduled for completion. Several controllers remain on extended trauma leave after the radar outage, which worsened staff shortages in Philadelphia. In response, the FAA has slowed traffic in and out of Newark to ensure flights can be handled safely, leading to cancellations. Duffy also said FAA will meet with all airlines to determine how many flights the airport can handle. On Wednesday, Newark led the nation with 42 canceled departures and 46 canceled arrivals, according to FlightAware.com. Thats even after United cut 35 daily flights at the airport starting last weekend. The FAA has made incremental improvements as part of its Nextgen program that was established in 2003. Advancements include development of the ADS-B system that provides more precise aircraft locations to controllers and other planes. That system has been a focal point of the investigation of the January crash because the Black Hawk helicopter was not using it to broadcast its location at the time of the collision. Duffy has also tried to supercharge air traffic controller hiring by shortening the time it takes to get into the academy and improving student success rates. The FAA is also offering bonuses to experienced controllers to discourage early retirement. A major challenge to upgrading the aviation infrastructure is that the FAA must keep the current system operating while developing a new system  and then find a way to seamlessly switch over. Thats partly why the agency has pursued more gradual improvements in the past. The problem has existed for decades. Its not because of neglect, but because its a hard problem to solve, said Jeff Guzetti, who is a former accident investigator who also worked in the Transportation Departments Inspector Generals office for several years that was focused on aviation. And it requires money and good management. And the FAA has been has had shortages of both money and in some cases good management for years.",https://apnews.com/article/aviation-safety-crash-newark-air-traffic-control-8c529cd72fab0bcb42ba286682553d6e,business
"The more Trump talks about making trade deals, the more confusing the tariff picture gets","WASHINGTON (AP)  The more President Donald Trump talks about his efforts to reach deals with Americas trading partners, the more confusing the tariff picture gets. His team seems good with that, saying Trump is using strategic uncertainty to his advantage. Trump says the United States does not have to sign any agreements, and that it could sign 25 of them right now. He says he is looking for fair deals on all sides, and that he does not care about other countries markets. He says his team can sit down to negotiate the terms of a deal, and that he might just impose a set of tariffs on his own. I am struggling to make sense of it, Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in an email. Late Wednesday on his social media site, Trump wrote that hell be holding a news conference Thursday morning concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. He added that it would be THE FIRST OF MANY!!! Although Trumps team holds up his best-selling book The Art of the Deal as proof that he has a master plan, much of the world is on tenterhooks. That has meant a volatile stock market, hiring freezes and all kinds of uncertainty even as Trump continues to promise that new factories and jobs are on the horizon. A look at how the trade talks may play out:  
        
     As part of any deal, Trump wants to keep some of his tariffs in place. He believes the import taxes can generate massive revenues for a heavily indebted federal government even though other countries see the whole point of striking a deal as getting rid of tariffs. Theyre a beautiful thing for us, Trump said recently about tariffs. If you can use them, if you can get away with using them, its going to make us very rich. And well be paying off debt, well be lowering your taxes very substantially because so much money will be taken in that well be able to lower your taxes even beyond the tax cut that youre going to be getting. So far this year, the U.S. government has collected $45.9 billion from tariffs, about $14.5 billion more than last year, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Those revenues could escalate sharply given the 10% baseline tariffs, the 145% rate being charged on Chinese goods and rates as high as 25% on steel, aluminum, auto and Mexican and Canadian imports.

(Adrian Wyld /The Canadian Press via AP) Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump engage in a meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C., Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (Adrian Wyld /The Canadian Press via AP) To reach Trumps stated goals of repaying the $36 trillion debt and reducing income taxes, his tariffs would need to raise at least $2 trillion annually without causing the economy to crash in ways that lead to lower overall tax revenues. That would be close to impossible mathematically. The Republican administration has said 17 of its major 18 trading partners have essentially presented them with term sheets, which list the possible compromises that they are prepared to make. Agreeing to a mutual understanding of the terms would be only the start of any trade talks. But foreign leaders have said it is unclear exactly what Trump wants or how deals could be codified into a durable agreement. They also know Trump approved the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2020, only to charge new tariffs on those same two trading partners this year.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP) While meeting with Trump on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney suggested the next version of that agreement would need to be strengthened to prevent a repeat of the fentanyl-related tariffs imposed this year by Trump that Canada saw as arbitrary.  Some things about it are going to have to change, Carney said.  The 145% tariffs on China  and the 125% tariffs on the U.S. that Beijing imposed in response  hang over the entire negotiating process. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledges that those tariffs are not sustainable.  The first talks between the U.S. and China are set to begin this weekend in Switzerland, but they will likely be limited to finding ways to de-escalate tensions enough for meaningful negotiations to take place. The key issue is that China is the worlds dominant manufacturer, which makes also makes it a leading exporter in ways that can supplant domestic industries. Because China suppresses domestic consumption and focuses on production, the rest of the world buys what it makes because there is not enough internal demand. The U.S. wants to rebalance trade, but it has done so also through tariffs on countries that could be its natural allies in defending their auto and tech industries against China. Obviously in this trade puzzle, China is the biggest piece, Bessent said this week. Where do we end up with China? Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian has suggested that a meaningful way for the Trump administration to jump-start talks would be to pull back on its rhetoric and punitive import taxes. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop threatening and pressuring and engage in dialogue with China on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit, Lin said Tuesday.

(Chinatopix Via AP) Containers are pile up at a container terminal in Shanghai, China, Sunday, April 20, 2025. (Chinatopix Via AP) Asked on Wednesday whether he would reduce the tariffs on China as a condition for negotiations, Trump said, No. The president also disputed statements by the Chinese government that his administration sought the talks in Geneva. Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files, Trump said. Not necessarily. Trump unilaterally imposed his universal tariffs without Congress, using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so, which has led to multiple lawsuits. The administration also maintains that any agreements to change the rates would not need congressional approval. Previously, presidents, including Trump in his first term with his Phase One China deal, could negotiate only more limited agreements that have focused on select bilateral trade and tariff issues, according to a Congressional Research Service report updated this April. Other examples of limited deals include a 2023 agreement on critical minerals and a 2020 deal on digital trade with Japan. The challenge is that Trump has also made nontariff barriers such as safety regulations for autos and the value added taxes charged in Europe part of his talks. He wants other countries to change their nontariff policies in exchange for the U.S. reducing the new tariffs he introduced. Other countries, in return, might object to U.S. subsidies to its companies. In theory, it would take House and Senate approval to complete a deal that would address non-tariff barriers and require changes to U.S. law, the Congressional Research Service report said. If other countries fail to satisfy him, Trump has suggested he will just do some kind of internal deals and set a tariff rate, although he technically already did that with his April 2 Liberation Day tariffs. The import taxes announced by Trump then led to a financial market sell-off that caused him to pause some of his new tariffs for 90 days and charge the lower 10% baseline rate while negotiations take place.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) It appears Trump will agree not to impose the originally threatened tariffs if he thinks other countries are making adequate concessions, essentially meaning that the U.S. gives up nothing because the tariffs are new. But Trump might also pull back his tariffs without necessarily getting much in return. Trump is notorious for making maximalist demands and then retreating as negotiations go on, so well see how long he sticks with his formula, said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. But so far it is pretty clear that countries coming in and wanting a normal trade negotiation with both sides making substantive concessions are being rebuffed.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-deals-china-trade-02986c700a2d46c8b1ba85afe77d139f,business
"Energy Star, efficiency program that has steered consumer choice, targeted in cuts","An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said.  The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President Donald Trumps sharp turn away from the prior administrations focus on climate change. The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agencys core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback. The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the programs website says. People recognize it right away, so they would be like oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one, said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said. Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues. Trumps proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPAs entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.  But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said Americas energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time. Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products energy use. The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star. The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the programs website, DOEs role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label.  The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that would meet the administrations goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.  The move is the latest in the Trump administrations broader deregulatory effort. Theyve announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy.  The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances.  Trump targeted Energy Star during his first stint in the White House, but faced backlash. For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an energy emergency, Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency, Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Texas may put restraints on new big businesses hoping to tap into the energy grid,"ODESSA, Texas (AP)  Texas will need a lot more energy in the future. Driven largely by demand from businesses such as data centers and the oil and gas industry, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the states grid operator, predicts the states energy needs will nearly double in six years. State Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford, worries ERCOT is not working with a full picture. He told a legislative panel as much in February. We do not have accurate load forecasting. No one knows if the forecast is real, he said. Large companies, he added, are requiring ERCOT to plan for load growth at dramatically higher levels than experienced ever in the history of Texas, and frankly, ever in the history of the United States. And without credible data, we run the risk of overbuilding, with high costs being passed on to consumers, or underbuilding, further exacerbating scarcity, he said. He believes his legislation, Senate Bill 6, will put restraints on the states open-energy market, and help the grid plan for the future to save rate payers money and avoid another catastrophe when extreme weather strikes again. The bill, which has already won Senate approval and is expected to start its journey in the Texas House Wednesday with a committee hearing, would place more requirements on businesses meant to help ERCOT better forecast the electricity needs. Businesses would also have to pay more in advance of operating. 
        
     While business groups have said they agree the grid needs more security, they believe Kings bill is too heavy-handed. They said some of his proposals wont help ERCOTs planning and put their operations at risk. They want changes to the bill, such as removing language that would grant ERCOT the ability to disconnect power to major energy users during an emergency, and new rules on arrangements between power generators and companies. Michael Jewell, an attorney who has represented large industrial companies on energy issues and policy, said Kings legislation will need to strike a balance between addressing the growth without scaring companies away. This legislation is important to finding that balance, that we can bring these large loads into the ERCOT region, grow the Texas economy, and support the development of this technology, he said. But we also want to be sure that we, as Texans, will continue to have reliable electricity. Kings bill only applies to industrial-sized facilities, or those needing more than 75 Megawatts. Under the bill, businesses wanting to plug into the grid must disclose whether they have similar requests elsewhere in Texas or out of state. Companies must tell ERCOT if their backup generators can meet at least 50% of their power. During an emergency, ERCOT could instruct facilities to use that power, instead of the grid. Another provision allows ERCOT to shut off a facilitys power in an emergency. ERCOT must give the facilities a days notice. Facilities sometimes negotiate directly with power generators, like gas-fired plants, to satisfy their electricity needs without connecting to the grid. The bill gives the Public Utility Commission, which regulates electricity and some water and wastewater, authority over such arrangements, allowing it to approve or reject them, in addition to 180 days of review. Companies would also have to pay an electric, municipal utility or a cooperative at least $100,000 to study the transmission work necessary to transport electricity to their facilities. Companies must also demonstrate that they can afford to contribute to the construction of transmission lines and purchase any equipment or services. The bill also directs the utility commission to determine how to better allocate transmission costs, including looking at peak demand, the point at which supply meets demand. King acknowledged the strain on the states power grid means more businesses are moving to Texas, something he supports. I want to make it very clear that while this load growth is a strain on the ERCOT grid, it is also an excellent opportunity for the state of Texas, King said in February. So long as we manage it properly (and) not create reliability risks or pricing issues for everyday Texans. Groups consisting of the facilities King is targeting said parts of his proposals wont benefit ERCOTs efforts to make the grid reliable or lower prices. Dan Diorio, a government affairs expert for the Data Center Coalition, a national group, said it is supportive of the goals the bill is trying to reach. But in its current form, the group said it has lingering concerns as the bill moves through the House, including a provision requiring companies to disclose information that he said is unnecessary for the grid, such as out-of-state requests for electricity. He said ERCOT can separate serious requests within Texas. This is a highly competitive industry, he said. So not only do we have competitive concerns about that, because this is proprietary information, but how is that going to inform the forecast correctly? He said diesel makes up most backup power generation, and is a fuel overseen by the federal government and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Forcing companies to run emergency generators could lead to air emissions violations and air pollution, Diorio said. Diorio added that the information data centers collect and maintain  including from local and state authorities  could be put at risk when the system shuts down. Proposing to shut off power, even with a notice, could risk public safety, adding that the bill does not offer enough specificity regarding how the shut-off would be implemented. Walt Baum, president of Powering Texans, a group representing natural gas power generators, said the bill imposes administrative requirements on agreements between power companies and facilities. In this case, the company would pay the power generator directly for the needed electricity. Baum said a company could otherwise go directly to the grid, drawing out the same amount of electricity it would have gotten from the generator directly. The amount of energy used would not change. And the impact on the grid is the same, he said. ___ This story was originally published by The Texas Tribune and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",https://apnews.com/us-news/texas-phil-king-general-news-cffb42e58fad37bd67a5187f126ef9a3,business
Missouri poised to become first U.S. state to exempt stock sale profits from income taxes,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP)  Investors who profit from selling stocks, real estate and other assets soon could reap an even larger benefit in Missouri, which is poised to become the first U.S. state to exempt capital gains from its income tax.  Legislation that won final approval Wednesday would halt the capital gains tax this year for individuals and could eventually eliminate it for corporations, if state revenues keep growing. The tax repeal now heads to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has said hes very supportive of it.  Though proponents hope it can spur the economy, detractors assert that the capital gains tax repeal will primarily benefit the rich and result in less tax revenue for public schools and services. The Republican-led Legislature overcame objections by Democrats only after expanding the bill with greater tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and new sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products. Missouris unique income tax carve-out comes as Republican-led legislatures in at least eight other states have passed more traditional income tax rate reductions this year. It also comes as Congress weighs whether to renew and expand income tax breaks enacted during President Donald Trumps first term in office. 
        
     Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency or property. The federal government taxes long-term capital gains, on assets held for more than a year, at a lower rate than ordinary income.  All states that tax income also tax capital gains. Missouri currently is among 32 states and the District of Columbia that tax capital gains at the same rate as wages and other income, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation. Eight states tax capital gains at a lower rate than other income.  
        
     Some Democratic-led states have been moving in the opposite direction. Maryland lawmakers last month passed a bill that would impose a 2% capital gains tax on those with incomes over $350,000. And Washington lawmakers recently passed legislation to impose an extra 2.9% tax on capital gains over $1 million. Minnesota already imposes a surcharge on capital gains and other investment income over $1 million.  Proponents of axing the capital gains tax say the tax discourages investment and incentivizes people to hold onto assets instead of selling them and spending money elsewhere in the economy.  When you tax something you get less of it, said Jonathan Williams, president and chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an association of conservative lawmakers and businesses. The idea is, of course, you want more investment in your state. Though ALEC has long backed the repeal of state capital gains taxes, Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said the idea came to him last year from friends at an employee-owned construction company that was getting hit with the tax. He said his legislation also could benefit family farmers who want to sell their land.  The capital gains tax results in lost economic opportunity, financial sclerosis, lower wages -- all of which serve to make Missouri less competitive both domestically and internationally, said Republican state Sen. Curtis Trent, who handled the bill in the Senate.  Opponents say the wealthy will get the greatest reward.  Repealing Missouris tax on capital gains would set a worrisome precedent nationally and worsen economic and racial inequities, said Sam Waxman, deputy director of state policy research at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  One government study found that white families are more likely to report capital gains than some minorities. Among middle-income taxpayers, about 8% of white families benefited from the federal governments tax rates on capital gains and dividends compared to just 3% of Black families and 1% of Hispanic families, according to a 2023 U.S. Treasury Department report.  In Missouri, about 542,000 individual income taxpayers reported capital gains in 2022, amounting to just one-fifth of all filers, according to the Missouri Budget Project, a nonprofit research group that opposes the capital gains tax repeal. The group estimates that 80% of the tax relief would go to the wealthiest 5% of taxpayers. Legislative researchers estimate Missouris capital gains tax repeal could cost the state about $262 million annually when fully implemented. But thats disputed by both supporters and opponents.  The Missouri Budget Project estimates the cost could be nearly $600 million annually.  Trent predicts the tax repeal will trigger increased economic growth (that) will translate into increased tax revenue over time.  Owen Zidar, an economics and public affairs professor at Princeton University, studied the impacts of 584 capital gains tax rate changes in states over four decades. Capital gains tax cuts tend to result in more people selling assets for gains, but not so much as to offset the lost tax revenue, he said.  Zidar said he is skeptical of claims that Missouris capital gains tax repeal will attract a lot of investment and economic activity. I think its going to be a substantial revenue decrease, he said.",https://apnews.com/article/capital-gains-tax-repeal-missouri-b5a9c79db57b6d10369b2449b98b1b19,business
"US trade deficit hits record high as businesses, consumers try to get ahead of Trump tariffs","NEW YORK (AP)  The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses alike tried to get ahead of President Donald Trumps latest and most sweeping tariffs  with federal data showing an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products. The deficit  which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys  has roughly doubled over the last year. In March 2024, Commerce Department records show, that gap was just under $68.6 billion. According to federal data released on Tuesday, U.S. exports for goods and services totaled about $278.5 billion in March, while imports climbed to nearly $419 billion. Thats up $500 million and $17.8 billion, respectively, from February trade. Consumer goods led the imports surge  increasing by $22.5 billion in March. And pharma products in particular climbed $20.9 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis noted, signaling that drugmakers sought to get ahead of Trumps threats to slap tariffs on the sector. While we had known consumer goods accounted for the bulk of Marchs rise, we can now see pharmaceutical products were $20 billion higher  almost all of which were imported from Ireland, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote in a Tuesday research note. Uncertainty remains high, and broader signs of front-loading may be visible in coming months. Because pharma accounted for so much of this surge, the big rise in imports doesnt necessarily mean other sectors used March to stockpile in the same way. Retailers, for example, may not have bought as many clothes, toys and furniture from abroad  perhaps because they were already feeling the effects of previously-implemented levies, some analysts say, or because they decided to hold off on rushing in new inventory amid uncertainty.  
        
     Either way, this may signal supply challenges down the road  with shoppers potentially seeing barer shelves for products that run out of inventory in the coming months. Still, imports of capital goods, like computers, as well as automotive parts and cars, also increased in March. But industrial supplies and materials, such as metal and crude oil coming into the U.S., fell  notably as steel and aluminum tariffs and other levies impacting energy took effect. And service-based imports like travel also decreased. Overall, imports are flooding into the U.S. for products that have  or rather, are feared to soon be  caught in the crosshairs of the ongoing trade wars. Since taking office in January, Trump has threatened and imposed a series of steep tariffs. Much of March, in particular, was filled with anticipation and uncertainty leading up to what the president called Liberation Day on April 2, when he announced new import taxes on nearly all of Americas trading partners. With the exception of China, higher tariff rates for many countries have since been postponed  but other sweeping levies remain. The White House insists that new tariffs will help close long-standing trade deficits (the U.S. hasnt sold the rest of the world more than its bought since 1975), reinvigorate manufacturing in America and generate government revenue. But economists are warning of significant consequences for businesses, households and economies worldwide under the rates that Trump has proposed.  These new tariffs are already increasing operating costs for businesses that rely on a global supply chain  which, in turn, will hike prices for a range of goods that consumers buy each day.  The recent surge in imports reflects efforts by companies across the country to bring in foreign goods before more duties kicked in. New orders for manufactured durable goods, for example, jumped 9.2% to $315.7 billion in March, Census Bureau data released last month shows. Marchs trade deficit surpasses the last monthly record of $130.7 billion reported in January  also amid tariff uncertainty after Trump took office, marking a more than $32 billion jump from December. All of this contributed to shrinking economic growth in the first three months of the year. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. gross domestic product  or output of goods and services  fell at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March, marking the first drop in three years.  Imports grew at a total 41% pace for that period, its fastest rate since 2020, shaving 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. But that surge is likely to reverse in the second quarter, removing some weight on GDP.",https://apnews.com/article/economy-trump-deficit-imports-4c7e61748f7d17c35dd6eb3091e9a681,business
Trump says the US will stop bombing Yemens Houthis after rebels say theyll stop targeting ships,"WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump said Tuesday that hes ordering a halt to nearly two months of U.S. airstrikes on Yemens Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have indicated that they dont want to fight anymore and have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route.  Were going to stop the bombing of the Houthis, effective immediately, Trump said at the start of his Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.  That likely means an abrupt end to a campaign of airstrikes that began in March, when Trump promised to use overwhelming lethal force after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israels mounting another blockade on the Gaza Strip.  AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Trump says Yemens Houthis will stop fighting, and the U.S. will stop striking them. At the time, they described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. Trump said the Houthis had indicated to U.S. officials that they dont want to fight anymore. They just dont want to fight. And we will honor that, and we will stop the bombings.  His announcement came the same day that Israels military launched airstrikes against the Houthis that it said fully disabled the international airport in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Israels attacks were its second round of airstrikes on targets in Yemen in retaliation for a Houthi missile strike Sunday on Israels international airport. A U.S. official said the administration had not notified Israel of the agreement with the Houthis before Trump talked about it publicly.  
        
     Israel, according to this official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic talks, was irked by the unexpected news  particularly because the Houthis have continued to launch attacks on Israel proper and other Israeli targets. Israel does not appear to be covered by the U.S.-Houthi agreement.  Appearing before reporters again later Tuesday, this time for the swearing-in of senior adviser and special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump was asked about the possibility that the Houthis would continue to attack Israel and responded, I dont know about that, frankly. But I know one thing, they want nothing to do with us, Trump said. And theyve let that be known through all of their surrogates and very strongly. In his comments during the earlier meeting with Carney, Trump said the Houthis had capitulated but, more importantly, we will take their word that they say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. And thats what the purpose of what we were doing.  I think thats very positive, Trump added. They were knocking out a lot of ships. Asked how the Houthis had communicated that they were looking to stop being targeted by U.S. bombs, Trump offered few details, saying only with a chuckle that the information came from a very good source.  Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, confirmed that the U.S. bombing campaign was ending, posting on X that discussions involving the U.S. and Oman, as well as negotiators in Yemen, have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides. In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping, he wrote, calling the agreement a welcome outcome. In a statement, the Houthis said that its position toward Gaza hadnt changed and its initial understanding with the U.S. would not impact its support for the Palestinians. It wasnt clear in the statement whether it was on board with the agreement with the U.S. The costs of the U.S. munitions used against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen in daily attacks since March 15 have totaled more than $750 million, another U.S. official said. The Trump administration has dropped more than 2,000 munitions on more than 1,000 targets, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details on the strikes. The total is only a fraction of the total costs of the operation. It doesnt account for the costs of operating two aircraft carriers, their accompanying warships or the flight hours of the aircraft. It also doesnt include the Houthis destroying seven U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones, at a cost of more than $30 million apiece, or the loss of an F/A-18 fighter jet and tug from the carrier USS Harry S. Truman when it maneuvered to avoid a Houthi missile and the jet fell off the carrier. Despite Trumps framing of the deal as a way to reopen the Red Sea to commercial shipping without fear of Houthi attack, the Houthis have not fired on a commercial ship since December, Gregory Brew, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group risk-analysis firm, said on X. They are likely, however, to continue shooting at Israel, Brew noted. As to the Houthis continuing to attack Israel - they do so at Irans own peril, Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on social media. The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the groups leadership has described as an effort to end Israels war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.  The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. Those strikes Trump had ordered were similar to ones carried out against the Houthis multiple times by the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden. The Trump administration actions gained a higher profile in the public consciousness when The Atlantic revealed that Hegseth had texted sensitive plans for a military strike against the Houthis on a group chat in the messaging app Signal that mistakenly included the magazines editor-in-chief. Trump stood by Hegseth and downplayed the breach as a glitch. But national security adviser Mike Waltz, who created the group chat on Signal, left his post last week and has been nominated by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Lee, Tara Copp and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489,business
Critic of drug industry and COVID-19 measures to lead FDA vaccine program,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration, has been named to oversee the agencys program for vaccines and biotech drugs. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the appointment Tuesday in a message to agency staff, praising Prasads long and distinguished history in medicine. Prasad is the latest in a series of medical contrarians and critics of COVID-19 measures to join the federal government under President Donald Trump.  Unlike political roles such as FDA commissioner, the job Prasad is stepping into has traditionally been held by an FDA career scientist. His appointment raises new questions about whether vaccines and other new therapies will face unnecessary scrutiny from regulators.  Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, FDAs longtime vaccine chief who resigned in March after clashing with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over concerns about the safety of vaccinations. In a social media post, Prasad likened Marks to a bobblehead doll that just stamps approval.  Last year, he told former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy that Americans would probably be better off without the FDA in its current form. If youre talking about FDA 2024, I think theyd probably be better off as a result of not having the FDA Prasad said during an appearance on Ramaswamys podcast. 
        
     A professor at the University of California San Francisco, Prasads medical training is in cancer and blood disorders. He first came to prominence among academics more than a decade ago for a series of papers scrutinizing the evidence behind new cancer therapies. Research by Prasad and his colleagues showed that many cancer drugs fast-tracked by the FDA have never been shown to improve or extend patient lives. Instead, the drugs are often approved based on alternate measures, such as the ability to shrink tumors, which are thought to predict long-term survival in patients. The FDA has long defended this practice as a way of accelerating approval of medicines for gravely ill patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prasad reached a much broader audience as a critic of vaccine and mask mandates, lockdowns and moves to speed the availability of booster shots from Pfizer and Moderna. Many of his views mirror those of other Trump appointees, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya.  In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. Those patients received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild.  The paper concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit.

AP and others challenge an Indiana law barring reporters from witnessing executions,"The Associated Press and four other media companies argue in a federal lawsuit that Indianas ban on reporters attending state-sanctioned executions violates the publics constitutional right to an independent and unsanitized description of a sensitive and contentious government action.  The complaint, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, comes two weeks before the scheduled execution of Benjamin Ritchie, who was condemned for the September 2000 fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney during a foot chase.  It maintains that the law omitting news media from the states list of permitted witnesses improperly prevents the taxpayers from receiving an unbiased review of the death penaltys implementation. I dont think its about wanting to witness this act  Im sure its not a pleasant experience, said Kristopher Cundriff of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which is representing the plaintiffs. Its about having a representative standing in the shoes of the public to provide an account of what happened that comes from a neutral party. Named as defendants are Ron Neal, superintendent of Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, which houses the death chamber, and Lloyd Arnold, commissioner of the Indiana Department of Correction.  Department spokesperson Annie Goeller said she cannot comment on pending lawsuits. 
        
     Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bar media witnesses. The other, Wyoming, has conducted just one execution in the last half-century.  The AP aims to attend every execution in the U.S. to provide an accurate and unconstrained description for taxpayers. The news organization has repeatedly been on hand to report botched attempts. In December, Joseph Corcoran became the first person put to death in Indiana in 15 years because of a nationwide scarcity of lethal-injection drugs. Ritchie is scheduled for the death chamber on May 20. Five more await execution in Indiana, according to the lawsuit.  The media groups contend that the Indiana law violates the First Amendments guarantee that the public has a qualified right of access to certain government proceedings. It also notes that the law, which allows attendance by as many as five friends or relatives chosen by the condemned and up to eight members of the victims family, improperly treats them more favorably than the media. A hearing has not been scheduled. Joining the AP in pressing the lawsuit are Gannett Co., the nations largest local newspaper operation with Indiana outlets in Indianapolis, Lafayette, Bloomington and South Bend; and TEGNA Inc., which operates WTHR-13 in Indianapolis.  The other plaintiffs are Circle Broadcasting, whose WISH-TV is a statewide network, and States Newsroom, which operates the nonprofit Indiana Capital Chronicle. It was the Capital Chronicle that ensured media representation at the December execution, as Corcoran chose one of its reporters as a witness.",https://apnews.com/article/indiana-death-penalty-executions-secrecy-news-media-e4f5e97a2d26a0663f202214954d197c,business
Thousands of chickens euthanized in South Africa after they were left starving and eating each other,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  Animal welfare officers faced the grisly task of euthanizing more than 350,000 chickens by hand after they were left starving and cannibalizing each other when a South African state-owned poultry company ran out of money to feed them, officials said Tuesday. The National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or NSPCA, said it wasnt able to say for certain how many other chickens had already died by the time its officers reached several neglected poultry farming sites because of the mass cannibalism that took place among the birds.  The NSPCA managed to save more than 500,000 chickens, it said. It was a harrowing scene, the NSPCA said in a statement. Skeletal chickens huddled together, chickens eating one another, feeding lines stripped bare. The chickens were owned by Daybreak Foods, a major poultry supplier owned by South Africas state asset management company Public Investment Corp.  NSPCA officers were first alerted to a crisis at one farm on April 30. The organization uncovered at least five other farms in northern South Africa with multiple sites on each farm where birds had been left to starve, it said. Daybreak Foods was denied permission to take the birds to a slaughterhouse because they were too small. There was no immediate response to an email message seeking comment from Daybreak Foods late Tuesday. 
        
     Company spokesperson Nokwazi Ngcongo told the Daily Maverick news outlet that the birds went unfed for a period of time due to financial challenges affecting feed delivery. She said efforts had been made to limit animal suffering as much as possible. Nazareth Appalsamy, the manager of the NSPCAs farm animal protection unit, told The Associated Press that the mass culling began last Wednesday and was only completed on Monday. Around 75 animal protection officers were tasked with euthanizing the chickens that werent able to recover one by one, Appalsamy said. Culling took a real toll on the staff, being exposed to such extreme measures, he said. The NSPCA said the chickens hadnt been fed for more than a week and pledged to file a court case against Daybreak Foods under animal protection laws for abandoning its responsibilities. The South African government said it is in talks with Daybreak Foods leadership over its financial troubles. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",https://apnews.com/article/chickens-euthanized-animal-neglect-farm-61459549d78555f7fe121d6461b6bd41,business
Controllers briefly lost contact with Newark planes before wider flight disruptions,"The long flight delays and cancellations plaguing Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and spilling over to airports across the U.S. can be traced to a week ago when air traffic controllers temporarily lost communications with planes in the sky, according to the controllers union. Crews in the Philadelphia air traffic control facility that lines up flights going in out and of Newark lost radar and communications with the planes on April 28, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The outage left controllers unable to see, hear, or talk to planes under their control, union spokesperson Galen Munroe said. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed the brief problem and said traffic into the Newark airport was reduced afterward as a precaution to ensure safety. But that move led to the widespread delays and canceled flights. After the breakdown, a number of controllers took leave under a contract provision that allows them to step away after experiencing a traumatic event on the job. Having those controllers on leave exacerbated staff shortages at the facility. The flight disruptions that have trickled down to airports in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas renewed calls to upgrade aviation technology and infrastructure, and address the nationwide air traffic controller shortage, a problem the Trump administration has pledged to solve.  
        
     The whole system needs to be redone, Duffy said Tuesday at the White House. On Thursday, he plans to detail the administrations multibillion-dollar proposal to overhaul the nations air traffic control system that has been in the works since the aftermath of the deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., in January. Congress will have to approve funding for that plan. Controllers handling the planes in Newark lost communication for 30 seconds last week after the control centers primary communication line went down and a backup line failed to kick-in, he said. Former air traffic controllers said briefly losing contact with one plane was not uncommon but dropping communication with all of them would be unusual. Even then there are safeguards and backups. Duffy said that in this situation the backup line didnt immediately come online. If the pilot doesnt respond right away, you dont have them set up where they could collide, said Jordan Morales, who worked 12 years as a controller before leaving the job in 2022.  During a total outage, the control center would call an adjacent facility to take over the air space, he said. Airplanes also have built-in systems that allow pilots to know whats around, he added. Its a tense moment, particularly if its at critical point in the flight, said Todd Yearly, who spent 13 years as a controller in Chicago. Neither of the former controllers, though, said the latest trouble shook their confidence in flying. Safety was maintained that should be the story. In the moment when it mattered, they did their job, Yearly said. After the communications outage, traffic was slowed in and out of the Newark airport, the nations 12th busiest.  Travelers flying out of Newark on Tuesday said they were constantly checking for delays. Joseph Rierson, who was going to Spain with his wife, said they had tried to change plans. But they said the flights still scheduled and on time, so we couldnt do that yet, he said. United Airlines, which operates the most flights out of Newark by far, cut 35 daily Newark flights from its schedule beginning Saturday. United CEO Scott Kirby said the technology used to manage the planes failed more than once last week. Kirby said its clear Newark wont be able to handle the amount of planes currently operating there in the coming months. Last week, he called on the Federal Aviation Administration to limit arrival and departure slots at Newark  a practice used at three of the nations busiest airports where demand exceeds the airports capacity: Reagan National outside Washington and New York Citys LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports.  The union representing 55,000 flight attendants also has voiced concern, asking the airlines to cut flights operating out of Newark until the situation improves. The FAA moved the controllers responsible for the Newark airport from a facility in Long Island, New York, to Philadelphia last year partly to try to address chronic staffing shortages at the New York facility. But only 24 of the 33 controllers responsible for the Newark airspace made the transfer, leaving the Philadelphia facility shorthanded. At the time of the move, controllers union questioned whether the FAA had the equipment and procedures to handle the complicated transfer. Last fall, The Air Current trade magazine reported on several radar failures in Philadelphia related to lines that send data from New York to Philadelphia. The Trump administration has said it wants to supercharge the air traffic controller workforce and address the shortage of controllers. It announced a program last week to help recruit new controllers and give existing ones financial incentives not to retire early. But it takes years to train new air traffic controllers and get them certified. Duffy has said he hopes that the new hiring efforts might be able to have the system fully staffed within three or four years. It is absolutely going get worse, David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector, said in an interview. And something needs to be done about it because of the fact that, first of all, it takes a long time to hire controllers and get them in place. And you cant just turn on a switch, you can just go to the closet and pull out a new air traffic controller and say, here you go, we got new people now. ___ Associated Press reporters Darlene Superville and Joseph Frederick contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/newark-airport-flight-delays-cancellations-united-4d3a3e226608583df5c292389f3c3b37,business
"Alabama lawmakers approve tax cuts for food, diapers and other items","MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP)  Alabama lawmakers on Tuesday voted to cut the state sales tax on food and to exempt diapers, baby formula and menstrual hygiene products from the state sales tax altogether.  The Alabama Senate approved both bills by votes of 34-0. The bills now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. The food tax reduction comes as lawmakers in both parties said families are being hurt by soaring grocery prices. The reduction, if signed into law, will lower the state sales tax on food from 3% to 2% beginning Sept. 1. Lawmakers in 2023 reduced the tax from 4% to 3%. An additional reduction to 2% was planned but hinged on budget growth that did not materialize. Were still one of a few states that taxes groceries. Were headed toward zero taxes, were headed in the right direction. This is big, Republican Rep. Danny Garrett, the sponsor of the bill, said.  The reduction will cost the state about $121 million annually in tax revenue that would otherwise goes to the Education Trust Fund.  The leader of Alabama Arise, an advocacy group that supports policies that help low-income families, said the grocery tax belongs in the dustbin of history.  The grocery tax drives many families deeper into poverty, and Arise remains committed to the goal of eliminating it entirely, Alabama Arise Executive Director Robyn Hyden said.  Lawmakers also approved a bill that will exempt baby formula, maternity clothing, diapers and menstrual hygiene products from state sales tax. Baby wipes, breast pumps and bottles would also be exempt. The exemption from the 4% sales tax will cost the state about $13 million annually.  This is a big win for Alabamas working families, Democratic Rep. Neil Rafferty, the sponsor of the bill, wrote on social media about the approval.",https://apnews.com/article/alabama-legislature-tax-cut-food-education-daa9df493bf0bcf31828f873d06bb397,business
WeightWatchers files for bankruptcy protection to eliminate debt burden,"NEW YORK (AP)  WeightWatchers said Tuesday it is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to eliminate $1.15 billion in debt and focus on its transition into a telehealth services provider. Parent WW International Inc. said it has the support of nearly three-quarters of its debt holders. It expects to emerge from bankruptcy within 45 days, if not sooner. WeightWatchers, which was founded more than 60 years ago, has struggled recently. In 2023, the company moved into the prescription drug weight loss business  particularly with the $106 million acquisition of Sequence, now WeightWatchers Clinic, a telehealth service that helps users get prescriptions for drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Trulicity. Its latest earnings report Tuesday showed that first-quarter revenue declined 10% while its loss on an adjusted basis totaled 47 cents per share. However, clinical subscription revenue  or weight-loss medications  jumped 57% year over year to $29.5 million. In September, WW International CEO Sima Sistani  resigned, and the New York company named Tara Comonte, a WeightWatchers board member and former Shake Shack executive, interim chief executive. Comonte, now CEO, said in a statement Tuesday that, As the conversation around weight shifts toward long-term health, our commitment to delivering the most trusted, science-backed, and holistic solutions grounded in community support and lasting results  has never been stronger, or more important. Shares of the company have traded at under $1 since early February. In after-hours trading, the stock plunged by half to 39 cents.

Nevada high court weighs public access to secretive legal spat over control of Murdoch media empire,"LAS VEGAS (AP)  Nevadas high court is weighing whether to open up courtroom access and unseal records in the secretive legal dispute over who will control Rupert Murdochs powerful media empire after he dies. The case has been unfolding behind closed doors in state court in Reno, with most documents under seal. But reporting by The New York Times, which said it obtained some of the documents, revealed Murdochs efforts to give control to just one of his sons to ensure that Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant. The Nevada Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on a bid by media outlets including the Times and The Associated Press to let the public in on the Murdochs legal spat. The court said it will issue its decision at a later date.  Murdochs media empire, which also includes The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, spans continents and helped to shape modern American politics. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since his father stepped down in 2023. The issue at the center of the case is Rupert Murdochs family trust that would divide control of the company equally among four of his children  Lachlan, Prudence, Elisabeth and James  after his death. Irrevocable trusts are typically used to limit estate taxes, among other reasons, and cant be changed without permission from the beneficiaries or a court order. 
        
     Rupert Murdoch has attempted to alter the trust. But Prudence, Elisabeth and James have united to try to stop that, according to the Times. James and Elisabeth are both known to have less conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating the media moguls desire to keep Fox News political tone. The dispute has had many twists and turns, including a probate commissioner ruling against Rupert Murdoch in December. In a 96-page opinion, the commissioner characterized the plan to change the trust as a carefully crafted charade to permanently cement Lachlan Murdochs executive roles inside the empire regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries of the family trust, according to the Times. Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, told the newspaper at the time that they were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal. Another evidentiary hearing is scheduled for this month.",https://apnews.com/article/rupert-murdoch-media-empire-family-trust-nevada-a36b4a453630f8848d5d4282e813e94d,business
"One Tech Tip: Skype shut down for good, but users still have these alternatives","LONDON (AP)  Skype is dead. What now?  Microsofts shutdown of Skype on May 5 sent millions of users scrambling to find an alternative to the pioneering internet phone service.  Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011, was beloved by a dwindling group of users who appreciated how it let them make cheap long-distance calls as well as communicate with other users through chat messages, voice or video calls. Some liked its simplicity and ease of use  an advantage, for example, when setting up a communications app for an elderly parent living far away.  Or they just used it out of habit.  Skype was founded in 2003 and was among the first in a wave of communication services that used voice over internet protocol technology (VoIP), which converts audio into a digital signal.  Skypes disappearance also inconveniences Americans and other expatriates living overseas who signed up because they needed an U.S.-based number to receive text authentication codes from, say, a bank back home. It was also handy for calling 800 numbers for free even if you werent living in North America.  Here is a guide for life after Skype:  
        
     Microsoft announced in late February that it was shutting down Skype on May 5 and shifting some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship office videoconferencing and group collaboration platform. Skype users can use their existing accounts to log into Teams and have the option to automatically migrate their contacts and chats. If you had a Skype number or a calling subscription, it stopped automatically renewing on April 3.  If your account still has credit, you can access Skypes dial pad from the web portal or Teams to make calls.  Skype numbers wont immediately expire on May 5 so youll still be able to receive calls until your subscription expires. But youll have to use Teams or keep the Skype dial pad open on the web portal to receive them.  If your Skype number hasnt expired and you dont want to lose it, you should transfer it to another provider. Skype numbers can be ported to a phone carrier or any number of other VoIP services. But youll have to start the process through the new provider, not Skype.  Google users can access the online search giants internet phone service to make calls from a smartphone or a desktop web browser. You can get your own Google Voice phone number and use features like call forwarding and voicemail. Or you can port your number from another service like Skype, but it will cost $20.  Calls to U.S., Canadian or Puerto Rican numbers are free. Rates for other countries vary.  The free version of Google Voice is only available to U.S. residents physically located in the 48 contiguous states, so that means expatriate Americans can only use it if they registered before they moved overseas.  You cannot sign up for a Google Voice number while outside the USA, according to a help page. Do not try to circumvent this by using a VPN. Owned by Japans Rakuten, Viber was long considered one of the closest competitors to Skype. One key difference is that Skype users dont need a phone number and are identified by their usernames, while Viber users need a number to register for service.  Similar to Skype, Viber users can buy credit or packages to call phone numbers around the world but its no longer possible to get a Viber number to receive calls.  The videoconferencing service thats become a byword for online company meetings offers a calling service, Zoom Phone, and features like number porting and the ability to send and receive SMS text messages.  Take note that Zoom Phone isnt free. There are various calling plans that involve a monthly subscription cost and extra fees for international calls.  Microsoft users have the option of making calls on Teams, dubbed Teams Phone. Like Zoom Phone, youll need to buy a subscription and pay extra for international calls.  But its not an option for regular people because Microsoft says Teams Phone isnt for consumer use and is only available to small and medium-sized businesses.  If you absolutely need a U.S. number but live overseas, sign up for service with a low-cost virtual wireless carrier that offers cheap cellphone plans or pay-as-you-go rates.  One provider, Tello, offers monthly plans for as little as $5 and says users can activate its service even if theyre living outside the U.S.  Because mobile virtual network operators like Tello are essentially wireless phone companies that piggyback off a bigger carriers physical network, you cant use it to make calls on a computer or an app.  There are a slew of Skype pretenders offering phone calls over the internet, such as Zoiper, VoIP.ms, CallCentric, Mytello, and Virtual Landline. Many are aimed at business users.  Some are capitalizing on Skypes disappearance. Hushed, which started as an anonymous calling app, bills itself as a Skype alternative. Users can buy a phone number from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom or Puerto Rico or port their own number.  It warns that some of its numbers arent guaranteed to work with third-party verification text messages.  We do not intentionally block anyone from receiving these codes, but its common that some services will prevent verification texts from being sent to certain phone numbers due to their own security policies, Hushed says on its website.  Maybe you cant decide which calling service you want to switch to. If you want to save your current number, there are services to just park your number like NumberBarn.com and Parkmyphone.com.  They let you store a phone number for a monthly fee while relaying any text messages sent to that number. You can port the number to another service whenever you want.  Beware, you can only port in U.S. or Canadian phone numbers.  What about an international eSIM? Theyre the virtual version of the mobile phone SIM card that you can buy and add to your phone when youre on a trip to save on roaming fees.  They offer cheap data access rates so you can use the internet without worrying about racking up a huge bill when you get home.  Unfortunately, you cant port a Skype number to an international eSIM because of the fundamental differences between VoIP services and traditional mobile networks, said Pedro Maiquez, co-founder of eSIM provider Holafly. Skype numbers are not tied to a mobile carriers physical infrastructure, making them incompatible with mobile eSIM solutions. Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

"LA firefighters union leaders suspended after audit finds $800,000 in undocumented spending","LOS ANGELES (AP)  Top officials at the Los Angeles firefighters labor union were suspended Monday after an audit conducted by its parent organization found over $800,000 in credit card spending, some of it by the unions president, could not be accounted for. The International Association of Fire Fighters, which oversees firefighter unions across the country, wrote in a letter to the United Firefighters of Los Angeles City that it would be placing the union under a conservatorship to properly manage its finances. The union represents more than 3,600 members of the Los Angeles Fire Department, according to its LinkedIn. According to the letter from IAFF President Edward Kelly, the organization voted to suspend union President Freddy Escobar and two other officials who made thousands of credit card transactions with no receipts or other documentation justifying them. Escobar posted a statement on his Instagram account denying the allegations. Im going to defend myself because I have nothing to hide and I have always worked for the benefit of our membership for the greater good, the post said. These false allegations are disgusting and politically motivated by those who want to attack the union and me personally and Im going to clear my name. The unions troubles began in October 2024, when an officer flagged concerns about improper record-keeping to the parent organization. An investigation found that then-secretary Adam Walker transferred, without authorization, more than $80,000 from the unions nonprofit to support firefighters and families directly into his personal bank accounts, according to IAFF. 
        
     Investigators found that after moving those funds, Walker paid off substantial personal debts such as mortgage and loan payments, as well as casino cash ATM withdrawals. He was suspended for breach of fiduciary responsibility and misappropriation of funds, Kelly said. Contact information could not be located for requesting comment from Walker. A more extensive audit was ordered, revealing that Escobar had spent more than $300,000 on his union credit card between July 2018 and November 2024. Kelly said there was no way to determine that the funds were used for legitimate union expenditures. Auditors had warned union leadership in March 2024 there were significant deficiencies in the locals financial practices. Escobar spent more than $70,000 without submitting a single receipt that year. A former treasurer, Domingo Albarran, was also found to have spent more than $300,000 over about five years without documentation of the expenditures, according to the letter. The unions parent organization voted to suspend Vice Presidents Chuong Ho and Doug Coates for failing to ensure leaders were following policy. The financial malpractice by the leadership of UFLAC has dealt serious harm to the membership, Kelly said. Contact information for Albarran, Ho and Coates could not be immediately located.",https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-firefighters-union-funds-misuse-6773881a5973045ff3cbf6a8d9726596,business
Indias leader Modi touted all was well in Kashmir. A massacre of tourists shattered that claim,"SRINAGAR, India (AP)  Hundreds of Indian tourists, families and honeymooners, drawn by the breathtaking Himalayan beauty, were enjoying a picture-perfect meadow in Kashmir. They didnt know gunmen in army fatigues were lurking in the woods. When the attackers got their chance, they shot mostly Indian Hindu men, many of them at close-range, leaving behind bodies strewn across the Baisaran meadow and survivors screaming for help.  The gunmen quickly vanished into thick forests. By the time Indian authorities arrived, 26 people were dead and 17 others were wounded. India has described the April 22 massacre as a terror attack and blamed Pakistan for backing it, an accusation denied by Islamabad. India swiftly announced diplomatic actions against its archrival Pakistan, which responded with its own tit-for-tat measures. The assailants are still on the run, as calls in India for military action against Pakistan are growing. World leaders have been scrambling to de-escalate the tensions between two nuclear-armed neighbors, which have historically relied on third countries for conflict management. But the massacre has also touched a raw nerve.  Early on Wednesday, India fired missiles that struck at least three locations inside Pakistani-controlled territory, according to Pakistani security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. India said it was striking infrastructure used by militants.

     Those claims now lie shattered. Security experts and former intelligence and senior military officers who have served in the region say Modis government  riding on a nationalistic fervor over Kashmir to please its supporters  missed warning signs.  The government acknowledged that in a rare admission. Two days after the attack, Kiren Rijiju, Indias parliamentary affairs minister, said that a crucial all-party meeting discussed where the lapses occurred. We totally missed ... the intentions of our hostile neighbor, said Avinash Mohananey, a former Indian intelligence officer who has operated in Kashmir and Pakistan. The meadow, near the resort town of Pahalgam, can be reached by trekking or pony rides, and visitors cross at least three security camps and a police station to reach there. According to Indian media, there was no security presence for more than 1,000 tourists that day.  Pahalgam serves as a base for an annual Hindu pilgrimage that draws hundreds of thousands of people from across India. The area is ringed by thick woods that connect with forest ranges in the Jammu area, where Indian troops have faced attacks by rebels in recent years after fighting ebbed in the Kashmir Valley, the heart of an anti-India rebellion. The massacre brought Modis administration almost back to where it started when a suicide car bombing in the region in 2019 prompted his government to strip Kashmir of its semi-autonomy and bring it under direct federal rule. Tensions have simmered ever since, but the region has also drawn millions of visitors amid a strange calm enforced by an intensified security crackdown.  We probably started buying our own narrative that things were normal in Kashmir, Mohananey said.

However, this time a large number of tourists were attacked, making it one of the worst massacres involving civilians in recent years. The attack outraged people in Kashmir and India, where it led to calls of swift action against Pakistan.  Indian television news channels amplified these demands and panelists argued that India should invade Pakistan. Modi and his senior ministers vowed to hunt down the attackers and their backers. Experts say much of the public pressure on the Indian government to act militarily against Pakistan falls within the pattern of long, simmering animosity between both countries. All the talk of military options against Pakistan mainly happens in echo chambers and feeds a nationalist narrative, in India, New Delhi-based counterterrorism expert Ajai Sahni said. It doesnt matter what will be done. We will be told it was done and was a success, he said. And it will be celebrated nonetheless.

(AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan, File) Experts also say that the Modi governments optimism was also largely misplaced and that its continuous boasting of rising tourism in the region was a fragile barometer of normalcy. Last year, Omar Abdullah, Kashmirs top elected official, cautioned against such optimism. By this attack, Pakistan wants to convey that there is no normalcy in Kashmir and that tourism is no indicator for it. They want to internationalize the issue, said D.S. Hooda, former military commander for northern India between 2014 to 2016. Hooda said the choice of targets and the manner in which the attack was carried out indicates that it was well-planned. If there would have been a good security cover, maybe this incident would not have happened, he said. Indian security experts believe the attack could be a retaliation for a passenger train hijacking in Pakistan in March by Baloch insurgents. Islamabad accused New Delhi of orchestrating the attack in which 25 people were killed. India denies it. Mohananey said that Indian authorities should have taken the accusations seriously and beefed-up security in Kashmir, while arguing there was a striking similarity in both attacks since only men were targeted. It was unusual that women and children were spared in both cases, Mohananey said. Two senior police officers, who have years of counterinsurgency experience in Kashmir, said after the train attack in Pakistan that they were anticipating some kind of reaction in the region by militants.

(AP Photo/Dar Yasin, File) The officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that security officials perceived the threat of an imminent attack, and Modis inauguration of a strategic rail line in the region was canceled. A large-scale attack on tourists, however, wasnt anticipated, because there was no such precedence, the officers said. Hooda, who commanded what New Delhi called surgical strikes against militants in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir in 2016, said that the attack has deepened thinking that it was time to tackle the Pakistani state, not just militants. Such calculus could be a marked shift. In 2016 and 2019, India said that its army struck militant infrastructure inside Pakistan after two major militant attacks against its soldiers. After this attack, Hooda said, India wants to stop Pakistan from using terrorism as an instrument of state policy. We need to tighten our security and plug lapses, but the fountainhead of terrorism needs to be tackled, Hooda said. The fountainhead is Pakistan. ___ Saaliq and Roy reported from New Delhi.",https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-pakistan-tourist-attack-pahalgam-1089607a2c148eff059ca1052fe86aad,business
Disabled workers have faced prejudice. Now they face DOGE firings,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Spencer Goidel, a 33-year-old federal worker in Boca Raton, Florida, with autism, knew what he could be losing when he got laid off from his job as an equal employment opportunity specialist at the IRS. Because of his autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, Goidel had been able to secure his spot as one of more than 500,000 disabled workers in the federal government under Schedule A, which allows federal agencies to bypass the traditional hiring process and pick a qualified candidate from a pool of people with certain disabilities. His job, he said, was accommodating and enriching, and he wonders if hell ever get another one like that in the private sector. A lot of people who are disabled, they came to the federal government because it was a model employer for disabled individuals, and now they have nowhere else to go, he told The Associated Press. The irony, he says, is that his job was to help resolve workers harassment claims before they escalated into full-blown lawsuits against the government. So much for reducing waste, he says.  
        
     For decades, the federal government has positioned itself as being committed to inclusive hiring and long-term retention across agencies. But as mass layoffs ripple through the federal workforce under President Donald Trumps Republican administration, disabled employees are among those being let go. Amid the firings, rollbacks of accommodation guidance for businesses and skepticism of disability inclusion practices, advocates and experts wonder if the governments status as a model employer will hold true.  Trump has said he ended diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the government because people should be hired based on work quality and merit alone. However, under Schedule A, candidates already have to be qualified for the position with or without an accommodation. They dont get a job solely because they have a disability. Disability advocates point to a slew of statements from Trump administration officials that indicate they view disabled workers as a liability to the government. Trump criticized the federal governments inclusion efforts in January when a midair collision between a plane and a helicopter near Reagan National Airport killed 67 people. Without evidence, he blamed the Federal Aviation Administrations targeted hiring of people with disabilities for the crash, saying that only psychologically superior air traffic controllers should work for the agency. Kelly McCullough, legal director at Disability Law Colorado, said the messaging from the Trump administration could affect how seriously the private sector takes on disability inclusion efforts. Recently, she said, the nonprofit has received an uptick in disability discrimination complaints. It does make me wonder, if the federal government is setting this example, challenging these ideas of inclusion that have (had) long-standing support from the government  is that trickling down? she said. Is that messaging getting to employers in other contexts? Trump also rescinded a Biden-era executive order that required federal agencies to create action plans to hire more diverse staff, including those with disabilities. The order calls diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, or DEIA, efforts illegal and says they violate the text and spirit of civil rights. The Trump administrations other actions have caused consternation, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s dismantling of the Administration for Community Living, an agency that serves disabled and aging adults. HHS officials also floated - and walked back - a plan to create a registry of people with autism. Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, which advocates for people with physical and intellectual disabilities, said she is concerned about the impact the massive reductions in the federal workforce will have on government services for all Americans as well as the loss of opportunities for workers with disabilities. Im really worried  where are these folks going to go? Whos going to hire them? she asked. Employment gaps for disabled people have been an issue across the federal and private sectors for years. When the Labor Department began recording disability status in its employment trends in the Current Population Survey in 2009, just 30% of disabled people between ages 16 and 64 were working at least part time. Thats compared with 71% of people without a disability. Last year, employment rates for disabled people hit a record high of 38%, but the decades-old disparities still persisted: 75% of people without disabilities were employed that year. Disability hiring in the federal government became a prominent effort in the 1970s, shortly after the passing of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits disability discrimination in federal agencies. Expectations to hire disabled people expanded from there.  In 2014, Democratic President Barack Obamas administration began requiring that federal contractors meet specific goals related to hiring disabled people.  Three years later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission updated rules under the Rehabilitation Act. The new rules required federal agencies to set hiring goals for people with disabilities and create plans to help them get jobs and promotions. Anupa Iyer Geevarghese worked as a disability policy adviser at the EEOC when officials updated the regulations. She said it increased progress in ensuring that disabled people had equitable opportunities in the federal workforce. She now worries that progress will be undone as the Trump administration shows little interest in continuing inclusion efforts. I think, unfortunately, there are still perceptions about the knowledge, skill and abilities of people with disabilities, she said. As a whole, were still, as a community, still perceived as people who cant do their jobs, are unqualified, who are uneducated and are incapable  we thought we had combated it, but we are still fighting that fight. Abby Tighe, a former public health adviser at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, was among thousands of federal probationary workers terminated in February. Tighe, 30, has a progressive form of muscular dystrophy, which may eventually affect her ability to walk independently.  I really truly understand how other people who are using a chair or using some kind of assistance device might be really concerned about that next stage of employment when they cant interview and hide their disability at the same time, she said. Some also worry that disabled federal workers may have been disproportionately hurt by the terminations. Tighe and Goidel were hired through Schedule A, which allows a probationary period of up to two years. Other federal employees typically have one year of probation.  Tighe suspects that if she hadnt been hired through the special hiring authority, she might still have a job, given that no one else on her team was let go.  Goidel, who was converted to permanent status with full tenure in 2019, says his employment with the federal government motivated him to continue his education and pursue a masters degree in employment law. He says the decision to slash jobs at the IRS EEO office will mean there are fewer federal workers able to investigate harassment claims and that could result in more litigation against the government. The White House is promoting its efforts to provide services for disabled individuals and veterans.  In an email to The Associated Press, a White House official pointed to student loan forgiveness for completely disabled veterans and record low unemployment for people with disabilities during Trumps first term. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, also noted that a multiagency task force was created in 2018 to focus on increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. HHS also announced plans for the Administration for Community Living to release more than $1 billion in funding to states to address nutrition, daily living assistance, chronic disease management and more. Goidel says he hopes the Trump administration realizes what its losing with the layoffs. Theyre taking away peoples opportunities, and theyre taking away peoples livelihoods, he said. Theyre also hurting people who may need a little extra help to get over the finish line and have that upward mobility. ___ Hunter reported from Atlanta.",https://apnews.com/article/disabled-federal-workers-layoffs-trump-77528e68350b62e52bab3455f0a87591,business
"Trump, Carney faceoff in Oval Office leaves gaping differences on tariffs, 51st state","WASHINGTON (AP)  U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney faced off in the Oval Office on Tuesday and showed no signs of retreating from their gaping differences in an ongoing trade war that has shattered decades of trust between the two countries.  The two kept it civil, but as for Trumps calls to make Canada the 51st state, Carney insisted his nation was not for sale and Trump shot back, time will tell. Asked by a reporter if there was anything Carney could tell him to lift his tariffs of as much as 25% on Canada, Trump bluntly said: No. President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The U.S. president added for emphasis, Just the way it is. Carney acknowledged that no bit of rhetoric on tariffs would be enough to sway Trump, saying that this is a bigger discussion. There are much bigger forces involved, the Canadian leader continued. And this will take some time and some discussions. And thats why were here, to have those discussions. The meeting between the two leaders showcased the full spectrum of Trumps unique mix of aggression, hospitality and stubbornness.  Shortly before Carneys arrival, Trump insulted Canada by posting on social media that the United States didnt need ANYTHING from its northern neighbor, only to then turn on the charm and praise Carneys election win in person before showing his obstinance on matters of policy substance. Carney won the job of prime minister by promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump, even as he has preserved the calm demeanor of an economist who has led the central banks of both Canada and the United Kingdom.  
        
     At times, Carney struggled to interject his views and raised his hand to talk as Trump held forth at length and veered between topics, touching on California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, Carneys predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and teasing a great upcoming announcement thats not necessarily on trade. Trump offended Canadas sense of pride and friendship by saying he wants to make Canada the 51st U.S. state and levying steep tariffs against an essential partner in the manufacturing of autos and the supply of oil, electricity and other goods. The outrage provoked by Trump enabled Carneys Liberal Party to score a stunning comeback victory last month as the trade war and attacks on Canadian sovereignty have outraged voters. Trump said the two would not discuss making Canada part of the U.S., even as he insisted the idea would lead to lower taxes for Canadians. Its not for sale, Carney said. It wont be for sale. Ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together. Trump persisted by saying that the United States did not want to buy autos from Canada, even if the vehicles were also assembled in America. The U.S. leader insisted that the $63 billion trade deficit in goods  which he inflated to $200 billion  was a subsidy that needed to come an end. The meeting never devolved into the outburst that the public saw in Trumps meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was berated by the U.S. president and his team for not being sufficiently deferential. Nor did it have the ease of Trumps sit down with the United Kingdoms Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who invited Trump for a visit provided by King Charles III. Carney later described his conversation with Trump as wide ranging and constructive, telling reporters that the prospect is there for positive negotiations but there would be zigs and zags. Carney said he stressed the value that Canadian companies and factories created for U.S. automakers while stressing that it was unfair to assume one meeting could resolve any differences. I wouldnt have expected white smoke coming out of this meeting, Carney said after the Tuesday meeting, referencing the signal that a new pope has been selected. Carney said that he privately asked Trump to stop calling Canada the 51st state during their meeting. But when pressed on how Trump responded, the Canadian prime minister said: Hes the president. Hes his own person. Trump was later asked if he would give Carney the same governor nickname that he had put on Trudeau. The nickname was a slight meant to imply that Canadas leader would eventually be just one of many U.S. governors. As far as calling him Gov. Carney, no, I havent done that yet, and maybe I wont, Trump said. I did have a lot of fun with Trudeau. But I think this is, this is a big step. Its a good step up for Canada. Trump added that the meeting with Carney had been great and that he thought the ongoing relationship would be strong. A senior Canadian government official said the president asked Carney his perspective on a variety of foreign policy issues including Iran, Russia, Ukraine and China. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said Trump was looking forward to the G-7 meeting in Alberta, Canada. The stakes of the meeting were high and the messages beforehand mixed. Trump told reporters on Monday that he wasnt quite sure why Carney was visiting. Im not sure what he wants to see me about, Trump said. But I guess he wants to make a deal. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick further stoked doubts about their interest in repairing the relationship with Canada in a Monday interview on Fox Business Networks Kudlow show.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Asked if the U.S. could make a deal with Canada, Lutnick called the country a socialist regime that has been basically feeding off America. Lutnick said Tuesdays meeting would be fascinating. Carney, at a Friday news conference ahead of his trip, said the talks would focus on immediate trade pressures and the broader economic and national security relationships. He said his government would fight to get the best deal for Canada and take all the time necessary to do so, even as Canada pursues a parallel set of talks to deepen relations with other allies and lessen its commitments with the U.S. President Donald Trump greets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump has maintained that the U.S. doesnt need anything from Canada. He is actively going after a Canadian auto sector built largely by U.S. companies, saying, Theyre stopping work in Mexico, and theyre stopping work in Canada, and theyre all moving here. He also said the U.S. doesnt need Canadas energy  though nearly one-fourth of the oil that the U.S. consumes daily comes from the province of Alberta. The president has also disparaged Canadas military commitments despite a partnership that ranges from the beaches of Normandy in World War II to remote stretches of Afghanistan. He said on Tuesday with Carney that the U.S. would continue to provide national security support to Canada. Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and tariffs on other products outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in some cases ostensibly to address relatively low volumes of fentanyl intercepted at the northern border. That has jeopardized a closely entwined trade relationship as Canada sees an increasing need to build relations with the European Union and other nations. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canadas exports go to the U.S.",https://apnews.com/article/canada-prime-minister-carney-trump-c279642998197ecb212f39bf38184388,business
A Czech court blocks the signing of a deal with South Koreas KHNP to build 2 nuclear reactors,"PRAGUE (AP)  A court in the Czech Republic blocked on Tuesday the government from signing a deal with South Koreas KHNP to build at least two nuclear reactors in country. KHNP won a lucrative public tender last year, beating a competing bid by Frances EDF. The two new reactors will be built at the existing Dukovany power plant in an effort for the country to wean itself off fossil fuels. The contract between the dominant power company CEZ, where the Czech state has a majority stake, and the South Korean company was scheduled for Wednesday. EDF challenged the signing of the deal at the regional court in the second largest Czech city of Brno on Friday after the Czech anti-monopoly office dismissed its complaint about the tender. The court said that the deal could not be signed before it rules on the EDF case, because then there would be no way to change it even if the French company won. It is not clear when that might happen. Prime Minister Petr Fiala said he believed the tender was correct and in line with law. CEZ said the Korean bid was the better one, and the tender was transparent and fair. EDF had no immediate comment. The two new reactors will complement Dukovanys four 510-megawatt units that were completed in the 1980s. The government estimated they would each cost about 200 billion koruna ($9.1 billion). The first new reactor is expected to become operational for a trial by 2036, the second about two years later.",https://apnews.com/article/czech-nuclear-reactors-edf-khnp-2dcaa77856b7837c596cb0291dad5659,business
On the attack: Trumps media response in Abrego Garcia story is notably vigorous,"NEW YORK (AP)  Responding to coverage of Kilmar Abrego Garcias deportation, the Trump administration has called journalists despicable, questioned CNNs patriotism, scolded Fox News and even admitted to a mistake  in admitting to a mistake in the first place. The vigorous reaction was noteworthy even in service to a president known for never backing down and a hostility toward the press. The song is the same, said former CNN Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno, but the volume is a lot louder. President Donald Trump has fought the press on several fronts since returning to office in January. His team is battling The Associated Press in court over White House access, has sought to close Voice of America and launched FCC investigations into ABC News, CBS News, PBS and NPR, among others. In the Abrego Garcia case, the White House took a situation that may have knocked predecessors on their heels and used it as an opportunity. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national has lived in the United States for 14 years, married and is raising three children, and a judge shielded him from deportation in the first Trump term. In what Justice Department officials called an administrative error, he was sent last month to a Salvadoran prison. His case has come to symbolize concerns over whether people are being expelled legally. Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller wasnt interested in those questions during an interview with Fox News Bill Hemmer. I hate to do it, Bill, but I have to correct you on every single thing that you said, because it was all wrong, Miller said, interpreting a U.S. Supreme Court order that the administration facilitate Abrego Garcias return as a victory. Similarly, Trump said that people at CNN hate our country and objected when the networks Kaitlan Collins asked about Abrego Garcia in an Oval Office news conference. Why dont you just say, Isnt it wonderful that were keeping criminals out of our country? Trump responded. Why cant you say that? Why do you go over and over  and thats why nobody watches you anymore, you know. You have no credibility. From the briefing room, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said outrage about the case by Democrats and the media has been nothing short of despicable. Based on the sensationalism of many of the people in this room, you would have thought we had deported a candidate for Father of the Year, she said. She called Abrego Garcia an illegal alien MS-13 gang member and foreign terrorist who was deported back to his home country. Abrego Garcia has denied being part of the El Salvadoran gang. She later told Fox News that the official who labeled Abrego Garcias deportation an administrative error was himself mistaken. The immigrant, she promised, wouldnt be returning to his old life in the United States. Trump and his team are banking on his immigration stance being among his most popular, and that many of his followers dislike journalists, said Sean Spicer, White House press secretary during the presidents first term. If the roles were reversed and the Trump administration had been referring to Abrego Garcia as a Maryland family man, the media would have gone nuts claiming he was spreading misinformation, Spicer said in an interview. Matt Margolis, a columnist for PJMedia, told The Associated Press that when the media wont report the facts, its on the Trump administration to bring the facts directly to the public, and I think theyve done so effectively. Thats why he has solid approval ratings on immigration. The public knows the media is lying  and they know Trump isnt. Nonetheless, Abrego Garcia put a human face to an issue and an effort frequently happening in the shadows. Recognizing the potency of government by anecdote, the administration produced its own face  inviting Patty Morin to meet Trump in the White House and address reporters. The Maryland womans daughter, Rachel, was raped and killed in 2023 and a jury on April 14 convicted an immigrant from El Salvador in the U.S. illegally, Victor Martinez-Hernandez, of the crime. Trump aide Steven Cheung called it a media outrage that CNN and MSNBC did not carry angel mom Patty Morins recounting of the tragedy live on the air. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr criticized the same two networks for news distortion in their coverage of Abrego Garcia. A conservative media watchdog, the Media Research Center, produced a report that Martinez-Hernandezs trial received 12 seconds of coverage on the ABC, CBS and NBC morning and evening newscasts. The Abrego Garcia case got 143 minutes in total on the broadcasts between April 1 and 23, enabling them to berate the Trump administration, they said. Disgusting, Donald Trump Jr. said in a social media posting. The Morin murder trial did receive extensive local news coverage. Nationally, ABC News covered the case in 2024 when Martinez-Henderson was arrested and when Morins brother spoke before the Republican national convention. The tactic  dont look here, look there!  is familiar in politics and propaganda, said Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News executive who is now dean of the Hofstra University school of communication. It seems to me that what the White House would like the Abrego Garcia case to be about is whether this individual should be in the United States, Lukasiewicz said. Their clear view is that he should not, and that should be the story. From a news perspective, thats not what the story is about. The story is about the absence of due process. Attacking the news media is also not unique or new; ask your grandparents who former Vice President Spiro Agnew was referring to when he coined the phrase nattering nabobs of negativism. Trumps defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has bitterly denounced the press for a series of tough stories on his leadership. Yet the Abrego Garcia case is worth examining; the media strategy followed by the White House is likely to be repeated, especially since the president has a strong cadre of loyalists to follow his lead, said Sesno, professor at George Washington Universitys school of media and public affairs. Does any of this ever get old? he asked. That is the question. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

UK and India sign a landmark trade agreement after years of tough negotiations,"LONDON (AP)  Britain and India announced Tuesday that they have agreed on a hard-wrought free trade agreement that will slash tariffs on products including Scotch whisky and English gin shipped to India and Indian food and spices sent to the U.K. The deal comes more than three years after negotiations started  and stalled  under a previous British government. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X that the deal was ambitious and mutually beneficial. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it a landmark. This is the biggest trade deal that we the U.K. have done since we left the EU, and its the most ambitious trade deal that India has ever done, Starmer said.  The U.K. government said the deal will reduce Indian import taxes on British goods including whisky, cosmetics, medical devices, cars, airplane parts and lamb. Whisky and gin tariffs will be halved from 150% to 75% before falling to 40% by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will fall from over 100% to 10% under a quota.  Indias Trade Ministry said 99% of Indian exports would face no import duty under the deal, which applies to products including textiles, marine products, leather, footwear, toys, gems and jewelry. This brings us closer to our goal of becoming a global economic powerhouse. It protects our core interests while opening doors to Indias greater participation in global value chains, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said.  
        
     Modis office said the agreement covered trade in both goods and services, and would unlock new potential for the two nations to jointly develop products and services for global markets. Britain said the deal is expected to increase bilateral trade by 25.5 billion pounds ($34 billion) a year from 2040 and add almost 5 billion pounds ($6.7 billion) a year to the British economy. Mark Kent, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the deal would be transformational for the industry. India, a country of 1.4 billion people, is the worlds largest whisky market, and Kent said the agreement had the potential to increase Scotch whisky exports to India by 1 billion pounds over the next five years. The issue of visas for Indian nationals was a sticking point in the talks. The British government is under pressure to cut immigrant numbers  pressure heightened by the success of anti-immigrant party Reform UK in local elections in England last week. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the trade deal had no impact on the immigration system, but made modest changes to business mobility.  The agreement adds Indian musicians, chefs and yoga instructors to the groups who can apply for U.K. visas, and includes a three-year exemption from British social security contributions for Indian workers in the U.K. The same exemption will apply to British workers in India. The deal, which must be ratified by both countries, comes as countries around the world scramble to strike trade deals to make up for tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on Americas trading partners. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of employers organization the Confederation of British Industry, said the trade deal between India and Britain  the worlds fifth- and sixth-largest economies  was a beacon of hope amidst the specter of protectionism. U.K.-India trade negotiations began long before Trumps re-election. Formal talks began in 2022 on a free trade agreement that then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed as a key goal after Britains departure from the European Union in 2020. Johnson famously promised to have a deal done by Diwali in October of that year. The two countries held 13 rounds of negotiations without a breakthrough before talks were suspended while both nations held general elections in 2024.  Modi was re-elected, and Britain replaced the Conservative government with one led by Starmers Labour Party. The two leaders spoke by phone on Tuesday, and Modi said he had invited Starmer to visit India soon. Starmers office said he would go there at the earliest opportunity. ___ Roy reported from New Delhi.",https://apnews.com/article/uk-india-trade-deal-starmer-modi-6cbaf787f49a08aac18f93b2601d09f2,business
"Homeland Security chief says travelers with no REAL ID can fly for now, but with likely extra steps","WASHINGTON (AP)  Travelers who havent obtained a REAL ID by this weeks deadline received assurances from the head of Homeland Security that they will be able to fly after additional identity checks. Her comments came Tuesday as people were waiting in long lines outside of government buildings from California to Chicago trying to update their IDs before the long-delayed deadline.  Kristi Noem told a congressional panel that 81% of travelers already have IDs that comply with the REAL ID requirements. She said security checkpoints will also be accepting passports and tribal identification when the deadline hits Wednesday. Those who still lack an identification that complies with the REAL ID law may be diverted to a different line, have an extra step, Noem said. But people will be allowed to fly, she said.

(AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) The Transportation Security Administration warned people who dont have the REAL ID to show up early and be prepared for advanced screening to avoid causing delays.  I do not have a belief that this will cause people to miss their flights if they take that additional time in, said Thomas Carter, the TSAs Federal Security Director in New Jersey. I think theres that self-responsibility of the law that they need to know, give themselves that extra time, and if they do that, they shouldnt have an issue. Across the country, government offices extended their hours to help meet the demand. But despite that, some people waited for hours Tuesday to get a REAL ID ahead of the long-delayed deadline.  
        
     Renel Leggett, a college student from West Chester, Pennsylvania, spent hours getting her REAL ID and was not happy about it. Ive been out here for three hours to get one ID when Ive already had one that should have lasted me until about 2029, Leggett said.  You have to do it. But it feels like a waste of time, she said.  REAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that Homeland Security says is a more secure form of identification. It was a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission and signed into law in 2005.  The commission recommended the government set security standards for state-issued drivers licenses and IDs. It was supposed to be rolled out in 2008. But the implementation has been repeatedly delayed. Besides needing a REAL ID to fly domestically, people will also need one to access certain federal buildings and facilities. In recent weeks, Noem has been warning the American public about the upcoming deadline. In a television ad put out by Homeland Security, she warned that these IDs were needed for air travel and for entering public buildings, adding: These IDs keep our country safe.

In California, about 58% of all drivers license and ID cardholders have a REAL ID. The state has extended the hours of some Department of Motor Vehicles offices through June 27 to help more people get the federally required identification. Officials are also reminding residents that if they already have a valid U.S. passport, they can use that and wait to upgrade to a REAL ID when their ID or drivers license is due for renewal. Lucas Krump was traveling Tuesday to San Francisco on business from Newark, New Jersey, and said he was using a passport to get through security.  I dont have a license that is Real ID, he said. I question the bureaucracy around it. It feels like attacks on everyday people, having to upgrade their licenses and all of their identification for something that really, you know, seems like weve been fine without it. At the Driver Services Bureau in Jackson, Mississippi, there were no long lines Tuesday, and people were getting their REAL IDs fairly quickly.  Marion Henderson said before going in that she planned to travel to California, Michigan, Chicago and New York this year and wanted to be prepared.  Even though I have my license, now that its required, I wanted to go ahead and get it done ahead of the deadline, Henderson said.  ___ Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.

Florida raises basketball coach Todd Goldens salary to $6M annually after national title,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP)  Florida basketball coach Todd Golden has signed a contract extension that raises his annual salary to $6 million, a lucrative bump nearly a month after the Gators won the national championship. Golden inked a six-year, $40.5 million extension Tuesday night, adding a year to his current deal and putting him under contract through the 2030-31 season. He signed a two-year extension in March 2024 that increased his average salary to $4.1 million annually. His latest raise is a significant commitment from Florida and puts Golden nearly on par with football coach Billy Napier, who is scheduled to make $7.4 million in 2025. Goldens deal pays $6 million a year (beginning April 16, 2025), with a $300,000 pay hike every year after. The coach of the reigning national mens college hoops champion is getting a raise. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports. Todd has done an incredible job getting Florida mens basketball back where it belongs, athletic director Scott Stricklin said in a statement. We believed in his vision, his competitive nature and his modern approach to the game back in 2022, and he has validated that belief in a relatively short time and helped create memories of a lifetime for another generation of Gator fans. The new money makes the 39-year-old Golden the second-highest-paid basketball coach in the Southeastern Conference behind Arkansas John Calipari, who earns $8 million annually. Golden, once an assistant under Bruce Pearl at Auburn who got his first head coaching job at San Francisco in 2019, previously ranked 12th out of 16 coaches in the league. 
        
     He now jumps to fifth among the seven active coaches with national titles, behind Bill Self of Kansas, Calipari, UConns Dan Hurley and Michigan States Tom Izzo. As weve shown during our time in Gainesville, the University of Florida is an institution that has the resources, support, and people in place to compete and win national championships, Golden said in a statement. Goldens new deal is nearly fully guaranteed. Florida would owe him 85% of the remaining value if the school fired him without cause at any point. Goldens buyout to leave Gainesville starts at $16 million next season and drops annually: $11 million in 2026-27; $4 million in 2027-28; $3 million in 2028-29; $2 million in 2029-30; and $1 million in 2030-31. However, Golden can leave for the NBA at a much lower price. His NBA buyout begins at $3 million next season and drops to $2 million (2026-28) and then $1 million in 2028-29. Included in Goldens annual compensation is a $500,000 signing bonus, a $500,000 annual longevity incentive and a $60,000 annual expense account. In addition to that, he gets $70,000 annually in travel allowance for using the university athletic associations plane and other fringe benefits valued at $62,000. He would get a $100,000 bonus for winning the SEC regular-season championship, a $50,000 bonus for winning the SEC Tournament, a $100,000 bonus for making the NCAA Tournament and a $50,000 bonus for every NCAA Tournament victory. With Golden at the helm for his third season in Gainesville, the Gators finished 36-4 and beat Houston to clinch the programs third national title. They won their final 12 games, including four in the NCAA Tournament in come-from-behind fashion. Floridas style of play under Golden has drawn rave reviews, leading to sellouts in eight of the teams last 10 home games. Florida averaged 84.8 points a game this season after setting the program record (85.6) during the 2023-24 campaign. Golden became the third coach this century to win a national title within his first three seasons on the job, joining North Carolinas Roy Williams (2005) and UConns Kevin Ollie (2014). Williams and Ollie accomplished the feat in their second seasons. Golden has a modest rebuild on his hands now. Leading scorer Walter Clayton, the Final Fours Most Outstanding Player, is headed to the NBA along with fellow guards Alijah Martin and Will Richard. Forwards Alex Condon and Rueben Chinyelu are going through the NBA draft process with the potential to stay in school and return for next season. Backup guard Denzel Aberdeen (Kentucky) and backup forward Sam Alexis (Indiana) transferred, and assistant coaches Kevin Hovde (Columbia) and John Andrzejek (Campbell) took head coaching jobs. Golden signed two guards out of the transfer portal  Princetons Xaivian Lee and Ohios AJ Brown  and have swingman CJ Ingram and guard Alex Lloyd joining the team as incoming freshmen. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

"Home of Philadelphia 76ers, Flyers lands naming rights deal with Xfinity Mobile","PHILADELPHIA (AP)  The home of the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76ers has a new name. The arena will be renamed Xfinity Mobile Arena, effective Sept. 1 and running through the 2030-2031 season. Banking giant Wells Fargo announced last year that it would not renew its deal with building owner and operator Comcast Spectacor  the parent company of the Flyers  when it expires in August. Financial terms were not announced. Wells Fargo paid a reported $1.4 million annually as part of the naming rights deal. The arena, originally named CoreStates Center, opened in 1996 and has been the home to Philly sports stars like Allen Iverson, Eric Lindros and Joel Embiid, as well as NCAA Tournament games. The building has carried a number of names, including the First Union Center in 1998 and Wachovia Center in 2003. Wells Fargo bought out Wachovia and posted its name on the roughly 21,000-seat building in 2010. Comcast Spectacor last year completed a $400 million renovation project of the Wells Fargo Center. The 76ers earlier this year announced they would partner with Comcast Spectacor, their current landlord, to build a new arena in South Philadelphia and abandon a deal with the city to move downtown. Comcast will own the naming rights to the arena being developed via a joint venture between HBSE and Comcast Spectacor, set to open in the 2031-2032 season. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",https://apnews.com/article/flyers-76ers-philadelphia-xfinity-comcast-d5a3c6dc790d5ef8ecdceb61475dc1d9,business
Champion skier Mikaela Shiffrin joins NWSL Denvers ownership group,"DENVER (AP)  Olympic gold medal-winning skier Mikaela Shiffrin has joined the ownership group of the National Womens Soccer League expansion team in Denver, set to launch next year. Shiffrin, an eight-time world champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist, is the most decorated alpine skier of all time. She is the latest celebrity athlete to invest in an NWSL team. Others run the gamut from NBA star James Harden (Houston Dash) to former NFL quarterback Eli Manning (Gotham FC) to actress Natalie Portman (Angel City). Im beyond thrilled to join the ownership group of Denver NWSL and support something so meaningful in the community I call home, Shiffrin said in a statement Tuesday. The sport culture in Colorado is rich and deep, and  most notably  the growth of womens sports is one of the most exciting movements in our culture today. Denver was awarded the NWSLs 16th team earlier this year. A club in Boston will join Denver in kicking off next year. In March, the Denver teams owners unveiled plans for a new downtown soccer stadium. The facility will be only the second purpose-built womens soccer stadium in the league after the Kansas City Current opened CPKC Stadium last year. Denvers owners more recently announced plans for a temporary stadium and training facility in Centennial, Colorado, southeast of Denver. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",https://apnews.com/article/nwsl-denver-mikaela-shiffrin-35720a317458e5cb31890e77a4672a79,business
What customers can expect as Rite Aid closes or sells all its drugstores,"Rite Aid customers can expect their local store to close or change ownership in the next few months, as the struggling drugstore chain goes through another bankruptcy filing. The company plans to sell customer prescription files, inventory and other assets as it closes distribution centers and unloads store locations. Stores will remain open for now, but the company isnt buying new inventory so bare shelves are likely become more common. I think what well progressively see is the stores will become more and more spartan, said retail analyst Neil Saunders. The company runs 1,245 stores in 15 states, according to its website. It has a heavy presence in New York, Pennsylvania and California, which alone has 347 locations. Heres what customers can expect next. Rite Aid says a few months for most of its stores. All locations will eventually close or be sold to a new owner. Until then, customers will still be able to fill prescriptions, get immunizations and shop in the stores or online. Rite Aid has said that it will stop issuing customer rewards points for purchases. It also will no longer honor gift cards or accept returns or exchanges starting next month. 
        
     Rite Aid will try to sell them to another drugstore, grocer or retailer with a pharmacy. The company says it is working to put together a smooth transfer of customer prescriptions to other pharmacies. But theres no guarantee those files will wind up at a retailer near the location that is closing. That may be challenging because some Rite Aid stores are in rural areas, miles away from another pharmacy, noted Saunders, managing director of the consulting and data analysis firm GlobalData. Prescription files can be valuable assets because they can connect the acquiring drugstore with a regular customer if that person sticks with the new store. Philadelphia-based Rite Aid had been closing stores and struggling with losses for years before its first bankruptcy filing in 2023. The company says its only viable path forward is a return to Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The company said in letter to vendors that it has been hit with several financial challenges that have grown more intense. Rite Aid and its competitors have been dealing with tighter profits on their prescriptions, increased theft, court settlements over opioid prescriptions and customers who are drifting to online shopping and discount retailers. Walgreens, which has more than six times as many stores as Rite Aid, agreed in March to be acquired by the private equity firm Sycamore Partners. CVS Health also has closed stores. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

States sue Trump administration for blocking the development of wind energy,"A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trumps attempt to stop the development of wind energy. Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesnt have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and hes jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals. Theyre asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it. This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet, New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are using lawfare to stop the presidents popular energy agenda, instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families.  The American people voted for the president to restore Americas energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats radical climate agenda, Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.  
        
     Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal governments leasing and permitting of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts. The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. Hes boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing its necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world. The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval.  Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.  Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nations largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trumps order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a national energy emergency, which called for expanding domestic energy production.  The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say theyve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate. Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nations first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island. Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermens organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind. The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey. Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmerannounced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.  ___ The Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Book Review: Restaurateur Keith McNally opens up in candid memoir I Regret Almost Everything,"Keith McNally has been charming New York City diners since he opened his first restaurant, The Odeon, in 1980, helping transform a then-derelict TriBeCa into a hotspot for the glitterati. The Odeons glowing neon sign was featured on the cover of Jay McInerneys 1984 novel Bright Lights, Big City, and the restaurant was a regular hangout for celebrities from Andy Warhol to John Belushi. Nearly five decades and 19 restaurants later, McNallys Balthazar in SoHo, Minetta Tavern in New York and D.C., and other restaurants are still going strong. In his candid, funny and poignant memoir, I Regret Almost Everything, McNally, 73, shows that he is, too. But it might not have been that way. The book opens with a 2018 suicide attempt, sparked by back pain, a crumbling marriage and the aftereffects of a 2016 stroke which left him with aphasia and a paralyzed right hand. Work  building and operating restaurants  helped keep him going. And with his speech distorted, he found a creative outlet in Instagram, where his filter-free screeds on everything  from dealing with his stroke to Balthazars evening recap by staff  often go viral. In some ways, it was only after I lost my voice that I learned to speak my mind, he writes. In his memoir, McNally charts his unlikely success story from a working-class teen actor raised in Bethnal Green, London, to being dubbed The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown in his heyday of the 1980s and 90s. 
        
     His exacting eye for lighting and ambiance and charming touches in his restaurants  he sends a gratis glass of champagne to solo diners at Balthazar, and often filled the cheap $15 carafe of wine at the now-defunct Schillers with his finest bottles  have turned countless customers into regulars at his establishments. McNallys memoir lets readers sidle up to the bar and feel like regulars in his life, too. ___ AP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",https://apnews.com/article/keith-mcnally-regret-book-review-21d5881808440f6323cfe2f64f90d8f7,business
Cyprus and Israel seek to quickly establish an electricity linkup via an undersea cable,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP)  Cyprus and neighboring Israel are seeking to swiftly establish an electricity linkup via an undersea cable that would eliminate their respective energy isolation, an official said Monday. Energy Minister George Papanastasiou said that Israel is particularly keen to ensure that it can rely on Cypriot energy reserves from both conventional and renewable sources to power the country if the need ever arises. Pananastasiou told The Associated Press that Cyprus would soon have the capacity to generate around four gigawatts of electricity from fossil fuels as well as solar and wind sources, while consuming only 0.5 GW. Wind turbines and photovoltaics generate 1 GW of electricity, but licenses have been issued for construction of new wind and solar energy parks with a capacity of 2.8 GW. Conventional fuels generate 1.4 GW. The shared commitment for an electricity cable link was affirmed Sunday when Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a daylong visit to Israel and Ramallah, West Bank. Both leaders said that the electricity link would showcase the two countries geographical location as the natural gateways between Europe and the Middle East. Papanastasiou said given this geographical advantage, the two leaders agreed to pursue the potential benefits from the establishment of a trade, energy and digital connectivity corridor between India, the Middle East and Europe. 
        
     The corridor, known as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, or IMEC, was unveiled at the India-hosted Group of 20 summit of the worlds leading rich and developing nations in 2023.  Netanyahu said Sunday that he had recently spoken with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi about IMEC, which he said was a very revolutionary and transformative development that we want to bring into place. Separately, an electricity cable project to link Greece with Cyprus is already underway. The 1.94 billion-euro ($2.19 billion) Great Seas Interconnector, or GSI, is partly funded by the European Union to the tune of 800 million euros ($903 million). Progress has been slowed because of Turkish objections over the cables course. Turkey says the project cant proceed without its consent because the cable would pass through waters it claims are under its jurisdiction.",https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-israel-india-imec-electricity-cable-corridor-e0fac3a0c5d53824266016b4ae17bcfa,business
"AI developers should counter misinformation and protect fact-based news, global media groups say","GENEVA (AP)  A global group of broadcasters and publishers is calling on artificial intelligence developers to make sure their technology serves the public by helping to counter misinformation and protect the value of fact-based news. The Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union, an association of public broadcasters thats also known for running the popular Eurovision Song Contest, says it and the World Association of News Publishers and other partners want to cooperate with tech companies behind AI.  The group says thousands of public and private media in broadcast, print and online formats have joined the News Integrity in the Age of AI initiative, whose five core steps were announced Monday at the World News Media Congress in Krakow, Poland. The initiative is calling for news content to only be used in generative AI models with the authorization of the content originator, and for clarity about attribution and accuracy. It says the original news source behind AI-generated material must be apparent and accessible. Organizations and institutions that see truth and facts as the desirable core of a democracy and the foundation of an empowered society should now come together at one table to shape the next era, said Ladina Heimgartner, president of the publishers association and CEO of Switzerlands Ringier Media.  Among the media affiliates along with EBU and WAN-IFRA  as the association of news publishers is known  are Latin American broadcasters association AIL; the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union; and the North American Broadcasters Association, which counts Fox, Paramount, NBC Universal and PBS among its members.  
        
     Since AI surged into public awareness with the launch of OpenAIs ChatGPT in November 2022, legacy media have grappled with how best to use the technology, and whether to cooperate with or even combat the companies behind it.  The New York Times and other newspapers have filed a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and business partner Microsoft. The Times has said the tech companies have threatened its livelihood by effectively stealing billions of dollars worth of work by its journalists. Many news outlets have struck deals with OpenAI, including the Associated Press. which has a licensing and technology deal with it as well as with Google for delivery of news through its Gemini AI chatbot.

Barstool Sports founder retracts Auschwitz tour offer to customer in antisemitic sign incident,"PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said he would send two customers to tour a former Nazi concentration camp after they allegedly engaged in antisemitic behavior at a Barstool pub in Philadelphia, then later retracted that offer for at least one of them because he said the person was denying responsibility for what happened. Portnoy said in posts on social media that in an initial conversation Sunday the customer took 100% responsibility for his actions with his friend and agreed to take a learning trip to Auschwitz in Poland. But on Monday, Portnoy posted that the customer did a 180 and told him he had nothing to do with the antisemitic behavior and that he was just being a citizen journalist by sharing video of what happened. His trip to Poland has been revoked, Portnoy said in the post. Whatever ramifications come his way he 100% earned. It wasnt clear if the trip had been revoked for the other customer. In a video posted on social media Saturday night, a woman at the bar who appears to be a server holds a sign with an anti-Jewish message on it while a man repeats the message multiple times. The bar said in a statement posted to social media that several employees, against their training and organizations written discrimination policies, complied with a customers request for the sign in connection with ordering bottle service.  
        
     We are saddened, embarrassed, and frustrated by the deplorable actions of a customer and misguided staff, Barstool Samson Street said in the post. Portnoy said two bar employees had been fired over the incident.  Philadelphia police said they were investigating. No charges were immediately filed. Temple University said one of the customers is believed to be one of their students. The student was put on interim suspension while an investigation continues, President John Fry said in a statement posted on the universitys website.  Fry called antisemitism abhorrent and said he would take further action if other students were involved. It has no place at Temple and acts of hatred and discrimination against any person or persons are not tolerated at this university, Fry said.  Kappa Delta Rho said in a post on its website that it is also investigating because the customer involved was allegedly a member of their fraternity at Temple.  To be clear, our organization firmly opposes all forms of hate, which have no place in our fraternity, said Xavier Romano, executive director of the national fraternity. Portnoy, who is Jewish, had said he hoped to turn the event into a teachable moment. He did not initially identify the culprits, but identified one of them on Monday when saying he would not be sending them to Auschwitz. The customer didnt immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Portnoy said he has experienced increased antisemitism, as the war between Israel and Hamas continues. He founded Barstool Sports in 2003, a digital platform covering sports, lifestyle and entertainment, in the Boston area. He also owns several Barstool bars in locations around the country.",https://apnews.com/article/barstool-antisemitism-temple-university-philadelphia-auschwitz-72c7d507b4feb70e6fe0c8eed29b89b0,business
"New York Times wins 4 Pulitzers, New Yorker 3; Washington Post wins for coverage of Trump shooting","NEW YORK (AP)  The New York Times won four Pulitzer Prizes and the New Yorker three on Monday for journalism in 2024 that touched on topics like the fentanyl crisis, the U.S. military and last summers assassination attempt on President Donald Trump.

Kavitha Surana, Lizzie Presser, Cassandra Jaramillo and Stacy Kranitz were honored for reporting on pregnant women who died after doctors delayed urgent care in states with strict abortion laws. The Washington Post won for urgent and illuminating breaking news coverage of the Trump assassination attempt. The Pulitzers honored Ann Telnaes, who quit the Post in January after the news outlet refused to run her editorial cartoon lampooning tech chiefs  including Post owner Jeff Bezos  cozying up to Trump. The Pulitzers praised her fearlessness. The Pulitzers honored the best in journalism from 2024 in 15 categories, along with eight arts categories including books, music and theater. The public service winner receives a gold medal. All other winners receive $15,000. The New York Times showed its breadth with awards honoring reporting from Afghanistan, Sudan, Baltimore and Butler, Pennsylvania.

The Times Azam Ahmed and Christina Goldbaum and contributing writer Matthieu Aikins won an explanatory reporting prize for examining U.S. policy failures in Afghanistan. Declan Walsh and the Times staff won for an investigation into the Sudan conflict. The Times was also part of a collaboration with The Baltimore Banner, whose reporters Alissa Zhu, Nick Thieme and Jessica Gallagher won in local reporting for stories on that citys fentanyl crisis and its disproportionate effect on Black men. The Banner was created three years ago, with several staffers who had left the Baltimore Sun. This is a huge milestone for us, editor in chief Kimi Yoshino said in an interview. I told the newsroom today that never in my wildest dreams did I think we would be here at this moment. It is a testament to the power of local news, the need for local news and what journalists can do when they focus on important stories in our community. The Banner created a statistical model that it shared with journalists in cities like Boston, Chicago and San Francisco for stories there, she said. Reuters won for its own investigative series on fentanyl, showing how lax regulation both inside and outside the United States makes the drug inexpensive and widely available. inewsource.org in San Diego was a finalist in the illustrated reporting and commentary category for its stories on fentanyl. The New Yorkers Mosab Abu Toha won for his commentaries on Gaza. The magazine also won for its In the Dark podcast about the killing of Iraqi civilians by the U.S. military and in feature photography for Moises Samans pictures of the Sednaya prison in Syria. The Wall Street Journal won a Pulitzer for its reporting on Elon Musk, including his turn to conservative politics, his use of legal and illegal drugs and his private conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Pulitzer board said. The Journal was also a finalist for its cool-headed reporting on the plight of Evan Gershkovich, who was imprisoned in Russia. The Pulitzers also gave a special citation to the late Chuck Stone for his work covering the civil rights movement. The pioneering journalist was the first Black columnist at the Philadelphia Daily News and founded the National Association of Black Journalists. Mark Warren of Esquire won the feature writing prize for his portrait of a Baptist pastor and small-town mayor who died by suicide after his secret online life was exposed by a right-wing news site.

Federal investigators say a utility wasnt marked before a deadly natural gas explosion in Missouri,"LEXINGTON, Mo. (AP)  A deadly explosion that leveled one Missouri home and damaged two others happened after a subcontractor drilled into an unmarked underground gas main while installing fiber optic cable, the National Transportation Safety Board announced Monday. One person was killed and two others were injured in the April 9 explosion in the 4,500-person town of Lexington, Missouri, which is about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of downtown Kansas City. Liberty Utilities, a subsidiary of Algonquin Power and Utilities Corporation, sent someone out to mark its lines before the subcontractor began digging, but the uncapped gas main section involved in the accident wasnt identified, the NTSB said in its preliminary report. A few hours before the explosion, the subcontractor felt their drill strike something and smelled odorized natural gas. The crew supervisor then called 911. Firefighters and a crew with Liberty Utilities arrived and worked to stop the flow of gas. One business about 15 feet (4.6 meters) from the leak was evacuated. But several other nearby buildings were not evacuated, including the destroyed and damaged homes, which ranged from 80 feet to 160 feet (24 to 49 meters) from the leak, the NTSB said. The NTSB said it continues to investigate the evacuation procedures and Liberty Utilities repair history, record keeping and emergency response. The utility responded in a statement that federal regulations limit what it can disclose about what it described as a terrible tragedy. We will continue to do our part to help those affected and support broader recovery efforts, the statement said. ___ This story has been updated to correct that Lexington is 55 miles east of Kansas City, not west.",https://apnews.com/article/home-explosion-gas-lexington-missouri-d6bb9012e15e31cf45b3c9009c2e9bc0,business
Mattel plans to raise prices on some toys to offset tariff costs,"NEW YORK (AP)  Mattel Inc., the maker of Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels cars and other popular toys, said Monday that it would have to raise prices for some products sold in the U.S. where necessary to offset higher costs related to President Donald Trumps tariffs. The El Segundo, California-based company said the increases are necessary even though it is speeding up its plans to diversify its manufacturing base away from China. Trump imposed a 145% tariff on most Chinese-made products.  Company executives told analysts on a conference call that China currently accounts for 40% of Mattels global production. The company plans to move roughly 500 products this year from manufacturers in China to sources in other countries, compared to 280 products last year.  For some highly sought after toys, Mattel said it would enlist factories in more than one country. To prevent possible shortages, the company said it was focusing on getting products to stores without interruptions.  The company said that even with price increases it expects 40% to 50% of its toys will cost customers $20 or less.  The diversified and flexible supply chain in global commercial organizations are clear advantages to Mattel in this period of uncertainty, CEO and Chairman Ynon Kreiz told analysts.  Citing the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the presidents trade policies, however, Mattel withdrew its annual earnings forecast on Monday. The company said it would be difficult to predict consumer spending and the companys U.S. sales for the remainder of the year without more information.  
        
     Mattel reported larger-than expected first-quarter sales but also a wider loss. Mattel said sales rose 2% to $827 million for the quarter that ended March 31. The companys loss expanded to $40.3 million, or 12 cents per share, in the quarter. That compares with a loss of $28.3 million, or 8 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Analysts expected a loss of 10 cents on sales of $786.1 million for the first quarter, according to FactSet.

Fishermen sue Mississippi over plan to lease oyster reefs,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP)  A group of more than 20 fishermen, led by Mississippi Commercial Fisheries United Inc., a nonprofit trade organization, are suing the state over its attempts to lease historically public oyster reefs in the Mississippi Sound.  In a statement, MSCFU cited a 2024 bill that allows private individuals and companies to lease up to 80% of Mississippis natural oyster reefs.  Over the past several years, the Mississippi State Legislature has attempted to implement an unconstitutional private leasing regime, the statement read. These vague and discriminatory acts, if implemented, would unjustly exclude our current oyster fishing families from their direct access to harvest from reefs that they rely upon for their livelihoods.  The lawsuit, filed in Harrison County on Thursday, also names the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources and its Executive Director Joe Spraggins as defendants.  When reached for comment, MDMR referred The Associated Press to the Mississippi Attorney Generals office, which said it could not comment on active litigation.  MDMR frames the leasing plan as a way to increase oyster production while ensuring compliance and environmental and conservation requirements.  The lawsuit comes as the states oyster industry is recovering after massive freshwater flooding, released through Louisiannas Bonnet Carr Spillway, killed almost all the oysters on Mississippis most productive reefs in 2019.",https://apnews.com/article/oyster-lawsuit-mississippi-fishermen-lease-0d3ec2966107718be921b58ebf319da8,business
Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. Heres what we know,"NEW YORK (AP)  President Donald Trump is eyeing Hollywood for his next round of tariffs, threatening to levy all films produced outside the U.S. at a steep rate of 100%. Over the weekend, Trump accused other countries of stealing the movie-making capabilities of the U.S. and said that he had authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to immediately begin the process of implementing this new import tax on all foreign-made films. But further specifics or dates werent provided. And the White House confirmed that no final decisions had been made as of Monday. Trump later said that he would meet with industry executives about the proposal but a lot remains unclear about how an import tax on complex, international productions could even be implemented.  If imposed, experts warn that such a tariff would dramatically hike the costs of making movies today. That uncertainty could put filmmakers in limbo, much like other industries that have recently been caught in the crosshairs of todays ongoing trade wars. Unlike other sectors that have recently been targeted by tariffs, however, movies go beyond physical goods, bringing larger intellectual property ramifications into question. Heres what we know. 
        
     Trump is citing national security concerns, a justification hes similarly used to impose import taxes on certain countries and a range of sector-specific goods. In a Sunday night post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump claimed that the American movie industry is DYING to a very fast death as other countries offer all sorts of incentives to draw filmmaking away from the U.S.  Trump has previously voiced concern about movie production moving overseas. And in recent years, U.S. film and television production has been hampered between setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Incentive programs have also long-influenced where movies are shot both abroad and within the U.S., with more production leaving California to states like Georgia and New Mexico -- as well as countries like Canada. But unlike other sectors targeted by Trumps recently-imposed tariffs, the American film industry currently holds a trade deficit thats in the U.S.'s favor. In movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelmingly dominate the domestic marketplace. Data from the Motion Picture Association also shows that American films made $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus in 2023  with a recent report noting that these films generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the world for the U.S. Last year, international markets accounted for over 70% of Hollywoods total box office revenue, notes Heeyon Kim, an assistant professor of strategy at Cornell University. She warns that tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries impacting this industry could result in billions of dollars in lost earnings and thousands of jobs. To me, (this) makes just no sense, she said, adding that such tariffs could undermine otherwise a thriving part of the U.S. economy. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers across the U.S. and Canada, said in a statement Monday that Trump had correctly recognized the urgent threat from international competition that the American film and television industry faces today. But the union said it instead recommended the administration implement a federal production tax incentive and other provisions to level the playing field while not harming the industry overall. Thats anyones guess. Traditional tariffs apply to physical imports crossing borders, but film production primarily involves digital services  shooting, editing and post-production work that happens electronically, notes Ann Koppuzha, a lawyer and business law lecturer at Santa Clara Universitys Leavey School of Business. Koppuzha said that film production is more like an applied service that can be taxed, not tariffed. But taxes require Congressional approval, which could be a challenge even with a Republican majority. Making a movie is also an incredibly complex  and international  process. Its common for both large and small films to include production in the U.S. and in other countries. Big-budget movies like the upcoming Mission: Impossible  The Final Reckoning, for instance, are shot around the world. U.S. studios frequently shoot abroad because tax incentives can aid production costs. But a blanket tariff across the board could discourage that or limit options, Kim said  hurting both Hollywood films and the global industry that helps create them. When you make these sort of blanket rules, youre missing some of the nuance of how production works, added Steven Schiffman, a longtime industry veteran and adjunct professor at Georgetown University. Sometimes you just need to go to the location, because frankly its way too expensive just to try to create in a soundstage Schiffman points to popular titles filmed outside the U.S.  such as Warner Bros Harry Potter series, which was almost entirely shot in the U.K. The cost to have done that would have like literally double to produce those movies under this proposed tariff, he said. Overall, experts warn that the prospect of tariffing foreign-made movies ventures into uncharted waters. Theres simply no precedent or sense for applying tariffs to these types of creative services, Koppuzha said. And while the Trump administration could extend similar threats to other forms of intellectual property, like music, theyd encounter the same practical hurdles. But if successful, some also warn of potential retaliation. Kim points to quotas that some countries have had to help boost their domestic films by ensuring they get a portion of theater screens, for example. Many have reduced or suspended such quotas over the years in the name of open trade  but if the U.S. places a sweeping tariff on all foreign-made films, these kinds of quotas could come back, which would hurt Hollywood film or any of the U.S.-made intellectual property, Kim said. And while U.S. dominance in film means there are fewer substitutes for retaliation, Schiffman notes that other forms of entertainment  like game development  could see related impacts down the road. Others stress the potential consequences of hampering international collaboration overall. Creative content distribution requires thoughtful economic approaches that recognize how modern storytelling flows across borders, notes Frank Albarella, U.S. media and telecommunications sector leader at KPMG. The question hanging over every screen: Might we better nurture American storytelling through smart, targeted incentives, or could we inadvertently force audiences to pay more for what could become a narrower creative landscape? __________ AP Writers Jake Coyle and Jill Colvin in New York, Aamer Madhani in Palm Beach, Florida and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-foreign-movies-films-8008248fc08c748a7e8a174306ba66ba,business
Florida jury awards man $3M for defective airbag that caused serious injury during crash,"MIAMI (AP)  A South Florida jury has awarded $3 million to a man who was severely injured by a defective airbag in a 2020 crash. Miami-Dade jurors reached a verdict for Jose Hernandez on Thursday, according to court records. He had filed a lawsuit in 2022 against Takata Airbag Tort Compensation Trust Fund, which was formed during Takatas bankruptcy Hernandez was driving his 2005 Honda Civic in Miami in December 2020 when another vehicle hit him as he tried to make a left turn, his attorneys said. The collision should have caused only minor injuries, but the cars Takata airbag inflator improperly exploded, shooting a piece of metal shrapnel several inches long into Hernandezs right arm, the lawsuit said. Attorneys for the Takata trust didnt immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment. At least 28 deaths have been linked to Takata air bag inflators in the U.S. and at least 36 worldwide, according to regulators. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Large-scale recalls began in 2013. Takata used ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate over time due to high heat and humidity and explode with too much force. That can blow apart a metal canister and send shrapnel into the passenger compartment.",https://apnews.com/article/crash-airbag-takata-florida-award-cc06c52796f07906541bf154b5fb98a7,business
"Ann Telnaes, who quit Washington Post in protest, wins Pulitzer for fearlessness in commentary","NEW YORK (AP)  A longtime editorial cartoonist for The Washington Post who quit in protest early this year after editors killed her sketch criticizing the Post owner and other media chief executives working to curry favor with Trump has won the Pulitzer Prize for illustrated reporting and commentary. Ann Telnaes won for delivering piercing commentary on powerful people and institutions with deftness, creativity  and a fearlessness that led to her departure from the news organization after 17 years, according to the Pulitzer announcement on Monday. Her cartoon showed a group of media executives bowing before then President-elect Donald Trump while offering him bags of money, including Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Several executives, Bezos among them, had been spotted around that time at Trumps Florida club Mar-a-Lago. Telnaes accused them of having lucrative government contracts and working to eliminate regulations. Amazon also donated $1 million to Trumps inauguration fund. When she quit the newspaper earlier this year, Telnaes that shed never before had a sketch killed because of the point of view inherent in the cartoons commentary. She called that a game-changer and dangerous for a free press. As an editorial cartoonist, my job is to hold powerful people and institutions accountable, Telnaes wrote on the online platform Substack in early January. For the first time, my editor prevented me from doing that critical job. So I have decided to leave the Post. I doubt my decision will cause much of a stir and that it will be dismissed because Im just a cartoonist. But I will not stop holding truth to power through my cartooning, because as they say Democracy dies in darkness. 
        
     David Shipley, the newspapers editorial page editor at the time, said in a statement after Telnaes quit that he decided to nix the cartoon because the paper had just published a column on the same topic. Shipley then resigned in late February after Bezos, in a major shift, directed that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The fallout continued in March when a longtime columnist, Ruth Marcus, quit after she said the newspapers management decided not to run her commentary critical of Bezos policy.  The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years, Its internal strife largely began last June when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists have since left for other jobs. Bezos decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate  after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris  led to an exodus of subscribers.",https://apnews.com/article/ann-telnaes-pulitzer-washington-post-quit-protest-4c1855566d0b02ea04d465e7aa39e070,business
Ford says its Q1 profit fell by two-thirds and it expects a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs this year,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP)  Ford Motor Co. says it expects to take a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year and is withdrawing its full-year financial guidance due to the uncertainty created by the Trump administrations evolving trade policy.  Ford said Monday that its net income fell by about two-thirds in the first quarter to $473 million, or 12 cents per share, from $1.33 billion, or 33 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue dropped 5% to $40.66 billion.  The results topped the expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet, who forecast earnings per share for the quarter would be flat. Revenue was forecast to be $38.02 billion. Still, the stock fell more than 2% in after-hours trading.  Last week, General Motors said it is bracing for a potential impact from auto tariffs as high as $5 billion in 2025. Ford and Tesla are expected to see a smaller impact from tariffs than GM and other automakers because they assemble more of their cars in the U.S. Still, what impact they do see wont be insignificant.  Ford originally forecast 2025 earnings before interest and taxes in a range of $7 billion to $8.5 billion, but on Monday the company said the risks associated with tariffs make updating full year guidance challenging right now given the potential range of outcomes.  Ford CEO Jim Farley has been touting the advantage that higher domestic production gives his company and he did so again Monday, while acknowledging that the shake-up to the industry from tariffs is still in its early stages.  
        
     Its too early to gauge the related market dynamics, including the potential industrywide supply chain disruptions, said Farley said on an earnings call with analysts. Automakers with the largest U.S. footprint will have a big advantage, and, boy, that is that true for Ford. It puts us in the pole position. President Donald Trump says one goal of his trade policy is to move more manufacturing of products such as autos back to the U.S. Last week Trump signed executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts in a move the president said would allow automakers more time to transition their manufacturing operations.  Automakers and independent analyses have indicated that the tariffs could raise prices, reduce sales and make U.S. production less competitive worldwide.  The potential impact of tariffs dominated Fords earnings calls, with one executive noting how just a little trouble with a few parts could have a dramatic effect.  The rare earth materials from China, for example, how they are imported, not just for us, but for the entire industry, has become rather complicated over the last few weeks, said Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra. It would take only a few parts to potentially cause some disruption into our production.",https://apnews.com/article/ford-tariffs-net-income-gm-trump-549d908f4dc0e4c2383a7ccd7a326d67,business
F1s governing body studying cost cap and ponders McLarens proposal on paying to lodge complaints,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)  The president of Formula 1s governing body is studying the cost cap that teams operate under and is considering eliminating it because managing it has become such a headache for the FIA.  Mohammed Ben Sulayem also said before the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday that he supports a proposal floated by McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown that would require teams making any allegations against another to lodge a formal complaint with a monetary deposit. Brown suggested the money would be returned if the allegations proved true, but it should count against the cost cap if unproven as a deterrent to baseless and damaging claims.  Ben Sulayem wants to adopt the rule, but is studying if it should count against the cost cap. That then led him to vocalize his frustration with the entire cost cap system, in which the FIA must review each teams annual spending and make sure they are within the budget.  Im looking at the cost cap and its just giving the FIA a headache. So whats the point of it? Ben Sulayem said in his trackside office about an hour before the race around Hard Rock Stadium.  I dont see the point. I really dont.  The cost cap was introduced in 2021 with new rules that restricts spending and a sliding scale of aerodynamic and CFD testing  financial regulations that has made the competition closer. The cost caps prevent the bigger teams from being able to endlessly spend on development that the smaller teams cannot afford.  
        
     The cost cap for the 2025 season is $140.4 million. As for Browns idea, which Brown raised in Miami by using a bottled labeled TIRE WATER to troll Red Bull Racings accusations that McLaren is using water to manipulate its tire temperatures, Ben Sulayem was in full agreement on charging teams to lodge an allegation.  You cannot just accuse someone without a written complaint, and that protest, you have to pay money, said Ben Sulayem, who even tossed out $50,000 as the potential fee charged. Finally, Ben Sulayem said he expects clarification to the driver code of conduct policy to be completed next week, but he was explicit in that he wont be lifting the ban on profanity. Drivers as of this season can be fined for cursing when in official FIA appearances and the rule has been highly criticized by drivers from multiple series managed by the governing body.  Ben Sulayem said the clarifications coming will address how the code of conduct is applied to individual series, but he wont be lifting the cursing restriction. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",https://apnews.com/article/f1-ben-sulayem-a6509003abc8cf260c9afa0d5d90f3ee,business
"Trump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, saying the movie industry in the US is dying","NEW YORK (AP)  President Donald Trump is opening a new salvo in his tariff war, targeting films made outside the U.S. In a post Sunday night on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he has authorized the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to slap a 100% tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death, he wrote, complaining that other countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw filmmakers and studios away from the U.S. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! The White House said Monday that it was figuring out how to comply with the presidents wishes. Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trumps directive to safeguard our countrys national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again, said spokesperson Kush Desai. Its common for both large and small films to include production in the U.S. and in other countries. Big-budget movies like the upcoming Mission: Impossible  The Final Reckoning, for instance, are shot around the world. Incentive programs for years have influenced where movies are shot, increasingly driving film production out of California and to other states and countries with favorable tax incentives, like Canada and the United Kingdom. 
        
     Yet Trumps tariffs are designed to lead consumers toward American products. And in movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelmingly dominate the domestic marketplace. China has ramped up its domestic movie production, culminating in the animated blockbuster Ne Zha 2 grossing more than $2 billion this year. But even then, its sales came almost entirely from mainland China. In North America, it earned just $20.9 million. In New Zealand, where successive governments have offered rebates and incentives in recent years to draw Hollywood films to the country, the film industry has generated billions of dollars in tourism revenue driven by the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, which featured the countrys pristine and scenic vistas. More recently, the blockbuster Minecraft movie was filmed entirely in New Zealand, and U.S. productions in 2023 delivered $1.3 billion New Zealand dollars ($777 million) to the country in return for NZ$200 million in subsidies, according to government figures. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was awaiting more details of Trumps measures before commenting on them but would continue to pitch to filmmakers abroad, including in Indias Bollywood. Weve got an absolutely world class industry, he said. This is the best place to make movies, period, in the world. The Motion Picture Association, which represents major U.S. film studios and streaming services, didnt immediately respond to messages Sunday evening. The MPAs data shows how much Hollywood exports have dominated cinemas. According to the MPA, the American movies produced $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus in 2023.  Trump, a Republican, has made good on the tariff man label he gave himself years ago, slapping new taxes on goods made in countries around the globe. That includes a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with even higher levies threatened. By unilaterally imposing tariffs, Trump has exerted extraordinary influence over the flow of commerce, creating political risks and pulling the market in different directions. There are tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, with more imports, including pharmaceutical drugs, set to be subject to new tariffs in the weeks ahead. Trump has long voiced concern about movie production moving overseas. Shortly before he took office, he announced that he had tapped actors Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone to serve as special ambassadors to Hollywood to bring it BACK  BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE! U.S. film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Overall production in the U.S. was down 26% last year compared with 2021, according to data from ProdPro, which tracks production.  The groups annual survey of executives, which asked about preferred filming locations, found no location in the U.S. made the top five, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Toronto, the U.K., Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia came out on top, with California placing sixth, Georgia seventh, New Jersey eighth and New York ninth. The problem is especially acute in California. In the greater Los Angeles area, production last year was down 5.6% from 2023 according to FilmLA, second only to 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. Last, October, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, proposed expanding Californias Film & Television Tax Credit program to $750 million annually, up from $330 million.  Other U.S. cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago and San Francisco have also used aggressive tax incentives to lure film and TV productions. Those programs can take the form of cash grants, as in Texas, or tax credits, which Georgia and New Mexico offer. Other nations have been stealing the movie-making capabilities from the United States, Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday night after returning from a weekend in Florida. If theyre not willing to make a movie inside the United States we should have a tariff on movies that come in. ___ Associated Press writers Gary Fields in Washington and Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-films-hollywood-tariff-movies-415367dff6ae5bb7dc0871db5ac97d48,business
"Federal Reserve likely to defy Trump, keep rates unchanged this week","WASHINGTON (AP)  The Federal Reserve will likely keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, despite weeks of harsh criticism and demands from President Donald Trump that the Fed reduce borrowing costs.  After causing a sharp drop in financial markets two weeks ago by saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump subsequently backed off and said he had no intention of doing so. Still, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said the Fed should cut rates.  They argue that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked.  Separately, Elon Musk, the head of Trumps Department of Government Efficiency, last Wednesday suggested that DOGE should look more closely at the Feds spending on its facilities.  The heightened scrutiny shows that even as the Trump administration backs off its threats to fire Powell, the Fed is still subject to unusually sharp political pressures, despite its status as an independent agency.  Even so, the Fed will almost certainly leave its key rate unchanged at about 4.3% when it meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Powell and many of the other 18 officials that sit on the Feds rate-setting committee have said they want to see how Trumps tariffs affect the economy before making any moves. Trump, however, on Friday said on the social media platform Truth Social that there is NO INFLATION and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon.  
        
     Thats not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined  gas costs are down 10% from a year ago  continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon. Inflation did drop noticeably in March, an encouraging sign, though in the first three months of the year it was 3.6%, according to the Feds preferred gauge, well above its 2% target.  Without tariffs, economists say its possible the Fed would soon reduce its benchmark rate, because it is currently at a level intended to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Yet the Fed cant now cut rates with Trumps broad tariffs likely to raise prices in the coming months.  Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY, said that the Fed is scarred by what happened in 2021, when prices rose amid supply snarls and Powell and other Fed officials said the increase would likely be transitory. Instead, inflation soared to a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.  This time they will be more cautious, he said.  Thats a Fed that is going to have to wait for evidence and be slow to adjust on that evidence, Reinhart said.  Plus, Trumps badgering of Powell makes it harder for the Fed chair to cut rates because doing so anytime soon would be seen as knuckling under to the White House, said Preston Mui, an economist at Employ America.  You could imagine a world where there isnt pressure from the Trump administration and they cut rates ... sooner, because they feel comfortable making the argument that theyre doing so because of the data, he said. For his part, Powell said last month that tariffs would likely push up inflation and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the Fed. The central bank would typically raise rates  or at least keep them elevated  to fight inflation, while it would cut them to spur the economy if unemployment rose.  Powell has said that the impact of the tariffs on inflation could be temporary  a one-time price increase  but most recently said it could also be more persistent. That suggests that Powell will want to wait, potentially for months, to ensure tariffs dont sustainably raise inflation before considering a rate cut.  Some economists forecast the Fed wont cut rates until its September meeting, or even later.  Yet Fed officials could move sooner if the tariffs hit the economy hard enough to cause layoffs and push up unemployment. Wall Street investors appear to expect such an outcome  they project that the first cut will occur in July, according to futures pricing.  Separately, Musk criticized the Fed Wednesday for spending $2.5 billion on an extensive renovation of two of its buildings in Washington, D.C.  Since at the end of the day, this is all taxpayer money, we should certainly look to see if indeed the Federal Reserve is spending $2.5 billion on their interior designer, Musk said. Thats an eyebrow raiser. Fed officials acknowledge that the cost of the renovations have risen as prices for building materials and labor have spiked amid the post-pandemic inflation. And former Fed officials, speaking on background, say that local regulations forced the Fed to do more of the expansion underground, rather than making the buildings taller, which added to the cost.  Meanwhile, Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and a potential candidate to replace Powell as chair when Powells term expires next year, said recently that the Fed has attracted greater scrutiny because of its failure to keep prices in check.  The Feds current wounds are largely self-inflicted, he said in a speech during an International Monetary Fund conference in late April, in which he also slammed the Fed for participating in a global forum on climate change. A strategic reset is necessary to mitigate losses of credibility, changes in standing, and most important, worse economic outcomes for our fellow citizens. Powell, for his part, said last month that Fed independence is very widely understood and supported in Washington, in Congress, where it really matters.",https://apnews.com/article/inflation-trump-fed-rates-dda543c3c00fda34e37e09119d9a9709,business
A massive coastal restoration project is in peril amid claims Louisiana concealed a critical report,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP)  An ambitious project to restore a rapidly vanishing stretch of Louisiana coast that was devastated by the 2010 Gulf oil spill has been thrown deeper into disarray amid claims by Gov. Jeff Landry that his predecessor concealed an unfavorable study that it was feared could imperil the $3 billion effort. Its a controversy that was even predicted by the previous administration as it grappled with how to handle conflicting environmental analyses for the project, according to a confidential memo obtained by The Associated Press.

John Bel Edwards, left, listens as Attorney General Jeff Landry, right, speaks during a news conference at the Governors Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management, April 6, 2020, in Baton Rouge, La. (Bill Feig/The Advocate via AP, Pool, File) Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, left, listens as Attorney General Jeff Landry, right, speaks during a news conference at the Governors Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management, April 6, 2020, in Baton Rouge, La. (Bill Feig/The Advocate via AP, Pool, File) The nine-page document, prepared by five attorneys working for then-Gov. John Bel Edwards administration, sheds new light on a study Landry says was improperly withheld from the public and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as it was approving a permit for the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion. The stakes were so high the attorneys even weighed whether state officials could face federal charges for withholding from the Corps a report that the diversion would generate significantly less land than another modeling projection used in a federal review. Prosecution seemed extremely unlikely, the lawyers wrote to the heads of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which oversees the diversion project, but they added that the severe consequences and criminalization of the action warranted mention. The attorneys also warned that the Corps might suspend or revoke the permit if it discovered the study after the fact, the 2022 memo shows, foreshadowing actions taken last month when the Corps cited deliberately withheld information among its reasons for suspending its permit for the project. The move halts construction despite more than half a billion dollars already spent.  
        
     They hid the bad stuff and only showed the (Corps) the version they liked, Landry wrote in a post on X. Science is easy when you just delete the inconvenient parts! Edwards denied his administration withheld information from the Corps and said Gov. Landrys accusations are demonstrably false. When all the facts are presented, the public will see that his administration has played political games and botched this important project, Edwards said in a statement to AP. Landry countered in his own statement that the facts speak for themselves.  Amid the finger-pointing, conservation proponents have called the report in question a red herring that Landry is using to tank the project. The diversion, funded mostly from a settlement arising from BPs 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, is the largest of its kind in Louisianas history. The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion would puncture levees in southeast Louisiana, diverting some of the rivers sediment-rich flow to restore wetlands. The long-delayed project was intended to mitigate a disappearing coastline caused by a range of factors such as climate change-induced sea-level rise and the rivers vast levee system. Ground was broken in 2023, but state and federal litigation has stalled it. Opponents have blasted its ballooning cost and crippling effects on the local fishing and oyster industries. Landry has said the project would break Louisianas culture of shrimp and oyster harvesting, likening it to government efforts a century ago to punish schoolchildren for speaking Cajun French.  Earlier this year, Landrys administration approached the Corps with a list of concerns about the project, including a 2022 study it said does not appear to have been disclosed to the public nor considered by all necessary persons within the Corps.  Officials working for the state at the time defended their handling of the report in question, saying it had been focused on analyzing maintenance and operational costs related to the diversion and was not intended to be part of the federal environmental impact statement process.  The report, prepared by AECOM Technical Services and a subcontractor, produced inconsistent results such as a significantly lower projected land creation  as few as 7 square miles (18 square kilometers) compared to the 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) estimated under the primary model, according to the confidential memo.  Officials familiar with the study said its lower projection resulted from not properly accounting for sea level rise and underestimating the rivers flow. The memo also pointed to the need for significant dredging to maintain the diversion channel, which Landrys administration now says will cost tens of millions of dollars.  In the memo, the attorneys outlined a series of reputational concerns about withholding the study and warned it would be more difficult to keep controlling the narrative if the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority is on the defensive. The memo noted the Corps and other federal agencies could delay the project for years if they attempted to integrate the modeling results into their environmental impact analysis. Failing to formally disclose the modeling results to federal agencies like the Corps, the attorneys warned, also would leave the project vulnerable to litigation.  They suggested the Edwards administration informally discuss the issue with federal agencies and then strategize the best way to formally enter it into the public record for the agencies to review. The reports findings eventually were verbally communicated to at least one Corps official, who indicated it was insignificant, according to multiple former Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority officials familiar with the exchange. But the complete analysis itself was not submitted into the public record, nor was the officials response at the time, they said. The former state officials werent authorized to discuss internal deliberations and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.  Col. Cullen Jones, head of the Corps New Orleans District, told Landrys administration last month that the Corps recently conducted a technical review of the modeling analysis in question and concluded it would not affect the permit. But Jones said the Corps suspended the projects permit in part because the State deliberately withheld information  that the State knew it should provide. The Corps also pointed to actions taken by Landrys administration, including a 90-day work stoppage announced last month amid plans to study an alternative smaller diversion and claims the state cant afford the project. Its unclear how Landry intends to respond to the permits suspension. The state has until Monday to take action to dispute the permit suspension. At that point, the Corps could revoke or modify the permit as it sees fit.  Louisianas coastal agency earmarked about $573 million in its 2025 budget for the project, an amount now being reviewed by the legislature. Last fall, federal agencies tasked with managing Deepwater Horizon settlement money warned that if Louisiana backs out of or alters the Mid-Barataria diversion, money allocated for it would need to be returned.  Lauren Bourg, director of the National Audubon Societys Mississippi River Delta program, told lawmakers that ending or altering the project sends the message that any infrastructure project in this state may be undone by a few stakeholders who engage in politics with the right people, distorting the scientific and engineering principles upon which all of these projects are grounded. But many in southeast Louisianas fishing industry applauded the move to halt the project. If all this water comes down, its going to kill everything, said Mitch Jurisich, chairman of the Louisiana Oyster Task Force.  __ Brook reported from New Orleans.

"In battle against transgender rights, Trump targets HUDs housing policies","As a transgender man, the words youre a girl gutted Tazz Webster, a taunt hurled at him from the day he moved into his St. Louis apartment. The government-subsidized buildings manager also insisted on calling Webster by the wrong name, the 38-year-old said, and ridiculed him with shouts of, Youre not a real man!

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Tazz Webster, who ultimately wound up homeless after an apartment manager allegedly ridiculed and shoved him because he is transgender, poses for a photo, April 9, 2025, in St. Louis. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) I just felt like I was being terrorized, Webster told The Associated Press. I felt that I was being judged and mistreated, like I was less of a human being. Then one day in March 2022, the manager shoved Webster so hard he stumbled backward. After regaining his balance, Webster said he pushed the manager back. Four months later he was homeless.  Webster filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity office, the agency tasked with investigating housing discrimination and enforcing the landmark Fair Housing Act that guarantees equal access to housing for all Americans.  Websters harassment allegation was serious enough that it was investigated for more than two years, until the office suddenly notified him in February it was dropping his case without a finding, citing lack of jurisdiction.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) The timing of the closure was not a coincidence. In the months since President Donald Trump took back the White House and installed a loyalist to lead the federal housing department, HUD Secretary Scott Turner and his team have moved swiftly and strategically to undo, uproot and remake the agencys decades of work and priorities.  
        
     In the crosshairs is an intense focus on transgender people, as HUD retreats from long-established fair-housing protections by closing their discrimination complaints and, more broadly, moving to undo the Obama-era Equal Access Rule that cemented transgender peoples rights to discrimination protection in housing. Its time to get rid of all the far-left gender ideology and get government out of the way of what the Lord established from the beginning when he created man in his own image  male and female, Turner said in announcing in February that he was halting enforcement of the Equal Access Rule.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) At issue is the fact that discrimination against LGBTQ+ people wasnt specifically cited in the Fair Housing Act. But the Equal Access Rule enacted in 2012 under former President Barack Obama further defined sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The policy was expanded in 2016 to cover transgender people seeking help at federally funded emergency shelters, escalating opposition from the right.  In 2020, the first Trump administration unsuccessfully moved to relieve shelters of any obligation to serve transgender people. Now, advocates fear an emboldened Trump will go further and forbid shelters from accommodating gender identity altogether, as his administration announces unspecified revisions to the Equal Access Rule.  Our protections cant be a pingpong ball that changes every four years, said Seran Gee, an attorney for Advocates for Trans Equality.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) After being left with permanent injuries in a car crash, Webster, who survives on disability payments, was grateful to move in April 2021 into an apartment near the citys 1,300-acre (526-hectare) Forest Park, scene of the 1904 Worlds Fair and home to museums and a zoo.  His rent was initially less than $200 per month, he said. That is because Branscome Apartments had a contract with the federal government to provide subsidized housing to people with disabilities and low-income seniors. But the HUD money also comes with strings, said Linda Morris, staff attorney for the ACLUs Womens Rights Project, who leads the organizations housing discrimination work.  The Equal Access Rule applies to HUD-funded programs and shelters, said Morris, who doesnt represent Webster. If an entity is going to accept federal funding they have to comply.  Under the rule, HUD-funded housing and programs must provide equal access to everyone regardless of gender identity, and cant require intrusive questioning. Four months after the shoving incident, Webster found his door kicked in and his belongings trashed, even though, he said, he was up to date on his rent and never received an official eviction notice.  Gone were his king-size bed, dishes, Social Security card and birth certificate. Even worse was the loss of the obituary for his mother, who died when he was 12, and her necklace, a treasured memento. I had nothing, said Webster, who had been mostly staying away from the apartment for fear of another run-in with the manager. I was so afraid to be there, I would go to my friends house and spent nights at a time and then come back, switch my clothes, and leave. Court records in an eviction case filed against Webster in April 2022 cited repeated unsuccessful efforts to serve him. After he was gone, the case was dropped.  Last August, Webster filed a lawsuit in Missouri state court alleging he was illegally evicted.  There was never a court order allowing them to change the locks, allowing them to throw away his belongings, said attorney KB Doman of Arch City Defenders, an advocacy group representing Webster.  The suit seeks $25,000 in property damage and for severe emotional stress and trauma. The apartment has denied the allegations in court filings. Stephen Strum, the attorney representing the building, declined the APs requests for comment on the HUD case and said the pending lawsuit merely alleges that my client did not properly follow the steps for evicting. To Doman, Websters case reflects a larger trend.  A lot of people that would have some recourse, at least through HUD investigating, really are just out on their own now, she said. Its going to be harder for trans people to find safe, stable housing, and its very hard already.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Since Turner took the helm at HUD, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has instructed staff to pause investigations of all gender identity discrimination cases, according to two HUD attorneys who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or benefits.  One said letters were then issued closing the cases for lack of jurisdiction. HUD has not disclosed how many cases have been dropped.  Websters letter and another provided to the AP cite Trumps executive order calling for the federal government to define sex as only male or female.  Morris, of the ACLU, said she has never seen an executive order cited in a jurisdictional closure of a complaint.  So thats really alarming, said Morris, who described the closures as very much consistent with this administrations broader attacks on trans people and on civil rights more broadly.  Asked about policy changes concerning transgender discrimination, HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said the agency was enforcing the Fair Housing Act while implementing Trumps executive order restoring biological truth to the federal government.  In a statement citing Trumps order, she said government policy recognizes two sexes that are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Bea Gonzalez, a transgender man, was kicked out of a suburban St. Louis domestic violence shelter on a chilly night in November 2021, along with his three children, then 2, 5 and 7.  The family was just settling into a room after filling out paperwork at Bridgeway Behavioral Health Womens Center when Gonzalez was told they had to go because he disclosed he was a transgender man.  I wasnt about to go back into the closet, the 33-year-old said of his insistence on telling the truth even after it was suggested he keep his trans identity secret.  He needed a domestic violence shelter, he said, for greater security for the children and because he feared for his safety as a trans man in a mens shelter, some of which dont accept children anyway. The city had no domestic violence shelters for men, said his attorney Kalila Jackson. In the St. Louis metropolitan area, there was no place else for him to go. There were no other options.  The family was sent to a motel, but when they arrived they discovered it hadnt been paid for, and the organization that sent them there was closed. So I was stranded, said Gonzalez, who did not have a car. I had to call a friend who was able to let us stay for the night.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Jackson said Bridgeway received HUD funding and that its policy of barring transgender men was a violation of the Equal Access Rule and straight up sex discrimination.  Jackson said the message the shelter sent was this: Youre biologically a girl, you should dress as a girl. Since you say that you are a man, we are not going to accept you here. HUD didnt address Gonzalezs or Websters complaints when the AP sought comment on their cases.  HUD investigated Gonzalezs complaint for 2 1/2 years until it suddenly notified him in March the agency was dropping it without a finding. The company operating the shelter, Preferred Family Healthcare, did not respond to the APs requests for comment. After 455 days of being shuttled between six shelters in six cities in two states  Missouri and Illinois  Gonzalez ultimately found stable housing, where his children live with him part time. He sees what happened as part of what he describes as a nationwide federal push to erase trans identity. Advocates are concerned by HUDs shift, noting high rates of discrimination  and homelessness  among people who are LGBTQ+.  Nearly one-third of trans people say they have been homeless at some point in their lives, while 70% who stayed in a shelter reported being harassed, assaulted or kicked out because of their gender identity, according to an Advocates for Trans Equality survey released in 2015, a year before Obama expanded protections for trans people in shelters.  Teens who come out to families who arent accepting are particularly at risk, said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.  Some shelters that might have served them in the past are becoming less welcoming now amid upheaval with the Equal Access Rule, Oliva said. Folks who are trans just wont go if they dont think that theyre going to be treated with respect, she said, adding that is particularly problematic for young people who are vulnerable to sex traffickers and to other types of abuse. Further complicating the situation are seemingly contradictory requirements in new HUD contracts with nonprofits that find permanent housing and run shelters for the homeless. One section stipulates they cant promote gender ideology while another requires compliance with anti-discrimination law, according to a copy provided to the AP. Organizations say they are confused. What is promoting gender ideology? What does that mean? asked Jeannette Ruffins, CEO of Homeward NYC, a nonprofit that runs three permanent housing sites for LGBTQ+ young adults, as well as a homeless shelter.  Does housing LGBTQ young adults promote gender identity? she asked. You know, theyre coming to us. This is already their gender identity. Like Im not promoting it.  Ruffins called a board meeting to discuss potential vulnerabilities on their website, something she said most New York City nonprofits were doing as well. Her organization made small changes to their website, saying they were LGBTQ+ affirming and friendly in a few places rather than LGBTQ+ serving, hoping that will make them less of a target.  In Memphis, Tennessee, a nonprofit that provides emergency shelter for transgender people is looking to increase capacity because of the uncertainty.  Kayla Gore, executive director of My Sistahs House, said it can do that because it doesnt take federal funding. People are confused, Gore said. They dont know what to do because they want to protect their bottom line. Nearly three years after losing his apartment, Webster remains homeless, staying with friends and sometimes sleeping on the floor.  He is on a waiting list for subsidized housing because he cant afford rent otherwise. But he expects the massive federal funding cuts and Trump administration directives banning diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives will make the wait even longer. Lets be honest. This is the world, he said. People, they do hateful things. If you legalize them to hating, then they feel like they have a right.",https://apnews.com/article/transgender-hud-fair-housing-trump-lgbtq-turner-915634741f56f3d5ea265e316cd396bb,business
Copper cable theft in Spain delays thousands of high-speed rail passengers,"MADRID (AP)  Thousands of rail passengers in Spain were hit with delays after copper cables used in the signaling system of a high-speed line traveling south from Madrid to Seville were stolen at five locations, authorities said Monday.  The theft, which happened late Sunday, affected dozens of trains traveling between Madrid and the southern Andalusian cities of Seville, Malaga and Granada as many people were returning home to Spains capital after a holiday weekend. Copper prices are high on global markets, meaning criminals stand to collect big sums of cash from selling the material. Transport Minister Oscar Puente said in an X post that he expected the rail line would fully return to its normal schedule between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. local time (1200 GMT and 1400 GMT). Droves of travelers crowded Madrids Atocha station Monday seeking information about their trains from rail employees and screens with updated departure times. By 9 a.m, Alberto Valero and his family had spent hours at the station because of delays on services to Seville, where they were headed. Valero was on vacation in Spain from Mexico, and expressed frustration about the lack of information. Were here with tourists from everywhere  France, Portugal, Valero said. Everyone is at a loss for what to do because of the total disarray.  The cable theft took place at five points on the high-speed line in Toledo in central Spain, Puente said on X, adding that Spains national police force was investigating the incident. Spains high-speed rail network has expanded rapidly and travels through large stretches of the countrys little-populated countryside. The incident came a week after a blackout in Spain and Portugal grounded high-speed train traffic in Spain to a halt, stranding many passengers for several hours.",https://apnews.com/article/spain-train-delays-cable-theft-highspeed-rail-5a28e93f23e24c77c60749d5db397105,business
Trumps trade demands go beyond tariffs to target perceived unfair practices,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  The Trump administration says the sweeping tariffs it unveiled April 2, then postponed for 90 days, have a simple goal: Force other countries to drop their trade barriers to U.S. goods.  Yet President Donald Trumps definition of trade barriers includes a slew of issues well beyond the tariffs other countries impose on the U.S., including some areas not normally associated with trade disputes. Those include agricultural safety requirements, tax systems, currency exchange rates, product standards, legal requirements, and red tape at the border.  Hes given countries three months to come up with concessions before tariffs ranging from 10% to more than 50% go into effect. Tariffs on China are already in effect. On many issues it will be difficult, or in some cases impossible, for many countries to make a deal and lower their tariff rates. In addition, many trade officials from targeted countries say privately that it isnt always clear what the Trump administration wants from them in the negotiations.  Vice President JD Vance announced that India has agreed to the terms of trade talks with the United States, but other countries are still trying to set the contours for any negotiations. The White House has highlighted conflicting goals for its import taxes: Its seeking to raise revenues and bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but it also wants greater access to foreign markets and massive changes to other nations tax and regulatory policies. Here are several non-tariff areas the administration is targeting: 
        
     CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES Trump has accused Germany, China and Japan of global freeloading by  in his view  devaluing their currencies to make their exports cheaper.  The European Central bank has been cutting interest rates to support growth. That could also weaken the euro, which has strengthened sharply against the dollar since Trump took office. The ECB says it doesnt target the exchange rate.  In Japans case, the Bank of Japan has been gradually raising rates anyway after keeping them at zero or in negative territory for years, which should drive the yen up against the dollar. The U.S. dollar has fallen recently to 140-yen levels, down from about 160 yen last summer. Shrikant Kale, a strategist at Jefferies, believes the dollar will fall to 120 yen over the next 18 months. FARM PRODUCTS Agricultural safeguards against importing pests or health hazards have been a sticking point with U.S. trade partners for years. They include Japans restrictions on rice and potato imports, the EUs ban on hormone-treated beef or chlorine-disinfected chickens and Koreas ban on beef from cows more than 30 months old.  Yet changes face stiff political resistance from voters and farm lobbies in those countries. For years, U.S. potato growers have sought access to Japans potential $150 million market for table potatoes. Japan has engaged in talks but taken years simply to supply a list of concerns to U.S. negotiators. The delay is pure politics, intended to protect domestic growers, says National Potato Council CEO Kam Quarles. If Japanese politicians perceive the pain from Trumps tariffs might be worse than from their own potato growers, that makes it more likely to make a deal, Quarles said.  But if they perceive the pain domestically will be worse than the Trump administration can bring to them ... were going to be stuck where we are. Koreas beef restrictions started as a measure to keep out bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. The 30-month rule has been maintained in the wake of mass protests in 2008, even as the U.S. has become the largest beef exporter to Korea.  Its still politically controversial because of the scar at the time in 2008. I think the government will be very cautious, said Jaemin Lee, professor of law at Seoul National University and an expert on trade issues.  TAXATION Trump has railed against value-added tax as a burden to U.S. companies, although economists say this kind of tax is trade-neutral because it applies equally to imports and exports. Value-added tax, or VAT, is paid by the end purchaser at the cash register but differs from sales taxes in that it is calculated at each stage of the production process. Trumps view could mean higher tariffs for Europe, where individual countries levy VAT of 20% or more depending on the type of good, and for the more than 170 countries that use this kind of tax system. The U.S. is an outlier in that it doesnt use VAT; instead, individual states levy sales taxes. Theres little chance countries will change their tax systems for Trump. The EU for one has said VAT is off the table. The domestic taxation system has not been a conventional topic in trade negotiation because domestic taxation is directly related to national sovereignty or the domestic economic regime, trade expert Lee said. Its very hard to understand why VAT has become an important topic in the trade discussion. PRODUCT STANDARDS U.S. officials have complained about Japans non-recognition of U.S vehicle safety standards and its different testing procedures for car equipment.  Japan also provides subsidies for the Japanese-designed ChaDeMo plug standard for electric cars, requiring foreign makers to use an outdated technology if they want the subsidy.  BUREAUCRACY Concerns about excessive or baffling bureaucratic procedures to get goods into a country are mentioned repeatedly in the administrations latest trade assessment. The U.S. has complained about expensive delays getting permission to export seafood to Japan. Meanwhile, Japan requires wheat imports to be sold to a government entity and has highly regulated and intransparent quota system that keeps rice imports from the U.S. to a minimum. Most of these issues are years old, raising questions about whether 90 days is enough to make a deal over them.  U.S. pharmaceutical companies have complained about Koreas system for drug imports, while automakers say environmental equipment standards are unclear and expose only importers to criminal penalties in case of violations. BUY AMERICAN Analysts say that despite the long list of non-tariff issues, the administrations main focus may lie elsewhere: on Trumps desire to reduce trade deficits, cases where a country sells more to the U.S. than it buys. And the solution may be other countries buying more U.S. products, from energy to soybeans, and builingd more plants in the U.S.  U.S. energy is already a major export to Europe. Trump has mentioned a figure of $350 billion for potential EU gas imports. The EU does need imported gas. But Trumps figure would be a stretch given that last years exports of liquefied natural gas to the EU were around $13 billon, and that Europe is seeking to reduce its use of fossil fuels over the longer term. THE HEART OF THE MATTER? Discussions about non-tariff issues may simply be leverage to underpin Trumps stiff tariff levels.  Its just a thing thats there to justify my tariffs, said Tobias Gehrke, senior policy fellow at the European Council of Foreign Relations. While lower level trade officials and industry representatives are acutely aware of non-tariff issues like agricultural safety, Trump and his cabinet... dont really care about chlorinated chicken regulations in Europe and food standards, Gehrke said. They have much bigger thinking. They want to have European companies significantly move production to America... and to export from America to Europe. That would change the trade balance. And if thats the main logic, then theres no real deal to be had on non-tariff barriers. ___ Rugaber contributed from Washington DC and Kageyama from Tokyo.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-trade-war-tariffs-negotiations-f172b97761c1b4923df63e0beceb584b,business
Jackpot! How French police freed a cryptocurrency hostage whose finger was severed for ransom,"PARIS (AP)  Fearful that the kidnappers might sever another finger from their hostage or worse, the French police commander ordered his officers  with a radioed Go command  to raid the house where he suspected that the father of a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur was being held. Fabrice Gardon, director of Paris judicial police, then waited anxiously in his units headquarters in the north of the French capital for the code word they use to signal that a hostage has been freed. Finally, it came: Jackpot!  With seven suspects in custody, the police commander detailed in radio interviews Monday 58 hours of drama, mutilation and finally relief that marked the latest kidnapping in France of people working in the cryptocurrency business. The victim was the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, the prosecutors office said.  Attackers wearing balaclavas bundled him into a van as he was coming out of his Paris house to walk his dog last Thursday morning, Gardon said. He said bystanders alerted police. Speaking to RTL radio, he confirmed French media reports that the kidnappers severed one of the hostages fingers. He said they sent a video to his son of the mutilation and other video of his father tied up, and demanded millions of euros (dollars) in ransom. On Saturday night, police tracked the gang to a house in the Essonne region south of Paris, where investigators believed the man was being held.  
        
     We got there a few minutes before a new ultimatum where the victim might again have suffered another mutilation, Gardon said. He gave the go-ahead for an assault by a police Search and Intervention Brigade, known by its French initials, BRI. He then followed its progress over the radio from the judicial police headquarters. After a few moments, the head of the BRI said over the radio  using whats our code  Jackpot! In our jargon that means, All good. We have freed the hostage, he said on France Info radio.  Obviously, it was a big relief, he said. The prosecutors office said police detained four people in or close to the house where the man was held captive, and a fifth person at the wheel of a vehicle thought to have been used for the alleged abduction. Another two suspects were detained Sunday, it said. It said the police investigation is looking at an array of possible criminal charges, including kidnapping with torture or a barbaric act. In January, police said a co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, was also kidnapped with his wife from their home in the Cher region of central France. Police said they made 10 arrests and that the alleged kidnappers demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency from another of Ledgers co-founders. A raid by Frances elite National Gendarmerie Intervention Group unit that specializes in hostage situations freed Balland the next day, followed the day after that by the liberation, again by the GIGN, of his wife, found tied up in a vehicle, police said.",https://apnews.com/article/france-cryptocurrency-kidnapping-3bee45ffa10fa07dfe8ff4f339ec97e2,business
Europe launches a drive to attract scientists and researchers after Trump freezes US funding,"PARIS (AP)  The European Union launched a drive on Monday to attract scientists and researchers to Europe with offers of grants and new policy plans, after the Trump administration froze U.S. government funding linked to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. A few years ago, no one would have imagined that one of the biggest democracies in the world would cancel research programs under the pretext that the word diversity was in this program, French President Emmanuel Macron said at the Choose Europe for Science event in Paris. No one would have thought that one of the biggest democracies in the world would delete with a stroke the ability of one researcher or another to obtain visas, Macron said. But here we are. Taking the same stage at the Sorbonne University, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EUs executive branch would set up a super grant program aimed at offering a longer-term perspective to the very best in the field. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports the European Union has launched a drive to attract U.S. scientists and researchers to Europe. She said that 500 million euros ($566 million) will be put forward in 2025-2027 to make Europe a magnet for researchers. It would be injected into the European Research Council, which already has a budget of more than 16 billion euros ($18 billion) for 2021-2027. Von der Leyen said that the 27-nation EU intends to enshrine freedom of scientific research into law with a new legal act. As the threats rise across the world, Europe will not compromise on its principles, she said. 
        
     The White House responded by describing DEI as an inherently discriminatory policy. If the European Union wants to embrace policies that divide, rather than focus on real scientific discovery, they should not be surprised when U.S. innovation continues to outpace Europe, said spokesperson Anna Kelly. America will continue to attract and cultivate the best talent in science, research, and beyond.  Macron said that the French government would also soon make new proposals to beef up investment in science and research. Last month, hundreds of university researchers in the United States had National Science Foundation funding canceled to comply with U.S. President Donald Trumps order to end support to research on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the study of misinformation. More than 380 grant projects have been cut so far, including work to combat internet censorship in China and Iran and a project consulting with Indigenous communities to understand environmental changes in Alaskas Arctic region. Some terminated grants that sought to broaden the diversity of people studying science, technology and engineering. Scientists, researchers and doctors have taken to the streets in protest. While not mentioning the Trump administration by name, von der Leyen said that it was a gigantic miscalculation to undermine free and open research. We can all agree that science has no passport, no gender, no ethnicity, no political party, she said. We believe that diversity is an asset of humanity and the lifeblood of science. It is one of the most valuable global assets and it must be protected. Von der Leyens drive to promote opportunities in Europe in the field of science and take advantage of U.S. policy shifts dovetails with the way that she has played up the potential for trade deals with other countries since Trump took office in January and sparked a tariff war last month. The former German defense minister, and trained doctor, vowed that the EU would also address some of the roadblocks that scientists and researchers face, notably excessive red tape and access to businesses. Macron said that science and research must not be based on the diktats of the few. Macron said that Europe must become a refuge for scientists and researchers, and he said to those who feel under threat elsewhere: The message is simple. If you like freedom, come and help us to remain free, to do research here, to help us become better, to invest in our future. ___ Lorne Cook reported from Brussels.

Warren Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire Hathaway when Greg Abel takes over as CEO in 2026,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  When Greg Abel becomes Berkshire Hathaways new CEO next year he will of course take on additional responsibilities, but with Warren Buffett remaining as chairman, the surprise change announced at the annual meeting over the weekend is in some ways just another milestone in the companys succession plans. Shareholders have been worrying about how to replace the worlds greatest investor for decades  even before the 94-year-old hit a typical retirement age. So years ago, Berkshires board started devoting part of every meeting to the succession question.  Then in 2018, Buffett began publicly handing over the reins when he put Abel in charge of all of Berkshires dozens of manufacturing, retail, railroad and utility businesses. Fellow Vice Chairman Ajit Jain was given responsibility for the insurance companies including Geico, while Buffett kept responsibility for investing Berkshires billions. Berkshire confirmed that Abel would be Buffetts successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at a shareholder meeting. Starting next year, Abel will have the final say on all of Berkshires companies and investments, but he will also still have Buffett, Jain and two investment managers  Ted Weschler and Todd Combs  coming to the office every day to help. And the CEOs of Berkshires many different subsidiaries handle all the day-to-day operations. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Warren Buffett will remain chairman at Berkshire Hathaway when the new CEO takes over. Gregs already been doing it for a couple of years, so his job really doesnt change. His title does, but his jobs not really changing that much, said Bob Miles, who has taught a course about Buffett and Berkshire at the University of Nebraska-Omaha for 15 years. 
        
     Berkshires board approved the 62-year-old Abels promotion to CEO and kept Buffett as chairman on Sunday. Berkshire Class B shares fell more than 5% Monday in response to the news after hitting an all-time high Friday, but many investors praised the plan.  I think it gives Warren a little more bandwidth instead of running this conglomerate, Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an interview with The Associated Press. It gives Greg more transparency on the opps with also Warren still being his mentor as chairman,  In six decades at the helm, Buffett turned a Massachusetts textile company into a sprawling but nimble conglomerate that owns everything from Daily Queen and Sees Candies to BNSF Railway and massive insurance and utility companies. As the company grew, Buffetts reputation grew with it as shares of Berkshire Hathaway climbed steadily, exceeding major indexes by wide margins and returning an average 19.9% each year to investors versus 10.4% for the Standard & Poors 500.  The decision to continue with the Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is known, as head of the board differs from the succession plans laid out in the event of Buffetts death. The billionaire has long said that Howard Buffett, the second-born of his three children, should become chairman when he is gone to protect Berkshires culture.  Abel will take over in a precarious time as the U.S. launches trade wars against friend and foe alike, which Buffett has called a mistake. But that could also create investment opportunities for Berkshire if there is a crisis. Then there is Berkshires $348 billion in cash.  Buffett says he doesnt see many bargains to invest that money in now, not even Berkshires own stock, but he assured some of the estimated 40,000 attendees of the companys annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, over the weekend that one day the company would be bombarded with opportunities. Abel, a low-key Canadian with a love a hockey who makes it a priority to coach his kids teams, said Saturday that he wouldnt change Berkshires approach to investing, which he learned from Buffett. Maintaining Berkshires fortress-like balance sheet will always be a priority, he said. Eventually, Berkshire might have to consider paying a dividend, which Buffett always resisted because he believed he could deliver better returns by reinvesting the cash. For now, Buffett and Abel want to keep building cash, so they are prepared when opportunities arise. Buffett endorsed Abel, vowing to keep all of his shares that give him control of 30% of Berkshire Hathaway. Abel is a more hands-on manager than Buffett, asking managers tough questions and encouraging them to collaborate with other subsidiaries when it makes sense. Its way better with Greg than with me because I didnt want to work as hard as he works and I can get away with it because weve got a basically good business -- a very good business  and I wasnt in danger of you firing me by virtue of the ownership and the fact that we could do pretty well, Buffett said. The fact that you can do pretty well doesnt mean you couldnt do better, and Greg can do better at many things, he said.  The CEOs of Berkshire subsidiaries who report to Abel have praised his management style of personal accountability, but also autonomy. Sees Candy CEO Pat Egan worked with Abel at Berkshires utility unit for years before he took over the candymaker six years ago and said Abel makes sure hes considered every contingency. Hes allowed me to make a lot of decisions that he may or may not have agreed with, but hell support us at the end of the day, no matter what as long as were operating with integrity and principles and the long game, Egan said.  But Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren wrote that Buffetts succession announcement left him with plenty of questions and Abel will have to prove himself. Abel, in our view, will be held to a different standard than Buffett, with a greater focus on how well Berkshire is performingespecially with it being likely that there will be some churn in the companys shareholders as we move past the end of an era for the firm, Warren said. Buffett has always delegated the decisions about how to distribute his fortune, worth nearly $160 billion, to others through annual share donations to the Gates Foundation and four family foundations run by his children.  The Gates Foundation has received the biggest donations worth more than $40 billion since he started giving away his fortune in 2006.  He said last summer that his three children will decide how to distribute his remaining fortune after his death, but donations to the Gates Foundation will end. Buffett has said he expects it to take a decade to give away all his shares after his death, ensuring extended support for Abel from the family. ____ AP Business writer Bernard Condon is in New York City.

Trump is swiftly undoing transgender protections in HUDs housing policies,"The Trump administration is swiftly remaking housing policy as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development retreats from long-established fair-housing protections for transgender people. In recent months, HUD has been targeting the Obama-era Equal Access Rule that expanded protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Also in the bulls-eye are fair-housing complaint investigations and federally funded homeless shelters. This administration wants to pretend trans people dont exist, said Hannah Adams, a senior staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project. Whatever theyre doing is not in line with HUDs supposed mission to provide a safety net for families that are struggling in this country.  HUD said in a statement that it is upholding the landmark Fair Housing Act that guarantees equal access to housing for all Americans, as well as implementing what it called Trumps executive order restoring biological truth to the federal government. Here are key takeaways about how HUD is taking on the battle over transgender rights. 
        
     The Fair Housing Act identifies sex as one of seven protected classes for housing discrimination. But it wasnt until the Obama administration established the Equal Access Rule in 2012 that those protections were extended to cover sexual orientation, gender identity and marital status.  In 2016, the rule was expanded to include transgender people seeking help at federally funded emergency shelters. Four years later, a 2020 Supreme Court ruling established that a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment. Housing advocates and HUD in 2021 under the Biden administration interpreted that as broader affirmation that LGBTQ+ people were also protected in the fair housing law.  Kim Johnson, public policy manager at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said transgender people experience homelessness at a disproportionately higher rate despite being less than 1% of the general population. The spirit of the Fair Housing Act is to protect everyone who is vulnerable to discrimination, she said, even if the text of the law does not explicitly include gender identity as a protected class. We really need to ensure were upholding what the law means, and the fact is that transgender people are some of the most marginalized people in this country, Johnson said. President Donald Trump listens during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump listens during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Since President Donald Trump appointed Scott Turner to take the helm at HUD, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has instructed staff to pause investigations of all gender identity discrimination cases, according to two HUD attorneys who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or benefits. One said letters were then issued closing the cases for lack of jurisdiction.  HUD has not disclosed how many cases have been dropped. A National Fair Housing Alliance report identified at least 195 discrimination complaints involving gender identity in 2023, though HUD has not specified how many cases are still outstanding.  With changes to the Equal Access rule and other guidance still unclear, what happens now often depends on where a case is filed. In blue states with laws offering protections beyond federal law, HUD can direct tenants facing LGBTQ+ discrimination to state-run offices still taking cases, said a HUD employee who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the hot-button topic.  To Sasha Samberg-Champion, HUD deputy general counsel in the Biden administration and now special counsel for civil rights at the National Fair Housing Alliance, There is no public policy justification for permitting discrimination in the housing market against people because they are transgender. None. Community leaders say theyre facing seemingly contradictory requirements in new HUD contracts with nonprofits that find permanent housing for the homeless and run shelters.  One section stipulates that nonprofits cant promote gender ideology while at the same time another requires compliance with anti-discrimination law, according to a copy provided to the AP. In Memphis, Tennessee, a nonprofit that provides emergency shelter for transgender people is looking to increase capacity because of the uncertainty.  Kayla Gore, executive director of My Sistahs House, said it can do that because it doesnt take federal funding. But other shelters are removing information from their websites about serving the LGBTQ+ community, fearful that federal funding will be stripped if they dont, she said. People are confused, Gore said. They dont know what to do because they want to protect their bottom line. Soon after being sworn in as HUD secretary in February, Turner announced he was halting enforcement of the Equal Access Rule and quietly filed a proposal to revise the policy. HUD officials have declined to say what the proposed changes are. In 2020, the first Trump administration unsuccessfully moved to relieve shelters of any obligation to accommodate transgender people.  With Trump back for a second term, advocates fear his administration will feel even more emboldened to go further and forbid shelters from accommodating gender identity altogether. Unfortunately, its making an already vulnerable class of people more vulnerable, said Seran Gee, an attorney for Advocates for Trans Equality.  Our protections cant be a pingpong ball that changes every four years.",https://apnews.com/article/transgender-hud-fair-housing-trump-lgbtq-turner-003a354b933592303a4eea350ebbc804,business
"In a trade-war whirlwind, shoemaker Skechers is sold for $9 billion to become a private company","The shoe company Skechers is being acquired for more than $9 billion to be taken private by the investment firm by 3G Capital.  The deal comes amid growing uncertainty over how U.S. President Donald Trumps tariffs on foreign goods will affect companies who make their products overseas, particularly in China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.  The offer of $63 per share represents a premium of 30% to Skechers 15-day volume-weighted average stock price. The deal was unanimously approved by Skechers board.  Skechers shares jumped nearly 25% Monday, to $61.56. In a press release announcing the deal, the companies did not mention the potential impacts of Trumps tariffs on its business going forward. However, Skechers says that about two-thirds of its revenue comes from sales outside of the U.S. China accounts for 15% of the companys revenue, according to the data firm FactSet. The deal comes at a precarious time with Trumps ongoing, on-again-off-again tariff announcements. Like many other companies increasingly have done since Trumps widespread tariff announcements, Skechers did not issue guidance when it released its first quarter earnings in April. Chief Financial Officer John Vandemore told investors that the current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success. Executives also said they would be looking to minimize products going to the U.S. from high-cost locations, including the impact of tariffs. The company did not immediately provide a breakdown of foreign production, but many of their shoes come with a Made in China stamp. 
        
     Trump raised the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% in early April, hours after China boosted the duty on American goods to 84% in an escalating battle that threatens to disrupt trade between the worlds two largest economies. Skechers executives said last month that the company had several levers it could pull to deal with tariffs, including cost sharing with vendors, sourcing optimization, and price adjustments.  Were looking at how we optimize the global cost of tariffs in all markets when we look to move production around, Vandemore said last month. Obviously, with an effective tariff rate at about 159%, products from China to the U.S. are prohibitively expensive. Skechers has about 5,300 retail stores worldwide, about 1,800 company-owned. About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs. When the deal closes, the company will be led by Skechers Chairman and CEO Robert Greenberg and his management team. Its headquarters will remain in Manhattan Beach, California, where it was founded more than three decades ago. Skechers reported a record $9 billion in revenue in 2024 with net earnings of $640 million.  The deal with 3G Capital is expected to close in the third quarter this year.",https://apnews.com/article/skechers-shoes-acquisition-private-3g-capital-00a1a3479cfc9015ec631fbe249bae4c,business
Sunoco buys Canadian gas and convenience store chain Parkland for about $9.1 billion,"Sunoco is buying Canadas gas station and convenience store chain Parkland in a cash-and-stock deal valued at approximately $9.1 billion, expanding its footprint north of the border.  Parkland has approximately 4,000 locations across Canada, the United States, and the Caribbean. Sunoco has gas and convenience store locations in more than 40 states, Puerto Rico, Europe, and Mexico.  Parkland Corp. shareholders will receive 0.295 SunCorp units and $19.80 Canadian ($14.34) for each Parkland share they own. Theres also an option for Parkland shareholders to choose to receive $44.00 Canadian ($31.86) per Parkland share in cash or 0.536 SunCorp units for each share. The deal also includes the assumption of debt. Parkland announced in March that its board was looking at strategic options for the company. It was at that point that talks with Sunoco significantly intensified, Parkland said.  Parkland will keep its headquarters in Calgary. Sunoco will also continue to invest in Parklands Burnaby refinery, which produces low-carbon fuels.  The deal is expected to close during the second half of the year. It is subject to shareholder and court approvals. The transaction is also subject to certain regulatory approvals, including approvals under the Investment Canada Act, and approval of the listing of the SunCorp shares to be issued under the transaction on the New York Stock Exchange. Parkland will hold a special shareholders meeting on June 24 to vote on the transaction.  If the deal doesnt close, Parkland would have to pay a $275 million break up fee, under certain circumstances.

Massive repair job on leaky NYC aqueduct will take a few more years to finish,"A $2 billion project to fix a massive leak in a water tunnel that supplies about half of New York Citys water that was already paused recently due to drought conditions, wont be completed for a few more years, city officials said Monday. Department of Environmental Protection officials have been planning for years to temporarily shut down a section of the Delaware Aqueduct north of the city to address the leak of up to 35 million gallons per day, almost all of it beneath the Hudson River. The planned eight-month shutdown will allow workers to hook up a bypass tunnel that has been constructed under the river. City officials announced the shutdown of the aqueduct last fall, timing the cutoff of water from the Catskill region for when seasonal demands are lower. But the work was paused in November due to a drought warning and low levels in the citys other reservoirs. The delay means the environmental agency will have to enter into a new contract for the construction work. Officials also remain concerned about below-average precipitation and plan to upgrade the aqueducts pumps. So they dont expect the project to be completed until after 2027. A new contract must take every contingency into account to ensure we meet our critical responsibility of providing the highest quality water possible to nearly 10 million New Yorkers every day, without exception, Commissioner Rohit T. Aggarwala said in a prepared release. 
        
     The aqueduct is the longest tunnel in the world and carries water for 85 miles (137 kilometers) from four reservoirs in the Catskill region to other reservoirs in the northern suburbs. It serves more than 8 million New York City residents. The sprawling system also serves some upstate municipalities.",https://apnews.com/article/new-york-water-delaware-aqueduct-43fef3b9380c2485137d6ec8aad0cfbd,business
"Harassed by Assassins Creed gamers, a professor fought back with kindness","HANOVER, N.H. (AP)  Sachi Schmidt-Hori has never played Assassins Creed Shadows, but facing an onslaught of online harassment from its fans, she quickly developed her own gameplay style: confronting hate with kindness. Schmidt-Hori, an associate professor of Japanese literature and culture at Dartmouth College, worked as a narrative consultant on the latest installment in the popular Ubisoft video game franchise. The game launched March 20, but the vitriol directed at Schmidt-Hori began in May 2024 with the release of a promotional trailer. Once I realized that I was by myself  nobody was defending me  I just decided to do what I knew would work, she said. Its very difficult to hate someone up close. Set in 16th century Japan, the game features Naoe, a Japanese female assassin, and Yasuke, a Black African samurai. Furor erupted over the latter, with gamers criticizing his inclusion as wokeness run amok.  They quickly zeroed in Schmidt-Hori, attacking her in online forums, posting bogus reviews of her scholarly work and flooding her inbox with profanity. Many drew attention to her academic research into gender and sexuality. Some tracked down her husbands name and ridiculed him, too. Imagine that! Professional #WOKE SJW confirms fake history for Ubisoft, one Reddit user said, using an acronym for social justice warrior. Another user called her a sexual degenerate who hate humanity because no man want her. 
        
     Learning Yasuke was based on a real person did little to assuage critics. Asian men in particular argued Schmidt-Hori was trying to erase them, even though her role involved researching historical customs and reviewing scripts, not creating characters. I became the face of this backlash, she said. People wanted to look for who to yell at, and I was kind of there. Ubisoft told her to ignore the harassment, as did her friends. Instead, she drew inspiration from the late civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis. I decided to cause good trouble, she said. I refused to ignore. Schmidt-Hori began replying to some of the angry emails, asking the senders why they were mad at her and inviting them to speak face-to-face via Zoom. She wrote to an influencer who opposes diversity, equity and inclusion principles and had written about her, asking him if he intended to inspire the death threats she was getting.  If somebody said to your wife what people are saying to me, you wouldnt like it, would you? she asked. The writer didnt reply, but he did take down the negative article about Schmidt-Hori. Others apologized. It truly destroyed me knowing that you had to suffer and cancel your class and received hate from horrible people, one man wrote. I feel somehow that you are part of my family, and I regret it. Im sorry from the bottom of my heart. Anik Talukder, a 28-year-old south Asian man living in the United Kingdom, said he apologized at least 10 times to Schmidt-Hori after accepting her Zoom invitation to discuss his Reddit post about her. On May 16, feeling surprised and disappointed about Yasuke as a protagonist, he posted a screenshot that included photos of Schmidt-Hori, her professional biography from the Dartmouth website and a description of a book she wrote. I felt like maybe they were doing too much of like racial inclusion and changing things, he said in an interview. An Asian male could have been the role model for so many people. Though he didnt criticize Schmidt-Hori directly, others responded negatively and the image was picked up and shared in other forums.  He was shocked the professor reached out to him and hesitant to speak to her at first. But they ended up having a thoughtful conversation about the lack of Asian representation in Western media and have stayed in touch ever since. I learned a massive lesson, he said. I shouldnt have made this person a target for no reason whatsoever. Ubisoft officials declined to be interviewed about the criticism of the game or the harassment Schmidt-Hori faced. In a statement, the company said it carefully researches historical settings and collaborates with internal and expert witnesses, but the games remain works of fiction and artistic liberties are taken. We do not condone harassment or bullying in any form, the company said. We are committed to creating a supportive and collaborative environment and were constantly learning how we can improve this process. We commend and appreciate Sachi Schmidt-Hori for addressing these topics directly and are grateful for her approach and expertise. Unlike the professor at Dartmouth, in Hanover, New Hampshire, most people who become the target of online hate end up retreating to protect themselves, said Kate Mays, an assistant professor of public communication at the University of Vermont.  Online forums allow people to post anonymously without seeing how their words are received and algorithms boost more aggressive content, she said, creating a perfect storm for people to become hateful. The intervention that she did was pretty brilliant in terms of sort of stopping that toxic train in its tracks and putting another spin on how people are engaging with her, Mays said. Shes sort of breaking the spell of that online disinhibition community involvement and forcing people to address her as a human and an individual. ____ Associated Press video journalist Amanda Swinhart contributed to this report from Burlington, Vermont.",https://apnews.com/article/assassins-creed-video-game-harassment-4b68890b7ed9ead8dbe3ad09dbee9859,business
"Grand Theft Auto VI delayed again, this time until May 2026","BOSTON (AP)  Fans of the hugely popular video game series Grand Theft Auto will have to wait a little longer to play the latest version. In a post on X Friday, Rockstar Games said it delayed the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI until May 26, 2026. It apologized for the delay of a game, the release of which has been talked about for several years. It didnt provide any specifics on why the release date has been pushed back from fall of this year. With every game we have released, the goal has been to try and exceed your expectations and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception, the company said in a statement. We hope you understand we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve. Shares of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstars parent company, fell Friday by nearly 7%.  Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, stood by Rockstar in a statement and said it supports the company taking additional time to realize their creative vision. He said it still expects a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations. While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence, Zelnick said in a statement. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders. Fans of the game reacted to the delay with disappointment but also a shrug -- since it has been suggested the game would be released in 2024 and then this year.  
        
     On a Reddit discussion forum dedicated to the game, several fans noted they had seen this before and wouldnt be surprised if the release was delayed again. Others took a more optimistic tone, saying an exact release date means it will actually happen this time around. One of the last times the game garnered this much buzz was in 2023, when a trailer for the game was leaked online. At the time, Rockstar released the first look of the sixth game 15 hours earlier than planned, citing the leak. That 90-second trailer gave fans a taste of what comes next for the game. The trailer suggested the next installment would be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and star a female protagonist, a first for the franchise, named Lucia. It is unclear whether the delay means any, or all, of these details will remain part of Grand Theft Auto VI.",https://apnews.com/article/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-games-9c1be2401e76cac72099ef02347ed1b9,business
Warren Buffetts best and worst investments in his 60 years leading Berkshire Hathaway,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said Saturday that he wants to step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. The revelation came as a surprise because the 94-year-old had previously said he did not plan to retire.  Buffett, one of the worlds richest people and most accomplished investors, took control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 when it was a textiles manufacturer. He turned the company into a conglomerate by finding other businesses and stocks to buy that were selling for less than they were worth.  His success made him a Wall Street icon. It also earned him the nickname Oracle of Omaha, a reference to the Nebraska city where Buffett was born and chose to live and work.  Here are some of his best and worst investments over the years:   National Indemnity and National Fire & Marine: Purchased in 1967, the company was one of Buffetts first insurance investments. Insurance float  the premium money insurers can invest between the time when policies are bought and when claims are made  provided the capital for many of Berkshires investments over the years and helped fuel the companys growth. Berkshires insurance division has grown to include Geico, General Reinsurance and several other insurers. The float totaled $173 billion at the end of the first quarter.   Buying blocks of stock in American Express, Coca-Cola Co. and Bank of America at times when the companies were out of favor because of scandals or market conditions. Collectively, the shares are worth over $100 billion more than what Buffett paid for them, and that doesnt count all the dividends he has collected over the years.   Apple: Buffett long said that he didnt understand tech companies well enough to value them and pick the long-term winners, but he started buying Apple shares in 2016. He later explained that he bought more than $31 billion worth because he understood the iPhone maker as a consumer products company with extremely loyal customers. The value of his investment grew to more than $174 billion before Buffett started selling Berkshire Hathaways shares.  
        
      BYD: On the advice of his late investing partner Charlie Munger, Buffett bet big on the genius of BYD founder Wang Chanfu in 2008 with a $232 million investment in the Chinese electric vehicle maker. The value of that stake soared to more than $9 billion before Buffett began selling it off. Berkshires remaining stake is still worth about $1.8 billion.  Sees Candy: Buffett repeatedly pointed to his 1972 purchase as a turning point in his career. Buffett said Munger persuaded him that it made sense to buy great businesses at good prices as long as they had enduring competitive advantages. Previously, Buffett had primarily invested in companies of any quality as long as they were selling for less than he thought they were worth. Berkshire paid $25 million for Sees and recorded pretax earnings of $1.65 billion from the candy company through 2011. The amount continued to grow but Buffett didnt routinely highlight it.  Berkshire Hathaway Energy: Utilities provide a large and steady stream of profits for Berkshire. The conglomerate paid $2.1 billion, or about $35.05 per share, for Des Moines-based MidAmerican Energy in 2000. The utility unit subsequently was renamed and made several acquisitions, including PacifiCorp and NV Energy. The utilities added more than $3.7 billion to Berkshires profit in 2024, although Buffett has said they are now worth less than they used to be because of the liability they face related to wildfires.  Berkshire Hathaway: Buffett had said his investment in the Berkshire Hathaway textile mills was probably his worst investment ever. The textile company he took over in 1965 bled money for many years before Buffett finally shut it down in 1985, though Berkshire did provide cash for some of Buffetts early acquisitions. Of course, the Berkshire shares Buffett began buying for $7 and $8 a share in 1962 are now worth $809,350 per share, so even Buffetts worst investment turned out OK.  Dexter Shoe Co.: Buffett said he made an awful blunder by buying Dexter in 1993 for $433 million, a mistake made even worse because he used Berkshire stock for the deal. Buffett says he essentially gave away 1.6% of Berkshire for a worthless business.   Missed opportunities. Buffett said that some of his worst mistakes over the years were the investments and deals that he didnt make. Berkshire easily could have made billions if Buffett had been comfortable investing in Amazon, Google or Microsoft early on. But it wasnt just tech companies he missed out on. Buffett told shareholders he was caught sucking his thumb when he failed to follow through on a plan to buy 100 million Walmart shares that would be worth nearly $10 billion today.  Selling banks too soon. Not long before the COVID pandemic, Buffett seemed to sour on most of his bank stocks. Repeated scandals involving Wells Fargo gave him a reason to start unloading his 500 million shares, many of them for around $30 per share. But he also sold off his JP Morgan stake at prices less than $100. Both stocks have more than doubled since then.  Blue Chip Stamps: Buffett and Munger, Berkshires former vice chairman, took control of Blue Chip in 1970 when the customer rewards program was generating $126 million in sales. But as trading stamps fell out of favor with retailers and consumers, sales steadily declined; in 2006, they totaled a mere $25,920. However, Buffett and Munger used the float that Blue Chip generated to acquire Sees Candy, Wesco Financial and Precision Castparts, which are all steady contributors to Berkshire.",https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-billionaire-berkshire-hathaway-investor-738682bbc8f420889fc4adee92fef3ca,business
Kidnappers in France target cryptocurrency entrepreneurs for ransom,"PARIS (AP)  French police rescued the father of a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur in a nighttime raid after he was taken hostage for ransom, the latest alleged criminal effort in France to extort people involved in the management of digital assets. The man was kidnapped Thursday morning in Paris, the prosecutors office said Sunday. The victim turned out to be the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, and the incident was accompanied by a ransom demand, its statement said, without giving their names or other specifics about their identities. Police investigators located the hostage in a house in the Essonne region south of Paris, from which he was rescued on Saturday night, the prosecutors office said.  It said he was treated for injuries but gave no details. French media reported that the alleged hostage-takers cut off one of the mans fingers.  Police detained 5 people  four were in or close to the house where the man was held captive, while the fifth was at the wheel of a vehicle thought to have been used for the alleged abduction, the prosecutors office said. It said the police investigation is looking at an array of possible criminal charges, including kidnapping with torture or a barbaric act. In January, police said a co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, was also kidnapped with his wife from their home in the region of Cher of central France. 
        
     Police said they made 10 arrests and that the alleged kidnappers demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency from another of Ledgers co-founders. A raid by Frances elite National Gendarmerie Intervention Group unit that specializes in hostage situations freed Balland the next day, followed the day after that by the liberation, again by the GIGN, of his wife, found tied up in a vehicle, police said.",https://apnews.com/article/france-police-kidnapping-cryptocurrencies-hostages-technology-64af99f20d16ebdd08fe5e84ddd6bc64,business
Federal Reserve chief says Trump tariffs likely to raise inflation and slow US economic growth,"ARLINGTON, Va. (AP)  The Trump administrations expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth for the U.S. economy, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday.  Powell said that the tariffs, and their likely impacts on the economy and inflation, are significantly larger than expected. He also said that the import taxes will probably lead to at least a temporary rise in inflation, but added that it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.  Our obligation is to ... make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem, Powell said in remarks delivered to a conference of the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing.  Powells focus on inflation suggests that the Fed will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% in the coming months, rather than cut them anytime soon. Higher borrowing costs can help slow the economy and cool inflation. Wall Street investors, meanwhile, now expect five interest rate cuts this year, a number that has increased since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs Wednesday.  AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the Federal Reserves chairman predicting the economic impacts of the new tariffs. Powell also emphasized that the full impact of the tariffs on the economy arent yet clear, and the Fed will stay on the sidelines until it has more clarity about the economy. He acknowledged that many businesses have said they are holding off on new investments until they get a better sense of the tariffs impact. Theres a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us, Powell said during a question and answer session. And that just seems like the right thing to do in this period of uncertainty. 
        
     Trump, separately, urged Powell to cut rates, citing lower inflation and energy prices on his social media platform, Truth Social.  This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates, Trump wrote. CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS! Economists expect that the tariffs will weaken the economy, possibly threaten hiring, and push up prices. In that scenario, the Fed could cut rates to bolster the economy, or it could keep rates unchanged  or even hike them  to combat inflation. Powells comments suggest the Fed will mostly focus on inflation.  Powells remarks come two days after Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs that have upended the global economy, prompted retaliatory moves by China, and sent stock prices in the U.S. and overseas plunging.  Powells description of the impact of tariffs was more negative than just last month, when he said that any inflation resulting from the tariffs would likely be temporary.  Weaker growth and higher prices are a tricky combination for the Fed. Typically the central bank would reduce its key interest rate to lower borrowing costs and spur the economy in the event of slower growth, while it would raise rates  or keep them elevated  to slow spending and combat inflation.  The Fed is in a tough spot with inflation set to accelerate and the economy poised to slow, said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.  The Fed is required by law to seek maximum employment and price stability, which it defines as yearly inflation of 2%. Powell acknowledged that the tariffs, which could cause job losses and raise prices, could make both those goals harder to achieve.  The two goals ... are in tension  or they may be, he said.  Powell said the economy and hiring remain solid, for now, but he noted that consumers and businesses have become more pessimistic about the future. He also said inflation has fallen sharply from its peak in 2022, but said that recently progress toward the central banks 2% target has slowed. Some positive news arrived Friday when the government reported that hiring accelerated in March, with 228,000 jobs added, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%.  Yet those figures measure hiring in mid-March, before the scope of the duties became clear. The tariffs have also raised uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the coming months, which could limit businesses willingness to invest and hire.",https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-inflation-economy-trump-powell-490417656971634592bbeb3b2ade3593,business
US stocks dip after careening through a manic day following Trumps latest tariff threat,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks careened through a manic Monday after President Donald Trump threatened to crank his tariffs higher, despite a stunning display showing how dearly Wall Street wants him to do the opposite.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% at the end of a day full of heart-racing reversals as battered financial markets try to figure out what Trumps ultimate goal is for his trade war. If its to get other countries to agree to trade deals, he could lower his tariffs and avoid a possible recession. But if its to remake the economy and stick with tariffs for the long haul, stock prices may need to fall further. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349 points, or 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by 0.1%.  All three indexes started the day sharply lower, and the Dow plunged as many as 1,700 points following even worse losses elsewhere in the world. But it suddenly surged to a gain of nearly 900 points in the late morning. The S&P 500, meanwhile, went from a loss of 4.7% to a leap of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years.  The sudden rise followed a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs, one that a White House account on X  quickly labeled as fake news. That a rumor could move trillions of dollars worth of investments shows how much investors are hoping to see signs that Trump may let up on tariffs. Stocks quickly turned back down, and shortly afterward, Trump dug in further and said he may raise tariffs more against China  after the worlds second-largest economy retaliated last week  with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products.  
        
     Its a slap in the face to Wall Street because it suggests Trump may not care how much pain he inflicts on the market. Many professional investors had long thought that a president who used to crow about records reached under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent the Dow reeling. On Sunday Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasnt concerned about a sell-off and that sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. Trump has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years. Trump on Sunday said he wanted to bring down the numbers for how much more the United States imports from other countries versus how much it sends to them.  Indexes nevertheless did keep swinging between losses and gains Monday after Trumps latest tariff threat, in part because hope still remains in markets that negotiations may still come. Were not calling the all-clear at all, but when you have this type of volatility in the market, of course youre going to have back and forth in markets not just day to day but also hour to hour, said Nate Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management.  Were all waiting for the next bit of information, he said. Literally a Truth Social tweet or an announcement of some sort about real negotiations could dramatically move this market. This is the world we live in right now. All that seemed certain Monday was the financial pain hammering investments around the world for a third day after Trump announced tariffs in his Liberation Day.  Stocks in Hong Kong  plunged 13.2% for their worst day since 1997. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped below $60 during the morning for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel. Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week. Trumps tariffs are an attack on the globalization thats remade the worlds economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries. It also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero by slashing interest rates to protect the economy during every downturn. But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because inflation remains higher than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation. The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, wrote in his annual letter to shareholders Monday. Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth. In the bond market, Treasury yields rallied to recover some of their sharp drops from earlier weeks. Some of the big move may have been because of reduced expectations for cuts to interest rates by the Fed. Some analysts also said it could be due to investors outside of the United States wanting to pare their U.S. investments.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.20% from 4.01% late Friday.  Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 briefly fell more than 20% below its record set less than two months ago. If it finishes a day below that bar, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A bear market signifies a downturn thats moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10% drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious.  The S&P 500, which sits at the heart of many investors 401(k) accounts, is coming off its worst week since COVID  began crashing the global economy in March 2020. All told, the index fell 11.83 points Monday to 5,062.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 349.26 to 37,965.60, and the Nasdaq composite added 15.48 to 15,603.26. ___ Kurtenbach reported from Bangkok. McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.

Will the tariffs lead to a recession? Heres how to know if were in one,"WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trumps sharp tariff hikes last week have sent the stock market into a tailspin, raised alarm bells among Wall Street executives, and heightened many economists worries that the U.S. could tip into recession.  The tariffs, set to take effect Wednesday, include a 10% blanket duty on nearly all countries and additional import taxes on 60 nations. The increases are so large and are taking effect so rapidly that they are likely to be disruptive to the economy, economists say, even if they are partially rolled back through negotiations in the coming weeks or months.  Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession  where the economy shrinks and unemployment rises  to 45%, from 35% last week. And even that forecast assumes many of the duties are negotiated away or reduced. If not, we expect to change our forecast to a recession, Jan Hatzius, Goldmans chief economist, and his colleagues said in an analyst note.  Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently.  Should the tariffs remain in place for an extended period, they will likely raise costs and uncertainty for businesses, which could reduce their willingness to hire, invest in new equipment or software, or expand into new markets. Americans could cut back on their spending in the face of higher prices. The economy could start to shrink, after expanding 2.8% in 2024.  
        
     So far, most measures of the economy, such as job gains, remain solid. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, the government reported last week, and layoffs remain historically low.  Still, surveys show consumers and businesses are increasingly worried about the economic outlook. What everyone from Wall Street investors to economists to officials at the Federal Reserve will be watching closely is whether those concerns lead to a downturn.  Here are some questions and answers about recessions: Not yet. But one development that has sparked widespread fear is a real-time economy tracker maintained by the Federal Reserves Atlanta branch. It now indicates that the economy could shrink by 0.8% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4% in last years final quarter.  The Atlanta Feds tracker is not technically a forecast but instead a running tally that is updated as economic data is released.  Typically, a recession occurs when some short of shock hits the economy, such as the pandemic in 2020, or the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007. Its not yet clear that tariffs will have a large enough impact to knock the economy into reverse.  But economists at Wells Fargo, in a note on Friday, calculated that the average U.S. tariff would jump tenfold to about 23% when all the duties are in place, the highest since 1908. Such a shift practically overnight will throw sand in the gears of global supply chains in ways that we have not seen since the pandemic and perhaps since World War II, Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, wrote.  On Sunday, Trump told reporters that sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. Yet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the same day said there doesnt have to be a recession and that the administration is focused on building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. The governments weekly report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, which is released every Thursday, is being closely watched for signs of rising layoffs. So far, applications for aid remain quite low by historical standards.  Torsten Slok, chief economist for Apollo, an asset management firm, is watching a range of real-time data and sees some signs the economy is weakening. The number of people filing for bankruptcy has risen, while visits to Las Vegas have declined a bit. Weekly visits to movie theaters this year are below their levels in recent years, he said.  The Trump administration is plowing ahead with widespread job cuts in federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, and says it will cut government spending. Both could weigh on the economy, at least in the short run.  And even if some of the tariffs imposed April 2 are pulled back or reduced, the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administrations trade policies are likely to discourage spending by businesses or consumers. Its unclear, for example, whether companies will build more factories in the U.S.  as the tariffs are intended to encourage  if they dont know how long the tariffs will last.  Another factor could be overseas boycotts of U.S. goods and travel. Slok has noted that airline bookings data point to a 70% drop in trips from Canada to the U.S. in the next six months. While the effect on the overall economy is likely to be minor, Goldman Sachs estimates such changes could shave 0.2 percentage points off growth this year.  Many economists now expect the Fed will cut their key interest rate at their meeting in June and implement at least three reductions this year.  But the Fed is in a difficult position: With inflation seemingly stuck above its target of 2%, even before the tariffs take effect, the central bank would typically want to keep borrowing costs high to slow spending and cool inflation.  Yet if tariffs weaken the economy and lead to job losses, the Fed would normally slash its key rate to stimulate borrowing and spending. Since tariffs could worsen inflation, however, it is unlikely to do so until there are clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown.  They cant really be proactive here because they do have inflation to worry about, said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. What were looking at is a Fed that is going to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. On Friday, Chair Jerome Powell said the tariffs could worsen inflation and added that the Feds main obligation was to keep prices in check. His comments suggested the Fed will likely stay on the sidelines at its next meeting in May.  Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists whose Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months. The committee considers trends in hiring. It also assesses many other data points, including gauges of income, employment, inflation-adjusted spending, retail sales and factory output. It assigns heavy weight to a measure of inflation-adjusted income that excludes government support payments like Social Security. Yet the organization typically doesnt declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes as long as a year afterward.",https://apnews.com/article/recession-tariffs-economy-inflation-5a24ff198dcd6813b53f44c662354b6a,business
The grace period for student loan payments is over. Heres what you need to know,"NEW YORK (AP)  The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended on Sept. 30. The on-ramp period helped borrowers who are struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting their credit score. The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make payments, said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.  Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5 trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal challenges.  With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added Yu. Student loan borrowers who havent been able to afford their monthly payments must consider their options to avoid going into default. If you have student loans, heres what you need to know. 
        
     The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the borrowers transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to accumulate.  Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling behind ultimately on repaying your loans, said Abby Shaforth, director of National Consumer Law Centers Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who dont make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for nine months, go into default.  Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to accrue.  Borrowers who cant or dont pay risk delinquency and eventually default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible for additional aid and government benefits.  If a borrower missed one months payment, they will start receiving email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasnt been paid for three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the borrower hasnt paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into default.  If youre struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by visiting the Federal Student Aid website. If youve worked for a government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives student debt after 10 years.  When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days  roughly 9 months  the loan appears on your credit report as being in default.  Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of Social Security checks and other benefit payments.  If your budget doesnt allow you to resume payments, its important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid. If youre in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance  allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrowers discretionary income. If a borrowers earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan, the income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower courts.  Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan dont have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was unaffected. The next court hearing about this case will be held on Oct. 15.  The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on Sept. 30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits.

What to know about this years Social Security cost-of-living adjustment,"NEW YORK (AP)  Tens of millions of older Americans will see an increase in benefits this January when a new cost-of-living adjustment is added to Social Security payments. The 2.5% raise is intended to help meet higher prices for food, fuel, and other goods and services. The average recipient will see an increase of about $50 per month, according to agency officials. Social Security recipients received a 3.2% increase in their benefits in 2024, and some retirees are concerned that this years increase is not big enough to meet their needs.  The Social Security Administration will begin notifying recipients about their new benefit amount by mail starting in early December. Adjusted payments to nearly 7.5 million people receiving Supplemental Security Income will begin on December 31. Supplemental Security Income provides monthly payments to adults and children who have income below specific financial limits and qualify to receive Social Security benefits.  Heres what to keep in mind: About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, get Social Security benefits. The program is funded by taxes on income subject to Social Security payroll taxes. The government uses taxes from working people to pay benefits to people who have already retired, people who are disabled, the survivors of workers who have died, and dependents of beneficiaries. In 2025, the Social Security payroll tax will be assessed on the first $176,100 of income, up from $168,600 this year While the money is used to pay people currently receiving benefits, any unused money goes to the Social Security trust fund. Some of the money in the trust, together with the Social Security contributions of people in the workforce, pays for future benefits. To determine what amount of Social Security youll receive, the government calculates a percentage of your highest wages from your top 35 years of earning, factoring in when you choose to start receiving benefits. 
        
     The COLA is calculated according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, but there are calls to use a different index  one that measures price changes based on the spending patterns of the elderly  like healthcare, food and medicine costs. The smaller increase for 2025 is because inflation is slowing. That means prices arent increasing as fast as they were at the height of the COVID pandemic. Recipients got a historically large 8.7% benefit increase in 2023 because of record high inflation.  Future problems with the fund have long been predicted, largely because of demographic shifts. As birthrates decline, fewer people become workers, which results in fewer payments of payroll taxes. Meanwhile, more Baby Boomers are retiring and collecting Social Security. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in May said the programs trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. If the trust fund is depleted, the government will be able to pay only 83% of scheduled benefits, the report said. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Why you shouldnt store your money in payment apps,"NEW YORK (AP)  Connor Tomasko grew up wary of credit cards. As she taught herself more about managing money, she realized that many people also have bad habits when it comes to payment apps. Tomasko, 31, a freelance software consultant in Chicago, understands why people appreciate the ease of the apps, which typically only require you to know someones username in order to send money. But she realized that keeping money in the apps could be risky and means losing out on the interest from a high yield savings account. She now immediately transfers any payments out of the apps and encourages friends to do the same. Im definitely the one that is always harping about high yield savings accounts, Tomasko said. But if youre in an industry dealing with a lot of cash  bartending, say  sometimes youre just worried about finding a place to deposit it. Its not always a fun thing to talk about. As use of payment apps has grown in recent years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued guidance on best practices to avoid pitfalls. For example, funds stored on Venmo or Cash App typically lack the deposit insurance youd get from a bank, except in certain cases.  Popular digital payment apps are increasingly used as substitutes for a traditional bank or credit union account, but lack the same protections to ensure that funds are safe, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a bulletin last year. 
        
     In 2022, transaction volume on these apps was an estimated $893 billion, according to the CFPB, and thats projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2027. More than three-quarters of US adults say they have ever used one of four popular payment apps, according to a 2022 survey from the Pew Research Center. Of consumers ages 18 to 29, 85% said theyve used a service such as PayPal, Venmo, Apple Cash, Google Pay, or Zelle, according to a March 2022 study by Consumer Reports. The apps are popular because you dont have to give your personal information, like a phone number, if you just got drinks with someone once but youre never going to see them again  a date that didnt go well, Tomasko said. I get the benefits in that sense  to be able to send money that way. Heres what you should know: It may be tempting to leave money sitting in peer-to-peer lending accounts so that youre ready to pay your friends when they request money to cover your portion of a dinner bill... (but) there are a few reasons why we wouldnt suggest doing that, said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma. Funds stored in payment apps often lack deposit insurance, the CFPB has found. FDIC-insured banks protect depositors against the loss of their insured deposits up to at least $250,000 if a bank fails, and a similar framework protects credit unions. While funds stored on payment apps resemble funds stored on deposit accounts, those funds are not typically covered until they have been transferred back to an FDIC-insured bank or insured credit union. The Financial Technology Association, an industry group that includes many payment apps as members, noted that Cash App and PayPal both offer separate high-yield, FDIC-insured savings products. In select circumstances, deposit insurance does cover payment apps. With Cash App, funds are eligible for insurance if consumers link their account to a Cash App debit card. And with Venmo, funds added to an account via direct deposit or check cashing are covered. Still, the CFPB has found that funds stored in a payment app may be at significantly higher risk of loss for a consumer than if it is deposited in an insured bank or credit union account. Consumers should be aware of these risks if they choose to leave a balance on these nonbank payment apps, the agency wrote in its report last year. To minimize risks, the CFPB said consumers should transfer their balances back to federally insured accounts.  Some payment app companies are able to invest users funds in loans and bonds, earning money on the investments while generally paying no interest on users balances, the CFPB found. To maximize your own funds, immediately transfer any deposits to an account where you can collect interest. Leaving money sitting in those accounts is leaving potential interest from a high-yield savings account on the table, said Alev. All of that interest adds up over time, so your money could be growing elsewhere. Tomasko said she always uses the 1-3 business day option to transfer funds when using Venmo, to avoid incurring fees, while Cash App has a setting that users can select to automatically route money back to their bank accounts, which she uses. Theres definitely room for improvement in the space, she said. With Venmo, every time I receive a payment, I go in to actively transfer it out. The Financial Technology Association said in a statement that tens of millions of Americans use payment apps every day to send money to friends and family, cover routine expenses, and manage their finances.  Consumers choose these apps because they are safe, convenient, and transparent, said FTA CEO and President Penny Lee. ___ This story has been updated to correct the name of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the name of Apples peer-to-peer payment app. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Heres how to stay safe from scams,"NEW YORK (AP)  October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which means its the perfect time to learn how to protect yourself from scams.  Scams have become so sophisticated now. Phishing emails, texts, spoofing caller ID, all of this technology gives scammers that edge, said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center.  As scammers find new ways to steal money and personal information, consumers should be more vigilant about who they trust, especially online. A quick way to remember what to do when you think youre getting scammed is to think about the three Ss, said Alissa Abdullah, also known as Dr. Jay, Mastercards deputy chief security officer Stay suspicious, stop for a second (and think about it) and stay protected, she said. Whether its romance scams or job scams, impersonators are looking for ways to trick you into giving them money or sharing your personal information. Heres what to know: Three common tactics used by scammers are based on fear, urgency and money, said security expert Petros Efstathopoulos. Heres how they work:  Fear When a scammer contacts you via phone or email, they use language that makes it seem like there is a problem that you need to solve. For example, a scammer contacts you over email telling you that your tax return has an error and if you dont fix it youll get in trouble.  Urgency Because scammers are good at creating a sense of urgency, people tend to rush, which makes them vulnerable. Scammers often tell people they need to act right away, which can lead to them sharing private information such as their Social Security numbers. 
        
      Money Scammers use money as bait, Efstathopoulos said. They might impersonate tax professionals or the IRS saying you will get a bigger tax refund than you expect if you pay them for their services or share your personal information. Simply being aware of typical scams can help, experts say. Robocalls in particular frequently target vulnerable individuals like seniors, people with disabilities, and people with debt. If you get a robocall out of the blue paying a recorded message trying to get you to buy something, just hang up, said James Lee, chief operating officer at the Identity Theft Resource Center. Same goes for texts  anytime you get them from a number you dont know asking you to pay, wire, or click on something suspicious. Lee urges consumers to hang up and call the company or institution in question at an official number. Scammers will also often imitate someone in authority, such as a tax or debt collector. They might pretend to be a loved one calling to request immediate financial assistance for bail, legal help, or a hospital bill. So-called romance scams often target lonely and isolated individuals, according to Will Maxson, assistant director of the Division of Marketing Practices at the FTC. These scams can take place over longer periods of time -- even years. Kate Kleinart, 70, who lost tens of thousands to a romance scam over several months, said to be vigilant if a new Facebook friend is exceptionally good-looking, asks you to download WhatsApp to communicate, attempts to isolate you from friends and family, and/or gets romantic very quickly. If youre seeing that picture of a very handsome person, ask someone younger in your life  a child, a grandchild, a niece or a nephew  to help you reverse-image search or identify the photo, she said. She said the man in pictures she received was a plastic surgeon from Spain whose photos have been stolen and used by scammers. Kleinart had also been living under lockdown during the early pandemic when she got the initial friend request, and the companionship and communication meant a lot to her while she was cut off from family. When the scam fell apart, she missed the relationship even more than the savings. Losing the love was worse than losing the money, she said. Job scams involve a person pretending to be a recruiter or a company in order to steal money or information from a job seeker.  Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.  Theyre going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work, she said. And theyre often saying its a 100% remote position because thats so appealing to people. Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and drivers license details. The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said. Other details dont generally need to be shared with an employer until after youve gotten an offer. According to Lois Greisman, an associate director of marketing practices at the Federal Trade Commission, an investment scam constitutes any get-rich-quick scheme that lures targets via social media accounts or online ads. Investment scammers typically add different forms of testimony, such as from other social media accounts, to support that the investment works. Many of these also involve cryptocurrency. To avoid falling for these frauds, the FTC recommends independently researching the company  especially by searching the companys name along with terms like review or scam. When youre using Facebook or scrolling Google results, be aware of quiz scams, which typically appear innocuous and ask about topics you might be interested in, such as your car or favorite TV show. They may also ask you to take a personality test. Despite these benign-seeming questions, scammers can then use the personal information you share to respond to security questions from your accounts or hack your social media to send malware links to your contacts. To protect your personal information, the FTC simply recommends steering clear of online quizzes. The commission also advises consumers to use random answers for security questions. Asked to enter your mothers maiden name? Say its something else: Parmesan or another word youll remember, advises Terri Miller, consumer education specialist at the FTC. This way, scammers wont be able to use information they find to steal your identity. When buying or selling products on Instagram or Facebook Marketplace, keep in mind that not everyone that reaches out to you has the best intentions. To avoid being scammed when selling via an online platform, the FTC recommends checking buyers profiles, not sharing any codes sent to your phone or email, and avoiding accepting online payments from unknown persons. Likewise, when buying something from an online marketplace, make sure to diligently research the seller. Take a look at whether the profile is verified, what kind of reviews they have, and the terms and conditions of the purchase. Scammers often reach out by phone, Ben Hoffman, Head of Strategy and Consumer Products at Fifth Third Bank recommends that you dont pick up unknown incoming calls. Banks dont ask your for your password, said Hoffman. If you believe your bank is trying to reach out, give them a call at a number listed on their website.  This makes it easier to know for sure that youre not talking to a scammer. As a general rule, banks dont often call unless there is suspicious activity on your account or if you previously contacted them about a problem. If you receive many unknown calls that end up being scammers or robocalls, you can use tools available on your phone to block spam. Check here for how to do this on your iPhone and here for Android. There are many tools are your disposal that can be used to protect yourself from scammers online.   Use a password manager to ensure youre utilizing a complex password that scammers cant guess.  Regularly checking your credit report and bank statements is a good practice since it can help you identify if someone has been using your bank account without your knowledge.  Turn on multi-factor verification to make sure impersonators arent able to access your social media or bank accounts.  As scams get more sophisticated, its difficult to know who to trust or if a person is actually real, or an impersonator. If you arent sure if a job recruiter is real or if your bank is actually asking your for information, find organizations that can help you, recommended Velasquez.  Organizations like the Identity Theft Protection Center and the AARP Fraud Watch Network offer free services for customers who need help identifying scams or knowing what to do if youve been a victim of a scam.  If youve taken all the necessary steps to protect yourself, you might want to help those around you. Whether youre helping your grandparents to block unknown callers on their phones or sharing tips with your neighbors, talking with others about how to protect themselves from scams can be very effective. If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, its good practice to report it on the FTCs website. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"Threatened by Trump tariffs, Japan walks a delicate tightrope between US and China","WASHINGTON (AP)  Just as Japans top trade negotiator traveled to Washington for another round of tariff talks last week, a bipartisan delegation bearing the name of Japan-China Friendship wrapped up a visit to Beijing. A week earlier, the head of the junior party in Japans ruling coalition was in Beijing delivering a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba addressed to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Details of the letter are unknown, but the two sides discussed U.S. tariffs in addition to bilateral issues. Among all U.S. allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out.  It is a peculiar case not only for its staunch commitment to its alliance with the United States but also for its complicated and uneasy history with the neighboring Asian giant  particularly the war history from the 20th century that still casts a shadow over the politics of today. On one hand, they are neighbors and they are important economic partners. Theres a lot that connects Japan and China, said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations. But on the other hand, I think there are limits to how far theyre going to lean into China.  While Japan wont walk away from its alliance with the United States, the linchpin of the Asian countrys diplomacy and security policies, its also true that the tariffs and uncertainty that Trump has created for Japan is really shaking things up in Tokyo, Goodman said.  
        
     Last month, President Donald Trump announced a 24% tariff on Japanese goods in a sweeping plan to levy duties on about 90 countries. The White House has since paused the tariffs but a 10% baseline duty on all countries except China, allowing time for negotiations. Still, Trumps 25% tax on aluminum, steel and auto exports have gone into effect for Japan. The tariff moves, as well as Trumps America First agenda, have cast doubts among the Japanese if the United States is still a dependable ally, while China is rallying support from tariff-threatened countries  including Japan. When Tetsuo Saito led Japans Komeito Party delegation to Beijing in late April, China hinted at difficulty in its tariff dispute with the United States, signaling its willingness to improve ties with Tokyo. An unnamed senior Chinese official said his country was in trouble when discussing Trumps 145% tariff on Chinese products, according to Japanese reports. Saitos visit was soon followed by that of the bipartisan delegation of Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians Union. Zhao Leji, Beijings top legislator, told the delegation that Chinas National Peoples Congress would be willing to carry out various forms of dialogue and exchanges. Beijing did not lift a ban on Japans seafood imports as the Japanese delegates hoped, but it signaled positive signs on its assessment of the safety of the discharges of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Beijing banned Japans seafood products in 2023, citing those concerns. Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have long been rocky. In the past several years, they squabbled not only over the seafood ban but also long-standing territorial disputes over the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands in the East China Sea, Beijings growing military assertiveness and violence against Japanese nationals in China  an issue complicated by the nations uneasy history.  Tokyos closer ties with Washington during Joe Bidens presidency also upset Beijing, which saw it as part of the U.S. strategy to contain China and has lectured Tokyo to face squarely and reflect on the history of aggression. An imperial power in Asia for centuries, China fell behind Japan in the 19th century when Japan began to embrace Western industrialization and grew into a formidable economic and military power. It invaded China in the 1930s and controlled the northeastern territory known as Manchuria. War atrocities, including the Nanking Massacre and the use of chemical and biological weapons and human medical experiments in Manchuria, have left deep scars in China. They have yet to be healed, though Japans conservative politicians today still attempt to deny the aggression. Ishiba, elected Japans prime minister in October, has a more neutral view on his countrys wartime history than the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his two successors. Weeks after taking office, Ishiba held talks with Xi on the sidelines of a leaders summit. Chinese scholars, however, see Tokyos recent engagements with Beijing as a pragmatic move to hedge against U.S. protectionism and not a long-term strategy for stability with China. The odds are low for Japan to move into Chinas orbit, Goodman said. They have for a long time had to manage an important but challenging relationship with China, he said. And that is, again, a long-standing problem for Japan, going back centuries or millennia. While Japan might welcome the friendlier tone from Beijing, it is trying to stabilize Japan-U.S. relations under Trumps America First agenda, and it is hoping to settle the tariff dispute without confronting Washington, with an eye on preventing Beijing from exploiting any fallout in Japan-U.S. relations. Japan was among the first countries to hold tariff talks with Washington. During the first round in mid-April, Trump inserted himself into the discussions, a sign of the high stakes for the United States to reach a deal with Japan. The Trump administration reportedly pushed for Japan to buy more U.S.-made cars and open its market to U.S. beef, rice and potatoes.  After the second round of negotiation in Washington last week, Ryosei Akazawa, the countrys chief tariff negotiator, said he pushed Japans request that the U.S. drop tariffs and was continuing efforts toward an agreement acceptable to both sides. He said Japans auto industry was already hurting from the 25% tariff and that he needed to be thorough but fast. Asked about China, Akazawa said only that his country keeps watching the U.S.-China tariff development with great interest. He noted Japans deep trade ties with China. While China and Japan are working to mend ties, the two are also competing in the Southeast Asia region, where Trump has threatened high tariffs as well. The region is deeply integrated into Chinas supply chain but under pressure from the West to diversify and reduce its reliance on China. With younger and growing populations as compared to East Asia, the region is considered an important growth center. Japan, as a major postwar development aid contributor, has gradually regained trust in the region, which also was scarred by Japans World War II past. On Wednesday, Ishiba returned from Vietnam and the Philippines after agreeing with their leaders to further strengthen security and economic ties. During the visit, Ishiba stressed Japans commitment to maintaining and strengthening a multilateral free-trade system in each country. Ishiba also had telephone talks with his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts earlier this month about U.S. tariffs. Just weeks earlier, Xi was in Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, also stressing free trade and seeking stronger supply chains.  At a recent discussion at the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute, Itsunori Onodera, Japans governing party policy chief, warned of very unstable feelings among many Asian countries faced with high tariffs from the United States.  Theres a danger they might become more distant and become closer to China, Onodera said. This is not something that Japan wants, either. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",https://apnews.com/article/china-beijing-tariff-trump-xi-japan-1c9c669951146e9bee9c3563293dd694,business
"What to Stream: Poker Face, Blake Shelton, the spy thriller Black Bag and Vince Vaughn","NEW YORK (AP)  The popular whodunit series Poker Face starring Natasha Lyonne returning for its second season and Steven Soderberghs sleek and lean spy thriller Black Bag are some of the new television, films, music and games headed to a device near you. Also among the streaming offerings worth your time, as selected by The Associated Press entertainment journalists: Blake Shelton releasing a new full-length album, gamers can fight off all sorts of gnarly wildlife in the sci-fi world of Revenge of the Savage Planet and theres a new Lifetime documentary series about the country music iconic family the Judds.  Steven Soderberghs sleek and lean spy thriller Black Bag (streaming now on Peacock), stars Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett as married British intelligence operatives whose agency has a mole that needs ferreting out. In my review, I praised the third collaboration between Soderbergh and screenwriter David Koepp ( Presence,Kimi ): Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from The Thin Man or a more cerebral Mr. & Mrs. Smith.  In Nonnas (Friday, May 9 on Netflix), Vince Vaughn stars as Jody Joe Scaravella, an MTA worker who, after the death of his mother, opens up a traditional Italian restaurant to honor her memory. He hires only grandmothers  played by Lorraine Bracco, Talia Shire, Susan Sarandon and Brenda Vaccaro  to do the cooking.   James Jones documentary Antidote, playing as part of PBS Frontline, follows the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev, a prominent reporter on the imprisonment and death of Alexei Navalny, and Evgenia Kara-Murza, the wife of activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was poisoned twice and sentenced to 25 years in a Russian prison. The film, debuting May 6 on PBS, PBS.org and the PBS app, details the lives of opponents to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

US states push for speed-limiting devices on the cars of dangerous drivers,"A teenager who admitted being addicted to speed behind the wheel had totaled two other cars in the year before he slammed into a minivan at 112 mph (180 kph) in a Seattle suburb, killing the driver and three of the five children she was transporting for a homeschool co-op. After sentencing Chase Daniel Jones last month to more than 17 years in prison, the judge tacked on a novel condition should he drive again: His vehicle must be equipped with a device that prevents accelerating far beyond the speed limit. Virginia this year became the first state to agree to give its judges such a tool to deal with the most dangerous drivers on the road. Washington, D.C., already is using it and similar measures await governors signatures in Washington state and Georgia. New York and California also could soon tap the GPS-based technology to help combat a recent national spike in traffic deaths. Its a horror no one should have to experience, said Amy Cohen, who founded the victims advocacy group Families for Safe Streets after her 12-year-old son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was killed by a speeding driver in front of their New York home more than a decade ago. 
        
     Andrea Hudson, 38, the minivan driver who was killed when Jones ran a red light, was building a backyard greenhouse with her husband to help educate several kids who shuttle between homes during the school day, her father, Ted Smith, said.  Also killed in the March 2024 crash near Hudsons home in Renton, Washington, were Boyd Buster Brown and Eloise Wilcoxson, both 12, and Matilda Wilcoxson, 13. Hudsons two children were sitting on the passenger side and survived, but they spent weeks in a hospital. You always hear of these horrific accidents, and its always far away, you dont know anybody. But all of a sudden, thats my daughter, Smith said. This guy did not swerve or brake. And it was just a missile. Smith knew Washington state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who reached out to offer condolences and tell him she was sponsoring legislation to mandate intelligent speed assistance devices as a condition for habitual speeders to get back their suspended licenses. Leavitt predicts it will have an even more powerful impact than revoking driving privileges, citing studies showing around three-quarters of people who lose their licenses get behind a wheel anyway. Between 2019 and 2024, the state saw a 200% increase in drivers cited for going at least 50 mph (80 kph) over the speed limit, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission. I guess I dont understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast, Leavitt said. But if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they cant. Its going to stop them in their tracks. The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda. Because Jones, 19, didnt receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldnt have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judges requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said. Competing tech companies that joined forces to lobby for ignition interlock requirements for drunken drivers have been working in unison again the last few years to pitch intelligent speed assistance. Brandy Nannini, chief government affairs officer at one manufacturer, Grapevine, Texas-based Smart Start, said fleet vehicles including school buses in the nations capital have been trying it out for years. But it took a lot of refinement before the GPS technology could instantly recognize speed limit changes and compel vehicles with the devices installed to adjust accordingly. Weve got a lot more satellites in the sky now, said Ken Denton, a retired police officer who is the chief compliance officer at Cincinnati-based LifeSafer, part of the coalition of companies. When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed. A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion. Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nanninis car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit. That was my first question: Is it safe? Hope said. Not only did he come away convinced it is, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers. For those mandated by a court, the price could be hefty: $4 per day and a $100 installation fee. The fee would be less for low-income offenders. Cohen with Families for Safe Streets, which provides support services to the loved ones of crash victims, knows firsthand the kind of impact slowing down speeders can make. A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.  By then, the roads speed limit had been lowered. That boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not, she said. When you are going a few miles slower, theres more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, its much less likely to be deadly.",https://apnews.com/article/speed-limiters-reckless-drivers-states-judges-washington-72165c45b7481b6b313248841006578b,business
OpenAI reverses course and says its nonprofit will continue to control its business,"After months of pursuing a plan to convert itself into a for-profit business, OpenAI is reversing course and said Monday its nonprofit will continue to control the company that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products. We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware, said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees.  Altman and the chair of OpenAIs nonprofit board, Bret Taylor, said the board made the decision for the nonprofit to retain control of OpenAI but is proposing another way to grow its business. As part of what Taylor described as a recapitalization, the nonprofits existing for-profit arm will convert into a public benefit corporation that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission. Shareholders will also receive stock and a cap on profit for some investors will be lifted, as part of the new plan. Altman said the changes would make it easier for the for-profit to behave more like a normal company. Taylor declined to say Monday how large of an ownership stake the nonprofit will have in the new public benefit corporation. He said in a call with reporters that the nonprofit will choose the board members of the public benefit corporation and, at first, they will likely be the same people who now sit on OpenAIs nonprofit board. Public benefit corporations were first created in Delaware in 2013 and other states have adopted the same or similar laws that require the companies to pursue not just profit but a social good. Public benefit corporations, which include Amalgamated Bank and the online education platform Coursera, need to define that social good, which can vary broadly, when they incorporate.  
        
     Altman said that converting from a limited liability company to a public benefit corporation just sets us up to be a more understandable structure to do the things that a company of our scope has to do. Theres so much more demand to use AI tools than we thought there was going to be, Altman said. Getting access to more capital will make it easier for OpenAI to pursue mergers and acquisitions and other normal things companies would do, Altman said. OpenAIs co-founders, including Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build whats known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanitys benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product. OpenAI first outlined plans last year to convert its core governance structure but faced a number of challenges. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led Musk to invest in the charity and tried to block the conversion to a for-profit. A federal judge last week dismissed some of Musks claims and allowed others to proceed to a trial set for next year. OpenAI also faced scrutiny from the top law enforcement officers in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, and California, where it operates out of a San Francisco headquarters. The California attorney generals office said in a statement that it was reviewing the plan and, This remains an ongoing matter  and we are in continued conversations with Open AI. The attorney generals office in Delaware did not immediately return a request for comment. A number of advocates, including former OpenAI employees and other charities, had petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAIs charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. Some, including AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton, who won a Nobel Prize last year, were concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harm. Multiple other artificial intelligence companies have opted to incorporate as public benefit corporations, including Anthropic and xAI, Musks company. However, OpenAI would remain unique in that its public benefit corporation would still be controlled by the nonprofits board. Altman said it would maybe be easier to raise money if OpenAI were a fully normal company, but given its mission, we dont want to be a fully normal company, and we believe this is well over the bar of what we need to be able to fundraise. Altman said he still expects a large investment from Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group, which in February announced plans to set up a joint company with OpenAI to push AI services.  The companys biggest investor over the past several years has been Microsoft, which declined to comment Monday. Page Hedley, a former OpenAI employee who led a petition to halt the for-profit conversion, said he was pleased that OpenAI was listening to the concerns of civil society leaders but remained concerned about the details. The charitable mission is about ensuring this technology benefits the public and not shareholders, said Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview. The premise of OpenAIs founding was that those interests might diverge significantly in the development, ownership or control of the technology. Thats whats at stake. A coalition of California-based charities on Monday renewed its call for Californias attorney general to investigate and questioned whether OpenAIs planned new business structure would carry out its charitable mission. If OpenAI is truly committed to benefiting humanity, it should transfer its charitable assets over to an independent public trust completely separate from any for-profit interests, said a statement from Fred Blackwell, CEO of the San Francisco Foundation. Rose Chan Loui, a nonprofit tax attorney who has studied OpenAIs structure, said any change would need to allow the nonprofit to maintain control over the development of the technology. If theyre not the majority shareholder, the control would have to be given through outsized voting rights on specific issues, said Chan Loui, who is the executive director of the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law. That is possible but may frustrate investors who want to exercise their rights to influence the direction of the company.   The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of APs text archives.",https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-nonprofit-sam-altman-3dbfca4d13586debf9740e0dede8ba47,business
Trumps meme coin business racks up fees as buyers jump at the chance for access to the president,"In the crypto world, meme coins are mostly just jokes with no intrinsic value. But the Trump family is parlaying the presidents meme coin into two valuable commodities: serious cash and access to the president. Since the coin was launched earlier this year, it has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And on Monday, Trump promoted a dinner hes set to attend on May 22 thats open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins. According to the contests rules, the top 220 holders of the meme coin will get to go to the dinner at Trumps Washington-area golf club. The top 25 holders will also get to attend a reception where they can rub shoulders with Trump beforehand. Let the President know how many $TRUMP coins YOU own! the meme coin said on its website promoting the dinner. Trading activity in the meme coin jumped after the dinner was first announced and the price rose as well. But the Trumps dont need to sell any coins to make money. 
        
     Decentralization is foundational to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the worlds most popular crypto, was born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a digital currency meant to be uncontrolled by banks or governments. Trump meme coins can be traded on a decentralized exchange, which is essentially a place where traders can swap goods without a middleman. Instead of matching buyers and sellers one by one, decentralized exchanges use something called a liquidity pool to ensure trades can happen easily and instantly. Liquidity pools are essentially an automated pot of funds that pair meme coins like $TRUMP with more popular types of crypto that can be easily traded. When the Trump meme coin was first launched, its creators initially released 20% of the planned 1 billion total coins. Half of that 20% was put up for public sale while the other half was put into a liquidity pool. CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, and another company receive trading revenue derived from trading activities of the Trump meme coins, according to its website. Through the liquidity pool, the creators of Trumps meme coins make money by charging tiny fees on each trade. You dont really care about what happens to the price. You only care that there is continuous volume, said Nicolai Sndergaard, a research analyst at the blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Because the more volume there is, that means more trades and therefore more fees for you. Since cryptocurrency blockchains are public, its possible to track how much in trading fees has been paid. Chainalysis said Trump meme coin creators made more than $1.3 million in trading fees in the week after the dinner was first announced. The value of the meme coin jumped from about $9 to around $14 just after the announcement. It was trading around $11 on Monday afternoon. Launched just before he took office, Trumps meme coin has become one of the most high-profile ways the norm-breaking president has mixed politics and his personal finances. The remaining 80% of Trumps meme coins, which are still under a lock-up, have been allocated to CIC Digital and another company. An ethics agreement  prohibits Trump from day-to-day decision making at the Trump Organization when hes president and limits the financial information about the business that can be shared with him.  During an interview with NBCs Meet the Press over the weekend, Trump said he didnt follow the price swings of his meme coin and dismissed the idea that he was profiting from the presidency. He also rejected a suggestion that he would forgo any profits made from his crypto endeavors. Should I contribute all of my real estate that Ive owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because Im president and doing a good job? I dont think so, Trump said. The team behind Trumps meme coins has been aggressively trying to promote the chance to eat with the president. Good News! President Trump is allowing one more person to attend Dinner with Trump, the meme coins official account on X said last week, encouraging people to reply with memes featuring Trump. Our favorite $TRUMP memes will be shown to President Trump and we will pick 1 person who gets to come to the dinner on May 22nd! The creators have also tried to up the ante by offering $100,000 Trump-themed watches to the top four holders of Trumps meme coins. On Monday night, Trump hosted a closed-door Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner fundraiser sponsored by his MAGA Inc. super PAC at his golf club outside Washington. An invitation to the event that circulated online instructs those invited to pay $1.5 million per person to attend. The White House did not provide a list of attendees, though the super PAC eventually will be required to list donors in its regular public disclosures. Whether the public will ever know who bought their way into the meme coin dinner with the president is unclear, though. Unlike political donations that must be publicly reported, theres no disclosure requirement for meme coin buyers.  Critics of Trumps foray into meme coins, which includes several Democrats, say the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency gives bad actors the opportunity to try and unduly influence the president through purchasing his digital assets. The Trump meme coin website assures those who register for the contest that their full legal name and contact information will never be publicly shown. Instead, registrants pick a username thats displayed on the websites leaderboard. The ranking is dependent not just on how many Trump meme coins someone holds, but also on how long. After No. 220, the board has a note of encouragement for those just below the cut to buy more of the meme coins. Youre so close. FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT for your $TRUMP dinner.

Trump disrupts global economic order even though the US is dominant,"WASHINGTON (AP)  By declaring a trade war on the rest of the world, President Donald Trump has panicked global financial markets, raised the risk of a recession and broken the political and economic alliances that made much of the world stable for business after World War II. Trumps latest round of tariffs went into full effect at midnight Wednesday, with higher import tax rates on dozens of countries and territories taking hold. President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Economists are puzzled to see Trump trying to overhaul the existing economic order and doing it so soon after inheriting the strongest economy in the world. Many of the trading partners he accuses of ripping off U.S. businesses and workers were already floundering. There is a deep irony in Trump claiming unfair treatment of the American economy at a time when it was growing robustly while every other major economy had stalled or was losing growth momentum, said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. In an even greater irony, the Trump tariffs are likely to end Americas remarkable run of success and crash the economy, job growth and financial markets. Trump and his trade advisers insist that the rules governing global commerce put the United States at a distinct disadvantage. But mainstream economists  whose views Trump and his advisers disdain  say the president has a warped idea of world trade, especially a preoccupation with trade deficits, which they say do nothing to impede growth.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) The administration accuses other countries of erecting unfair trade barriers to keep out American exports and using underhanded tactics to promote their own. In Trumps telling, his tariffs are a long-overdue reckoning: The U.S. is the victim of an economic mugging by Europe, China, Mexico, Japan and even Canada. 
        
     Its true that some countries charge higher taxes on imports than the United States does. Some manipulate their currencies lower to ensure that their goods are price-competitive in international markets. Some governments lavish their industries with subsidies to give them an edge. However, the United States is still the second-largest exporter in the world, after China. The U.S. exported $3.1 trillion of goods and services in 2023, far ahead of third-place Germany at $2 trillion. The fear that Trumps remedies are deadlier than the maladies hes trying to cure has sent investors fleeing American stocks. Since Trump announced sweeping import taxes on April 2, the S&P 500 has cratered 12%. Traffic flows on Interstate 5 past shipping containers near downtown Los Angeles, Tuesday, April 8, 2025.

Hong)   Trump and his advisers point to Americas lopsided trade numbers  year after year of huge deficits  as proof of foreigners perfidy. Hes seeking to restore justice and millions of long-gone U.S. factory jobs by taxing imports at rates not seen in America since the days of the horse and buggy. Theyve taken so much of our wealth away from us, the president declared last week at a White House Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the tariffs announcement. Were not going to let that happen. We truly can be very wealthy. We can be so much wealthier than any country. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick holds a chart as President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) But the U.S. is already the wealthiest major economy in the world. And the International Monetary Fund in January forecast that the United States would outgrow every other major advanced economy this year. China and India did grow faster than the United States over the past decade, but their living standards still dont come close to those in the U.S. Manufacturing in the U.S. has been fading for decades. There is widespread agreement that many American manufacturers couldnt compete with an influx of cheap imports after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Factories closed, workers were laid off and heartland communities withered. Four years later, nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs had been lost, though robots and other forms of automation probably did at least as much to reduce factory jobs as the China shock.   To turn around this long decline, Trump has repeatedly unsheathed the tariffs that are his weapon of choice. Since returning to the White House in January, hes plastered 25% taxes on foreign cars, steel and aluminum. Hes hit Chinese imports with 20% levies, on top of hefty tariffs he imposed on China during his first term. On April 2, he blasted his big bazooka: 10% baseline tariffs on just about everybody and reciprocal tariffs on everyone else that the Trump team identified as bad actors, including tiny Lesotho (a 50% import tax) and China (34% before adding earlier levies). Trump views tariffs as an all-purpose economic fix that will protect American industries, encourage companies to open factories in America, raise money for the U.S. Treasury and give him leverage to bend other countries to his will, even on issues that have nothing to do with trade, such as drug trafficking and immigration. The president also sees a smoking gun: The United States has bought more from other countries than it has sold them every year for the past half-century. In 2024, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services came to a whopping $918 billion, the second-highest amount on record. Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro calls Americas trade deficits the sum of all cheating by other countries. However, economists say trade deficits arent a sign of national weakness. The U.S. economy has nearly quadrupled in size, adjusted for inflation, during that half-century of trade deficits. There is no reason to think that a bigger trade deficit means lower growth, said former IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics and an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. In fact, the opposite is closer to the truth in many countries. A trade deficit, Obstfeld said, does not mean a country is losing through trade or being ripped off.

(AP Photo/Mahmud Hossain Opu)    The faster the U.S. economy grows, in fact, the more imports Americans tend to buy and the wider the trade deficit tends to get. The U.S. trade deficit  the gap between what it sells and what it buys from foreign countries  hit a record $945 billion in 2022 as the American economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. Trade deficits typically fall sharply in recessions. Nor are trade deficits primarily inflicted on America by other countries unfair trading practices. To economists, theyre a homegrown product, the result of Americans propensity to save little and consume more than they produce. American shoppers famous appetite for spending more than the country makes means that a chunk of the spending is used for imports. If the United States boosted its saving  for example, by reducing its budget deficits  then that would reduce its trade deficit as well, economists say. Its not like the rest of the world has been ripping us off for decades, said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo. Its because we dont save enough. The flip side of Americas low savings and big trade deficits is a steady inflow of foreign investment as other countries sink their export earnings into the United States. Direct foreign investment into the U.S. came to $349 billion in 2023, the World Bank reported, nearly double No. 2 Singapores inflows. The only scenario in which tariffs reduce the U.S. deficit is if they cause investment in the U.S. to crash, said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. That would be a disaster. Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik said a well-designed industrial policy supported by select tariffs might have fostered increased investment and capacity in manufacturing. Instead, Rodrik said, Trumps actions just throw up a lot of uncertainty and alienate Americas best allies, making for a terrible policy all in all. ___ AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-markets-china-recession-economy-e532f95f05cf929b7bf27ea636627937,business
Germanys economy is expected to be more or less stagnant this year,"BERLIN (AP)  Germanys economy is likely to be more or less stagnant in 2025 after shrinking for two years and the impact of U.S. tariffs could weigh down an already unimpressive showing, leading think tanks forecast Thursday. Germany has Europes biggest economy and is the 27-nation European Unions most populous member. Five economic institutes said in a regular update that they expect minimal growth of 0.1% this year  down from the 0.8% they forecast in September. They predicted growth of 1.3% in 2026. However, they pointed to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administrations trade policy. U.S. tariffs on aluminum, steel and vehicle imports are likely to reduce German economic growth this year and next by 0.1 percentage points each, an effect that the new forecast already takes into account, according to their report. The sweeping tariffs announced last week by President Donald Trump and then largely put on hold could double that hit to gross domestic product, the economists said. But they added that the specific effects are difficult to quantify, as tariff rates have never been raised so sharply in the worlds current globalized economy. Germanys prospective new government, which hopes to take office next month after months of political drift in the country, aims to revitalize the economy.

How to protect yourself from scammers offering fake jobs,"NEW YORK (AP)  Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of scammers impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.  In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.  Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.  Weve really seen tremendous growth in job scams, Velasquez said. I think thats just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people. It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.  After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment shed need for the job. A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. Thats when she learned the job was a scam.  
        
     Im a little traumatized, said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.  If youre a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers: Job scams are a type of impersonation scam. Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.  Theyre going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work, she said. And theyre often saying its a 100% remote position because thats so appealing to people. Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and drivers license details. The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.  Other details dont generally need to be shared with an employer until after youve gotten an offer. Whether youre replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didnt initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.  Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.  Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:   Dont respond to the message right away.   Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.   Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.  If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.  If you receive a message from a recruiter, its best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.  In Islams case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.  A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.  If you deposit a check and its fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check, Puig said.  So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.  When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.  Dont let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust, Velasquez said.  After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiters email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.  This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I cant just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are, Islam said.  If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, its good practice to report it on the FTCs website. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

USDA bans school lunch fees for low-income families,"NEW YORK (AP)  The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027.  School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge processing fees for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  For families with lower incomes who cant afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. The new Agriculture Departments policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.  USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. While todays action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.  
        
     The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.  Its just massively inconvenient, said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. A dollar here and there, I expected, she said. But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower  as are the salaries  is a lot. Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a childs account.  While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate. Just three companies  MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect  dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices, the agency said, including those that may violate federal consumer protection law. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

The White House is cracking down on overdraft fees,"NEW YORK (AP)  The Biden administration has finalized a rule limiting overdraft fees banks can charge, as part of the White Houses campaign to reduce junk fees that hit consumers on everyday purchases, including banking services. President Joe Biden had called the fees, which can be as high as $35, exploitative, while the banking industry has lobbied extensively to keep the existing fee structures in place.  Under the finalized rule announced Thursday, banks will be able to choose from three options: they may charge a flat overdraft fee of $5, they may charge a fee that covers their costs and losses, or they may charge any fee so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan the way they would for any other loan, typically expressed as an annual percentage rate, or APR. While banks have cut back on overdraft fees in the past decade, the nations biggest banks still take in roughly $8 billion in the charges every year, according to data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and bank public records. Currently, there is no cap on the overdraft fees that banks can legally charge.  Right now, when a bank temporarily lends a consumer money when their account has reached a zero balance, the consumer is typically responsible for paying back both the overdrawn amount and an additional fee, which can be more than the original amount charged. In one example often cited by opponents of the fees, a $3 cup of coffee can end up costing someone more than $30.  The finalized rule is set to take effect in October 2025, but the incoming Trump administration has yet to tap anyone to lead the CFPB, and has mentioned the idea of eliminating the agency.  
        
     The finalized rule applies to banks and credit unions that have more than $10 billion in assets, which includes the nations largest banks. Banks have previously sued the CFPB over these rules and caps on credit card late fees, and are likely to sue again. Congress also has the ability to challenge or overturn the rule. Overdraft fees originated during a time when consumers wrote and cashed checks more frequently  so that the checks would clear instead of bouncing, if there was an issue of timing  but banks steadily increased the fees in the first two decades of the 2000s. The fees disproportionately affect banks most cash-strapped consumers. A majority of overdrafts (70%) are charged to customers with average account balances between $237 and $439, according to the CFPB.  The agency estimates the new rule would save consumers about $5 billion in annual overdraft fees, or $225 per household that typically experiences the fees. _____ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

US imposes sanctions on Myanmar ethnic militia for facilitating cyber scams,"BANGKOK (AP)  An ethnic militia in southeastern Myanmar that has been sanctioned by the United States for alleged involvement in human trafficking and online scams on Tuesday denied the accusations. The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday announced sanctions against the Karen National Army, or KNA, as well as its leader Col. Saw Chit Thu and his sons, Saw Htoo Eh Moo and Saw Chit Chit. They are accused of facilitating cyber scams that harm U.S. citizens, human trafficking, and cross-border smuggling, according to a Treasury Department statement. Cyber scam operations, such as those run by the KNA, generate billions in revenue for criminal kingpins and their associates, while depriving victims of their hard-earned savings and sense of security, said Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender. Treasury is committed to using all available tools to disrupt these networks and hold accountable those who seek to profit from these criminal schemes. Those who are hired to carry out the scams have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretences and find themselves trapped in virtual slavery. The sanctions block the targeted individuals and their companies from accessing money and assets under U.S. control, and prohibit U.S. citizens from providing financial services to them. Saw Chit Thu has already been sanctioned by the European Union and the U.K. for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking.  
        
     Lt. Col. Naing Maung Zaw, a spokesperson for the KNA  which operates as the Karen ethnic minoritys official Border Guard Force affiliated with Myanmars military government  said the groups activities are aimed at regional development and not related to cyber scams. He described the U.S. sanctions as a deliberate act of abasement by a powerful country over a weaker one. They are doing it because they can, he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Local militias in several border regions have de facto control in areas where their minority groups are dominant. The KNA controls Shwe Kokko and some areas in Myawaddy, on the border with Thailand in the state of Kayin, also known as Karen state. Shwe Kokko and Myawaddy are known havens for criminal syndicates that have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams, including romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Critics have accused the KNA of being involved in the criminal activities, at least to the extent of providing protection to the scam centers. Naing Maung Zaw said scam operations were carried out not only in areas controlled by the KNA but also in other places in Myawaddy. He acknowledged that his group rented land to some businesses holding the property where scam centers were located and said the KNA would continue with its mass repatriation of the foreigners working in scam centers, which it carries out in cooperation with the military government.

DoorDash rings up record first-quarter revenue and expands delivery reach through acquisitions,"DoorDash said Tuesday that demand for deliveries remained strong in the first quarter even as more Americans feel increasingly uneasy about the U.S. economy.  We havent seen any changes in consumer behavior even if there are changes in consumer sentiment, co-founder and CEO Tony Xu said in a call with investors. Food really is the most resilient category. Total orders climbed 18% to 732 million, a quarterly record. DoorDash said demand for grocery delivery surpassed prior quarters, with more than 25% of active users ordering groceries. DoorDash said it also added U.S. restaurants to its platform and broadened its geographic reach. Customers who use the companys DashPass and Wolt+ subscription services, which charge a monthly fee, feel delivery is more affordable, said Chief Financial Officer Ravi Inukonda. The San Francisco company said 22 million people subscribe to those services.  DoorDash confirmed that it will acquire Britains Deliveroo for 2.9 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in cash, expanding its business in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Deliveroo first announced it had received a bid from DoorDash just over a week ago.  It also said Tuesday that it had purchased SevenRooms, a New York company that makes hospitality management software, for $1.2 billion in cash. DoorDash said the deal will expand its offerings to merchants and help them grow in-store sales and customer marketing. 
        
     DoorDash expects the SevenRooms deal to close in the second half of this year, while the Deliveroo deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The acquisitions are the biggest for DoorDash since 2022, when it bought Finnish rival Wolt Enterprises for $8.1 billion. That deal brought DoorDash into 22 countries where it didnt already operate, including Germany and Israel. With the addition of Deliveroo, Xu said DoorDash will operate in 45 countries, 30 of them in Europe. Deliveroo, which was founded in 2013, served 7 million monthly active users last year. DoorDash, founded the same year, has 42 million monthly active users. Investors expressed some concern about DoorDashs ability to generate profits as it integrates Deliveroo. DoorDash shares dropped nearly 9% Tuesday. Inukonda said the increasing scale will help drive profitability. Our goal is to improve unit economics. Take that and continue to drive improvements in retention and order frequency, which ultimately drive scale. And that scale drives profitability in the business, he said. Revenue at DoorDash rose 21% to a quarterly record of $3.03 billion. That was short of Wall Streets forecast of $3.09 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Net income was $193 million, a year after the company reported a $23 million loss for the January-March period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 44 cents per share, topping Wall Street expectations by a nickel.",https://apnews.com/article/doordash-first-quarter-deliveroo-sevenrooms-47e21b6a18ac4cfa91fba0bfb479d56a,business
US expands attempt to blow up Google with proposed teardown of its ad technology,"The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking a federal judge to force the company to part with some of the technology powering the companys digital ad network. The proposed dismantling coincides with an ongoing federal effort to separate Googles Chrome browser from its dominant search engine. The governments latest proposal was filed late Monday in a Virginia federal court two-and-half weeks after a federal judge ruled that its lucrative digital ad network has been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers. In a 17-page filing, Justice Department lawyers argued that U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema should punish Google by ordering the company to offload its AdX business and DFP ad platform, tools that bring together advertisers, who want to market their products, and publishers, who want to sell commercial space on their sites, to bring in revenue. The government also is seeking other restrictions, including a 10-year ban on Google from operating a digital ad exchange, to undercut the power of a recidivist monopolist.  Not surprisingly, its an idea that Google vehemently plans to oppose when the penalty phase of the antitrust case known as remedy hearings  begins in late September. Google already has vowed to appeal Brinkemas ruling that the technology powering the ad network has been breaking the law, but cant do that until the judge rules on its punishment in a decision expected late this year or early next year. 
        
     The Justice Departments proposal would cause economic chaos and technological dysfunction resulting in harm to millions of advertisers and publishers, and in so doing, degrade the experience of internet users, Google said in a court filing late Monday.  In its counterproposal, Google outlined a plan that it believes will bring more transparency to its ad network and eventually foster more competition. Google proposed the appointment of a trustee to oversee its behavior for three years.  The attempt to tear down Googles ad network comes on top of the Justice Departments ongoing effort to have the company part with its popular Chrome browser and impose other restrictions to curtail the power of its ubiquitous search engine, which another federal judge branded an illegal monopoly in a ruling last August. The remedy hearings in the search case are scheduled to conclude later this month, with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta expected by Labor Day. If the Justice Department is able to persuade the two different judges to order its proposed dismantling of Google, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service into seven separate regional companies more than 40 years ago. Googles Play Store for apps running on its Android software that powers most of the worlds smartphones also was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal jury in 2023 and is battling a judges order that would require it to overhaul a commission system that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue. But hobbling its search engine and digital ad network would be far bigger blows because they are the key cogs in a business that generated $265 billion in revenue last year.  Google is confronting the breakup threats at the same time the advent of artificial intelligence is changing the way consumers are using technology and seeking information online  a shift that could also siphon traffic and money away from a powerhouse that began in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998. Despite the adversity, Google is still delivering robust financial growth to its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., which is currently valued at $2 trillion. Alphabets share dipped by less than 1% Tuesday to close at $163.20.",https://apnews.com/article/google-ad-network-monopoly-penalty-073faf53cd757249f83d6eddabcb8e56,business
Chinas economy grew 5.4% in the first quarter as exporters rushed to beat Trumps tariffs,"BANGKOK (AP)  Chinas economy expanded at a 5.4% annual pace in January-March, the government said Wednesday, supported by strong exports ahead of U.S. President Donald Trumps rapid increases in tariffs on Chinese products. With the trade war clouding the outlook, analysts are forecasting that the worlds second largest economy will slow significantly in coming months, however, as tariffs as high as 145% on U.S. imports from China take effect. Beijing has hit back at the U.S. with 125% tariffs on American exports, while also stressing its determination to keep its own markets open to trade and investment.  Chinese leader Xi Jinpings visits is visiting several other Asian countries this week as he makes a case for free trade, presenting China as a source of stability and certainty in uncertain times.  
        
     Xi was visiting Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia, while the U.S. announced that a senior State Department official, Sean ONeill, would be traveling this week to Vietnams capital Hanoi and to Ho Chi Minh City, to Cambodias Siem Reap and to Tokyo.  China also has been highlighting its focus on trade with countries other than the United States at various trade fairs that are showcasing its vast market and competitiveness as a manufacturing giant.  At Chinas Canton trade fair, in the southern city of Guangzhou, exporters were emphatic about the need to look beyond selling to Americans. We need to diversify our market. When the West is dark, the East is bright. The global market is huge, said Wallace Huang, the export business director of Guangdong Weking Group, which makes rice cookers. In recent years, our exports to the U.S. have slowly been declining.  
        
     Exports helped Chinas economy expand at a 5% annual rate in 2024 and this years official target is about 5%.  
        
     In the near term, the tariffs will put pressure on Chinas economy, but they wont derail long-run growth, Sheng Laiyun, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters. He noted that Chinas exports to the United States have fallen to less than 15% of total exports from more than 19% five years ago.  Chinas economic foundation is stable, resilient and has great potential. We have the confidence, ability and confidence to cope with external challenges and achieve our established development goals, Sheng said.  In quarterly terms the economy grew 1.2% in January-March, slowing from 1.6% in the last quarter of 2024.  Chinese exports surged more than 12% from a year earlier in March and nearly 6% in U.S. dollar terms in the first quarter, as companies rushed to beat Trumps tariffs. That has supported robust manufacturing activity in the past several months.  Chinas industrial production rose 6.5% from a year earlier in the last quarter, led by a nearly 11% increase in output of equipment manufacturing.  The strongest growth was in advanced technologies, such as production of battery electric and hybrid vehicles, which jumped 45.4% year-on-year. Output of 3D printers soared almost 45% and of industrial robots surged 26%.  Despite relatively fast growth by global standards, the Chinese economy has struggled to regain momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic as downturn in the property market has pushed unemployment higher, leaving families wary about spending.  Consumer prices fell 0.1% in the first quarter, suggesting that demand is not keeping up with supply for many industries. Investment in real estate also remained weak, falling nearly 10% from a year earlier despite government efforts to spur more lending for housing purchases.  The tariffs crisis looms as another massive blow at a time when Beijing is striving to get businesses to invest and hire more workers and to persuade Chinese consumers to spend more. Both private and public sector economists have remained cautious about what to expect, given how Trump has kept switching his stance on the details of his trade war.  Given the events over the past two weeks, it is extremely difficult to predict how the U.S. and China tariffs on each other might evolve, Tao Wang and other UBS economists said in a report.  The International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank have stuck with more optimistic forecasts of about 4.6% growth this year.  After taking office, Trump first ordered a 10% increase in tariffs on imports from China. He later raised that to 20%. Now, China is facing 145% tariffs on most of its exports to the United States. UBS estimates that the tariffs, if they remain roughly as they are, could cause Chinas exports to the United States to fall by two-thirds in coming months and that its global exports could fall by 10% in dollar value. It cut its forecast for economic growth this year to 3.4% from an earlier 4%. It expects growth to slow to 3% in 2026.  China has stepped up efforts to spur more consumer spending and private sector investment over the past seven months, doubling down on subsidies for auto and appliance trade-ins and channeling more funding for housing and other cash strapped industries.  ___ AP researchers Yu Bing and Shihuan Chen contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-tariffs-trump-beijing-45a04578c3d637465b9043600fc54ca2,business
"US tariffs will weaken global economy and trigger inflation but not a global recession, IMF says","Surging U.S. tariffs will weaken the global economy and push up inflation this year, according to projections to be released next week by the International Monetary Fund. The IMFs Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said Thursday that the Trump administrations sharp increases in duties have caused global uncertainty to spike. The import taxes will slow global growth, but not cause a worldwide recession, she added. The details of the IMFs outlook will be issued Tuesday. The world economys resilience is being tested by the reboot of the global trading system that threatens to cause turbulence in financial markets, Georgieva said. That turbulence has been playing out in financial markets for weeks now, especially on Wall Street, which has experienced wild swings from day-to-day and often times even hour-to-hour. The IMF chief also echoed some Trump administration concerns. She called on countries to reduce their tariffs and lower other barriers to trade, a process that she said had stalled out in the past decade after making steady progress for many years after World War II. Trade distortions  tariff and nontariff barriers  have fed negative perceptions of a multilateral system seen to have failed to deliver a level playing field, she said. This feeling of unfairness in some places feeds the narrative: we play by the rules while others game the system without penalty. Georgieva added that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly. Due to the complexity of supply chains, the cost of a single item can be affected by tariffs in dozens of countries, she said. 
        
     Increased trade barriers also tend to immediately impact growth, and while it can lead to more domestic production, that takes time to implement, she added. In its most recent projections issued in January, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow nominally faster and for inflation to come down, though it warned that outlook was clouded by President Donald Trumps policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports. The Washington-based lending agency said at the time that it expected the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024.  Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, was forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026. However, in a blog post that accompanied those projections, the funds chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce are likely to push inflation higher in the near term.  Those forecasts from January are expected to change  possibly significantly  as Trumps trade war has escalated in recent months, particularly with the U.S.'s biggest trade partner, China. Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats  leading to more volatility in the stock market  but has been in a tit-for-tat tariff battle with China and has shown no sign of backing down. Each time Trump has raised tariffs on China, Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports. The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty. - AP Business Writer Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/global-economy-tariffs-imf-d15febaaaab65c7df8538cce170231eb,business
"US and global economic outlook deteriorates in Trump trade war, IMF says","WASHINGTON (AP)  The U.S. and global economies will likely slow significantly in the wake of President Donald Trumps tariffs and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.  The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.  And the Fund sees the worlds two largest economies, China and the United States, weakening: U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesnt expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to about 40%.  China is now projected to expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.  AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports tariffs have changed the outlook on the economy. We are entering a new era, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. This global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset. The forecasts underscore the widespread impact of both the tariffs and the uncertainty they have created. Every country in the world is affected, the IMF said, by hikes in US import taxes that have now lifted average U.S. duties to about 25%, the highest in a century. 
        
     The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.  The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty. Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties. Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didnt substantially change the IMFs forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.  The Trump administration has slapped duties on cars, steel, and aluminum, as well as 25% import taxes on most goods from Canada and Mexico. The White House has also imposed 10% tariffs on nearly all imports, and a huge 145% duty on goods from China, though smartphone and computers have been exempted. China has retaliated with 125% duties on US goods. The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administrations next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Most traded goods are parts that feed into finished products, and the tariffs could disrupt supply chains, similar to what occurred during the pandemic, Gourinchas warned in a blog post.  Companies facing uncertain market access will likely pause in the near term, reduce investment and cut spending, he wrote.  The U.S. tariffs are also expected to hit less-developed nations, with Mexicos economy now expected to shrink this year by 0.3%, down from a previous projection of 1.4% growth. South Africa is forecast to grow just 1% this year, down from a 1.5% projection in January.  While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a supply shock, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall. Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.  In his blog post, Gourinchas acknowleged that there is an acute perception that globalization unfairly displaced many domestic manufacturing jobs and added that there is some merit to these grievances.  But he added that the deeper force behind this decline is technological progress and automation, not globalization. Gourinchas noted that both Germany, which has a goods trade surplus, and the U.S., which has a deficit, have seen factory output remain relatively level in recent decades even as automation has caused manufacturing employment to decline. The IMF expects the tariffs to take a big chunk out of Chinas economy, but it also forecasts that additional spending by the Chinese government will offset much of the hit.  The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.  The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMFs January forecast.  Japans growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.  In a separate report Tuesday, the IMF warned that global financial stability risks have increased significantly, along with the deteriorating economic outlook. The fund noted that some stock and bond prices remained high despite the recent market rout triggered by Trumps tariffs  which means they are vulnerable to further drops. The IMF also cautioned that some financial institutions could come under strain in volatile markets, pointing in particular to heavily indebted hedge funds and asset management companies and the risk that they will be forced to raise cash by selling investments into an already-fragile market. _____ AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/recession-imf-economy-tariffs-5ec37492c9fac499923c094776b87552,business
"Most Americans expect higher prices as a result of Trumps tariffs, a new AP-NORC poll finds","WASHINGTON (AP)  Americans trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the presidents broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise. Roughly half of U.S. adults say that Trumps trade policies will increase prices a lot and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up somewhat, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 
        
     About half of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months. While skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesnt mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation. AP polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux reports on a new poll showing concerns over tariff impacts. Three months into his second term, Trumps handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. Thats roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March. Matthew Wood, 41, said hes waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but hes feeling anxious. Im not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends, said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. Personally, it hasnt affected me as of yet. But, generally, I dont know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.  
        
     Still, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trumps attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said hes willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs. About half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. Thats up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didnt previously have an opinion on tariffs. Trump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries. Actually, I think he shouldnt have suspended it, said Manis, a retired sheriffs deputy from Del Rio, Texas. Because now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen. Not quite 100 days into Trumps second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply. Trump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. Hes imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes  albeit partially suspending some of them  launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trumps tariff pronouncements. Many Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has gone too far when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll. Stocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trumps tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands. Trump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not sustainable. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are extremely or very concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want  a sign of the economys resilience so far. 
        
     Retirement savings are a source of anxiety  about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a major source of stress in their lives. But fewer  only about 2 in 10  identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety. This whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide, said Nicole Jones, 32. Its revenge  and everybodys losing on it. The Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadnt given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt. Things are more expensive for us, she said. And most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state. The difference is that Republicans  who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president  now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the countrys financial future. It wasnt all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine, Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trumps policies went into effect. ___ The AP-NORC poll of 1,260 adults was conducted April 17-21, using a sample drawn from NORCs probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

"The Fed expects to cut rates more slowly in 2025. What that could mean for mortgages, debt and more","NEW YORK (AP)  The Federal Reserves third interest rate cut of the year will likely have consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses. But with inflation pressures still elevated and with concern that President-elect Donald Trumps policies could fuel inflation, the Fed indicated Wednesday that its likely to cut rates more gradually in 2025 than it had projected three months ago. The policymakers now envision two rate cuts next year, not the four they predicted back in September. The result is that borrowers who have been hoping for much-lower-rate loans could be disappointed. Loan rates may barely budge if the Fed sticks with its plan to cut its key short-term rate only twice next year. This could be the last cut for a while, said Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree. Because the upcoming Trump administrations policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting.  Depending on the specific proposals the Trump administration manages to enact, the Fed could hold off on any additional cuts until March or even later.  Heres what to know: Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesnt amount to much for those with debt, said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. A quarter-point reduction may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment. It certainly doesnt change the fact that the best thing cardholders can do in 2025 is to take matters into their own hands when it comes to high interest rates.  The average annual percentage rate on a new credit card offer, according to LendingTree, is 24.43%. In September, it was 24.92%. Further modest declines in that rate, Schulz said, are possible in the next few months.  But, he cautioned, Anyone expecting card rates to go from awful to amazing overnight because of the Fed is going to be sorely disappointed. Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said that particularly for credit card users who carry debt from month to month, Its a drop in the bucket for anyone feeling pressure from high rates. For savers, returns on high-yield accounts have dropped, too, in tandem with the Feds rate cuts. So while these accounts are not quite as attractive as they had been, they might still be worth investigating if you havent shopped for one recently. Some of these accounts offer yields at or near 5%. Yes, youve missed the peak rates seen a few months ago, Schulz said. But even at these levels, theyre still likely higher than what youll find at a traditional bank. Though the Fed doesnt set mortgage rates, it does influence them. Long-term mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which, in turn, is driven in part by the markets outlook for inflation and the Feds benchmark rate. That means that, at least indirectly, cuts to the Feds key rate can put downward pressure on mortgage rates, even if they dont move in lockstep. Case in point, turmoil in the bond market has caused mortgage rates to yo-yo up and down over the last month, Channel said. After peaking at 6.84% for the week ending Nov. 21, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has since come down to 6.60%. Despite this decline, this average remains well above the 2024 low of 6.08%, back in late September. For people with fixed mortgages, their rate wont change unless they refinance their mortgage or sell and move someplace else.  The effects of the Feds half-point rate cut in September and its quarter-point cut in November have largely been passed through to auto loans, which fell on average from a peak of 7.3% in July to 6.8% last month, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com. The half-point drop, he said, has helped more people afford new vehicles, helping to spur a buying spree in November. But the increased demand, which Drury attributed largely to some optimism over Trumps election, also boosted average prices and monthly payments to record levels. Optimism and having money on hand to do these things has definitely green-lit some peoples spending, when other folks are more conservative with how much theyre spending, he said. The average amount that a car buyer financed rose to $42,160, and average monthly payments hit $753, according to Edmunds data. Edmunds expects only a modest increase in auto sales next year, from just under 16 million vehicles this year to 16.2 million in 2025. The Federal Open Market Committee is in a balancing act  cut (rates) too much and risk inflation resurgence; cut too little and continue to squeeze the labor market, said Renter of NerdWallet. Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, suggested that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reiterating the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut skip at the January meeting.  This will favor a gradual easing of policy to observe how the economy and inflation behave, indicating an extremely data-dependent approach, Daco said. Remember, Channel said, the Fed is designed to pivot relatively quickly should something unexpected happen. If the economy shows serious signs of deterioration, we could see bigger and more frequent cuts over the next 12 months. On the other hand, he cautioned, if inflation rears its head and spikes once more, (rate) cuts might be moved off the table. ___ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher contributed to this report from Detroit. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Wall Street rallies and recovers Mondays losses as the dollar and US bond market steady,"NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks jumped in a widespread rally Tuesday, and other U.S. investments steadied a day after falling sharply on worries about President Donald Trumps trade war and his attacks on the head  of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 climbed 2.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,016 points, or 2.7%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.7%. All three indexes more than made up their big losses from the start of the week. The value of the U.S. dollar  also stabilized after sliding against the euro and other competitors, while longer-term Treasury yields  held steadier as more calm returned to financial markets. Sharp, unusual moves for the dollar and for Treasurys have recently raised worries that Trumps policies are making investors more skeptical about U.S. investments reputation as the worlds safest.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)  The only prediction many Wall Street strategists are willing to make is that financial markets will likely continue to veer up and down as hopes rise and fall that Trump may negotiate deals with other countries to lower his tariffs. If no such deals come quickly enough, many investors expect the economy to fall into a recession. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday slashed its forecast for global economic growth  this year to 2.8%, down from 3.3%. But Vice President JD Vance also said he made progress with Indias  prime minister, Narendra Modi, on trade talks Monday. 
        
     A suite of better-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, meanwhile, helped drive U.S. stocks higher.  Equifax jumped 13.8% after reporting a better profit for the first three months of 2025 than analysts expected. It also said it would send more cash to its shareholders by increasing its dividend and buying up to $3 billion of its stock over the next four years.  3M climbed 8.1% after the maker of Scotch tape and Command strips said it made more in profit from each $1 of revenue during the start of the year than it expected. The company also stood by its forecast for profit for the full year, though it said tariffs may drag down its earnings per share by up to 40 cents per share. Homebuilder PulteGroup rose 8.4% after it likewise delivered a stronger profit for the start of 2025 than analysts expected.

Drops for Treasury yields during the first three months of the year translated into lower mortgage rates for potential customers, though yields have been largely rising since early this month.  CEO Ryan Marshall said buyers remain caught between a strong desire for homeownership and the affordability challenges of high selling prices and monthly payments that are stretched. Tesla rose 4.6% ahead of its earnings report, which arrived after trading ended for the day. That trimmed its loss for the year so far to roughly 41%.  Elon Musks electric car company had already reported its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the year before. Its been hurt by vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musks oversight of cost-cutting efforts for the U.S. government.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Stocks also showed how Trumps tariffs could create winners and losers as he tries to remake the global economy and trade.  First Solar jumped 10.5% after the U.S. Department of Commerce finalized harsher-than-expected solar tariffs on some southeast Asian communities. U.S. defense contractors, meanwhile, had some of the markets sharpest losses after RTX said tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports, along with other products, could mean an $850 million hit to its profit this year. RTX, which builds airplane engines and military equipment, fell 9.8% even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter.  Kimberly-Clark lost 1.6% even though the maker of Huggies and Kleenex likewise reported a better-than-expected profit.  CEO Mike Hsu said that the current environment will now mean greater costs across our global supply chain versus what it expected at the start of the year, and the company lowered its forecast for an underlying measure of profit this year.  Losers on Wall Street were the exceptions, though, as 99% of the stocks within the S&P 500 index rose. All told, the S&P 500 climbed 129.56 points to 5,287.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1,106.57 to 39,186.98, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 429.52 to 16,300.42. In the bond market, longer-term yields eased following an unsettling run higher the day before. The yield on the 10-year Treasury pulled back to 4.39% from 4.42% late Monday. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe following modest, mixed moves across Asia. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-trump-tariffs-investments-7ee60dbf71e262843eac15ae1564f4cb,business
US Treasury secretary says trade war with China is not sustainable,"WASHINGTON (AP)  U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday speech that the ongoing tariffs showdown against China is unsustainable and he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the worlds two largest economies. But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. U.S. President Donald Trump placed import taxes of 145% on China, which has countered with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures. Details of the speech were confirmed by two people familiar with the remarks who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations, Bessent said according to a transcript obtained by The Associated Press. Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying a trade war with China is not sustainable. The S&P 500 stock index rose 2.5% after Bloomberg News initially reported Bessents remarks. Trump acknowledged the increase in the stock market in remarks to reporters afterward on Tuesday, but he avoided confirming if he, too, thought the situation with China was unsustainable as Bessent had said behind closed doors. Were doing fine with China, Trump said. 
        
     Despite his high tariffs, Trump said he would be very nice to China and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Were going to live together very happily and ideally work together, Trump said. The U.S. president said that the final tariff rate with China would come down substantially from the current 145%. It wont be that high, not going to be that high, Trump said. The Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations. But Trump has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10% tariff, even as he has insisted hes looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the U.S. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States that could negatively impact China. China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of Chinas interests, Chinas Commerce Ministry said in a statement. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration has received 18 proposals from other countries for trade deals with the U.S., adding that everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen. The uncertainty over tariffs in the financial markets has also been amplified by Trump calling on the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate, with the president saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell if he wanted to do so. Leavitt said Trump believes the Fed has by holding rates steady as it awaits the impacts of tariffs in the name of politics, rather in the name of whats right for the American economy. Trump later said that he wanted Powell to be early in lowering rates and that he has no intention of firing the Fed chair, despite previously suggesting that he would.",https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trade-taxes-trump-china-bessent-treasury-66668fa26957ece530a250fa8ea19faa,business
Associated Press finds no definitive evidence to change credit for famous Vietnam War photo,"Months after the release of a film that questions who took an iconic Vietnam War image of a naked girl running from a napalm attack, The Associated Press said Tuesday it had found no definitive evidence to warrant changing a nearly 53-year-old photo credit. The AP released a 96-page report  its second examination in less than four months  about who actually took the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo credited to Nick Ut that became one of the defining images of the 20th century. A documentary shown at Sundance in January, The Stringer, asserts that it was actually shot by another man, Nguyen Thanh Nghe, but that credit was given to Ut, an AP staff photographer. The AP concluded that it was possible Ut took the photo, but it was unable to be proven conclusively due to the passage of time, absence of key evidence, limitations of technology and the deaths of several key people involved. At the same time, AP found no proof that Nguyen took the photo, the report said. We left nothing uncovered that were aware of and weve done it with a great deal of respect to everybody involved, said Derl McCrudden, an AP vice president who heads global news production. It makes no difference to us if we changed the credit, but it has to be based on facts and evidence. And there is no definitive evidence proving that Nick Ut did not take this picture. The APs latest study involved further interviews, examination of cameras, building a 3D model of the scene and studying photo negatives that survive from June 8, 1972, the date of the photo.  The report revealed inconsistencies on both sides. The prize-winning photo was apparently taken on a Pentax camera, not a Leica as Ut had long claimed. Nguyen told AP he was not working for NBC that day, as was earlier asserted. Of 10 people on the scene that day that the AP reached, Nguyen is the only one who believes that Ut didnt take the picture, the report said. 
        
     The report said that believing Nguyens story would require several leaps of faith, including believing that the only time he ever sold a photo to a Western news agency it turned out to be one of the most famous images of the century. Ut, who has strongly maintained that the photo is his, said Tuesday he was gratified by the findings of APs investigation. This whole thing has been very difficult for me and has caused great pain, he said in a statement. Im glad the record has been set straight. ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Puerto Rico governor under fire as federal funds for solar projects are stalled,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)  Puerto Ricos governor came under fire Tuesday as her pledge to support the investment of millions of federal dollars in solar projects across the U.S. territory appeared to fade. More than a week has passed since the U.S. Department of Energy missed a deadline to finalize contracts worth $365 million that would see battery-operated solar systems installed at health clinics and public housing units in Puerto Rico. Since last month, the department has not been in communication with those awarded the grants, including the nonprofit Hispanic Federation. Theres been deathly silence, said Javier Ra Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Ricos Solar and Energy Storage Association. The lack of communication by the federal government comes as Puerto Rico prepares for the Atlantic hurricane season, which starts June 1 and is predicted to be above average, with nine anticipated hurricanes, four of them major. Puerto Rico already struggles with chronic power outages, including two island-wide blackouts that occurred on Dec. 31 and April 17. There are people who really need this help immediately, said Frankie Miranda, president and CEO of the Hispanic Federation. Until recently, Gov. Jenniffer Gonzlez, a Republican and supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, had backed more than $1 billion appropriated by Congress for solar projects in Puerto Rico, including the $365 million slated for public housing units and health centers, including those that provide dialysis. 
        
     But the governors public affairs secretary, Hiram Torres Montalvo, told Radio Isla on Monday that the governor tried to defend the funds but ultimately withdrew her support for the grant. He said that Gonzlez has proposed using the funds to improve the generation, transmission and distribution of power, and is focused on ensuring theres enough electricity for the summer months. We are extremely surprised and shocked over this development, Miranda said in a phone interview. We want the governor to reconsider her position and continue to fulfill her word. Miranda and others have noted that some $18 billion in federal funds is already slated for the grid. Neither Torres nor a spokeswoman for the governor returned messages seeking comment. On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy sent The Associated Press a statement saying that the agency was conducting a department-wide review of grant processes, and that it was working with Puerto Ricos governor and the White House to strengthen the islands grid and ensure that the island has reliable, affordable and secure energy. In the wake of recent outages that impacted families, businesses, and critical infrastructure, the Department of Energy remains focused on advancing solutions that provide urgent relief, prevent future disasters, and restore long-term reliable energy access across the island, the agency said. The department did not say whether Puerto Ricos government has formally requested that the funds be reassigned. More than 60% of energy on the island is generated by petroleum-fired power plants, 24% by natural gas, 8% by coal and 7% by renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The push for more renewable energy comes as crews continue to rebuild Puerto Ricos power grid after Hurricane Maria hit the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already weak before the storm hit given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-us-solar-energy-projects-trump-2d7035b0c26692e328f8a0d23a5a4b80,business
"Trump keeps contradicting himself on tariffs, making a fragile world economy nervous","WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump cant stop contradicting himself on his own tariff plans.  He says hes on a path to cut several new trade deals in a few weeks  but has also suggested its physically impossible to hold all the needed meetings.  Trump has said he will simply set new tariff rates negotiated internally within the U.S. government over the next few weeks  although he already did that on his April 2 Liberation Day, which caused the world economy to shudder. The Republican president says hes actively negotiating with the Chinese government on tariffs  while the Chinese and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said talks have yet to start. What should one believe? The sure bet is that uncertainty will persist in ways that employers and consumers alike expect to damage the economy and that leave foreign leaders scratching their heads in bewilderment. And the consequences of all this tariffs turmoil are enormous.  Trump placed tariffs totaling 145% on China, leading China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S.  essentially triggering a trade war between the worlds two largest economies with the potential to bring on a recession. 
        
     The president told Time magazine in an interview released Friday that 20%, 30% or 50% tariffs a year from now would be a total victory, even though a financial market panic led him to temporarily reduce his baseline import taxes to 10% for 90 days while talks take place. The deal is a deal that I choose, Trump said in the interview. What Im doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries. If that is confusing for the nations trading partners, its also sowing anxiety at home.  The Federal Reserves beige book, a compilation of anecdotes from U.S. businesses prepared eight times a year, on Wednesday reported a huge spike in uncertainty among American companies that has caused them to pull back on hiring and investment in new projects. The word uncertainty cropped up 80 times, compared with 45 in early March and just 14 in January. Beyond the idea that Trump plans to keep some level of tariffs in place, the world finance ministers and corporate executives who gathered this past week in Washington for the International Monetary Fund conference said in private discussions that the Trump administration was providing no real clarity on its goals for substantive talks. Theres not a coherent strategy at the moment on what the tariffs are supposed to achieve, said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center at The Atlantic Council. My conversations with the ministers and governors this week at the IMF meetings have been they dont understand completely what the White House wants, nor who they should be negotiating with. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF released Friday, said after a meeting with Bessent that Switzerland would be one of 15 countries with which the United States plans to conduct privileged negotiations. But she said a memorandum of understanding would have to be reached for talks to formally begin. She was happy to at least know whom to talk to, saying that we have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration. Nations are deploying various negotiating tactics. The South Korean officials who met with their U.S. counterparts this week say they specifically asked for the tariffs to be lifted with the goal of working toward an agreement by July. The European Union has pushed for cutting tariffs to zero for both parties, though Trump objects to European countries charging a value-added tax, which is akin to a sales tax that he says hurts U.S. goods. Trump continues to radiate optimism that negotiated deals with other countries will occur despite his claims that he will set his own deals and a lack of clarity about how the process goes forward. Im getting along very well with Japan, Trump told reporters on Friday. Were very close to a deal. As part of a deal with Japan, the Trump administration has publicly called on the Japanese government to change its auto safety standards that put a greater focus on pedestrian safety. But the steering wheels on autos sold in Japan are on the right-hand side, while U.S. automakers put their steering wheels on the left. I dont think left-hand drive cars sell in Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told a parliamentary session this week. We want to make sure we arent seen as being unfair, Ishiba said, suggesting a possibility of reviewing Japanese car safety standards. As Trump continues to make conflicting statements about tariffs, companies are actively looking at higher prices, lower sales and possibly bare shelves in stores due to fewer shipments from China. Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a supply chain company, said on the social media site X: In the 3 weeks since the tariffs took effect, ocean container bookings from China to the United States are down over 60% industry wide. Consumers are getting notices via email and social media from retailers that lamps, furniture and other housewares will now include tariff-related charges. The showerhead company Afina on Wednesday reported on a test to see if people would buy an American-made product that cost more than an import. Their Chinese-made filtered showerhead retails for $129, but to manufacture the same product domestically would take the price up to $239.  When customers on the companys website were given a choice between a showerhead made in the USA or a cheaper one made in Asia, there were 584 purchases of the $129 model made abroad and not one sale of the domestically produced showerhead. Ramon van Meer, Afinas founder, said in an interview that the scale and the speed of the tariffs were part of the challenge for smaller businesses looking to adapt, adding that part of the challenge is that Trump imposed the import taxes without proper planning or announcements. He concluded in his written analysis: If policymakers and pundits want to rebuild American industry, they need to grapple with this truth: idealism doesnt always survive contact with a price tag. ___ AP economics writer Christopher Rugaber in Washington and AP writers Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-time-china-switzerland-660aa519e9059de7d81368ec4eef4b38,business
Trumps tariffs loom over the economy as shipments from China fall,"WASHINGTON (AP)  American businesses are cancelling orders from China, postponing expansion plans and hunkering down to see what trade policy surprises President Donald Trump plans to spring on them next. The presidents massive and unpredictable taxes on imports seem likely to mean emptier shelves and higher prices for American shoppers, perhaps within weeks. And the higher costs and paralyzing uncertainty could exact an economic toll: U.S. consumers are in the biggest funk since COVID-19 hit five years ago, and economists say recession risks are climbing. An early sign of the damage emerged on Wednesday when the Commerce Department released its first look at first-quarter economic growth. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3% from January through March, the first drop in three years. Gross domestic product  the nations output of goods and services  was down from 2.4% in the last three months of 2024. Imports shaved 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. Consumer spending also slowed sharply. Separately, a report from payroll provider ADP showed that companies added just 62,000 jobs in April, about half of what was expected, and down from 147,000 in March. Its a potential signal that businesses may be taking a more cautious approach to hiring amid uncertainty over tariffs.  Asked how much of deterioration in the worlds biggest economy could be traced to Trumps erratic policies, Boston College economist Brian Bethune said: All of it. 
        
     As he promised on the campaign trail, Trump has upended decades of American trade policy. Hes been imposing  then sometimes suspending  big import taxes, or tariffs, on a wide range of targets. Hes currently plastered a 10% levy on products from almost every country in the world. Hes hit China  Americas third-biggest trading partner and second-biggest source of imported goods  with a staggering 145% tariff. China has responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own  125% on American products. The take-no-prisoners trade war between the worlds two biggest economies has shaken global financial markets and threatened to bring U.S.-China trade to a standstill. Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, warned last Thursday within two weeks arrivals to the port will drop by 35% as essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers has ceased. Seroka added that cargo from Southeast Asia also is much softer than normal with tariffs now in place. After Trump announced expansive tariffs in early April, ocean container bookings from China to the United States dropped 60% -- and stayed there, said Ryan Petersen, founder and CEO of Flexport, a San Francisco company that helps companies ship cargo around the world. With orders down, ocean carriers have reduced their capacity by cancelling 25% of their sailings, Flexport said. Many companies tried to beat the clock by bringing in foreign goods before Trumps tariffs took effect. In fact, that is a big reason that first-quarter economic growth is expected to come in so low: A surge in imports swelled the trade deficit, which weighs on growth. By stockpiling goods ahead of the trade war, many companies will be positioned to ride out this storm for a while, said Judah Levine, research director at the global freight-booking platform Freightos. But at a certain point, inventories will run down. In the next few weeks, Levine said, you could start seeing shortages ... its likely to be concentrated in categories where the U.S. is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and there arent a lot of alternatives and certainly quick alternatives. Among them: furniture, baby products and plastic goods, including toys. Jay Foreman, CEO of toymaker Basic Fun, said he paused shipments of Tonka trucks, Care Bears and other toys from China after Trumps tariff plan was announced in early April. Now, hes hoping to get by for a few months on inventory hes stockpiled. Consumers will find Basic Fun toys in stores for a month or two but very quickly we will be out of stock and stock product will disappear from store shelves,  he said.  Kevin Brusky, who owns APE Games, a small tabletop game publisher in St. Louis, has about 7,000 copies of three different games sitting in a warehouse in China. The tariff bill of about $25,000 would wipe out his profit on the games, so he is launching a Kickstarter campaign next week to help defray the cost of the duties.  Still, his sales representative is urging him to import the games if possible, because he expects that retailers will soon be desperate for products to sell. If he does import the games, Brusky is considering raising its price from $40 to at least $45.  Worried that tariffs will push up prices and drive away customer, retailers have put expansion plans on hold for next year, said Naveen Jaggi, president of retail advisory services in the Americas for real-estate firm JLL. What they are telling us is: We want to slow down the decision to open up stores and commit to leases because they want to watch how the consumer reacts. Consumers already seem to be freaking out. The Conference Board, a business group, reported Tuesday that Americans confidence in the economy fell for the fifth straight month to the lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly one-third of consumers expect hiring to slow in the coming months, nearly matching the level reached in April 2009, when the economy was mired in the Great Recession. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. GDP so if nervous consumers stop shopping, the economic fallout could get ugly. Economist Joseph Brusuelas of the consultancy RSM pegs the probability of a recession within the next 12 months at 55%. Even gloomier is Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. He sees a 90% chance of a recession by this summer if Trumps tariffs remain in place. Businesses are already planning on significant disruptions, particularly from the 145% duties on goods from China, he said. You see that in company reactions: Orders are down, (spending) plans are down, costs are up, prices paid are up, he said. He expects large layoffs by trucking firms and retailers as soon as late May, as the slowdown in goods coming into U.S. ports from China works its way through the supply chain. Flexport CEO Petersen said shortages of products are not a tragedy.  Its going to be much more about the layoffs that follow, Petersen said. Thats where the real pain is going to be felt. Shortages mean companies arent selling stuff and therefore dont have the profits that they need to pay their workers. He said the stakes are so high that he expects the U.S. and China to deescalate their trade war and bring down the tariffs. In fact, Trump and his advisers have sounded more conciliatory lately. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, for example, said that the triple-digit tariffs the U.S. and China have slapped on each other are not sustainable. But more abrupt shifts in trade policy risk increasing the uncertainty that has paralyzed businesses and worried consumers. Moreover, said economist Cory Stahle of the Indeed Hiring Lab, conditions may worsen in the coming months if people start behaving like they are in a recession. Softening some of the recent trade policy changes may ease some business concerns, but it may already be too late. ___ DInnocenzio reported from New York",https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariff-economy-recession-china-imports-trade-8d90bb37735e833c43a7b7a9d5a0b9a2,business
Chinas export orders dip in April as Trumps tariffs begin to bite,"Higher tariffs on U.S. imports of products from China are taking a toll on the worlds second-largest economy as export orders sink, according to monthly surveys of Chinese factory managers released Wednesday.  The official survey by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing shows export orders slowed sharply in April, with Beijing and Washington in a standoff after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered combined tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods.  China has imposed duties of up to 125% on U.S. products, with some exemptions. It has also ordered other retaliation, such as tighter restrictions on exports of some strategically important minerals used for high-tech products such as electric vehicles.  American businesses are cancelling orders from China and postponing expansion plans as they watch to see what comes. The official manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to a 16-month low of 49.0 from 50.5 in March. Thats on a scale where 50 marks the break between expansion and contraction. A private survey by the financial information group Caixin fell to 50.4 from 51.2.  The sharp drop in the PMIs likely overstates the impact of tariffs due to negative sentiment effects, but it still suggests that Chinas economy is coming under pressure as external demand cools, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.  Large manufacturers are likely to be hit harder than smaller ones that are more labor intensive, since China still enjoys a cost advantage for such products, economists at ANZ Research said.  
        
     Chinas manufacturing cost for light industries may be one-fifth that of the U.S., which is unlikely to change, they said in a report.  Earlier this week, senior Chinese economic officials convened a news conference where they showcased Beijings support for the economy and its capacity to do more to counter the impact of the tariffs.  The economy expanded at a solid 5% annual pace in 2024 and the ruling Communist Party has set a target for growth at about that level this year.  But that was before Trump escalated his trade war, piling on still higher tariffs with an aim of compelling manufacturers to rebase production to the United States.  Overall, in April, the expansion in supply and demand slowed, with exports stunted and employment shrinking slightly. Manufacturers sought to reduce stocks, logistics were delayed, and prices remained under pressure. Market optimism weakened significantly, Wang Zhe, wrote senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. Business sentiment was at one of the lowest levels on record, Wang said.  Private economists have downgraded their forecasts for the economy this year and next. Capital Economics estimates the economy will expand only 3.5% in 2025.  The economy grew 5.4% from a year earlier in the first quarter of the year, as companies rushed to beat the higher tariffs. Chinese exports surged more than 12% year-on-year in March.  Although some Chinese exports will likely be diverted to other countries, Trumps trade war has raised the risk of recession in the U.S. and its impact is expected to ripple across the global economy.  The International Monetary Fund said in a recent update that the outlook for the U.S. and global economies this year and next has significantly worsened.  It forecast the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its estimate in January of 3.3%.",https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-tariffs-exports-trump-534bbbc0cbdafa70c43fb90ee5f5ae94,business
IRS is sending out automatic stimulus payments. Who is getting them?,"The IRS is distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who didnt receive their COVID stimulus payments. By the end of January, approximately 1 million taxpayers will receive special payments of up to $1,400 from the IRS.  The IRS said its distributing these payments to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who did not receive one or more Economic Impact Payments (EIP), also known as stimulus payments. Looking at our internal data, we realized that one million taxpayers overlooked claiming this complex credit when they were actually eligible, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. One taxpayer who benefitted was Ginny Bultman, 61, from Colorado. Bultman and her husband didnt receive a stimulus payment back in 2021. After reading about the latest IRS payments, she realized she qualified for the Recovery Rebate Credit. A day later, she got her check in the mail. It was a pleasant surprise, said Bultman, who owns a locksmith business in her town. The Bultman family received three late stimulus payments, including one for their underaged son, which amounted to $4,200 at the end of December. Heres what you need to know about the IRS payments.  The special payments announced by the IRS are being sent to those taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return but left the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit blank or they filled it out as $0 when they were actually eligible for the credit. 
        
     Payments will vary but the maximum amount will be $1,400 per individual. In total, the IRS will be distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns.  The IRS has posted information online about eligibility and how the payment was calculated. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who didnt receive the Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus payments, during 2020 and 2021.  The IRS announced this initiative after reviewing its internal data and finding that many eligible taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return didnt claim the credit. To minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, were making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it, said Werfel.  If you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you dont have to take any action. The IRS plans to send letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January. Theyll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayers 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.  You still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to the IRS. There were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents.  In March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In March 2021, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 per income tax filer and $1,400 per child under the American Rescue Plan Act. __ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"After disasters, people are especially vulnerable to scams. Heres how to protect yourself","NEW YORK (AP)  During natural disasters like wildfires and floods, scammers often emerge to prey on victims.  People in heightened emotional states in the wake of a catastrophic event should be extra careful of impersonators asking for identifying details, according to Karina Layugan, an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission based in Los Angeles, where firefighters in the region are battling blazes that have already destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Scammers sometimes pretend to be from the utility company or the Federal Emergency Management Agency and ask to verify information. If someone uses that phrase, ask why the individual needs that information and always contact the company or agency directly, she said. Thats information those organizations should already have. Its something thats unfortunately very common, Layugan said. After disasters, people are also particularly vulnerable to people saying you need to act fast and using urgency to pressure people into taking actions that might not be in their best interest. Layugan stresses that FEMA will never charge fees for applications for aid, and that people should be skeptical of anyone who says theyll help others get FEMA relief soon and who charges up-front fees. The same goes for contractors. After a disaster, people looking to rebuild will get a flood of contractors coming to them and saying they can help and they know the system. Sometimes theyre looking for a quick payout, Layugan said. Be skeptical of anyone who promises immediate clean-up or immediate repairs. Oftentimes those types of individuals seek cash payments up front or do things without written contracts. Be very wary if anyone who wants cash up front or who urges you to act immediately. 
        
     Online review sites and searches for the contractors name with the word scam or complaints can help, as can confirming the license and insurance information of anyone you work with.  Always do your own research and get a second estimate, Layugan said.  In 2023 alone, roughly 1 million people reported identity theft, 2.6 million people reported fraud, and 1.9 million reported other types of scams to the FTC. Here are some ways to protect yourself from identity theft and scams, especially after disasters: It can take time to realize your data has been stolen. According to the FTC, signs include:  A phone, electricity, or gas account opened in your name  Debt collection calls for accounts you didnt open  Bills for things you didnt buy  Medical bills or insurance charges for procedures you didnt have  Inaccurate information on your credit report  Denial of loan applications  Mail that stops coming to, or is missing from, your mailbox  A missing tax refund or government benefits If you notice any of the above, heres what to do: Contact:  The FTC online at IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877-438-4338. The FTC will provide you with an individualized recovery plan. Prompts and questions will ask you how the thief has used your data  whether to open credit card accounts, get a car loan or lease in your name, or to file for government benefits.  The three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Ask them to place fraud alerts and a credit freeze on your accounts to prevent further misuse of your data.  The fraud department at your credit card issuers, bank, and other places where you have accounts, such as a medical insurance account. By acting quickly, you can prevent consequences to your credit score and financial health. False information on your credit report can cause lasting damage if not addressed promptly. After youve done the above, continue to review credit card and bank account statements. Watch for and report any unauthorized or suspicious transactions. The FTC recommends doing the following to keep your personal identity safe:  Collect your mail every day and place a hold on your mail when youll be on vacation or away.  Store personal information, including your Social Security card, in a safe place. Do not carry it in your wallet.  Never share your bank account number or Social Security number, especially over the phone to unknown callers or via email or text. While disasters can lead scammers to take advantage of vulnerable groups by impersonating representatives from relief and government agencies, or with contracting scams, other types of fraud and impersonation can also surround these events. If youre already feeling vulnerable, you may be more likely to fall for other types of fraud, such as:  Tax and medical information theft Medical ID theft and tax ID theft are common forms of identity theft, especially during tax season and Medicare re-enrollment periods.  ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"Wall Streets rally roars into a 3rd day as companies profits keep piling up, for now at least","NEW YORK (AP)  Wall Streets rally kept rolling Thursday as better-than-expected profits for U.S. companies piled up, though CEOs said theyre unsure whether it will last  because of uncertainty created by President Donald Trumps  trade war. The S&P 500 charged 2% higher and pulled within 11% of its record set earlier this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 486 points, or 1.2%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 2.7%. Tech stocks helped lead the way, including ServiceNow after the AI platform company delivered a stronger profit for the start of 2025 than analysts expected. The company, whose AI agents help clients manage their customers, saw its stock jump 15.5% after it also gave a forecasted range for upcoming subscription revenue that beat some analysts expectations.  Southwest Airlines likewise reported stronger results than expected for the first three months of the year. But its stock flipped between gains and losses through the morning after it also became the latest U.S. carrier  to say the outlook for the economy looks so cloudy that its pulling some of its financial forecasts for the year.  CEO Bob Jordan said the company is controlling what we can control, and its cutting how much flying it will do in the second half of the year. Southwests stock eventually pulled higher in afternoon trading and finished up 3.7%.  Rival American Airlines, meanwhile, pulled its financial forecasts for the full year and said it plans to provide an update when the economic outlook becomes clearer. Its stock rose 3.1% after it also topped profit expectations for the latest quarter.  
        
     Companies across industries have been talking about how difficult it is to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year, as Wall Street typically expects them to do, because of the on-again-off-again rollout of Trumps tariffs.  U.S. stocks rallied the prior two days on hopes that Trump was softening his approach on tariffs  and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which had earlier shaken markets. But China, the worlds second-largest economy, on Thursday denied its involved in active negotiations  with the United States over tariffs, saying that any suggestion of progress was as groundless as trying to catch the wind. Calling Trumps policy announcements headline turbulence, Tan Jing Yi of the Asia & Oceania Treasury Department at Mizuho Bank warned that global economies could be hurt in the long run, adding: Sentiments swing from hopes of intense relief to inflicted economic gloom. This week began with a steep loss for U.S. stocks  on fears about the trade war, and its been a microcosm of the markets severe swings in recent weeks as investors struggle with how to react to conditions that sometimes change by the hour. The only certainty is that the market will likely keep swinging until more clarity arrives on tariffs, which many investors expect would cause a recession unless theyre rolled back. Its an unhealthy market backdrop right now, and were trying not to react too much, said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.  Households across the United States are preparing for the higher prices  that economists say tariffs would bring, while the head of the International Monetary fund  urged countries to move swiftly to resolve their trade disputes that threaten global economic growth.  In the meantime, many U.S. companies are continuing to report stronger profit than analysts expected for the start of 2025, while offering caution and uncertainty about the year ahead. Toy company Hasbro was a winner and jumped 14.6% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It cited strong growth for its Magic: The Gathering game, among other products. Texas Instruments rallied 6.6% after the semiconductor company likewise reported a stronger profit than expected.  They helped offset a 3.7% drop for Procter & Gamble, which fell even though the company behind Olay, Tide and Pampers reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected. Its revenue came in below expectations, and it also cut its forecast for profit growth this fiscal year.  Procter & Gamble said its expecting a $200 million hit to its earnings this fiscal year because of higher costs for commodities.  At PepsiCo, CEO Ramon Laguarta said his company expects more volatility and uncertainty and that consumer conditions in many markets remain subdued and similarly have an uncertain outlook. His companys stock fell 4.9% after the beverage and snack maker cuts its forecast for an underlying measure of profit over 2025, citing increased costs from tariffs and subdued conditions for customers. A 25% tariff on  imported aluminum for cans is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. All told, the S&P 500 rose 108.91 points to 5,484.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 486.83 to 40,093.40, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 457.99 to 17,166.04. In the bond market, Treasury yields continued to ease following their disconcerting run higher earlier this month. Yields usually fall when fear is dominating markets, but their surprising earlier rise stirred fears that Trumps trade war was degrading the U.S. bond markets status as one of the worlds safest places to keep cash.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.30% from 4.40% late Wednesday, in part on expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later this year to soften the economic blow that may come from tariffs. Yields sank after a report showed slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week than economists expected. A separate report said sales of previously occupied homes weakened by more than expected  in March.  In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid modest moves across much of Europe and Asia.  ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-tariffs-trump-fed-dollar-f6b5873edeb86d883bc90b7a8cc9794d,business
"Big Tech carries Wall Street to the close of its winning, roller-coaster week","NEW YORK (AP)  Big Tech stocks carried Wall Street Friday to the close of a winning, roller-coaster  week, one that saw markets swing from fear to relief and back to caution because of President Donald Trumps trade war. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to add some more to a big three-day rally, and its back within 10.1% of its record set earlier this year. Spurts for Nvidia and other influential tech stocks sent the Nasdaq composite up a market-leading 1.3%.  But they masked a mixed day of trading on Wall Street, where more stocks fell within the S&P 500 than rose, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added only a modest 20 points, or 0.1%. Alphabet climbed 1.7% in its first trading after Googles parent company reported late Thursday that its profit soared 50% in the beginning of 2025 from a year earlier, more than analysts expected.  Alphabet is one of the biggest companies on Wall Street in terms of size, and that gives its stocks movements extra influence on the S&P 500 and other indexes. Another market heavyweight, Nvidia, was also a major force pushing the S&P 500 index upward after the chip company rose 4.3%. They helped offset a 6.7% drop for Intel, which fell even though its results for the beginning of the year also topped expectations. The chip company said its seeing elevated uncertainty across the industry and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts expectations.  It wasnt just Intel. Roughly three out of every five stocks in the S&P 500 sank, including Eastman Chemical, which dropped 6.2% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts expectations.  
        
     CEO Mark Costa said that the macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased and that future demand for its products is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs. Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 5.3%.  Companies across industries have increasingly been saying the uncertainty  created by Trumps tariffs is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year.  Stocks bounced back from a steep slide on Monday  on hopes that Trump may be softening his approach on trade and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which had earlier shaken markets. The hope is that if Trump rolls back some of his stiff tariffs, he could avert a recession that many investors see as otherwise likely because of his trade war.  But Trumps on-again-off-again tariffs may nevertheless be pushing households and businesses to alter their spending and freeze plans for long-term investment because of how quickly conditions can change, sometimes seemingly by the hour. Business owners scrambling to figure out their supply chains and exposure to tariffs is more than just a distraction, according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. It could be an existential threat, especially for smaller businesses that dont have the scale or resources to have the same supply chain flexibility as larger firms.  All told, the S&P 500 rose 40.44 points to 5,525.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 20.10 to 40,113.50, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 216.90 to 17,382.94. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly across much of Europe following more mixed movements in Asia. Tokyos Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9%, but stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.1%.  In the bond market, Treasury yields eased some more, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.25% from 4.32% late Thursday.  Its been generally falling since approaching 4.50% earlier this month in a surprising rise  that suggested investors worldwide may have been losing faith in the U.S. bond markets reputation as a safe place to park cash. Yields have dropped as several reports on the U.S. economy have come in weaker than expected, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates later this year to support growth.  A report on Friday morning said sentiment among U.S. consumers sank in April, though not by as much as economists expected. The survey from the University of Michigan said its measure of expectations for coming conditions has dropped 32% since January for the steepest three-month percentage decline seen since the 1990 recession.  The value of the U.S. dollar meanwhile held steady against the euro and other rival currencies. Its been recovering some of its sharp, unexpected losses from earlier this month that had rattled investors.  ___ AP Writers Jiang Junzhe and Matt Ott contributed.",https://apnews.com/article/market-rates-trump-tariffs-cd30ed61467eee2dc778006fa49924ee,business
Market turmoil has many afraid to check retirement savings,"NEW YORK (AP)  Michael Montgomery used to check the balance on his retirement account once a week and smile. But lately, not wanting to get upset and question if he could retire in a few years, there was only one solution. Im not looking, says the 66-year-old professor from Huntington Woods, Michigan. As the White House simultaneously injects turmoil into financial markets with its trade war and dismisses fears of a downturn, retired and near-retired Americans are anxiously looking on, worried about outliving their savings or having to put off entries on their bucket lists. Keeping logged off his account has made Montgomerys days less worrisome. He and his wife adjusted their portfolio after Election Day, including moving more money into bonds. But hes not sure what more he can do if the entire world economy can be affected by Washingtons decisions. I hope like hell I dont lose all my retirement savings, he says. But where else could you put the money that these people could not disorder? They cant get into your mattress but thats about it. Many experts warned U.S. stocks were overpriced and due for a correction even before President Donald Trump reclaimed the Oval Office. But a historic blanket of tariffs have injected new uncertainty into the market. Though stocks rallied this week, the S&P 500 is down 10% from an all-time high reached in February. Losses in the Nasdaq and among small-cap stocks are steeper. Even bonds and the U.S. dollar have been volatile. Many economists are warning of a possible recession. 
        
     It has 71-year-old Jeanne Oats Estridge feeling so paranoid she called her financial planner with an idea. How about we put it all in cash? Oats Estridge asked. I just dont advise it, she heard back. Oats Estridge, who lives in Dayton, Ohio, retired from a job in software engineering and now writes books, including her latest, on four octogenarian women kidnapped by sex-trafficking aliens. Her account is down more than $40,000 and she gets angry thinking about how some in Washington have reacted to the market volatility, including Trumps recent market assessment that it was a great time to buy. Where am I supposed to come up with the money to buy? My underwear drawer? Oats Estridge asks.  Earlier this month, the Cboe Volatility Index, considered a fear gauge of investor pessimism, reached its highest level in five years. The index, known as VIX, has since retreated but is still in territory reflecting fearful investors. Another measure of market sentiment, the Cboe S&P 500 Left Tail Volatility Index, which tracks investor worry about so-called black swan events such as the 2008 housing crash that spurred the Great Recession, likewise has backed off from highs but remains elevated. Trump has urged people to be cool in assessing the impact of tariffs on their investments. Asked about his own savings earlier this month, he chuckled and replied: I havent checked my 401(k).  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meantime, brushed off the possibility that some might need to delay retiring, saying people dont look at the day-to-day fluctuations of whats happening. That seeming nonchalance isnt sitting well with some older investors. Peter Rost, 72, retired from his software development job last year and planned to start tapping his retirement savings to supplement Social Security. But he doesnt want to bake in his losses. Im looking to take $2,000 and meanwhile the account drops by $30,000, he says. Hes been through serious downturns before, but those were different. I had the time to be patient and let it work its way back, says Rost, who lives in New Hartford, Connecticut, but now Im retired and I need money from that account. At his age, he says, theres one goal: Make sure I dont run out of money before I die. Americans retirement savings totaled about $44 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Investment Company Institute. The composition of those savings has shifted increasingly toward stocks in the last couple decades as the 401(k) has become employers typical offering.  Among fund giant Vanguards nearly 5 million accounts, for example, the average investor puts three-quarters of their savings in stocks. Even older investors are still heavily steeped in equities: People 55 to 64 have 64% in stocks at Vanguard; those 65 and older have 49% in stocks. With that exposure, financial advisers are getting an influx of calls amid the recent market uncertainty. Tj Binkowski, who runs Narrow Road Financial Planning in Clarksville, Tennessee, says some clients find themselves obsessively checking their accounts and feel the emotional strain of worrying about their money. A downturn, he says, hits an older investor much differently. When youre retired, paper losses arent just on paper anymore, says Binkowski. Youre locking them in every month that you take money out. Paul Duesterhaus, a 68-year-old retiree from Quincy, Illinois, is passing up an IRA withdrawal this year to avoid selling at a low. Instead, the retired manager at an air compressor manufacturing company will put off buying a new car as planned and cut back on things like eating out.  Still, he cant help but feel bigger impacts of a trade war are ahead. I think theres going to be longer lasting effects that are going to affect every American, he says. That angst is more common among older adults than younger people. An April poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found just under half of U.S. adults ages 45 and older said their retirement savings are a major source of stress for them right now, compared to about one-third of younger people. Older Americans were also more likely to say theyre stressed about the stock market. For now, many older investors are taking the advice of many experts, to fine-tune investments if necessary but avoid dramatic moves. But it can be hard advice to swallow. The more things go up and down, the more nervous you get, says Steve Turner, a 74-year-old from Chesterfield, Missouri, who runs a small public relations business. He now finds himself anxious when he goes to log on to his retirement account, wondering, Gee, do I want to press the button? You worry that things may work themselves out in the long run, but you dont have as long, says Turner. Youre not 30, youre not 40, youre not 50, youre not even 60. ___ Matt Sedensky can be reached at [emailprotected] and https://x.com/sedensky. ___ Associated Press writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/retirement-stock-market-tariffs-trump-recession-f658b939b66c9dae8ebe093d0dd10ab4,business
New report shows NYC helicopter breaking apart in midair before crash that killed 6,"NEW YORK (AP)  Federal officials on Wednesday released images of a doomed New York City sightseeing helicopter as it broke apart in midair last month, killing six people. The series of still photographs taken from surveillance camera video shows the fuselage, containing the engine and rotors, separating from the helicopters tail. The rotor blades and the transmission then detach from the cabin thats carrying the passengers and the pilot.  The images were included in the preliminary report about the flight released by the National Transportation Safety Board.  Several witnesses described hearing several loud bangs emanating from the helicopter before it broke up and descended into the river, the report says.  Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine helicopter pilot, said the sequence of images shows the helicopter yawing severely and the tail boom failing, suggesting it was most likely struck by the aircrafts main rotor blades during flight. Its clear that some mechanical issue precipitated the breakup, he said.  The initial report, which runs about six pages, does not address the initial cause of the breakup. That, Green said, will likely be determined by a forensic examination of the wreckage itself, including the rotor blades, the engine and transmission. A tail strike could be caused by a pilot not handling a loss of power emergency and allowing the rotor rpm to decay, which makes the rotors flap up and down more and that can cause a strike, he said. 
        
     The aircraft, a Bell 206L-4 built in 2004, also appeared to be fairly old and well used, according to Green.  At the time of the crash, the helicopter had operated about 50 hours since its last inspection on Feb. 27, according to the NTSB report. The helicopters airframe accrued nearly 13,000 total hours of operation, and the engine accrued more than 23,000 hours. Federal Aviation Administration records also show the aircraft had a maintenance issue last September involving its transmission assembly. The NTSB will be looking at the overhaul and maintenance records to make sure everything is up to date, Green said.  The NTSB said previously that the aircraft, operated by tour company New York Helicopter, was not equipped with any video or data recording devices. But on Wednesday, it said photos taken beforehand show that the pilot, Seankese Johnson, was wearing computer-augmented sunglasses, which would have had video and audio recording capability. The glasses have not been recovered. Johnson, a 36-year-old former Navy SEAL, received his commercial pilots license in 2023 and had logged 790 hours of flight time, the NTSB report said. But he didnt appear to be particularly experienced flying a Bell 206L-4, observed Al Yurman, a retired NTSB investigator. The agency said in its report Johnson had fewer than 50 hours of flight in that type of aircraft.  Its quite sophisticated for that type of work, Yurman said. I would prefer to have someone more experienced, but well know more when the full report comes out. The report said Johnson worked a 10 days on/10 days off schedule and the April 10 flight was his first day back after 10 days off. The flight was also the eighth that day for the pilot and the helicopter. The aircraft was on a typical tour, departing from the downtown heliport by Wall Street around 3 p.m. and flying north along the Manhattan skyline before heading south toward the Statue of Liberty. Less than 18 minutes into the flight, witnesses saw the tail and main rotor break away and smoke pouring from the spinning helicopter. In recent years New York Helicopter, the tour company, went through bankruptcy and faced ongoing lawsuits over alleged debts.  The company has said it is cooperating with authorities in the investigation. No one answered the phone at its office or responded to an email seeking comment on Wednesday. The crash was among a recent string of aircraft disasters and close calls that left some people worried about the safety of flying in the U.S. It also revived concerns about the popular and costly aerial tours over New York City. Five commercial sightseeing helicopters have gone down in the rivers around Manhattan since 2005 as a result of mechanical failure, pilot error or collision, killing 20 people. The April 10 crash killed a prominent family from Barcelona, Spain: Agustn Escobar, 49; Merc Camprub Montal, 39; and their children Victor, 4, Mercedes, 8, and Agustin, 10.  Officials have said Escobar, global CEO of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, was in the New York area on business.  Montal, who worked for Siemens Energy and was the granddaughter of a former president of the famous Barcelona FC soccer club, flew in with their children to meet him.",https://apnews.com/article/new-york-fatal-helicopter-crash-ntsb-investigation-c0350c1bbb78edaa238aded56eda3342,business
Google partners with Elementl Power on nuclear energy sites as power demand for AI grows,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Google is partnering with Elementl Power on three project sites for advanced nuclear energy as the energy required to power burgeoning artificial intelligence projects rises sharply.  Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Google will provide capital for the projects, which the companies say will each produce 600 megawatts of power capacity. No dollar figure for Googles investment was given. Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation, said Amanda Peterson Corio, Googles head of data center energy. Google and Elementl said they will collaborative with utility and regulated power companies to identify and advance new projects. We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid, said Elementl Power Chairman and CEO Chris Colbert. U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industrys power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles. Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute. Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal governments regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms. 
        
     In October, Amazon announced that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, just two days after a similar announcement by Google.  A month before that, Constellation Energy, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said it it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers.  Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nations worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. Amazon, Google and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions.
