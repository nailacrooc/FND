a common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis bv may actually be a sexually transmitted infection sti according to researchers the nhs currently says bv is caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an sti even though it can be triggered by sex however a study claims bv  which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility premature births and newborn deaths  is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an sti the australian trial published in the new england journal of medicine found treating sexual partners not just the patient can be vital to clear the infection bv is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell the colour and consistency may change too such as becoming greyishwhite as well as thin and watery half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching it can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams in the trial of  couples with bv the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating bv as an sti with both sexual partners  rather than just the woman  given antibiotics the doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that bv recurrence was halved using this approach one of the lead researchers prof catriona bradshaw said our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the bv recurrence women experience and provides evidence that bv is in fact an sti part of the difficulty in establishing whether bv is sexually transmitted has been that we still dont know precisely which bacteria are the cause but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery she added in the study run by monash university and alfred health researchers at the melbourne sexual health centre half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week while the control group of men were given no treatment given the findings the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners the british association for sexual health and hiv said the findings provided valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected  that bvassociated bacteria may be sexually transmitted particularly in those who experience recurrent infections this research enhances our understanding of bv and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases said a spokesperson if you have symptoms of an sti or concerns about bv visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic,0.6986019679119735,0.9021410246390221,0.45726544783572476,health
harvard university is such a perfect foil for trumpism that its a wonder it avoided the maga maelstrom for so long but the nations oldest university is now going headtohead with a white house that sees few limits on its power which it wants to use to shatter elite societal pillars harvard president alan garber decided not to bend to administration demands to change its policies declaring that the university would not surrender its independence or its constitutional rights a university more used to producing presidents than defying them thus set off one of the most important clashes yet between president donald trump and an establishment institution those without an ivy league pedigree often mock the snobbery of the countrys most prestigious seats of learning whose degrees open elite circles offlimits to most americans and when trump portrays the esteemed academics of cambridge massachusetts as farleft activists pushing woke policies on race and gender hes not working in a vacuum millions of americans agree with him polls show rising distrust of higher education institutions especially among republicans but trumps assault on the countrys top colleges goes beyond an issue that will excite his political base administration heat on top universities is part of a broader effort to challenge centers of what it regards as liberal power which also include the courts the federal bureaucracy and the media after remaking the republican party and the supreme court trump hopes to extend his populist ideology to higher education as a way to challenge belief systems that conflict with his maga creed and to shift the country hard to the right trump is not only taking on top academics and what surveys show are their leftleaning faculties his immigration crackdown has stirred a culture of fear on campuses some students have been taken off the streets by border agents while hundreds more have had their visas canceled on the grounds that their views are damaging to american foreign policy interests that sense of repression threatens to stifle the atmosphere of open debate that animates a healthy university and trumps threats to halt funding for top schools endangers the countrys worldleading scientific and medical research into killer diseases such as cancer and alzheimers,0.4488480248242106,0.7342314010333365,0.9004975515882995,politics
the trump administration and el salvadors president nayib bukele made clear during an oval office meeting on monday that the maryland man who was wrongly deported to el salvador wont be returned to the united states despite a supreme court ruling that the us must facilitate kilmar armando abrego garcias return white house officials have argued its up to el salvador whether to do so asked directly by cnns kaitlan collins if he plans to return him bukele argued the notion of doing so would be preposterous i hope youre not suggesting that i smuggle a terrorist into the united states bukele said how can i smuggle a terrorist into the united states of course im not going to do it the question is preposterous senior white house officials have objected to the judges ruling in recent days and argued that a court cannot intervene in the foreign policy decisionmaking of the united states as cnn reported the high courts unsigned and brief decision left us district judge paula xinis order in place but drew a distinction between facilitating abrego garcias return and effectuating it the lower court properly required the government to facilitate his return the justices made clear president donald trump himself has shifted his stance in recent days after initially saying he would abide by the supreme courts decision if the supreme court said bring somebody back i would do that i respect the supreme court trump told reporters last week but pressed by collins on those previous comments the president on monday did not answer the question during the oval office meeting trump turned to members of his administration  including attorney general pam bondi deputy chief of staff stephen miller and secretary of state marco rubio  to underscore the administrations argument that the us doesnt have the power to return abrego garcia thats up to el salvador if they want to return him thats not up to us the supreme court ruled that if el salvador wants to return him  we would facilitate it meaning provide a plane bondi said abrego garcia entered the country illegally sometime around  but an immigration judge in   after reviewing evidence  withheld his removal that meant that abrego garcia could not be deported to el salvador a gang in his native country the immigration judge found had been targeting him and threatening him with death because of his familys pupusa business bukeles willingness to accept hundreds of migrants who the trump administration claims are gang members or violent criminals has been critical to the presidents ambition of deporting as many as a million undocumented people before the first year of his second term is over,0.6974259706715114,0.4542390339904551,0.9028523054697936,politics
the supreme court on monday temporarily paused a courtimposed midnight deadline to return to the us a maryland man who was mistakenly deported to el salvador agreeing to a request from president donald trump that will give the justices more time to consider the case chief justice john roberts granted the administrative stay a move that will extend the deadline until the court hands down a more fulsome decision in the case of kilmar armando abrego garcia who was deported on march  the decision to temporarily pause the case which is relatively common when the court is facing a quick deadline means that abrego garcia a salvadoran national will remain at a notorious prison in el salvador for now a lower court judge had given the administration until midnight to return him to the us roberts did not set a new deadline though the court is likely to move relatively quickly the chief justice ordered abrego garcias attorneys to respond by tuesday though they had already done so minutes before roberts order was made public this is just a temporary administrative stay we have every confidence that the supreme court will resolve this matter as quickly as possible simon sandovalmoshenberg abrego garcias attorney said after the supreme courts decision trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three because of an administrative error but said it could not bring him back because he is in salvadoran custody abrego garcias case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over white house efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review the justice department told the supreme court that ordering officials to return the man is unprecedented as it sounded nowfamiliar themes arguing federal courts are overstepping their power even amidst a deluge of unlawful injunctions this order is remarkable recently confirmed solicitor general d john sauer told the supreme court in the filing monday the constitution charges the president not federal district courts with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists including by effectuating their removal while the united states concedes that removal to el salvador was an administrative error  that does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations treat the executive branch as a subordinate diplomat and demand that the united states let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into america tonight sauer added abrego garcia rejected that position in his own written arguments monday there is no dispute that abrego garcia is only in el salvador because the united states sent him there his attorneys told the supreme court there is likewise no dispute that he is being held only because the united states has requested that he be held and there is no evidence in the record of this case supporting the governments contention that it cannot bring him back the trump administrations contention that he has suddenly morphed into a dangerous threat to the republic is not credible abrego garcias attorneys wrote the executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny abrego garcia was in the country illegally but an immigration judge in   after reviewing evidence  withheld his removal that meant that abrego garcia could not be deported to el salvador a gang in his native country the immigration judge found had been targeting him and threatening him with death because of his familys pupusa business the trump administration has claimed that abrego garcia is a ranking member of the ms gang because the trump administration designated ms as a foreign terrorist organization sauer wrote the withholding from the immigration court was no longer enforceable the administration alleges that abrego garcia was arrested in the company of other ranking gang members and that he was confirmed to be a member of the gang by a reliable source but in the six years between his immigration hearing and his deportation abrego garcia checked in with immigration officials annually and was never charged with a crime court records show yet abrego garcia was placed on one of three planes bound for a notorious prison in el salvador last month several of the people loaded onto those planes were deported under trumps invocation of the  alien enemies act  an invocation that has drawn its own legal challenge now pending at the supreme court but abrego garcia the administration has said was deported under different authorities,0.6963079302176194,0.45519500339258906,0.9028760796810806,politics
the request to the supreme court came minutes before a ruling from the th us circuit court of appeals denying the justice departments request to lift the lowercourt order the panel rejecting the appeal was judge stephanie thacker an appointee of former president barack obama judge harvie wilkinson iii an appointee of former president ronald reagan and judge robert king an appointee of former president bill clinton abrego garcias wife jennifer stefania vasquez sura said before the high courts decision that the appeals ruling gave her hope and encouragement this decision gives me hope and even more encouragement to keep fighting my children family and i will continue praying and seeking justice now that the court has spoken i ask again that both president trump and president bukele stop attempting any further delays she said referring to nayib bukele the president of el salvador they need to follow the courts order now my children are waiting to be reunited with their father tonight thacker wrote in a scathing concurrence explaining her reasoning that the united states government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the united states off the street and remove him from the country without due process the governments contention otherwise and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene are unconscionable she wrote adding later that the irreparable harm in this case is the harm being done to abrego garcia every minute he is in el salvador and the public interest undoubtedly favors requiring the government to facilitate and effectuate his return to the united states she added in a solo concurrence explaining his reasoning wilkinson said he thinks it is legitimate for the district court to require that the government facilitate the plaintiffs return to the united states so that he may assert the rights that all apparently agree are due him under law there is no question that the government screwed up here he continued thus the government here took the only action which was expressly prohibited but wilkinson said he read xinis order as one requiring that the government facilitate abrego garcias release rather than demand it he said that reading it as a requirement for the administration would be an intrusion on core executive powers that goes too far,0.7046844853058514,0.45486264986819575,0.901638921612111,politics
new research has found that brown rice has a higher concentration of arsenic than white rice in the usaffirming decades of similar findings around the toxic metals presence in the otherwise healthy grain for years experts have sounded alarm bells over arsenic levels in brown rice a  study found it was highest in rice grown in certain southern us states while a  consumer reports analysis of the us food and drug administration fda data found worrisome levels of arsenic in both white and brown ricewith a greater concentration in brown because the toxin tends to reside in its two outer layers the bran and the germ that are removed from white rice but while the new study from michigan state university msu and published in the journal risk analysis earlier this year further affirmed brown rices higher arsenic concentration experts point out that arsenic exposure can come from either type of rice arsenic is a known carcinogenic element that naturally occurs in soil and groundwater but it can also be the result of industrial activities including coal mining farming due to some pesticides and construction due to some paint and wood preservatives according to ohio state university because rice is grown in paddies flooded with water any arsenic present in soil can be readily absorbed into the riceat levels  times higher than other grains which are grown differently and this is the case regardless of whether or not rice is organic according to environmental working group senior scientist tasha stoiber arsenic contamination in rice worldwide was discovered over two decades ago stoiber tells fortune in an email and its not just the rice itself arsenic levels are consistently elevated in rice and foods made with rice flour bran and ricebased sweeteners she says the us and other countries have been slow to take action to reduce arsenic concentrationsalso found in drinking water and in foods and beverages including seafood mushrooms poultry infant formula protein powders and apple juicestoiber explains the fda set a nonbinding action level of  parts per billion for arsenic in apple juice the same as drinking water she says but the fda has not set legally enforceable maximum levels of arsenic for many ricebased foods that have higher concentrations of arsenic rice does not inherently need to be flooded to grow though farmers do so to control weeds and because constant irrigation is required for the semiaquatic plant and growing it in dry instead of saturated soil could decrease the amount of arsenic that seeps into the grains stoiber and others say could be a way to reduce arsenic levels new varieties of rice could be bred to take up less arsenic from the soil and water as well she adds the msu researchers emphasized that for the average person eating brown rice would likely not bring dangerously toxic levels of arsenic while we found that choosing brown rice over white rice would result in higher arsenic exposure on average the levels should not cause longterm health problems unless someone ate an enormous amount of brown rice every day for years said senior investigator of the study felicia wu professor at msus college of agriculture and natural resources however researchers did find that there was significant risk for children under  in the us who eat brown rice as they consume more food relative to their body weight than adults longterm exposure to arsenic can cause pigmentation changes and lesions on the skin which can be precursors to skin cancer according to the world health organization who bladder and lung cancers may also result from longterm arsenic exposure the international agency for research on cancer iarc has classified arsenic arsenic compounds and arsenic in drinking water as carcinogenic to humans the who points out other potential adverse health effects that may be associated with longterm ingestion of arsenic including developmental effects diabetes pulmonary disease cardiovascular disease and arsenicinduced heart attacks arsenic is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality exposure in early childhood has been linked to higher mortality in young adults from multiple cancers lung disease heart attacks and kidney failure while several studies have found negative impacts of arsenic exposure on cognitive development iq and memory,0.4569089514144916,0.9005699505768525,0.7088904518596486,health

katrina campins gave an excellent explanation of trump s position on immigration and the press  as an american i feel frustrated because people are losing sight of what donald trump is trying to say what he s saying is people should come to this country legally and i know about that process very well because my husband is going through it right now and it s extremely expensive so there s more incentive for people to come over to this country illegally so all he s saying is let s make the process to come here easier and less expensive so there s more incentive to do that when people cross the border who are not supposed to be here let s make sure they are sent back but what the media is doing is twisting and turning everything that he s saying and what s so frustrating as an american is that the point is not getting across we re so worried about his fights with megyn kelly and jorge ramos now let s talk about the real issues i don t think it s his fault i think it s the fact that everything he says gets misconstrued like this immigration thing  i m a hispanic woman and i m not offended for what he s saying i understood exactly what he is saying no and i don t agree that i m in the minority because the last time i was on cnn speaking about this as a hispanic woman so many hispanic women tweeted me and said  thank you for speaking for the real hispanic woman,0.7404238639230292,0.46210447769501406,0.8941164025549644,politics
another hollywood whatshisname is out there spouting off on something that he barely knows about because he thinks he knows better than you after all he is an actor you remember john leguizamo right he was that guy in that movie with name of a famous actor thats kind of how i remember him anyway actually hes not that bad an actor  i liked him as tybalt in that modern s version of romeo and juliet with leonardo dicaprio and claire danes of course that was  years ago to his credit hes still acting he was in john wick  apparently i admit it i didnt watch any of the john wick movies according to leguizamos imdb profile a lot of his more recent credits are voice work for cartoons  parents and grandparents might remember him as sid the sloth from ice age leguizamo is now weighing in on the sudden outrage over crt in schools he says that its not being taught to your kids and if you think it is then youre ignorant leguizamo later implies that if you do oppose it in college then youre racist he also provides a definition of critical race theory for those of us ignoramuses that dont know what crt is  its academic thinky talk thanks john thats so helpful why are parents so opposed to critical race theory well its because crt is racist leguizamo can try to lipstick on a pig this one all he wants to but it is viewing our history and our society through a racial lens that categorizes people as victims and oppressors based on their skin color it is antithetical to american values and the view that the vast majority of the founders held alright lets go over this one more time for the slow people like leguizamo that dont seem to get it  critical race theory itself is not being taught to k children there is no critical race theory class where kids take out their crt textbooks and learn the branch of critical theory that began in the law department of harvard university and concluded that disparities among races are the result of racism that undergirds all human interactions and is therefore the foundation of all systems created by people what is happening in classrooms now is the lens of crt  that all human interactions are based on race  is being used to teach history civics and social studies in some places this includes dividing students by race and young children are being introduced to the idea that whiteness is evil some public school boards  and a handful of woke elite private schools  are recommending a book that suggests that whiteness is a contract with the devil,0.8887333951132903,0.730542186205635,0.48093309117138533,entertainment
