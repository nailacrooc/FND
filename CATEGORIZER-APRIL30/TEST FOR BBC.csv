"A ""miracle"" baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb. The baby's mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sister's womb in 2023 – in what was then the UK's only successful womb transplant. Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb. Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was ""incredible"" and ""surreal"", new mum Grace says. ""It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,"" she says. ""It was really wonderful."" Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb. The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their ""little miracle"". The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial."
"A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers. The NHS currently says BV is caused by ""a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI"", even though it can be triggered by sex. However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI. The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection. BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell. The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery. Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though. Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching. It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams. In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics. The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach. One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: ""Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI."" ""Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,"" she added. In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment. Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided ""valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected – that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections."" ""This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,"" said a spokesperson. If you have symptoms of an STI or concerns about BV, visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic."
"Harvard University is such a perfect foil for Trumpism that it’s a wonder it avoided the MAGA maelstrom for so long. But the nation’s oldest university is now going head-to-head with a White House that sees few limits on its power, which it wants to use to shatter elite societal pillars. Harvard President Alan Garber decided not to bend to administration demands to change its policies, declaring that the university would not “surrender its independence or its constitutional rights.” A university more used to producing presidents than defying them thus set off one of the most important clashes yet between President Donald Trump and an establishment institution. Those without an Ivy League pedigree often mock the snobbery of the country’s most prestigious seats of learning, whose degrees open elite circles off-limits to most Americans. And when Trump portrays the esteemed academics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as far-left activists pushing “woke” policies on race and gender, he’s not working in a vacuum. Millions of Americans agree with him. Polls show rising distrust of higher education institutions, especially among Republicans. But Trump’s assault on the country’s top colleges goes beyond an issue that will excite his political base. Administration heat on top universities is part of a broader effort to challenge centers of what it regards as liberal power, which also include the courts, the federal bureaucracy and the media. After remaking the Republican Party and the Supreme Court, Trump hopes to extend his populist ideology to higher education as a way to challenge belief systems that conflict with his MAGA creed and to shift the country hard to the right. Trump is not only taking on top academics and what surveys show are their left-leaning faculties. His immigration crackdown has stirred a culture of fear on campuses: Some students have been taken off the streets by border agents, while hundreds more have had their visas canceled on the grounds that their views are damaging to American foreign policy interests. That sense of repression threatens to stifle the atmosphere of open debate that animates a healthy university. And Trump’s threats to halt funding for top schools endangers the country’s world-leading scientific and medical research into killer diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s."
"The Trump administration and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele made clear during an Oval Office meeting on Monday that the Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador won’t be returned to the United States. Despite a Supreme Court ruling that the US must “facilitate” Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s return, White House officials have argued it’s up to El Salvador whether to do so. Asked directly by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins if he plans to return him, Bukele argued the notion of doing so would be “preposterous.” “I hope you’re not suggesting that I smuggle a terrorist into the United States,” Bukele said. “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? Of course I’m not going to do it. The question is preposterous.” Senior White House officials have objected to the judge’s ruling in recent days and argued that a court cannot intervene in the foreign policy decision-making of the United States. As CNN reported, the high court’s unsigned and brief decision left US District Judge Paula Xinis’ order in place but drew a distinction between “facilitating” Abrego Garcia’s return and “effectuating” it. The lower court properly required the government to “facilitate” his return, the justices made clear. President Donald Trump himself has shifted his stance in recent days after initially saying he would abide by the Supreme Court’s decision. “If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that. I respect the Supreme Court,” Trump told reporters last week. But pressed by Collins on those previous comments, the president on Monday did not answer the question. During the Oval Office meeting, Trump turned to members of his administration — including Attorney General Pam Bondi, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of State Marco Rubio — to underscore the administration’s argument that the US doesn’t have the power to return Abrego Garcia. “That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us. The Supreme Court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him … we would facilitate it: meaning, provide a plane,” Bondi said. Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 – after reviewing evidence – withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family’s pupusa business.” Bukele’s willingness to accept hundreds of migrants who the Trump administration claims are gang members or violent criminals has been critical to the president’s ambition of deporting as many as a million undocumented people before the first year of his second term is over."
"The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily paused a court-imposed midnight deadline to return to the US a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, agreeing to a request from President Donald Trump that will give the justices more time to consider the case. Chief Justice John Roberts granted the “administrative stay,” a move that will extend the deadline until the court hands down a more fulsome decision in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was deported on March 15. The decision to temporarily pause the case, which is relatively common when the court is facing a quick deadline, means that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, will remain at a notorious prison in El Salvador for now. A lower court judge had given the administration until midnight to return him to the US. Roberts did not set a new deadline, though the court is likely to move relatively quickly. The chief justice ordered Abrego Garcia’s attorneys to respond by Tuesday, though they had already done so minutes before Roberts’ order was made public. “This is just a temporary administrative stay. We have every confidence that the Supreme Court will resolve this matter as quickly as possible,” Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s attorney, said after the Supreme Court’s decision. Trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. Abrego Garcia’s case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review. The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that ordering officials to return the man is “unprecedented” as it sounded now-familiar themes arguing federal courts are overstepping their power. “Even amidst a deluge of unlawful injunctions, this order is remarkable,” recently confirmed Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court in the filing Monday. “The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal.” “While the United States concedes that removal to El Salvador was an administrative error … that does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations, treat the executive branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight,” Sauer added. Abrego Garcia rejected that position in his own written arguments Monday. “There is no dispute that Abrego Garcia is only in El Salvador because the United States sent him there,” his attorneys told the Supreme Court. “There is likewise no dispute that he is being held only because the United States has requested that he be held. And there is no evidence in the record of this case supporting the government’s contention that it cannot bring him back.” The Trump administration’s “contention that he has suddenly morphed into a dangerous threat to the republic is not credible,” Abrego Garcia’s attorneys wrote. “The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny.” Abrego Garcia was in the country illegally, but an immigration judge in 2019 — after reviewing evidence — withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family’s pupusa business.” The Trump administration has claimed that Abrego Garcia is a “ranking member” of the MS-13 gang. Because the Trump administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organization, Sauer wrote, the withholding from the immigration court was no longer enforceable. The administration alleges that Abrego Garcia was arrested “in the company of other ranking gang members” and that he was confirmed to be a member of the gang by a “reliable source.” But in the six years between his immigration hearing and his deportation, Abrego Garcia checked in with immigration officials annually and was never charged with a crime, court records show. Yet Abrego Garcia was placed on one of three planes bound for a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. Several of the people loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump’s invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act — an invocation that has drawn its own legal challenge now pending at the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia, the administration has said, was deported under different authorities. "
"The request to the Supreme Court came minutes before a ruling from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals denying the Justice Department’s request to lift the lower-court order. The panel rejecting the appeal was: Judge Stephanie Thacker, an appointee of former President Barack Obama; Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Robert King, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura, said before the high court’s decision that the appeals ruling gave her “hope” and “encouragement.” “This decision gives me hope, and even more encouragement to keep fighting. My children, family, and I will continue praying and seeking justice. Now that the court has spoken, I ask again that both President Trump and President Bukele stop attempting any further delays,” she said, referring to Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador. “They need to follow the court’s order NOW. My children are waiting to be reunited with their father tonight.” Thacker wrote in a scathing concurrence explaining her reasoning that the “United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process.” “The Government’s contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” she wrote, adding later that the “irreparable harm in this case is the harm being done to Abrego Garcia every minute he is in El Salvador.” “And the public interest undoubtedly favors requiring the Government to facilitate and effectuate his return to the United States,” she added. In a solo concurrence explaining his reasoning, Wilkinson said he thinks it is “legitimate for the district court to require that the government ‘facilitate’ the plaintiff’s return to the United States so that he may assert the rights that all apparently agree are due him under law.” “There is no question that the government screwed up here,” he continued. “Thus the government here took the only action which was expressly prohibited.” But Wilkinson said he read Xinis’ order “as one requiring that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release, rather than demand it.” He said that reading it as a requirement for the administration “would be an intrusion on core executive powers that goes too far.”"
"New research has found that brown rice has a higher concentration of arsenic than white rice in the U.S.—affirming decades of similar findings around the toxic metal’s presence in the otherwise healthy grain. For years, experts have sounded alarm bells over arsenic levels in brown rice. A 2008 study found it was highest in rice grown in certain Southern U.S. states, while a 2014 Consumer Reports analysis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data found worrisome levels of arsenic in both white and brown rice—with a greater concentration in brown because the toxin tends to reside in its two outer layers, the bran and the germ, that are removed from white rice. But while the new study, from Michigan State University (MSU) and published in the journal *Risk Analysis* earlier this year, further affirmed brown rice’s higher arsenic concentration, experts point out that arsenic exposure can come from either type of rice. Arsenic is a known carcinogenic element that naturally occurs in soil and groundwater. But it can also be the result of industrial activities, including coal mining, farming (due to some pesticides), and construction (due to some paint and wood preservatives), according to Ohio State University. Because rice is grown in paddies flooded with water, any arsenic present in soil can be readily absorbed into the rice—at levels 10 times higher than other grains, which are grown differently. And this is the case regardless of whether or not rice is organic, according to Environmental Working Group senior scientist Tasha Stoiber. “Arsenic contamination in rice worldwide was discovered over two decades ago,” Stoiber tells *Fortune* in an email. And it’s not just the rice itself. “Arsenic levels are consistently elevated in rice and foods made with rice flour, bran and rice-based sweeteners,” she says. The U.S. and other countries have been slow to take action to reduce arsenic concentrations—also found in drinking water and in foods and beverages including seafood, mushrooms, poultry, infant formula, protein powders, and apple juice—Stoiber explains. “The FDA set a non-binding ‘action level’ of 10 parts per billion for arsenic in apple juice, the same as drinking water,” she says. “But the FDA has not set legally enforceable maximum levels of arsenic for many rice-based foods that have higher concentrations of arsenic.” Rice does not inherently need to be flooded to grow, though farmers do so to control weeds and because constant irrigation is required for the semi-aquatic plant. And growing it in dry instead of saturated soil could decrease the amount of arsenic that seeps into the grains, Stoiber and others say could be a way to reduce arsenic levels. New varieties of rice could be bred to take up less arsenic from the soil and water as well, she adds. The MSU researchers emphasized that, for the average person, eating brown rice would likely not bring dangerously toxic levels of arsenic. “While we found that choosing brown rice over white rice would result in higher arsenic exposure on average, the levels should not cause long-term health problems unless someone ate an enormous amount of brown rice every day for years,” said senior investigator of the study Felicia Wu, professor at MSU’s College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. However, researchers did find that there was significant risk for children under 5 in the U.S. who eat brown rice, as they consume more food relative to their body weight than adults. Long-term exposure to arsenic can cause pigmentation changes and lesions on the skin, which can be precursors to skin cancer, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Bladder and lung cancers may also result from long-term arsenic exposure. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified arsenic, arsenic compounds, and arsenic in drinking water as carcinogenic to humans. The WHO points out other potential adverse health effects that may be associated with long-term ingestion of arsenic, including developmental effects, diabetes, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and arsenic-induced heart attacks. Arsenic is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality. Exposure in early childhood has been linked to higher mortality in young adults from multiple cancers, lung disease, heart attacks, and kidney failure, while several studies have found negative impacts of arsenic exposure on cognitive development, IQ, and memory."
"Trina Candaza disclosed that her co-parenting setup with former boyfriend Carlo Aquino has been “good and civil,” underscoring how parents should prioritize not their emotions but what’s best for their children. The content creator opened up about this after she had a question-and-answer session via her Instagram Stories on Tuesday, April 15. One of the questions read, “How’s co-parenting and co-parenting tips?” “Good and civil,” Candaza responded without making a mention of Aquino. She, however, shared alongside her answer a video of their daughter Mithi. Candaza then went on to advise, “Before making a decision or saying something, ask yourself: Is this truly in my child’s best interest? Will this make her happy? Will she gain something positive from this?” She further noted how parents often convince themselves that the decisions they make are for their children, when in reality “they are influenced by [their] own emotions.” Aquino and Candaza became a couple in January 2019 and welcomed Mithi in September 2020. The pair’s breakup was confirmed to the public in 2022. The former couple also had public disputes, with claims from Aquino that he was being prevented from seeing their daughter. Candaza denied this, saying the actor was visiting Mithi and fulfilling his responsibility as a father, although he allegedly “only gives the bare minimum.” The actor reportedly took legal action to acquire visitation rights over Mithi in September 2023."
"Actress-director Olivia Wilde and actress-model Emily Ratajkowski were not impressed as they spoke out against the recent Blue Origin flight that took pop star Katy Perry and five other women to space. Wilde reposted a meme of Perry kissing the ground upon her return from space via her Instagram Story and wrote, “Billion dollars bought some good memes, I guess.” Ratajkowski, on the other hand, expressed her apparent “disgust” with the space mission as she questioned the intention and the amount of resources it took to send the six women to the edge of Earth’s atmosphere. “This is beyond parody,” the actress-model said on her TikTok video. “Saying that you care about Mother Earth and that it’s about Mother Earth, while you’re going up in a spaceship that is built and paid for by a company that is single-handedly destroying the planet. Look at the state of the world and think about how many resources went into putting these women into space. For what? What was the marketing there? And then to try to make it seem like I’m disgusted.” Actress Olivia Munn, meanwhile, described the entire rocket launch as “gluttonous,” as she explained how the world has other things to worry about aside from sending people to space. “What are they doing? Like, why? I’m just saying this. I know this is probably not the cool thing to say, but there are so many other things that are incredibly important in the world right now,” she said during an appearance on Today. “It costs so much money to go to space. There are a lot of people who can’t even afford eggs… I think it’s a bit gluttonous.” On Monday, Perry joined Nobel Prize nominee Amanda Nguyen, ex-rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn and journalist Lauren Sanchez, who is engaged to Amazon founder and Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos, on an 11-minute flight to space, the first mission for an all-female space crew since 1963."
"Hailey Van Lith shared some hugs with family and then a kiss with NBA player Jalen Suggs, who was thrilled that the Chicago Sky selected his girlfriend with the No. 11 pick in the WNBA draft on Monday night. So was Angel Reese. Van Lith and Reese, college teammates at LSU, will be reunited as pros and can’t wait to get back to work. “We both are just tough dogs on the court,” Van Lith said. “I mean, she’s willing to do things that aren’t pretty to win, and I’m talking about aggressive rebounding, defense, things that aren’t what we call sexy basketball.” “She’s willing to execute those things to get a win. And I think that I share that character trait with her.” That’s part of what drew the Sky to Van Lith, who showed those traits as the first player to be part of three teams that reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. First it was during her three seasons at Louisville, then one at LSU before spending this past season at TCU. LSU was attempting to defend its 2023 national title when Caitlin Clark and Iowa stopped the Tigers in the regional final in Reese’s final college game. Now, she and Van Lith will see what they can do together as pros. “We ain’t do it right the first time,” Reese wrote on X. “Let’s run it backkkkk.” Suggs, who plays for the Orlando Magic, was standing and smiling after Van Lith’s name was called by Commissioner Cathy Englebert. She waved back toward where he was standing, then eventually walked over for a kiss and hug. Suggs had also been there to cheer in the NCAA Tournament, wearing Van Lith’s jersey during their run to the Elite Eight. Reese had been supporting as well. Van Lith said the former teammates had remained in contact during the season, when Van Lith was voted Big 12 player of the year at her new school. Now they will try to help the Sky rebound from a 13-27 record in Reese’s rookie season, when she grabbed the most rebounds ever by a first-year player. “We have a very mature relationship, a mutual respect relationship where we both have respect for each other’s game and also the character and the person we are off the court,” Van Lith said. “So, mostly I’m just excited to get to be around her again. I think we have a lot of similarities about how we carry ourselves and our mindset on what’s important to us.”"
"A leaked private recording was recently obtained exclusively by Empire News, wherein former President Donald Trump directly refers to recently acquitted teenage gunman Kyle Rittenhouse as a ‘Modern Day Hero.’ “Mr. Ex-President is, naturally, very excited about this outcome,” says an anonymous source. “He loves Kyle, and has consistently been referring to the teen as a ‘modern day hero’ after what happened in Wisconsin.” Publicly, President Joe Biden has been very avoidant of commenting too heavily on his feelings about Kyle Rittenhouse’s arrest and subsequent trial. When Rittenhouse was acquitted last week, the Biden administration issued a statement simply acknowledging that “the jury system works, and we have to abide by it,” hinting heavily that he didn’t agree with the verdict. But Trump has been pushing in the exact opposite direction. “Oh man, Mr. Ex-President is jumping for joy over this outcome,” says an anonymous source who works for Trump. “He threw a huge party the night of the verdict. It was like a birthday party for a deranged toddler – there were pony rides and balloons and cupcakes featuring little automatic rifles drawn in frosting. He even set up a ‘pin the tail on the looter’ section, with giant pictures of African American rioters hung on the wall, and blindfolded guests trying to stick them with giant pins. Of course, Trump fell asleep about 45 minutes into the party, but we still had a blast regardless. Kid Rock played. It was kind of wild.” Another source claims that Trump and Rittenhouse have actually been texting each other since the verdict, bonding over their love for misplaced violence, a completely corrupt and failing justice system, and their mutual disregard for African Americans."
"Only a few hours after publicly announcing that he would be divorcing wife Lisa Bonet, superstar actor Jason Momoa (Aquaman) was photographed leaving a club in New York City with SNL cast member and comedian Pete Davidson. Momoa and Bonet had been together for over 16 years, but didn’t marry until 2017. The couple announced an amicable split on social media which immediately was picked up by the AP, but nobody thought they’d see Momoa out with anyone new quite so soon. Davidson, who has been romantically linked to nearly every woman on the planet, most recently Kim Kardashian, has reportedly swooped in quickly to get in on Momoa’s hunky, manly body. “The dude is fucking awesome in Aquaman,” Davidson told a reporter for TMZ. “I’ve never felt super into dudes, but one look at Jason with his shirt off throughout the entire runtime of that movie, and I challenge any man not to get erect. It’s just not possible.” Davidson is known for his whirlwind relationships, and friends of Momoa are already concerned for his well-being. “Jason is one big, badass dude,” said friend Timothée Chalamet, who recently starred in the epic film DUNE with Momoa. “Nobody is saying that Jason can’t take care of himself, but on the inside he’s a big soft teddy bear, and I just hope that Pete doesn’t screw around with his feelings.” Momoa and his reps could not be reached for comment. According to sources, his ex Lisa Bonet – best known for her role as Denise Huxtable on The Cosby Show – is “completely broken up” about Momoa being seen out so soon with someone new. “She knew he’d eventually start seeing someone else, but didn’t know it would be this fast,” said a friend of Bonet’s who asked to remain anonymous. “I mean, Jason could have any woman on this planet, and Lisa knows that. Hell, God knows I’ve jilled-off to thoughts of him before. So Lisa expected someone to come along eventually, but I think we’re all surprised that it’s Pete Fucking Davidson.”"
"Over a dozen people were hospitalized and 11 people were arrested after a massive celebration broke out in the streets of Boston on Friday. Last week, conservative dickbag Rush Limbaugh announced he had late-stage lung cancer, and liberals across the country let out a massive cheer. In Boston, a public celebration took place during the afternoon on Friday, with an estimated 35,000 people in attendance outside of Fenway Park. “When I heard that Rush was going to die, I couldn’t wait to celebrate,” said Rick Baker, 39, of Boston. “If there were ever a more worthless, piece of shit, talking head on radio and TV, I don’t know who it is. I heard about the party on the radio Friday morning, called out of work, and headed down to the park to party.” Boston Police Department say that the gathering was not authorized, but they caught wind of the party on social media, and were able to send a “significant number of police officers” to the area to keep things under control. “We were able to keep things really under control under the conservative protestors showed up,” said Boston Police Chief Frank R. Green. “The people who were there to enjoy the celebration were great. Unfortunately, some Rush supporters spoiled the fun. In the end, we arrested multiple people and our police forces had to, sadly, beat down many protestors who did not listen to directions to vacate the area.” Green said that none of the “Rushers” had life-threatening injuries, and that most would be out of the hospital within a few days. “Next time, perhaps these people will listen,” said Green. “If a group of people want to celebrate the inevitable death of a world class piece of shit, we will support that. If you want to get in the way of that, we will ensure that you’re dealt with accordingly.” Rush Limbaugh, who for some stupid reason received the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week, ensuring that it is now 100% meaningless, could not be reached for comment."
"So much for that ‘Soul of the Nation’ brand Biden was trying to pitch. He put party politics above the lives of two stranded American astronauts. That’s not just un-American, that’s the kind of technocratic indifference to human life you might expect of the Soviet space program, NOT NASA. When Boeing and NASA fell short, and the Ukraine war took their hitch-a-ride-with-the-Russians Plan off the table, Biden administration still had someone they could have turned to… but they were too busy throwing the weight of the US government at harassing and impeding Elon’s various companies to ask him. SpaceX had been to the Space Station before. More than once. But rather than call on Elon and risk him getting the chance to be a hero in cleaning up the mess that Boeing and NASA left behind, they did not give the go-ahead. Under Trump, that policy is being reversed. Elon’s got a green light to bring them back to Earth, and so long as the mission goes smoothly, he thinks he can bring them home in about 4 weeks. What kind of an inhuman and cheap view of the value of human life does a career politician need to have to make the decision that rescuing two people trapped in space — by a failure involving a joint venture with his own damn government in NASA — might benefit the other political party, and decide that’s a price he can’t afford to pay? Anyone trying to pitch a story about the decent and honorable Joe Biden wakes up today finding out their spin job just got that much harder."
"How many times have we heard the phrase ‘reproductive health care’ kicked around by the left? If this really was about women’s health and not about profiting off of the fears of pregnant women, shouldn’t the people who even want your barber to be credentialed insist that only the most highly-trained medical professionals be permitted to perform such a delicate procedure? After all, nobody wants a repeat of the abortion slaughterhouse Kermit Gosnell set up that was every bit as unsanitary and dangerous to pregnant women as the apocryphal ‘back alley coat-hanger abortions’ that led to the Roe decision in the first place. And yet, Planned Parenthood just won a case in Alaska where they sued for the right for NON-DOCTORS to perform abortions. Why is this a dangerous precedent? Because there’s a lot that can go wrong in any invasive medical procedure… and that risk only goes higher when you have someone with inferior medical training. Under this ruling, non-physicians can now commit chemical abortions, as well as surgical aspiration abortions (both most commonly used in the first trimester). Despite the claim that this is a necessary ruling for women, it actually puts them at increased risk. A 2013 study from the Ryan Residency abortion training program at the University of California San Francisco, abortions committed by non-physicians are more likely to end in complications than those committed by physicians. With aspiration abortions, the most common complication was incomplete abortions, meaning parts of the preborn baby were left inside the mother’s body. This can lead to life-threatening infection and death. The abortion pill likewise has been found to be four times more dangerous than first trimester surgical abortions, and increases in its rate of incomplete abortions as gestation progresses. — LifeSite So… Planned Parenthood fought a court case that actually made life more dangerous for their clients? In an election that has so much to say about the ‘rights of women’ this seems like it could be a relevant issue, doesn’t it?"
"It all started as a simple thread in a well-known Spanish forum called “forocoches,” where someone posted the following question: “If I eat snot, will my children have green eyes?” The post went viral around the world generating discussion. That’s why researchers at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts decided to study the effect – expecting to find no correlation. Their findings turned out to be extremely surprising. They concluded that swallowing snot increases 80% the chances of green eyes for the baby. “Believe it or not, we already knew about some benefits of eating your own boogers,” said Dr. Sam Not, who headed up the research. “It actually has health benefits, including boosting your immune system. What we didn’t know was that it directly correlated to eye color in the fetus of a pregnant woman. Our findings were astounding.” Unfortunately, the news broke quite quickly, and has since become viral on social media. With doctors advocating for snot eating, many mothers-to-be are asking the really tough questions, such as “does snot contain gluten?” and “If I’m a vegan, can I eat my snot?” “Sorry to say, that medical science has not quite caught up to those questions yet,” said Dr. Not."
"Trump s not backing down from his  in your face  style anytime soon. That s the problem with our country, we don t have fighters in our country. And his critics are just gonna have to  deal with it. Donald Trump is on the cover of Time magazine, and the headline reads:  Deal with it. The meme-worthy photo shoot features the Republican presidential hopeful posing with a 27-year-old American bald eagle   the emblem of the United States. Every frame was the same,  Schoeller told TIME.  Mr. Trump knows exactly how he looks, and he strikes one pose and doesn t move. The same could not be said for 27-year-old Uncle Sam, who was hit by a car in the 1990s and has since segued into a life on the educational and entertainment circuits. He s very difficult to photograph,  said Schoeller.  If you ask him to look up a little bit, he says no or he just doesn t do it. He literally has one angle. If I ask him to smile, he puts on a big grin and then he goes back to his Zoolander  blue steel  look. The  blue steel  look appears, sans eagle, on the cover of this week s TIME.It s a look America has grown very accustomed to since Trump became a household name in the 1980s and one they ve been showing their love for more than ever in recent months.The Republican front-runner said it all on Wednesday that when it comes to the polls in the crowded 2016 presidential race,  the only thing constant is Trump. Asked at a news conference ahead of a town-hall forum in New Hampshire who he saw as his strongest rival in the crowded Republican field, Trump said:  You know it changes. The only thing constant is Trump.  Via: UK Daily Mail They re going up and down like yo-yos,  he said of his Republican rivals.  But I ve been up there for a long time and I hope I m going to be up there for a long time. Saying he had seen newspaper reports that he would grow tired of the presidential race, Trump said:  I m not going anywhere folks. I m not doing this for my health. I m doing this to make America great again. Here is a great interview by Entertainment Tonight:Trump told TIME magazine,  I don t have a racist bone in my body. The fact that I want a strong border and the fact that I don t want illegal immigrants pouring into this country, that doesn t make me a racist, it means I love this country and I want to save this country.

"Katrina Campins gave an excellent explanation of Trump s position on immigration and the press:  As an American I feel frustrated because people are losing sight of what Donald Trump is trying to say. What he s saying is, people should come to this country legally. And I know about that process very well because my husband is going through it right now and it s extremely expensive. So there s more incentive for people to come over to this country illegally. So all he s saying is, let s make the process to come here easier and less expensive so there s more incentive to do that. When people cross the border who are not supposed to be here, let s make sure they are sent back. But what the media is doing is twisting and turning everything that he s saying and what s so frustrating as an American is that the point is not getting across. We re so worried about his fights with Megyn Kelly and Jorge Ramos now, let s talk about the real issues I don t think it s his fault. I think it s the fact that everything he says gets misconstrued. Like this immigration thing  I m a Hispanic woman and I m not offended for what he s saying. I understood exactly what he is saying. No. And I don t agree that I m in the minority because the last time I was on CNN speaking about this as a Hispanic woman, so many Hispanic women tweeted me and said,  Thank you for speaking for the real Hispanic woman.

"Another Hollywood whats-his-name is out there spouting off on something that he barely knows about because he thinks he knows better than you. After all, he is an actor. You remember John Leguizamo, right? He was that guy in that movie with [name of a famous actor]? That’s kind of how I remember him, anyway. Actually, he’s not that bad an actor — I liked him as Tybalt in that modern 90s version of Romeo and Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. Of course, that was 25 years ago… To his credit, he’s still acting. He was in John Wick 2, apparently. (I admit it, I didn’t watch any of the John Wick movies.) According to Leguizamo’s IMDB profile, a lot of his more recent credits are voice work for cartoons — parents and grandparents might remember him as Sid the sloth from Ice Age. Leguizamo is now weighing in on the sudden outrage over CRT in schools. He says that it’s not being taught to your kids, and if you think it is, then you’re ignorant. Leguizamo later implies that if you do oppose it in college, then you’re racist. He also provides a definition of Critical Race Theory for those of us ignoramuses that don’t know what CRT is — it’s “academic thinky talk.” Thanks, John. That’s so helpful. Why are parents so opposed to Critical Race Theory? Well, it’s because CRT is racist. Leguizamo can try to “lipstick on a pig” this one all he wants to, but it is viewing our history and our society through a racial lens that categorizes people as victims and oppressors based on their skin color. It is antithetical to American values and the view that the vast majority of the Founders held. Alright, let’s go over this one more time for the slow people like Leguizamo that don’t seem to get it — Critical Race Theory itself is not being taught to K-12 children. There is no Critical Race Theory class where kids take out their CRT textbooks and learn the branch of critical theory that began in the Law department of Harvard University and concluded that disparities among races are the result of racism that undergirds all human interactions and is, therefore, the foundation of all systems created by people. What is happening in classrooms now is the lens of CRT — that all human interactions are based on race — is being used to teach History, Civics, and Social Studies. In some places, this includes dividing students by race and young children are being introduced to the idea that “whiteness” is evil. Some public school boards — and a handful of “woke” elite private schools — are recommending a book that suggests that “whiteness” is a contract with the devil."
"In a shocking twist that rocked the entertainment world, the iconic trio of “It’s Showtime” hosts has seemingly gone their separate ways, each pledging allegiance to rival fast-food chains.
