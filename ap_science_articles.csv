"Eggs are less likely to crack when dropped on their side, according to science","NEW YORK (AP)  Eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side, according to experiments with over 200 eggs. What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfast? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.  But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the eggs insides in a puffy, cloudy mess. Its commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends  after all, its how theyre packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact. But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.  The fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another, said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.  The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).  The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .  The common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved thats not the case, said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study. 
        
     Scientists found that the eggs equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics. Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. Its not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights. Its a bit counterintuitive that the oblong side of an egg could hold up better against a tumble, said study co-author Tal Cohen with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Countless broken eggs show the courage to go and challenge these very common, accepted notions, Cohen said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"How to catch the shooting stars of springs first meteor shower, the Lyrids","When the Lyrid meteor shower reaches its peak, it will be springs first chance to see shooting stars. The Lyrids have surprised skygazers in the past with as many as 100 meteors per hour, but its not predicted to be as active this time around.  During Tuesday mornings peak, expect to see around six meteors per hour, said Thaddeus LaCoursiere, planetarium program coordinator at the Bell Museum in St. Paul, Minnesota.  The waning crescent moon will be 40% full, meaning a decent level of visibility under clear and dark conditions.  Viewing lasts until April 26. Heres what to know about the Lyrids and other meteor showers. As the Earth orbits the sun, several times a year it passes through debris left by passing comets and sometimes asteroids. The source of the Lyrids is debris from the comet Thatcher. When these fast-moving space rocks enter Earths atmosphere, the debris encounters new resistance from the air and becomes very hot, eventually burning up.  Sometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail  the end of a shooting star. You dont need special equipment to see the various meteor showers that flash across annually, just a spot away from city lights. The best time to watch a meteor shower is in the early predawn hours when the moon is low in the sky. Competing sources of light  such as a bright moon or artificial glow  are the main obstacles to a clear view of meteors. Cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest are optimal viewing opportunities.  And keep looking up, not down. Your eyes will be better adapted to spot shooting stars if you arent checking your phone.

NASAs Lucy spacecraft is speeding toward another close encounter with an asteroid,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Lucy spacecraft will swoop past a small asteroid this weekend as it makes its way to an even bigger prize: the unexplored swarms of asteroids out near Jupiter. It will be the second asteroid encounter for Lucy, launched in 2021 on a quest that will take it to 11 space rocks. The close approaches should help scientists better understand our early solar system when planets were forming; asteroids are the ancient leftovers. The upcoming flyby is a dress rehearsal for 2027 when Lucy reaches its first so-called Trojan asteroid near Jupiter. Cranking up its three science instruments, the spacecraft on Sunday will observe the harmless asteroid known as Donaldjohanson. The encounter will take place 139 million miles (223 million kilometers) from Earth in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, so far away it will take 12 minutes for each bit of data to reach flight controllers in Colorado. The paleontologist for whom the asteroid is named plans to be at spacecraft builder and operator Lockheed Martins Mission Control for all the action. He discovered the fossil Lucy in Ethiopia 50 years ago; the spacecraft is named after the famous human ancestor.  NASAs Lucy will venture as close as 596 miles (960 kilometers) to this asteroid, an estimated 2  miles (4 kilometers) in length but much shorter in width. Scientists should have a better idea of its size and shape following the brief visit. The spacecraft will zoom by at more than 30,000 mph (48,000 kph). 
        
     The asteroid is among countless fragments believed to have resulted from a major collision 150 million years ago. Its not going to be a basic potato. We already know that, said lead scientist Hal Levison of Southwest Research Institute.  Rather, Levison said the asteroid may resemble a bowling pin or even a snowman like Arrokoth, the Kuiper Belt object visited by NASAs New Horizon spacecraft in 2019. The other possibility is that there are two elongated but separate asteroids far apart. We dont know what to expect. Thats what makes this so cool, he said. There will be no communications with Lucy during the flyby as the spacecraft turns its antenna away from Earth in order to track the asteroid. Levison expects to have most of the science data within a day. Lucys next stop  the main event, as Levison calls it  will be the Trojan asteroids that share Jupiters orbit around the sun. Swarms of Trojans precede and follow the solar systems largest planet as it circles the sun. Lucy will visit eight of them from 2027 through 2033, some of them in pairs of two. Lucys first asteroid flyby was in 2023 when it swept past little Dinkinesh, also in the main asteroid belt. The spacecraft discovered a mini moon around it. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A green comet likely is breaking apart and wont be visible to the naked eye,"NEW YORK (AP)  A newly discovered green comet tracked by telescopes has likely broken apart as it swung by the sun, dashing hopes of a naked-eye spectacle. Comet SWAN, hailing from the Oort Cloud beyond Pluto, has been visible through telescopes and binoculars over the past few weeks with its streaming tail, but experts said it may not have survived its recent trip past the sun and is fading fast. Well soon be left with just a dusty rubble pile, astrophysicist Karl Battams with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory said in an email.  Comets are balls of frozen gas and dust from billions of years ago. Every so often, a comet passes through the inner solar system.  These are relics from when the solar system first formed, said Jason Ybarra, director of the West Virginia University Planetarium and Observatory. The newest comet was discovered by amateur astronomers, who spied it in photos taken by a camera on a spacecraft operated by NASA and the European Space Agency to study the sun.  The comet wont swing close to Earth like Tsuchinshan-Atlas did last year. Other notable flybys included Neowise in 2020 and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the 1990s. The comet, also designated C/2025 F2, would have been visible just after dark slightly north of where the sun set. Its green color would have been difficult to see with the naked eye. This might have been the objects first ever trip past the sun, making it particularly vulnerable to breaking apart, Battams said. After its flyby, whats left of the comet will disappear into the outer reaches of the solar system, past where scientists think it came from.  
        
     Its going to go so far out that we have no idea if its ever going to return, said Battams. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASAs Lucy spacecraft beams back pictures of an asteroid shaped like a lumpy bowling pin,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Lucy spacecraft has beamed back pictures from its latest asteroid flyby, revealing a long, lumpy, odd-shaped space rock. The space agency released the images Monday, a day after the close approach. It was considered a dress rehearsal for the more critical asteroid encounters ahead closer to Jupiter. This asteroid is bigger than scientists anticipated, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) long and 2 miles (3.5 kilometers) wide at its widest point  resembling an irregular bowling pin. Its so long that the spacecraft couldnt capture it in its entirety in the initial downloaded images.  Data returned over the next week should help clarify the asteroids shape, according to NASA. Lucy passed within 600 miles (960 kilometers) of the harmless asteroid known as Donaldjohanson on Sunday in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Its named for the paleontologist who discovered the fossil Lucy 50 years ago in Ethiopia. The spacecraft was launched in 2021 to study the unexplored so-called Trojan asteroids out near Jupiter.

"Bonobos in Congo form girl groups to fend off male aggression, study says","NEW YORK (AP)  Female bonobos find strength in numbers, teaming up to fend off males in the wild, a new study finds.  Along with chimpanzees, bonobos are among humans closest relatives. Scientists have long wondered why bonobos live in generally female-dominated societies since the males are physically bigger and stronger. This image provided by Martin Surbeck shows bonobos lounging on a fallen tree in the Congo in 2020. (Martin Surbeck/Kokolopori Bonobo Research Project via AP) This image provided by Martin Surbeck shows bonobos lounging on a fallen tree in the Congo in 2020. (Martin Surbeck/Kokolopori Bonobo Research Project via AP) Three decades of observations in Congo  the only place the endangered bonobos are found in the wild  lend support to the idea of a sisterhood where female bonobos band together to assert their power.  These girl groups chased male bonobos out of trees, securing food for themselves, and females that grouped more ranked higher in their communitys social ladder, researchers found.  Its very clear that you dont want to overstep as a male bonobo, said study author Martin Surbeck from Harvard University. Findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Biology. Female bonobos combined numbers seem to turn the tide against a males physical strength, Surbeck said. Its one of the rare times such a strategy has allowed females to come out on top in the animal kingdom. Spotted hyenas similarly find power in groups.

The observations show how female bonobos work together to protect themselves from male violence, said biological anthropologist Laura Lewis with the University of California, Berkeley.

A carnivorous bone collector caterpillar dresses in the remains of its prey,"NEW YORK (AP)  A new carnivorous caterpillar that wears the remains of its prey has been dubbed the bone collector. The odd insect is only found on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It creeps along spiderwebs, feeding on trapped insects and decorating its silk case with their body parts. There are other meat-eating caterpillars that do lots of crazy things, but this takes the cake, said study author Dan Rubinoff with the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Scientists think the case might act as camouflage, allowing the caterpillar to feast on the spiders ensnared meals without getting caught. A host of caterpillars native to Hawaii use silk glands to spin protective cases studded with lichen, sand and other materials. This one is the first to use ant heads and fly wings. It really is an astonishing type of case, said Steven Montgomery, an entomology consultant in Hawaii who was not involved with the new study. Findings were published Thursday in the journal Science. Scientists found just 62 of the carnivorous caterpillars in over 20 years of observing. Predatory caterpillars are extremely rare and the bone collectors found in Hawaii will even eat each other, researchers said.  The bone collectors origins date back at least 6 million years, making the caterpillars more ancient than the Hawaiian islands themselves. Today, they dwell on an isolated patch of mountain forest alongside invasive species. 
        
     There is really a concern that we need to do better with conservation, said Rubinoff. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"What makes a Kentucky Derby champion? Big hearts, immense lungs and powerful legs","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  On a crisp, clear morning, a chestnut thoroughbred thundered down the dirt strip at Churchill Downs, his exercise rider leaning forward above the saddle. Other horse-and-rider pairs followed. Dr. Will Farmer looked down from a viewing point, admiring the speed and agility of the 1,000-pound animals. The whole world will have the chance to see horses in action here Saturday, when the Kentucky Derby shines a global spotlight on equine athleticism. Its the subject of a growing body of research that cites a constellation of characteristics: big hearts, immense lung capacity, robust musculoskeletal systems and long, thin legs  all of which helped horses survive in the wild. Kentucky Derby entrant Citizen Bull works out at Churchill Downs Monday, April 28, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Kentucky Derby entrant Citizen Bull works out at Churchill Downs Monday, April 28, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) It goes back to the roots: They are an animal of prey, said Farmer, a veterinarian and equine medical director at Churchill Downs Inc. Thats how they got away from being eaten. APs Lisa Dwyer reports on what makes horse races such as the Kentucky Derby such a success. Horses honed skills such as running, jumping and pulling as humans bred and trained them for various purposes over millennia. And the 151st Derby  horse racings most-watched event  will draw attention not only to the animals skills, but also to concerns about their treatment and health. Advocates have long raised concerns about deaths and injuries  calls that were amplified two years ago, when 12 horses died at Churchill Downs.  Theres no doubt that war, agriculture and societies have been transformed by the human-horse relationship.  Horses allowed us to circumvent our own biological limitations as a species, said Timothy Winegard, a historian at Colorado Mesa University and author of a recent book, The Horse. We combined our brains with the horses size, strength, stamina and speed to form the most unstoppable animal coalition. A race horse works out at Churchill Downs Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) A race horse works out at Churchill Downs Wednesday, April 30, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) A horses heart and lungs are the source of its extraordinary power. The heart averages 10 to 12 pounds (4.5-5.4 kg), or about 1% of the animals body weight, compared with half a percent for the typical human heart. Secretariat, the storied horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973, was found after his death to have a heart weighing more than 20 pounds (9.1 kg). Horse hearts are built for exertion. The average horse can go from a resting heart rate of about 34 beats per minute to 220 or 240 while racing  faster than a human heart during maximum exertion. One thing thats really unique about horses is that they have an incredible capacity to move blood around their bodies -- their heart rate can go really high and still be safe, said University of Connecticut researcher Sarah Reed, editor in chief of the journal Animal Frontiers. They also have a lung capacity of 60 liters  10 times that of humans. That massive lung field allows for oxygen to transfer from the air into their blood, which is vitally important for sustaining aerobic energy, Farmer said. Recent research in the journal Science found that a genetic mutation enables horses to avoid negative side effects of super high energy production. Horses are great athletes because they can deliver a lot of oxygen to their muscles  way more than an elite human can and by elite human, I mean Olympic athlete, said Gianni Castiglione, the studys co-author. They have a bigger tank of gas and they have a more efficient engine  and this mutation is contributing to both of those things.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Other aspects of a horses biology enhance its abilities. Horses store extra red blood cells in their spleens. These cells are released to carry even more oxygen around the body during intense exertion. Adrenaline when exercising causes the spleen to release extra red blood cells into circulation, veterinarian Hilary Clayton said. What horses are doing is essentially blood doping themselves. Meanwhile, horses brains allow them to process sensory information and react quickly. Thats despite having frontal lobes, parts of the brain used for thought and planning that are proportionally smaller than those in humans. Brainwise, theyre designed with a real desire to play and run independent of any fear, said Dr. Scott Bailey, a veterinarian at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, a thoroughbred breeding farm where Secretariat is buried. Horses are also able to focus intently, which is really important for an athlete. Bone structure and musculature also help. The ligaments and tendons in their hind legs act like springs, Farmer said, helping propel them forward. Like other large prey animals, he added, they have long, thin legs that are meant to run.  The adaptations that make horses faster also predispose them to injury, Reed said. Their skinny legs absorb the impact of each stride, she said, and over time the repetitive stress of racing and training can lead to deformation of tendons and ligaments. In 2023, deaths occurred not only at Churchill Downs, but other major racing venues, affecting public perceptions of the sport and sparking changes. Reviews found no single cause for the deaths. But for 2024, Churchill Downs upgraded equipment used on its dirt surface and added an equine safety and integrity veterinarian.  In its annual report, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority noted the steps being taken to reduce injuries and fatalities  expanded veterinary protocols, pre-race inspections and uniform medication oversight. And, it said, the rate of deaths at authority-accredited tracks dropped in 2024, by 27%.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Experts say a healthy, safe environment brings out the best in a horse  but they still dont know what makes certain horses standouts at the race track. Thats the million-dollar question, Bailey said. Every thoroughbred owner is trying to match the genetics of the parents in order to make the horse with the greatest chance of winning. Breeding is only part of the equation, experts said; nurture, training and the horse-rider relationship also factor in. Each time a horse emerges seemingly out of nowhere to win the Kentucky Derby, Farmer is reminded of this. You dont have to be this star-studded bred horse that cost a million dollars at sale to come and win and be a great runner, he said, raising his voice slightly above the din of galloping hooves. There are a lot of great horses. ___ Larson reported from Washington, D.C.

Ancient DNA confirms New Mexico tribes link to famed Chaco Canyon site,"For the first time, a federally recognized Indigenous tribe in the U.S. has led research using DNA to show their ancestral history.  The Picuris Pueblo, a sovereign nation in New Mexico, has oral histories and cultural traditions that link the tribe to the region of Chaco Canyon, one of the ancient centers of Pueblo culture and society. Weve been telling our stories as long as time immemorial, said Picuris Lt. Gov. Craig Quanchello. But he said those traditions were often overlooked and erased. As members of the Picuris Pueblo seek a greater voice in shaping decisions about the future of Chaco Canyon, where debates about oil and gas drilling loom, leaders including Quanchello decided that using DNA sequencing to complement or corroborate their oral histories could be a useful tool. The group began a collaboration with an international team of geneticists.  The DNA could help us protect our heritage, he said. Now we can say, This is ours, we need to protect it.  The findings, published Thursday in the journal Nature, show close links between the genomes of 13 current members of Picuris and ancient DNA recovered from 16 Picuris individuals who lived between 1300 A.D. and 1500 A.D. in or near Chaco Canyon.  The results show a strong relationship between ancient and present-day Picuris, said co-author Thomaz Pinotti, a geneticist at the University of Copenhagen. 
        
     The genetic analysis was led by the Picuris. The researchers said this model of collaboration contrasts with a long history of archaeologists and geneticists seizing and studying artifacts and remains without the consent of Indigenous groups.  It wasnt an easy decision to begin the collaboration with scientists, said co-author and Picuris Gov. Wayne Yazza. This is life-changing data.  There are 19 Pueblo tribes in New Mexico. The new study does not refute the historic connections of other tribes to Chaco Canyon.  Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site managed by the U.S. National Park Service. It is famous for sweeping desert vistas and for monumental sandstone structures  including multistory homes and ceremonial structures  built by ancestral Pueblos.  Its super important that we dont talk about Chaco in the category of lost civilizations, like the Egyptian pyramids or Stonehenge, said Paul Reed, a preservation archaeologist at Archaeology Southwest, who was not involved in the study. That notion is particularly damaging in this instance because it disenfranchises the Pueblo people who live all around the canyon to this day. Brian Vallo, a member of the Acoma Pueblo who leads the Chaco Heritage Tribal Association, said a current concern revolves around drilling and mining permits on federal land adjacent to the park, which also impact the environment within the canyon.  We have these close connections because our ancestors migrated and built these places - they remain central to the preservation of our own Indigenous culture, said Vallo, who was not part of the research.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Vultures are among the least loved animals. African conservationists are trying to change that,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  Vultures have an image problem. Seen as ugly and associated with death, they are among the least loved animals in the world. But conservationists in Africa are trying to change that. Theyve launched an effort to save endangered vultures by trying to put a dollar figure on their incredible value. A recent report by the BirdLife International conservation organization estimated that vultures are worth $1.8 billion a year to certain ecosystems in southern Africa, which might surprise anyone not familiar with the clean-up, pest control and anti-poaching work performed by one of the most efficient scavengers on the planet. They are not up there on the pretty scale. And they are not popular. But we know they are very useful, said Fadzai Matsvimbo, an extinction prevention coordinator at BirdLife International. The report comes at an important time for Africas vultures; six of the 11 species found on the continent are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which says vultures are highly threatened in many parts of the world. In Africa, some species have declined by nearly 90%, Matsvimbo said. Conservationists hope the report will make authorities and the public more aware of the positive impact of vultures. It focused on research in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe and shows how a wake of vultures  the term for a group of feeding vultures  can strip a decomposing carcass in hours, cleaning up ecosystems, reducing the chance of disease spreading and the presence of pests like rats and feral dogs, which has great benefits to communities. 
        
     Vultures also have extremely strong stomach acid, dont get food poisoning and are able to consume and neutralize anthrax, botulism and other bacteria and toxins in carcasses that would kill other animals, removing deadly threats from the environment. Just this week, more than 50 hippos died from suspected anthrax poisoning in a reserve in Congo. Vultures are natures best sanitation services, said Matsvimbo. Conservationists have raised the case of the drastic loss of vultures in India over the last 30 years and how that led to a health crisis. A study published last year said half a million people died in India because of the spread of bacteria and infections in the absence of vultures. Matsvimbo said vultures in Africa are also used as sentinels by game rangers because they are often the first to spot a dead animal and can lead rangers to where poachers might be active. They have even proven useful in helping farmers locate dead or injured livestock. Vultures are unique among land vertebrates in that they only feed on carrion  dead animals. That makes them especially susceptible to poisoning by humans, either intentionally by poachers and others who want to get rid of them, or by mistake when pests are the target. Hundreds of vultures can die from a single poisoned carcass.  Vultures are also regularly killed or maimed in collisions with powerlines in Africa. And they are increasingly being killed for belief-based reasons, said Kerri Wolter, the CEO of the Vulpro vulture rehabilitation center in South Africa, which treats sick and injured vultures to be released back into the wild. She said because vultures have such outstanding eyesight and instincts when it comes to finding a dead animal they are viewed by some as being clairvoyant and able to foresee death. Their body parts, and especially their head, are used in potions or as charms to predict the future. Our work is to change the mindsets of people, Wolter said. For them to see vultures and think, wow that is amazing. Matsvimbo and Wolter both said vultures have been given a raw deal by moviemakers in Hollywood, where they are almost always shown as evil and sinister. Movies have done for vultures what Jaws did for sharks, Wolter said. I love watching The Lion King, but every time they do the vulture part, my heart breaks, said Matsvimbo. Vultures are never portrayed in a positive way. I have a bone to chew with these moviemakers. Or should that be bone to pick? ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",https://apnews.com/article/vulture-conservation-environment-wildlife-africa-d4d01206834873a198c6883bc92936f4,science
"Webb Space Telescope captures a star in the making and a galaxy far, far away","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Webb Space Telescope has captured a plume of gas and dust streaming from a star in the making, with a spiral galaxy as a stunning backdrop.  The composite image makes it look as though the overflow of stellar material is the billowing contrail of a rocket on its way to the galaxy. NASA and the European Space Agency released the photo on Monday.  The outflow is about 625 light-years from Earth in one of the closest star-forming regions of our Milky Way galaxy, according to NASA. A light-year is equivalent to almost 6 trillion miles. Launched in 2021 as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, Webb observed the scene in the infrared. NASA said in a statement it was a lucky alignment of the two unrelated objects.  NASAs retired Spitzer Space Telescope captured the same shot in 2006, with scientists then dubbing the stellar jet the cosmic tornado.

Get ready for a partial solar eclipse across Europe and parts of North America and Africa,"NEW YORK (AP)  The moon will appear to take bites out of the sun this weekend during a partial solar eclipse in the Northern Hemisphere  but make sure to protect your eyes.  The eclipse will be visible Saturday across Europe, western Africa, eastern North America and northern Asia. The sun will shrink the most for the northeastern United States, Greenland and eastern Canada. During a partial solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and Earth. The moon casts a shadow on Earth and only partly blocks the sun, making it appear like a crescent. Unlike a total solar eclipse, theres no totality so experts say proper eye protection must be worn the whole time.  Eclipses are just a game of light and shadow that are played by the sun, moon and Earth, said Auriane Egal with the Planetarium in Montral. Solar and lunar eclipses happen anywhere from four to seven times a year, according to NASA. Due to the moons tilted orbit around Earth, they tend to come in pairs: a total lunar eclipse turned the moon red mid-March. To see the eclipse, look on astronomy websites to see when it begins in your area. The spectacle is slotted during sunrise for most of the Americas, late morning for western Europe and Africa and afternoon for eastern Europe and northern Asia.  During the eclipse, the sun will slowly slim to a crescent as the moon appears to cover it and the day may get dimmer.  
        
     It will feel like a particularly cloudy day, said Juan Carlos Muoz-Mateos with the European Southern Observatory. Check weather conditions before heading outside. Clear skies away from tall buildings and city lights are best, especially in the Americas where the sun may be rising during the eclipse. Grab eclipse glasses ahead of time to spot the sight safely through a local science museum or ordering online from a seller cleared on the American Astronomical Societys website.

Neptunes auroras are captured in great detail by NASAs Webb telescope,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Neptunes glowing auroras are captured in the best detail yet by NASAs James Webb Space Telescope.  Hints of auroras were first faintly detected in ultraviolet light during a flyby of the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. Webb captured Neptunes shimmering lights in infrared light, providing direct evidence they exist.  NASA released the images on Wednesday, and the results were published in the journal Nature Astronomy. Auroras on any planet occur when electrically charged particles from space enter and collide with molecules in the atmosphere, creating a series of reactions that emits light.  On Earth, auroras tend to occur near the polar regions, producing spectacular northern and southern lights. Scientists have studied auroras on Saturn and Jupiter for decades, but Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, has been harder to see up close. Neptune has always been elusive, said University of Reading planetary scientist James ODonoghue, co-author of the new study. Its auroras had only been seen by Voyager, and weve been trying to see it again ever since.  Neptunes auroras occur near the mid-latitudes of the planet, not the polar regions, because of differences in its magnetic field, which determine the span of auroras, said ODonoghue.  More than three decades after Voyager 2s pass, scientists have seen Neptunes auroras again with the powerful Webb telescope, producing the first robust detection, co-author Heidi Hammel of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, said in an email. 
        
     The researchers also revealed that Neptunes atmosphere has cooled significantly since the 1980s, which may have somewhat dimmed the light of the auroras. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A Venus flytrap wasp? Scientists uncover an ancient insect preserved in amber that snatched its prey,"NEW YORK (AP)  An ancient wasp may have zipped among the dinosaurs, with a body like a Venus flytrap to seize and snatch its prey, scientists reported Wednesday.  The parasitic wasps abdomen boasts a set of flappy paddles lined with thin bristles, resembling a small bear trap attached to the end of it, said study co-author Lars Vilhelmsen from the Natural History Museum of Denmark.  Scientists uncovered over a dozen female wasps preserved in 99-million-year-old amber from the Kachin region in northern Myanmar. The wasps flaps and teeth-like hairs resemble the structure of the carnivorous Venus flytrap plant, which snaps shut to digest unsuspecting insects. But the design of the wasps getup made scientists think its trap was designed to cushion, not crush. Instead, researchers suggested the flytrap-like structure was used to hold a wriggly insect still while the wasp laid an egg, depositing a baby wasp to feed on and drain its new host. Its a playbook adapted by many parasitic wasps, including modern-day cuckoo and bethylid wasps, to exploit insects. But no known wasp or any other insect does so with bizarre flaps quite like this one. Ive seen a lot of strange insects, but this has to be one of the most peculiar-looking ones Ive seen in a while, said entomologist Lynn Kimsey from the University of California, Davis, who was not involved with the research. 
        
     Scientists named the new wasp Sirenobethylus charybdis, partly for the sea monster from Greek mythology that stirred up wild whirlpools by swallowing and expelling water.  The new study was published in the journal BMC Biology and included researchers from Capital Normal University and the Beijing Xiachong Amber Museum in China. Its unclear when the wasp went extinct. Studying unusual insects like this one can help scientists understand what insects are capable of and how different they can be. We tend to think that the cool things are only found today, said Gabriel Melo, a wasp expert at the Federal University of Paran in Brazil, who had no role in the study. But when we have this opportunity, we see that many really exceptional, odd things already happened. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

What to know about earthquakes like the one that hit Myanmar,"Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away. Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed. Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earths surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.

(The Myanmar Military True News Information Team via AP)   The Earths crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.  This formation is mostly stable, but along the edges they are moving, Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said. Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing very slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump, triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.

(The Myanmar Military True News Information Team via AP) Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region. Earthquakes that occur in the ocean dont always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.    Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, but we cant predict when theyll occur, USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.  However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely. Aftershocks are triggered because of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock, Yeck said. Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, you will probably see aftershocks for the next several months, Steckler said.

But thats not true everywhere. If you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world, Yeck said.  In many countries, including the United States, if youre inside when an earthquake occurs, its advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head  for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure  and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and dont use building elevators. If youre outside, try to remain in an area away from buildings or trees that could fall. Depending on the location, there may be secondary hazards triggered by earthquakes, such as landslides, fires or tsunamis, he said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"After an earthquake, how long can trapped victims survive?","NEW YORK (AP)  For those trapped in rubble after an earthquake, survival depends on many factors, including weather and access to water and air. If their injuries arent too severe, victims can survive for a week or more, assuming the weather isnt too hot or cold, experts say. In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, rescuers search for survivors at a collapsed building in the aftermath of an earthquake in Mandalay, Myanmar on Sunday, March 30, 2025. (Cai Yang/Xinhua via AP) In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, rescuers search for survivors at a collapsed building in the aftermath of an earthquake in Mandalay, Myanmar on Sunday, March 30, 2025. (Cai Yang/Xinhua via AP) Rescue teams in Myanmar and Thailand are searching for survivors after Fridays 7.7 magnitude quake that toppled buildings and damaged roads. The disaster has killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, mainly at a Bangkok office tower construction site. Most rescues happen in the 24 hours after a disaster. The chances of survival drop with each day after that, experts say. Most victims are badly injured or buried by falling stones or other debris.    Trapped victims are more likely to survive if they are in a debris-free pocket that prevents major injury while they await rescue, like under a sturdy desk, said geophysicist Victor Tsai from Brown University in an email. Experts call this a survivable void space. If fire, smoke or hazardous chemicals were released as a result of the building collapse, they may decrease a persons survival odds, said emergency response expert Dr. Joseph Barbera, an associate professor at George Washington University. Beyond that, having air to breathe and water to drink are crucial as the days go on. You could survive a while without food, Barbera said. You could survive less without water.

     Temperatures where someone is trapped may affect survival, and temperatures outside the rubble can affect rescue missions.  Power outages and spotty communications have slowed relief operations in Myanmar, where many are searching for survivors by hand in daily temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). A lack of heavy machinery has slowed search-and-rescue efforts. It can be important for survivors to receive vital medical care before they are removed from the rubble, Barbera said. If not, the buildup of toxins from crushed muscles could make them go into shock after they are rescued. In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, members of a China search and rescue team transfer a survivor from a collapsed Great Wall Hotel in the aftermath of an earthquake in Mandalay, Myanmar, Monday, March 31, 2025.

(Cai Yang/Xinhua via AP) After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a teenager and his 80-year-old grandmother were found alive after nine days trapped in their flattened home. And the year before, a 16-year-old Haitian girl was rescued from earthquake rubble in Port-Au-Prince after 15 days.  The best practices for survival during an earthquake depend on where you are in the world. Building codes in regions with active fault lines are often designed to withstand earthquakes, but that doesnt hold true everywhere. In many countries, including the United States, the best practices are to drop, seek cover and hang on unless you are close to a building exit. Seek shelter under a heavy table or near sturdy furniture that may yield a survivable pocket if the roof collapses. Cover your face with cloth or a mask to protect from dust and debris. If you are trapped in the rubble after and earthquake, save your energy and dont overexert. Ration food and water, listen for rescue calls and search for something near you to make noise. If you have a phone with you, conserve its battery and try for help in short spurts each day.

NASAs newly returned astronauts say they would fly on Boeings Starliner capsule again,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs celebrity astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams said Monday that they hold themselves partly responsible for what went wrong on their space sprint-turned-marathon and would fly on Boeings Starliner again. SpaceX recently ferried the duo home after more than nine months at the International Space Station, filling in for Boeing that returned to Earth without them last year.

(NASA via AP, File) In their first news conference since coming home, the pair said they were taken aback by all the interest and insisted they were only doing their job and putting the mission ahead of themselves and even their families. Wilmore didnt shy from accepting some of the blame for Boeings bungled test flight.  Ill start and point the finger and Ill blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide, he told reporters. All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.   Astronaut Butch Wilmore talks to reporters during a press conference at Johnson Space Center on Monday, March 31, 2025, in Houston. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis) Astronaut Butch Wilmore talks to reporters during a press conference at Johnson Space Center on Monday, March 31, 2025, in Houston. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis) Both astronauts said they would strap into Starliner again. Because were going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. Were going to fix them. Were going to make it work, Wilmore said, adding hed go back up in a heartbeat. Williams noted that Starliner has a lot of capability and she wants to see it succeed. Were all in, she said.  The two will meet with Boeing leadership on Wednesday to provide a rundown on the flight and its problems. Its not for pointing fingers, Wilmore said. Its just to make the path clearer going forward. 
        
     The longtime astronauts and retired Navy captains ended up spending 286 days in space  278 days more than planned when they blasted off on Boeings first astronaut flight on June 5. The test pilots had to intervene in order for the Starliner capsule to reach the space station, as thrusters failed and helium leaked.  Astronaut Suni Williams talks to reporters during a press conference at Johnson Space Center on Monday, March 31, 2025, in Houston. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis) Astronaut Suni Williams talks to reporters during a press conference at Johnson Space Center on Monday, March 31, 2025, in Houston. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis) Their space station stay kept getting extended as engineers debated how to proceed. NASA finally judged Starliner too dangerous to bring Wilmore and Williams back and transferred them to SpaceX. But the launch of their replacements got stalled, stretching their mission beyond nine months.  President Donald Trump urged SpaceXs Elon Musk to hurry things up, adding politics to the stuck astronauts ordeal. The dragged-out drama finally ended two weeks ago with a flawless splashdown by SpaceX off the Florida Panhandle. Its great being back home after being up there, Williams told The Associated Press in an interview. She waited until she was steadier on her feet before reuniting with her two Labrador retrievers the day after splashdown. Pure joy. Wilmore already has a to-do list. His wife wants to replace all the shrubs in their yard before summer. So Ive got to get my body ready to dig holes, he told the AP. NASA said engineers still do not understand why Starliners thrusters malfunctioned; more tests are planned through the summer. If engineers can figure out the thruster and leak issues, Starliner is ready to go, Wilmore said.  The space agency may require another test flight  with cargo  before allowing astronauts to climb aboard. That redo could come by years end.  Despite Starliners rocky road, NASA officials said they stand behind the decision made years ago to have two competing U.S. companies providing taxi service to and from the space station. But time is running out: The space station is set to be abandoned in five years and replaced in orbit by privately operated labs.

Bitcoin investor buys an entire SpaceX flight for the ultimate polar adventure,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A bitcoin investor who bought a SpaceX flight for himself and three polar explorers blasted off Monday night on the first rocket ride to carry people over the North and South poles. Chun Wang, a Chinese-born entrepreneur, hurtled into orbit from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. SpaceXs Falcon rocket steered southward over the Atlantic, putting the space tourists on a path never flown before in 64 years of human spaceflight. Wang wont say how much he paid Elon Musks SpaceX for the 3 -day ultimate polar adventure.  The first leg of their flight  from Florida to the South Pole  took barely a half-hour. From the targeted altitude of some 270 miles (440 kilometers), their fully automated capsule will circle the globe in roughly 1  hours including 46 minutes to fly from pole to pole. Enjoy the views of the poles. Send us some pictures, SpaceX Launch Control radioed once the capsule reached orbit. Wang has already visited the polar regions in person and wants to view them from space. The trip is also about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge, he said ahead of the flight. Now a citizen of Malta, he took along three guests: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips. Mikkelsen, the first Norwegian bound for space, has flown over the poles before, but at a much lower altitude. She was part of the 2019 record-breaking mission that circumnavigated the world via the poles in a Gulfstream jet to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrins moon landing. 
        
     The crew plans two dozen experiments  including taking the first human X-rays in space  and brought along more cameras than usual to document their journey called Fram2 after the Norwegian polar research ship from more than a century ago.  Until now, no space traveler had ventured beyond 65 degrees north and south latitude, just shy of the Arctic and Antarctic circles. The first woman in space, the Soviet Unions Valentina Tereshkova, set that mark in 1963. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and other pioneering cosmonauts came almost as close, as did NASA shuttle astronauts in 1990.  A polar orbit is ideal for climate and Earth-mapping satellites as well as spy satellites. Thats because a spacecraft can observe the entire world each day, circling Earth from pole to pole as it rotates below. Geir Klover, director of the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway, where the original polar ship is on display, hopes the trip will draw more attention to climate change and the melting polar caps. He lent the crew a tiny piece of the ships wooden deck that bears the signature of Oscar Wisting, who with Roald Amundsen in the early 1900s became the first to reach both poles. Wang pitched the idea of a polar flight to SpaceX in 2023, two years after U.S. tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman made the first of two chartered flights with Musks company. Isaacman is now in the running for NASAs top job. SpaceXs Kiko Dontchev said late last week that the company is continually refining its training so normal people without traditional aerospace backgrounds can hop in a capsule ... and be calm about it. Wang and his crew view the polar flight like camping in the wild and embrace the challenge.  Spaceflight is becoming increasingly routine and, honestly, Im happy to see that, Wang said via X last week. Wang said hes been counting up his flights since his first one in 2002, flying on planes, helicopters and hot air balloons in his quest to visit every country. So far, hes visited more than half. He arranged it so that liftoff would mark his 1,000th flight.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASAs Webb telescope captures photos of the asteroid that wont hit Earth in 2032,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Webb Space Telescope has captured pictures of the asteroid that caused a stir earlier this year when it topped Earths hit list.  Discovered late last year, the asteroid 2024 YR4 was predicted at one point to have a 3% chance of smacking Earth in 2032. Additional observations prompted scientists to reduce the threat to virtually zero, where it remains. But theres a slight chance it could hit the moon then. The asteroid swings our way every four years. NASA and the European Space Agency released the photos  showing the asteroid as a fuzzy dot  on Wednesday. Webb confirm the asteroid is nearly 200 feet (60 meters) across, or about the height of a 15-story building, according to the two space agencies. Its the smallest object ever observed by the observatory, the biggest and most powerful ever sent into space. Johns Hopkins University astronomer Andrew Rivkin said the observations by Webb served as invaluable practice for other asteroids that may threaten us down the road. Ground telescopes also have tracked this particular space rock over the past few months. All this gives us a window to understand what other objects the size of 2024 YR4 are like, including the next one that might be heading our way, Rivkin, who helped with the observations, said in a statement. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Four space tourists return to Earth after a private flight over the poles,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four space tourists who orbited the north and south poles returned to Earth on Friday, splashing down in the Pacific to end their privately funded polar tour. Bitcoin investor Chun Wang chartered a SpaceX flight for himself and three others in a Dragon capsule that was outfitted with a domed window that provided 360-degree views of the polar caps and everything in between. Wang declined to say how much he paid for the 3 1/2-day trip.  The quartet, who rocketed from NASAs Kennedy Space Center on Monday night, returned off the Southern California coast. It was the first human spaceflight to circle the globe above the poles and the first Pacific splashdown for a space crew in 50 years.  The Chinese-born Wang, now a citizen of Malta, invited Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips, all of whom shared stunning vistas during their voyage.  It is so epic because it is another kind of desert, so it just goes on and on and on all the way, Rogge said in a video posted by Wang on X while gazing down from orbit. Mikkelsen packed the capsule with camera equipment and spent much of her time behind the lens. All four suffered from space motion sickness after reaching orbit, according to Wang. But by the time they woke up on day two, they felt fine and cranked open the window cover right above the South Pole, he said via X. 
        
     Besides documenting the poles from 270 miles (430 kilometers) up, Wang and his crew took the first medical X-rays in space as part of a test and conducted two dozen other science experiments. They named their trip Fram2 after the Norwegian sailing ship that carried explorers to the poles more than a century ago. A bit of the original ships wooden deck accompanied the crew to space. Their medical tests continued at splashdown. All four got out of the capsule on their own, heaving bags of equipment so researchers could see how steady returning space crews are on their feet. They pumped their fists in jubilation. SpaceX said its decision to switch splashdown sites from Florida beginning with this flight was based on safety. The company said Pacific splashdowns will ensure that any surviving pieces of the trunk  jettisoned near flights end  falls into the ocean. The last people to return from space to the Pacific were the three NASA astronauts assigned to the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A day at Uranus just got 28 seconds longer,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A day at Uranus just got a little longer.  Scientists reported Monday that observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have confirmed it takes Uranus 17 hours, 14 minutes and 52 seconds to complete a full rotation. Thats 28 seconds longer than estimates by NASAs Voyager 2 spacecraft in the 1980s.  A French-led team studied a decades worth of aurora observations at the ice giant to track its magnetic poles. That long-term tracking provided a more precise rotation period for Uranus, the seventh planet from the sun. From that distance, it takes about 84 Earth years for Uranus to orbit the sun.

Scientists genetically engineer wolves with white hair and muscular jaws like the extinct dire wolf,"Three genetically engineered wolves that may resemble extinct dire wolves are trotting, sleeping and howling in an undisclosed secure location in the U.S., according to the company that aims to bring back lost species.  The wolf pups, which range in age from three to six months old, have long white hair, muscular jaws and already weigh in at around 80 pounds  on track to reach 140 pounds at maturity, researchers at Colossal Biosciences reported Monday.  Dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10,000 years old, are much larger than gray wolves, their closest living relatives today.  Independent scientists said this latest effort doesnt mean dire wolves are coming back to North American grasslands any time soon.  All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else"" not fully revive extinct species, said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who was not involved in the research.  Colossal scientists learned about specific traits that dire wolves possessed by examining ancient DNA from fossils. The researchers studied a 13,000 year-old dire wolf tooth unearthed in Ohio and a 72,000 year-old skull fragment found in Idaho, both part of natural history museum collections.  Then the scientists took blood cells from a living gray wolf and used CRISPR to genetically modify them in 20 different sites, said Colossals chief scientist Beth Shapiro. They transferred that genetic material to an egg cell from a domestic dog. When ready, embryos were transferred to surrogates, also domestic dogs, and 62 days later the genetically engineered pups were born. 
        
     Colossal has previously announced similar projects to genetically alter cells from living species to create animals resembling extinct woolly mammoths, dodos and others.  Though the pups may physically resemble young dire wolves, what they will probably never learn is the finishing move of how to kill a giant elk or a big deer, because they wont have opportunities to watch and learn from wild dire wolf parents, said Colossals chief animal care expert Matt James.  Colossal also reported today that it had cloned four red wolves using blood drawn from wild wolves of the southeastern U.S.'s critically endangered red wolf population. The aim is to bring more genetic diversity into the small population of captive red wolves, which scientists are using to breed and help save the species. This technology may have broader application for conservation of other species because its less invasive than other techniques to clone animals, said Christopher Preston, a wildlife expert at the University of Montana who was not involved in the research. But it still requires a wild wolf to be sedated for a blood draw and thats no simple feat, he added. Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said the team met with officials from the U.S. Interior Department in late March about the project. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum praised the work on X on Monday as a thrilling new era of scientific wonder even as outside scientists said there are limitations to restoring the past.

New observations show the asteroid that wont hit Earth resembles a spinning hockey puck,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The asteroid that once had a small chance of striking Earth and now might slam into the moon resembles a spinning hockey puck, scientists said Tuesday. A team of astronomers used the Gemini South Observatory in Chile to observe asteroid 2024 YR4 in multiple wavelengths as it zoomed away from Earth in February, barely 1 1/2 months after its discovery. They created a 3D image of it based on their findings.  The nearly 200 foot (60-meter) asteroid looks more like a flat disk  or not-quite-round hockey puck  than a potato. It also has a rapid rotation rate of about once every 20 minutes. This find was rather unexpected since most asteroids are thought to be shaped like potatoes or toy tops rather than flat disks, the research team lead, Bryce Bolin from Eureka Scientific said in a statement. Scientists said it most likely originated in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and is rich in silicates. At one point earlier this year, NASA and the European Space Agency put the odds of the asteroid striking Earth in 2032 at 3%. Its now down to virtually zero for the next century, but theres a 3.8% chance it could strike the moon instead. Even if that happens, NASA assures the moons orbit will not be altered. The asteroid - which swings our way every four years  will be too far away by next week for ground telescopes to see. The Webb Space Telescope will take another look later this month or next. 
        
     Scientists consider all this good practice for when a potentially killer asteroid heads our way. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A micromoon will grace the night skies this weekend,"NEW YORK (AP)  Theres a micromoon coming up.  The full moon will look slightly smaller and dimmer on Saturday night. But the change may be tricky to spot with the naked eye. Its a very subtle difference, said astrophysicist Alain Brizard from Saint Michaels College in Vermont.  The phenomenon happens when the moon is at a point farthest away from Earth. Its opposite to a supermoon, where the moon swings closer to Earth and looks a bit larger.  To see the micromoon, go outside and look up in an area with a clear view of the moon.  Supermoons and micromoons happen a few times a year as the moons full phase syncs up with its orbit.  Another micromoon is on tap for May. Three supermoons will be visible this year in October, November and December.  A more colorful lunar event took place in March when a total eclipse turned the moon coppery red. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Billionaire spacewalker highlights Mars trip for astronauts in his bid to become NASAs next chief,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The nominee for NASAs top job, billionaire spacewalker Jared Isaacman, outlined his vision for space exploration on Wednesday that prioritizes sending astronauts to Mars without giving up on the moon. Its imperative that we do both, Isaacman told senators. President Donald Trump nominated Isaacman to become NASAs 15th administrator late last year. If confirmed, the tech entrepreneur would become the youngest person to lead the space agency and among only a handful of administrators to have actually rocketed into orbit. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee gathered in Washington for the nomination hearing. Besides Isaacman, nine other experienced space travelers were in the audience, including NASAs next moon crew and passengers who flew on private spaceflights with him.  Isaacman assured the senators that he would not give up on the moon and wants the U.S. to beat China in landing astronauts there.  I didnt say we shouldnt go to the moon, he said. Whats taking so long to get back to the moon and why does it cost so much money? I absolutely want to see us return to the moon. Moon and Mars expeditions can be developed in parallel. I dont think these are either-or, he added. NASA can afford both under current funding, he said, without elaborating. Isaacman, 42, has already flown in space twice, buying his own trips with SpaceX, and performed the worlds first private spacewalk last September. An experienced jet pilot, he made his fortune with a payment processing company he started as a high school dropout in his parents basement, now called Shift4. 
        
     He acknowledged in his testimony that he is not a typical nominee for this position. I have been relatively apolitical; I am not a scientist and I never worked at NASA, he said. I do not think these are weaknesses. The space agency and others were anxious to hear Isaacmans stand on the moon and Mars for human exploration, given his close association with SpaceXs Elon Musk. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the committees chairman, urged the need to stay the course with NASAs plans to return astronauts to the moon.  An extreme shift in priorities at this stage would almost certainly mean a red moon, ceding ground to China for generations to come, Cruz said. NASA has been pitching the moon as the next logical step for astronauts for years. The Artemis program aims to send a crew around the moon next year and land astronauts near the moons south pole as early as 2027. Lunar bases are planned this time around, not just quick visits like the ones during NASAs Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Artemis has been slow going and expensive, especially for NASAs Space Launch System rocket. Its only blasted off once so far  in 2022 without a crew. Musk favors Mars as a destination, as he ramps up more test flights out of Texas for Starship, the worlds biggest and most powerful rocket. By making Starship reusable, he intends to dramatically lower costs of getting people and equipment to the red planet. NASA has chosen Starship for its first two astronaut landings on the moon under Artemis, named after Apollos twin sister in Greek mythology. When asked if Musk has contacted him since his nomination about how to manage NASA, Isaacman replied, not at all. Isaacman then was questioned how he would protect against undue influence from Musk, given SpaceXs billions of dollars worth of contracts with NASA. I absolutely want to be clear, Isaacman said. My loyalty is to this nation, the space agency and their world-changing mission. Isaacman said he supports continuing the International Space Station through 2030, as currently planned by NASA. Musk suggested earlier this year that the space station should be dumped as soon as possible in order to focus on Mars.  When pressed by senators again before the hearing ended, Isaacman said the space station should keep going until its replaced by private outposts in orbit.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Soil from the moons far side suggests drier conditions than the side facing Earth,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Soil and rocks returned from the moons mysterious far side suggest it may be drier than the side constantly facing Earth, Chinese scientists reported Wednesday. But they cautioned more samples are needed for a clearer picture. A better understanding of the abundance of water in the lunar mantle can help explain how the moon evolved, the researchers noted. But it could also be all the more reason for astronauts to stick close to the near side of the moon as currently planned. China became the first country to land on the moons far side last year. The Change 6 spacecraft scooped up the volcanic rock and dirt from the ancient, sprawling South Pole-Aitken basin, one of the largest impact craters in the solar system. The Chinese Academy of Sciences Sen Hu said he and his team received 5 grams of soil samples, then selected 578 particles for detailed analysis using electron microscopes. They estimated the water abundance at less than 1.5 micrograms per gram, on the dry end of whats been found in samples gathered over past decades from the moons near side. Measurements on samples from the near side have ranged between 1 microgram and 200 micrograms per gram. Given the limited sampling, its uncertain how widespread this dry condition might be, the scientists noted in their study published in the journal Nature. More far side samples are required for testing and further unraveling how much water there is, Hu said in an email. 
        
     Its possible the impact that created this basin may have blasted water elements to the near side, leaving the far side depleted. Another possibility is that the vertical distribution of water could be different between the two hemispheres. Even if confirmed, the findings shouldnt drastically alter NASAs plans to send astronauts to the moons south polar region, where permanently shadowed craters are believed to hold massive amounts of ice. This frozen water could be used for drinking, cooking and making rocket fuel.  NASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, which put 12 men on the moon from 1969 through 1972. That would be followed by a landing near the lunar south pole by astronauts no earlier than 2027. China is seeking its own astronaut moon landing by 2030. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Ancient jawbone from Taiwan belongs to a mysterious group of human ancestors, scientists say","An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.  Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.   Denisovan fossils are very scarce, with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan. So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans. The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.  The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwans National Museum of Natural Science. This photo provided by researchers in April 2025 shows the coast of Taiwans Penghu Islands at low tide in January 2024, and how the shallow sea extends out, near where a fossil jawbone was found in the Penghu Channel. (Takumi Tsutaya via AP) This photo provided by researchers in April 2025 shows the coast of Taiwans Penghu Islands at low tide in January 2024, and how the shallow sea extends out, near where a fossil jawbone was found in the Penghu Channel. (Takumi Tsutaya via AP) Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery. The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.  
        
     An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.  While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institutions Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan. Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for a fantastic job of recovering some proteins. But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.  At one time, at least three human ancestor groups  Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens  coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say. We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Blue Origin launches an all-female celebrity crew with Katy Perry, Gayle King and Lauren Sanchez","Jeff Bezos Blue Origin launched his fiancee Lauren Sanchez into space Monday with an all-female celebrity crew that included Katy Perry and Gayle King. It was the latest wave in space tourism, where more of the rich and famous than ever before  or lucky and well-connected  can enter the zero-gravity realm traditionally dominated by professional astronauts. This image provided by Blue Origin shows, first row, seated, from left: Lauren Sanchez and Kerianne Flynn and standing in back from left: Amanda Nguyen, Katy Perry, Gayle King and Aisha Bowe in West Texas.

(Blue Origin via AP) The New Shepard rocket blasted off on the quick up-and-down trip from West Texas. The fringes of space beckoned 66 miles (107 kilometers) up and provided a few precious minutes of weightlessness. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, invited the others along for the 10-minute, fully automated flight, packing on the star power with singer-songwriter Perry and CBS Mornings co-host King. Moved by the views of Earth below, Perry said she couldnt resist singing What a Wonderful World in space. Also sharing the ride were film producer Kerianne Flynn; Aisha Bowe, a former NASA engineer who started her own companies to promote science education; and Amanda Nguyen, a scientist who studied planets around other stars and now advocates for survivors of sexual violence.  This combination of 2025 file photos shows, from left, Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry and Gayle King.

(Photos by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid what. The trip came two months before Sanchez and Bezos marry in Venice. It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon. Bezos strapped in for Blue Origins first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad.  
        
     The celebrity launch was the nations first spaceflight where women filled each seat. The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963. Thats when Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet.  Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15% of the more than 700 people who have traveled into space. Sanchez said she deliberately chose women to launch with her, each of them eager to inspire both the young and old to dream big, and even commissioned special flight suits.

(Blue Origin via AP) This image taken from video provided by Blue Origin shows the New Shepard rocket blasting off in West Texas, Monday, April 14, 2025. (Blue Origin via AP) The launch brought out VIPs to West Texas including Oprah Winfrey; Kris Jenner and other members of the Kardashian family; former NASA astronaut Mae Jemison, who became the first Black woman in space in 1992; and several women who previously have flown on private flights. Winfrey, a close friend of King, wiped away tears when the capsule reached space and the passengers were heard marveling at the moon and shouting with joy.  As the women were buckling up for the ride back, Perry broke into song. Despite urging by her crewmates, she resisted singing Roar or her other tunes and instead chose What a Wonderful World.  Its not about me. Its not about singing my songs, Perry said following the flight. Its about a collective energy in there. Its about us. At a news conference later, she stressed, We werent just taking up space. We were making space for the future. Bezos opened the capsules hatch minutes after touchdown, embracing Sanchez, the first one out. As they emerged, Perry and King kneeled and kissed the ground. Oh my God, that was amazing, said King, who considers herself an anxious airplane flyer. Three hours later, Sanchez said she was still trying to process everything. Profound is like the one word I would use, she said.  This wasnt the first Blue Origin launch with marquee names. Star Trek actor William Shatner caught a lift to space with Blue Origin in 2021 at age 90, soon after Bezos inaugural trip. He was followed by former New York Giants defensive end and TV host Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, for whom the rocket is named. Two aviation pioneers who missed out on space when they were younger  Wally Funk and Ed Dwight  also rocketed away at ages 82 and 90, respectively. Most of Blue Origins passengers  58 counting the latest launch  have been business or science types, TV hosts or YouTubers. Ticket prices are not disclosed.

Two decades later, a Russian actress filmed aboard the International Space Station.  Elon Musks SpaceX also sells multi-day trips to private customers. SpaceXs first client to fly, billionaire tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman already has launched twice and performed the first private spacewalk.

A strong solar storm heads to Earth. Heres what to know about northern lights,"NEW YORK (AP)  A strong solar storm headed to Earth could produce colorful aurora displays across more U.S. states than usual Tuesday night.  The sun earlier this week burped out huge bursts of energy called coronal mass ejections, leading space weather forecasters to issue a geomagnetic storm watch.  Northern lights were forecast in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Parts of northern Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania may also get a view. The strength of the light show will depend on how Earths magnetic field interacts with the solar bursts, said Shawn Dahl at NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center. Heres what to know about auroras and how to spot them. The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come. This is going to kind of continue off and on throughout the year, Dahl said. Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City. 
        
     Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earths atmosphere.  Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.  Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications. The suns active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak wont be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.  When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earths magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit. In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam. Space weather experts arent able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth. Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app. Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. NASAs Kelly Korreck recommended skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely.  Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that arent visible to the naked eye. Enjoy it, said Korreck. Its this great show ... from the sun to you. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Tatooine-like planet outside the solar system may orbit two failed stars, scientists say","NEW YORK (AP)  A new Tatooine-like planet outside the solar system may orbit two failed stars, scientists reported Wednesday.  Located about 120 light years away, the exoplanet appears to take an unusual path around two brown dwarfs, whipping around at a right angle. Brown dwarfs are sometimes called failed stars because theyre lighter than stars, but heavier than gas giant planets. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles. The brown dwarf pair was first spotted years ago. Scientists noticed that the twins eclipse each other so one is always partly blocked when seen from Earth.  In a new analysis, researchers found that the brown dwarfs motion was changing  a quirk thats less likely to happen if they circled each other on their own. The research was published in the journal Science Advances. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports a planet similar to one in the Star Wars movie may have been discovered. Scientists know of over a dozen planets that orbit two stars like the fictional Star Wars scorching desert planet Tatooine with double sunsets that Luke Skywalker calls home.  The new planets odd orbit sets it apart. But it hasnt been directly spied, and scientists say more research is needed to be sure its out there and figure out its mass and orbit. I wouldnt bet my life that the planet exists yet, said Simon Albrecht, an astrophysicist with Aarhus University who had no role in the new study. Probing these wacky celestial bodies can help us understand how conditions beyond our solar system may yield planets vastly different from our own, said study author Thomas Baycroft with the University of Birmingham.

A colossal squid is caught on camera for the first time in the deep sea,"A colossal squid has been caught on camera for the first time in the deep sea by an international team of researchers steering a remotely operated submersible.  The sighting was announced Tuesday by the Schmidt Ocean Institute.  The squid filmed was a juvenile about 1 foot (30 centimeters) in length at a depth of 1,968 feet (600 meters) in the South Atlantic Ocean. Full-grown adult colossal squids, which scientists have uncovered from the bellies of whales and seabirds, can reach lengths up to 23 feet (7 meters)  almost the size of a small fire truck. The squid was spied last month near the South Sandwich Islands during an expedition to search for new sea life. Researchers waited to verify the species identification with other independent scientists before releasing the footage.  I really love that we have seen a young colossal squid first. This animal is so beautiful, said Kat Bolstad, a squid researcher at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, who helped confirm it.  Researchers are testing different cameras in hopes of catching an adult colossal squid, Bolstad said.  The young squid is almost entirely transparent, with thin arms. As adults, the squids lose this glassy appearance and become an opaque dark red or purple.

"Endangered sea turtle populations show signs of recovery in more than half the world, survey finds","WASHINGTON (AP)  Endangered sea turtles show signs of recovery in a majority of places where theyre found worldwide, according to a new global survey released Thursday.  Many of the turtle populations have come back, though some havent, said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. Overall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.  The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development and climate change to the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found. But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species.  Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.  All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.  Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal  with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said. 
        
     Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found. By ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle Mara Early Capistrn, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries. Sea turtles were protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, and Mexico banned all captures of sea turtles in 1990. But it took a few decades for the results of these actions  alongside efforts to protect nesting beaches and reduce accidental bycatch in fishing  to show up in population trends, she said. Around the world, the problem of sea turtles dying after accidentally becoming entangled in fishing gear remains a major threat, said Wallace. New technologies are being developed to spare turtles, but they must be accepted and used regularly by diverse fishing communities to be effective, he added. The survey was published in the journal Endangered Species Research and is the first update in more than a decade.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

State parks in Florida appear off-limits to development as lawmakers react to outcry,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP)  State parks would be protected from pickleball courts, golf courses and hotel development under a bill passed unanimously by the Florida House on Thursday in response to last summers statewide outcry over plans for these kinds of projects. The bill now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis for final approval, and his office hasnt said if hell sign it. The Republican governor distanced himself from the proposal following the backlash, saying he never saw or approved plans to allow resorts and sports facilities on state park land. DeSantis leads and appoints the heads of all state agencies.  The issue created a dilemma for Republican lawmakers who have traditionally defended the governors administration, and increased scrutiny of DeSantis record on environmental conservation.  Protections for state parks are reflected loud and clear in the bill, said state Rep. John Snyder.  Weve put real plans in place to make sure that, for generations to come, our state parks will be preserved, said Snyder, who represents a district about an hour north of Palm Beach. He noted the parks are enjoyed by millions of residents and tourists alike. The bill doesnt ban all types of development. But any projects must be conservation-based recreational uses that support things like hiking, swimming, horseback riding, boating, studying nature and other similar activities, according to a House staff analysis. 
        
     Snyder said the bills language was strengthened by an amendment proposed in the Senate, which also added a name change for a state park in Tallahassee. The public first got wind that DeSantis environmental agency was looking for recreational development plans in state parks when the Great Outdoors Initiative was leaked last August. Hundreds of people protested at parks and the states environmental protection headquarters, waving signs like Parks Over Profit and Save Dont Pave. Before the month was over, the governor said the Department of Environmental Protections plans were going back to the drawing board.  The environment secretary at the time, Shawn Hamilton, eventually stepped down after facing intensified scrutiny and bipartisan criticism of the initiative. In November, DeSantis appointed a new head of the agency, Alexis Lambert.",https://apnews.com/article/florida-state-parks-development-desantis-efa876a2540dd4291899aa53f5d56991,science
"Hope floats in the Amazon as Bacuri, a young manatee, fights for survival","CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil (AP)  Deep in silence, as if under a spell, children watch intently as Bacuri, a young Amazonian manatee, glides around a small plastic pool. When he surfaces for air, some of them exchange wide smiles. The soft rustle of rainforest leaves punctuated by bird song adds to the magic of the moment. The children from riverside communities traveled for hours by boat just to meet Bacuri at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, Brazils oldest research institute in the Amazon. Despite their endangered status, manatees are still hunted and their meat illegally sold, and they are increasingly threatened by climate change.

(AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) The Amazonian manatee is the regions largest mammal but is rarely seen, much less up close. The reasons for this are twofold: The manatee has acute hearing and will vanish into the murky water at the slightest sound; and its population has dwindled after being overhunted for hundreds of years, mostly for its tough hides that were exported to Europe and Central America.  To help the manatee population recover, several institutions are rescuing orphaned manatee calves, rehabilitating them and reintroducing them to the wild.

(AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) Bacuri weighed just 22 pounds (10 kilograms)  a fraction of the more than 900 pounds (400 kilograms) of an adult manatee  when he was rescued and taken to the federally protected Caxiuana National Forest. He was named after the local community that found him. Two years and several thousand milk bottles later, Bacuri has grown to about 130 pounds (60 kilos).  
        
     Three institutions are responsible for his care. The Goeldi Museum provides facilities and educates nearby communities. The federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation assigns two staffers for 15-day shifts to feed Bacuri three bottles of milk a day as well as chopped beets and carrots, and clean the pool every 48 hours. The nonprofit Instituto Bicho dAgua  meaning institute of water animals in Portuguese  oversees veterinary care, dietary planning and caregiver training.

(AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) During their visit, the children learn that female manatees are pregnant for about a year then nurse their young for two more, feeding them from nipples behind their front flippers  the manatee equivalent of armpits. This long reproductive cycle is one reason the manatee population has not recovered from the commercial hunting that persisted until the mid-20th century.  They also learn the species is endangered and that they are the ones who must protect it.  You are the main guardians, biologist Tatyanna Maricha, head of the Ferreira Penna scientific base, tells the children, who spend the rest of the day drawing and making Play-Doh models of Bacuri.

(AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) With its auditorium, dormitories, observation towers, cafeteria and laboratories, the research station  two hours by speedboat from Portel, the nearest city  stands in stark contrast to nearby communities comprising clusters of wooden houses on stilts where families rely on cassava farming, fishing and harvesting aa berries. School field trips and community outreach aim to narrow the gap.  Caxiuana is their home, Maricha told The Associated Press. We cant just come here and do things without their consent. Local knowledge will play a key role when Bacuri is finally released. He is the only manatee calf under care at Caxiuana. Once he has fully transitioned to a plant-based diet, hell spend time in a river enclosure before his release. That site will be selected based on where residents say wild manatees feed and pass through. If all goes as planned, Bacuri will be the first manatee released in the Caxiuana area. Two other calves rescued in poor health died in captivity, a sadly common outcome. While subsistence hunting isnt a major threat to the species, some fishermen still sell manatee meat illegally in nearby towns. Brazil banned hunting of all wild animals in 1967, with two exceptions: Indigenous peoples are allowed to hunt, and others can kill a wild animal to satisfy the hunger of the hunter or his family.

(AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) Coral, a rescued manatee, swims in a pool at the Bicho dAgua project facilities in Castanhal, Brazil, Sunday, March 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Jorge Saenz) The threat of hunters has become harder to manage due to climate change, said Miriam Marmontel, a senior researcher at the Mamirau Institute for Sustainable Development, hundreds of miles (kilometers) upstream along the Amazon River.  Dozens of dolphins died near Mamiraua in 2023, likely due to soaring water temperatures during a historic drought. Manatees avoided mass mortality then because they typically inhabit deep pools during the dry season, but recent droughts have dramatically reduced the water level, making manatees more vulnerable to poachers.  As climate change accelerates, manatees may begin to suffer from heat stress too, Marmontel said. They also have a thermal limit, and eventually it may be crossed. Thats why reintroduction efforts are so important.  Around 60 rescued manatees are being cared for across the state of Para, where Caxiuana is located. Bicho dAgua is caring for four in partnership with the Federal University of Para and Brazils environmental agency. One of the four, named Coral, was found near Obidos and airlifted 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to the institutes facility in Castanhal. She arrived dehydrated and with severe skin burns, likely from sun exposure. The population has declined so much that every hunted animal impacts the species, Renata Emin, president of Bicho dAgua, told AP. Thats why any effort matters, not just because one individual may return to the wild and help rebuild the population but because of the community and government engagement it inspires.

Heres a look at moon landing hits and misses,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Landing a spacecraft on the moon has long been a series of hits and misses. The latest casualty came this week after Intuitive Machines put another lander sideways on the moon through a NASA-sponsored program. Within 24 hours, the landers batteries were dead and the mission was over.  Last years mission by Intuitive Machines lasted a little longer. Despite hampered operations, it put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since the end of the Apollo program. Another U.S. company  Firefly Aerospace  earlier this week added its lunar lander to the win list, becoming the first private entity to pull off a fully successful moon landing. Both Texas businesses are part of NASAs effort to support commercial deliveries to the moon ahead of astronaut missions later this decade.  The moon is littered with wreckage from failed landings over the years. A rundown on the moons winners and losers: The Soviet Unions Luna 9 successfully touches down on the moon in 1966, after its predecessors crash or miss the moon altogether. The U.S. follows four months later with Surveyor 1. Both countries achieve more robotic landings, as the race heats up to land men. NASA clinches the space race with the Soviets in 1969 with a moon landing by Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Twelve astronauts explore the surface over six missions, before the program ends with Apollo 17 in 1972. Still the only country to send humans to the moon, the U.S. hopes to return crews to the surface by the end of 2026 or so, a year after a lunar fly-around by astronauts.  
        
     China, in 2013, becomes the third country to successfully land on the moon, delivering a rover named Yutu, Chinese for jade rabbit. China follows with the Yutu-2 rover in 2019, this time touching down on the moons unexplored far side  an impressive first. A sample return mission on the moons near side in 2020 yields nearly 4 pounds (1.7 kilograms) of lunar rocks and dirt. Another sample return mission from the far side in 2024 delivers rocks and soil from the less explored part of the moon . Seen as NASAs biggest moon rival, China aims to put its astronauts on the moon by 2030. In 2023, Russia tries for its first moon landing in nearly a half-century, but the Luna 25 spacecraft smashes into the moon. The countrys previous lander  1976s Luna 24  not only landed, but returned moon rocks to Earth. After its first lander slams into the moon in 2019, India regroups and launches Chandrayaan-3 (Hindi for moon craft) in 2023. The craft successfully touches down, making India the fourth country to score a lunar landing. The win comes just four days after Russias crash-landing. Japan becomes the fifth country to land successfully on the moon, with its spacecraft touching down in January. The craft lands on the wrong side, compromising its ability to generate solar power, but manages to crank out pictures and science before falling silent when the long lunar night sets in. A privately funded lander from Israel, named Beresheet, Hebrew for in the beginning, crashes into the moon in 2019. A Japanese entrepreneurs company, ispace, launches a lunar lander in 2023, but it, too, wrecks.  Intuitive Machines becomes the first private outfit to achieve a safe moon landing. The lander tipped over on its side in 2024, but worked briefly with limited communications. Another U.S. company  Astrobotic Technology  tried to send a lander to the moon the same year, but had to give up because of a fuel leak, eventually returning to Earth and burning up over the Pacific.  This years private rush to the moon kicked off with Firefly nailing its landing by Blue Ghost, delivering experiments for NASA. Next came Intuitive Machines second toppled landing. One more commercial landing looms: Japans ispace company aims to land on June 5, after sharing a rocket ride from Florida with Blue Ghost in January. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Last-minute problems with SpaceXs mega rocket Starship forces delay of latest test flight,"Last-minute problems forced a launch delay Monday for SpaceXs mega rocket Starship, attempting a comeback following an explosion on the last test flight.  The countdown got down to the 40-second mark, but it was halted because of issues with the 403-foot (123-meter) rocket, the worlds largest and most powerful.  Starship was supposed to blast off from the southern tip of Texas with four mock satellites on board for a space-skimming test flight. If the problems can be fixed quickly, another launch attempt could come Tuesday, according to SpaceX.  The last Starship demo ended in an explosion over the Atlantic in January, with flaming debris streaming over the Turks and Caicos. Starship has already been booked by NASA for astronaut moon landings later this decade. SpaceXs Elon Musk intends to use the mammoth rockets to settle Mars. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Scientists genetically engineer mice with thick hair like the extinct woolly mammoth,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts  genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth. Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.  Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically engineer them into living animals, said CEO Ben Lamm.  Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.  Youre not actually resurrecting anything  youre not bringing back the ancient past, said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research. On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the Colossal woolly mouse. Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.  
        
     The feat is technologically pretty cool, said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.  Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR make it a lot more efficient and easier, said Lynch. The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are present already in some living mice, said Colossals chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but we put them all together in a single mouse. They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance  a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe. Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.

(Colossal Biosciences via AP) In this Feb 2025 photo provided by Colossal Biosciences are genetically edited mice with long, thick, woolly hair at a lab in Dallas, Texas. (Colossal Biosciences via AP) However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be a lot of processes and red tape before any plan can move forward, said Colossals Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.  Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of de-extinction. You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but its not bringing back a woolly mammoth. Its changing an Asian elephant, said University of Montanas Preston.  Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research. Telugu said he was impressed by Colossals technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target. The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies. Its part of how we monetize our business, said Lamm. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASAs two stuck astronauts are finally closing in on their return to Earth after 9 months in space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs two stuck astronauts are just a few weeks away from finally returning to Earth after nine months in space. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have to wait until their replacements arrive at the International Space Station next week before they can check out later this month. Theyll be joined on their SpaceX ride home by two astronauts who launched by themselves in September alongside two empty seats. During a news conference Tuesday, Wilmore said that while politics is part of life, it did not play into his and Williams return, moved up a couple weeks thanks to a change in SpaceX capsules. President Donald Trump and SpaceXs Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts return, blaming the previous administration. But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musks recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASAs projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab. This place is ticking. Its just really amazing, so I would say were actually in our prime right now, said Williams, a three-time space station resident. I would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits. Williams said she cant wait to be reunited with her Labrador retrievers. The hardest part about the unexpected extended stay, she added, was the wait by their families back home. 
        
     Its been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us, she said. Were here. We have a mission. Were just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because were up in space and its a lot of fun. Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeings new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty. Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.  Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASAs Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agencys Alexander Gorbunov. Wilmore and Williams  retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers  have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January. They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. Thats fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit. Were just Butch and Suni, Williams said. Everybody knows who we are by now. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Ancient humans made tools from animal bones 1.5 million years ago,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago.  A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzanias Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.  The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans had rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought, incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research. The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council. The bone tools were probably used as a hand axe  a handheld blade thats not mounted on a stick  for butchering dead animals, he said. Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. We dont believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging, he said. 
        
     Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship. The uniform selection of the bones  large and heavy leg bones from specific animals  and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said Mrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.  The bones show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals  ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added. The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago. At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonians Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study. The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. It could have been any of these three, but its almost impossible to know which one, said Pobiner. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASA powers down two instruments on twin Voyager spacecraft to save power,"NEW YORK (AP)  NASA is switching off two science instruments on its long-running twin Voyager spacecraft to save power. The space agency said Wednesday an instrument on Voyager 2 that measures charged particles and cosmic rays will shut off later this month. Last week, NASA powered down an instrument on Voyager 1 designed to study cosmic rays.  The energy-saving moves were necessary to extend their missions, Voyager project manager Suzanne Dodd at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a statement.  The twin spacecraft launched in 1977 and are currently in interstellar space, or the space between stars. Voyager 1 discovered a thin ring around Jupiter and several of Saturns moons, and Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to visit Uranus and Neptune.  Each spacecraft still has three instruments apiece to study the suns protective bubble and the swath of space beyond. Voyager 1 is over 15 billion miles (24.14 billion kilometers) from Earth and Voyager 2 is over 13 billion miles (20.92 billion kilometers) away. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Private lunar lander may have fallen over while touching down near the moons south pole,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A privately owned lunar lander touched down on the moon with a drill, drone and rovers for NASA and other customers Thursday, but quickly ran into trouble and may have fallen over.  Intuitive Machines said it was uncertain whether its Athena lander was upright near the moons south pole  standing 15 feet (4.7 meters) tall  or lying sideways like its first spacecraft from a year ago. Controllers rushed to turn off some of the landers equipment to conserve power while trying to determine what went wrong. It was the second moon landing this week by a Texas company under NASAs commercial lunar delivery program. Sundays touchdown was a complete success. In this undated image released by Intuitive Machines, Intuitive Machines newest lunar lander is displayed. (Intuitive Machines via AP) In this undated image released by Intuitive Machines, Intuitive Machines newest lunar lander is displayed. (Intuitive Machines via AP) Intuitive Machines newest Athena lander dropped out of lunar orbit as planned. The hourlong descent appeared to go well until the final approach when the laser navigation system began acting up. It took a while for Mission Control to confirm touchdown. Were on the surface, reported mission director and co-founder Tim Crain. A few minutes later, he repeated, It looks like were down ... We are working to evaluate exactly what our orientation is on the surface.  Hours after the landing, Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus there was conflicting data about how Athena landed and whether it was on its side. The lander was near the intended target site, but a sweep by NASAs Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in the coming days will confirm its position and orientation, he said.  
        
     Launched last week, Athena was communicating with controllers more than 230,000 miles (375,000 kilometers) away and generating solar power, officials said. Mission managers worked to salvage the mission to see whether the drill can be turned on and the drone can be deployed to hop into a crater.  Obviously, without knowing the exact orientation of the lander, its hard to say exactly what science we will and will not be able to do, said NASAs top science officer Nicky Fox. Intuitive Machines last year put the U.S. back on the moon despite its lander tipping on its side.  On Sunday, Firefly Aerospace became the first private entity to achieve complete success with its Blue Ghost lunar lander, on the northeastern edge of the near side of the moon. A vacuum already has collected lunar dirt for analysis and a dust shield has shaken off the abrasive particles that cling to everything. Intuitive Machines was aiming this time for a mountain plateau just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole, much closer than before. It reached the plateau, but Intuitive Machines was not sure how near it was to the precise targeted spot. This weeks back-to-back moon landings are part of NASAs commercial lunar delivery program meant to get the space agencys experiments to the gray, dusty surface and jumpstart business. The commercial landers are also seen as scouts for the astronauts who will follow later this decade under NASAs Artemis program, the successor to Apollo.  NASA officials said before the landing that they knew going in that some of the low-cost missions would fail. But with more private missions to the moon, that increased the number of experiments getting there. NASA spent tens of millions of dollars on the ice drill and two other instruments riding on Athena, and paid an additional $62 million for the lift. Most of the experiments were from private companies, including the two rovers. The rocket-powered drone came from Intuitive Machines  its meant to hop into a permanently shadowed crater near the landing site in search of frozen water. To lower costs even more, Intuitive Machines shared its SpaceX rocket launch with three spacecraft that went their separate ways. Two of them  NASAs Lunar Trailblazer and AstroForges asteroid-chasing Odin  are in jeopardy. NASA said this week that Lunar Trailblazer is spinning without radio contact and wont reach its intended orbit around the moon for science observations. Odin is also silent, with its planned asteroid flyby unlikely. As for Athena, Intuitive Machines made dozens of repairs and upgrades following the companys sideways touchdown by its first lander. It still managed to operate briefly, ending Americas moon-landing drought of more than 50 years. Until then, the U.S. had not landed on the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. No one else has sent astronauts to the moon, the overriding goal of NASAs Artemis program. And only four other countries have successfully landed robotic spacecraft on the moon: Russia, China, India and Japan. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

SpaceXs latest Starship test flight ends with another explosion,"Nearly two months after an explosion sent flaming debris raining down on the Turks and Caicos, SpaceX launched another mammoth Starship rocket on Thursday, but lost contact minutes into the test flight as the spacecraft came tumbling down and broke apart. This time, wreckage from the latest explosion was seen streaming from the skies over Florida. It was not immediately known whether the spacecrafts self-destruct system had kicked in to blow it up.  The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off from Texas. SpaceX caught the first-stage booster back at the pad with giant mechanical arms, but engines on the spacecraft on top started shutting down as it streaked eastward for what was supposed to be a controlled entry over the Indian Ocean, half a world away. Contact was lost less than 10 minutes into the flight as the spacecraft went into an out-of-control spin.

It was not immediately clear where it came down, but images of flaming debris were captured from Florida, including near Cape Canaveral, and posted online. The space-skimming flight was supposed to last an hour. The Federal Aviation Administration said it would require SpaceX to investigate the accident.  
        
     Unfortunately this happened last time too, so we have some practice at this now, SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot said from the launch site.

Flights were briefly grounded at Orlando International Airport due to space launch debris in the area, the airport posted on X. Starship didnt make it quite as high or as far as last time.  NASA has booked Starship to land its astronauts on the moon later this decade. SpaceXs Elon Musk is aiming for Mars with Starship, the worlds biggest and most powerful rocket. Like last time, Starship had mock satellites to release once the craft reached space on this eighth test flight as a practice for future missions. They resembled SpaceXs Starlink internet satellites, thousands of which currently orbit Earth, and were meant to fall back down following their brief taste of space.

US militarys mini space shuttle returns to Earth after orbiting for 434 days on a secret mission,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The U.S. militarys classified mini space shuttle returned to Earth on Friday after circling the world for 434 days.  The space plane blasted into orbit from NASAs Kennedy Space Center in December 2023 on a secret mission. Launched by SpaceX, the X-37B vehicle carried no people, just military experiments.  Its predawn touchdown at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California was not announced until hours after the fact. Photos showed the white-and-black space plane parked on the runway in darkness. Its the seventh flight of one of these test vehicles. Space Force officials said the mission successfully demonstrated the ability to change orbits by using atmospheric drag to slow down, saving fuel. Its an exciting new chapter in the X-37B program, program director Lt. Col. Blaine Stewart said in a statement.  First launched in 2010, the Boeing-made, reusable space planes have spent as long as 908 days in space at a time. Theyre 29 feet (9 meters) long with a wingspan of almost 15 feet (4.5 meters). ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Private lunar lander is declared dead after landing sideways in a crater near the moons south pole,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A private lunar lander is no longer working after landing sideways in a crater near the moons south pole and its mission is over, officials said Friday. The news came less than 24 hours after the botched landing attempt by Texas-based Intuitive Machines. Launched last week, the lander named Athena missed its mark by more than 800 feet (250 meters) and ended up in a frigid crater, the company said in declaring it dead. Athena managed to send back pictures confirming its position and activate a few experiments before going silent. NASA and other customers had packed the lander with tens of millions of dollars worth of experiments including an ice drill, drone and pair of rovers to roam the unexplored terrain ahead of astronauts planned arrival later this decade. Its unlikely Athenas batteries can be recharged given the way the landers solar panels are pointed and the extreme cold in the crater.  The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission, the company said in a statement. The bigger, four-wheeled rover never made it off the fallen lander, but data beamed back indicates it survived and could have driven away had everything gone well, said Lunar Outpost, the Colorado company that owns it. This was the second landing attempt for Intuitive Machines. The first, a year ago, also ended with a sideways landing, but the company was able to keep it going for longer than this time. Despite all the problems, the companys first lander managed to put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years. 
        
     Earlier in the week, another Texas company scored a successful landing under NASAs commercial lunar delivery program, intended to jumpstart business on the moon while preparing for astronauts return. Firefly Aerospace put its Blue Ghost lander down in the far northern latitudes of the moons near side. Firefly CEO Jason Kim reported Friday that eight of the 10 NASA experiments on Blue Ghost already have met their mission objectives. Its expected to operate for another week until lunar daytime ends and solar power is no longer available. The south polar region of the moon is particularly difficult to reach and operate on given the harsh sun angles, limited communications with Earth and uncharted, rugged terrain. Athenas landing was the closest a spacecraft has come to the south pole, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) away. Thats where NASA is targeting for its first landing by astronauts since the 1960s and 1970s Apollo program, no earlier than 2027. The craters are believed to hold tons of frozen water that could be used by future crews to drink and turn into rocket fuel. Intuitive Machines has contracts with NASA for two more moon landing deliveries. The company said it will need to determine exactly what went wrong this time before launching the next mission. After the 15-foot (4.7-meter) Athena landed, controllers rushed to turn off some of the landers equipment to conserve power while trying to salvage what they could. In both landings by Intuitive Machines, problems arose at the last minute with the prime laser navigation system.  Intuitive Machines rocket-propelled drone, Grace, was supposed to hop across the lunar surface before jumping into a crater to look for frozen water. The two rovers from two other companies, one American and one Japanese, were going to scout around the area as well. NASAs ice drill was activated before the landers batteries died, but was unable to penetrate the lunar surface as planned, given the landers prone position. Flight controllers did manage to rotate the drill to prove it worked, and a companion science instrument collected some data, NASA said. Several other mission objectives were accelerated, according to Intuitive Machines.  NASA paid $62 million to Intuitive Machines to get its three experiments to the moon. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Scientists date remains of an ancient child that resembles both humans and Neanderthals,"NEW YORK (AP)  Scientists have dated the skeleton of an ancient child that caused a stir when it was first discovered because it carries features from both humans and Neanderthals. The childs remains were discovered 27 years ago in a rock shelter called Lagar Velho in central Portugal. The nearly complete skeleton was stained red, and scientists think it may have been wrapped in a painted animal skin before burial. When the humanlike child was discovered, scientists noted that some of their attributes  including body proportions and jawbone  looked Neanderthal. The researchers suggested that the child was descended from populations in which humans and Neanderthals mated and mixed. That was a radical notion at the time, but advances in genetics have since proven those populations existed  and people today still carry Neanderthal DNA.  But trying to figure out when exactly the child lived has been difficult. Small roots had grown through the bones and contamination  from plants or other sources  made it impossible for scientists to use traditional carbon dating to measure the childs age. They instead dated the charcoal and animal bones around the skeleton to between 27,700 and 29,700 years ago. Techniques have improved, and researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances that they were able to date the skeleton by measuring part of a protein thats found primarily in human bones.  
        
     Examining part of a crushed arm, they revealed that the earlier estimate was in the ballpark: the skeleton was from between 27,700 and 28,600 years ago. Being able to successfully date the child felt like giving them back a tiny piece of their story, which is a huge privilege, said Bethan Linscott, a study author now at the University of Miami, in an email. She noted the initial discovery was more than a skeleton  it was also the grave of a young child. When dating the bones, she couldnt help but wonder who loved the child, what made them laugh and what their world looked like in the short four years they walked the planet. Paul Pettitt, an archaeologist at Durham University in England who was not involved with the new research said in an email that the study is an example of how dating methods are becoming more effective and helping scientists better understand the past. The study of where humans came from is important for the same reason we keep the portraits of our parents and grandparents, said study author Joo Zilho from the University of Lisbon. Its a way of remembering, he said. - The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Watch the moon turn red during a total lunar eclipse in March,"NEW YORK (AP)  A total lunar eclipse will flush the moon red Thursday night into Friday morning across the Western Hemisphere.  The best views will be from North America and South America. Parts of Africa and Europe may catch a glimpse. Lunar eclipses happen when the moon, Earth and sun align just so. The Earth casts a shadow that can partially or totally blot out the moon.  During a partial lunar eclipse, Earths shadow appears to take a bite of the moon. The full moon is covered during a total eclipse and blushes coppery red because of stray bits of sunlight filtering through Earths atmosphere. Lunar and solar eclipses happen anywhere from four to seven times a year, according to NASA. A partial lunar eclipse graced skies in the Americas, Africa and Europe last September and the last total lunar eclipse was in 2022. This combination of photos shows the moon in various stages of a total lunar eclipse during the first blood moon of the year in Temple City, Calif. May 15, 2022. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) This combination of photos shows the moon in various stages of a total lunar eclipse during the first blood moon of the year in Temple City, Calif. May 15, 2022. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) The so-called blood moon will be visible for about an hour starting at 2:26 a.m. Eastern on Friday morning. Peak viewing will be close to 3 a.m. Eastern.  To see it, venture outside and look up  no need for eclipse glasses or any special equipment. As long as the sky is clear, you should be able to see it, said Shannon Schmoll, director of Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University. The setting of the moon may make it harder to see the eclipse in Europe and Africa. This is really an eclipse for North and South America, said astronomy expert Michael Faison from Yale University. 
        
     If you miss out, mark your calendar for Sept. 7. Another total lunar eclipse will sweep across parts of Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe. Parts of the Americas will get their next taste in March 2026. Civilizations have viewed and interpreted lunar eclipses for thousands of years. Ancient people knew more about the celestial bodies than we give them credit for, said historian Zoe Ortiz. They were looking at the night sky and they had a much brighter vision than we do today, said Ortiz with the University of North Texas. Aristotle noticed that the shadow the Earth cast on the moon during a lunar eclipse was always curved, observations proving that the Earth is round.  A total lunar eclipse will flush the moon red across the Western Hemisphere. On Thursday night into Friday morning, the Earth will cast a shadow that totally blocks the moon. And a civilization in ancient Mesopotamia saw the blood red moon as a bad omen for the king. The people installed a substitute king on the throne around the time of the eclipse to protect their ruler from any bad will. If theres ever a movie plot, said Ortiz, thats the one. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASAs newest space telescope blasts off to map the entire sky and millions of galaxies,"NASAs newest space telescope rocketed into orbit Tuesday to map the entire sky like never before  a sweeping look at hundreds of millions of galaxies and their shared cosmic glow since the beginning of time. SpaceX launched the Spherex observatory from California, putting it on course to fly over Earths poles. Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rockets upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background.  The $488 million Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years, and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments. Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge. The cone-shaped Spherex  at 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) or the heft of a grand piano  will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650 kilometers) up. Spherex wont see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASAs larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view. Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang. 
        
     This cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history, said the missions chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. Its a very different way of looking at the universe, enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past. By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.  We wont see the Big Bang. But well see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way, he said. The telescopes infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos.  Its like looking at the universe through a set of rainbow-colored glasses, said deputy project manager Beth Fabinsky of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  To keep the infrared detectors super cold  minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius)  Spherex has a unique look. It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earths heat, resembling a 10-foot (3-meter) shield collar for an ailing dog.  Besides the telescope, SpaceXs Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force Base for a quartet of NASA satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the suns corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind. The evening launch was delayed two weeks because of rocket and other issues. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

SpaceX delays flight to replace NASAs stuck astronauts after launch pad problem,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A launch pad problem prompted SpaceX to delay a flight to the International Space Station on Wednesday to replace NASAs two stuck astronauts. The new crew needs to get to the International Space Station before Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams can head home after nine months in orbit. Concerns over a critical hydraulic system arose less than four hours before the Falcon rockets planned evening liftoff from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. As the countdown clocks ticked down, engineers evaluated the hydraulics used to release one of the two arms clamping the rocket to its support structure. This structure needs to tilt back right before liftoff. Already strapped into their capsule, the four astronauts awaited a final decision, which came down with less than an hour remaining in the countdown. SpaceX canceled for the day. Officials later said the launch was off until at least Friday. Once at the space station, the U.S., Japanese and Russian crew will replace Wilmore and Williams, who have been up there since June. The two test pilots had to move into the space station for an extended stay after Boeings new Starliner capsule encountered major breakdowns in transit.  Starliners debut crew flight was supposed to last just a week, but NASA ordered the capsule to return empty and transferred Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX for the return leg. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Wombats are cute, furry marsupials  that shouldnt be picked up","Wombats are furry, nocturnal marsupials found only in Australia.  Baby wombats have recently been in the news after an American influencer filmed herself snatching a young joey from its mother, setting off a global conversation about mistreatment of wildlife. Wild animals are cute -- but please dont touch, for your sake and theirs. Unlike kangaroos and koalas, most wombats actually do spend much of their time down under  in burrows that sometimes include up to ten entrances and tunnels up to 325 feet (100 meters) long. Thats a lot of digging for an animal about the size of a medium dog with short legs, but also wide feet and sharp claws. Wombats can be up to 3 feet long and 88 pounds (40 kg). They have relatively flat faces, small ears and large noses.  If multiple wombats share the same burrow, also known as a warren, its most likely to be several females. Sometimes, after her young are raised, a mother wombat will depart her family burrow to join another, leaving the underground estate to her young, who may still be too small to dig their own, according to the Australia-based nonprofit Wombat Foundation. When theyre above ground, wombats spend much of their time grazing on grass, their primary food. They are herbivores, using their claws only for digging.  In 2021, scientists at Cornell University and other institutions published results of their study on why wombats are the only animal known to poop out cube-shaped scat. It turns out to be related to the shape of their intestinal muscles.  
        
     There are three species of wombats. One of those, the northern hairy-nosed wombat, is critically endangered.  During wildfire season in Australia, other species have been known to shelter in fireproof wombat burrows  not herded, but tolerated there. Last year, scientists published observations from trail cameras of bush rats, monitor lizards, painted button-quails and other animals sometimes using wombat dens. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

SpaceX launches a new crew to the space station to replace NASAs stuck astronauts,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The replacements for NASAs two stuck astronauts launched to the International Space Station on Friday night, paving the way for the pairs return after nine long months. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams need SpaceX to get this relief team to the space station before they can check out. Arrival is set for late Saturday night.

(AP Photo/Terry Renna) NASA wants overlap between the two crews so Wilmore and Williams can fill in the newcomers on happenings aboard the orbiting lab. That would put them on course for an undocking next week and a splashdown off the Florida coast, weather permitting. The duo will be escorted back by astronauts who flew up on a rescue mission on SpaceX last September alongside two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg. Reaching orbit from NASAs Kennedy Space Center, the newest crew includes NASAs Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, both military pilots; and Japans Takuya Onishi and Russias Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. They will spend the next six months at the space station, considered the normal stint, after springing Wilmore and Williams free.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) Spaceflight is tough, but humans are tougher, McClain said minutes into the flight.  As test pilots for Boeings new Starliner capsule, Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched from Cape Canaveral on June 5. A series of helium leaks and thruster failures marred their trip to the space station, setting off months of investigation by NASA and Boeing on how best to proceed. 
        
     Eventually ruling it unsafe, NASA ordered Starliner to fly back empty last September and moved Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight due back in February. Their return was further delayed when SpaceXs brand new capsule needed extensive battery repairs before launching their replacements. To save a few weeks, SpaceX switched to a used capsule, moving up Wilmore and Williams homecoming to mid-March. Already capturing the worlds attention, their unexpectedly long mission took a political twist when President Donald Trump and SpaceXs Elon Musk vowed earlier this year to accelerate the astronauts return and blamed the former administration for stalling it. Retired Navy captains who have lived at the space station before, Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly stressed that they support the decisions made by their NASA bosses since last summer. The two helped keep the station running  fixing a broken toilet, watering plants and conducting experiments  and even went out on a spacewalk together. With nine spacewalks, Williams set a new record for women: the most time spent spacewalking over a career. A last-minute hydraulics issue delayed Wednesdays initial launch attempt. Concern arose over one of the two clamp arms on the Falcon rockets support structure that needs to tilt away right before liftoff. SpaceX later flushed out the arms hydraulics system, removing trapped air. The duos extended stay has been hardest, they said, on their families  Wilmores wife and two daughters, and Williams husband and mother. Besides reuniting with them, Wilmore, a church elder, is looking forward to getting back to face-to-face ministering and Williams cant wait to walk her two Labrador retrievers. We appreciate all the love and support from everybody, Williams said in an interview earlier this week. This mission has brought a little attention. Theres goods and bads to that. But I think the good part is more and more people have been interested in what were doing with space exploration. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Who are the NASA astronauts who have been stuck in space for 9 months?,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were barely known outside space circles when they strapped in for what was supposed to be a quick test flight of Boeings Starliner capsule last June. Nine months later, theyve captured the worlds attention  and hearts  as NASAs stuck astronauts. Their homecoming is imminent now that a new crew has arrived at the International Space Station to replace them after launching from Florida last week. Theyre flying back with SpaceX, their problem-plagued Starliner having returned to Earth empty months ago, leaving them behind in orbit. Their SpaceX capsule undocked from the station early Tuesday for the 17-hour ride home. Heres a look at Suni and Butch and their drama-filled mission: The two test pilots came to NASA via the Navy. Wilmore, 62, played high school and college football in his home state of Tennessee before joining the Navy. Williams, 59, grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, a competitive swimmer and distance runner.  Wilmore racked up 663 aircraft carrier landings, while Williams served in combat helicopter squadrons.  NASA picked Williams as an astronaut in 1998 followed by Wilmore in 2000. Each had two spaceflights behind them including monthslong stints at the space station before signing up as Starliners first crew.  While they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmores wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.  Williams husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier. Besides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, cant wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.  Wilmore kept in touch with members of his congregation over the months, taking part in occasional prayer services and calling ailing members via the space stations internet phone.  Williams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim. Several other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once theyre back, according to NASA. Every astronaut that launches into space, we teach them dont think about when youre coming home. Think about how well your missions going and if youre lucky, you might get to stay longer, NASAs space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.  Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.  NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.  SpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two left the space station in the capsule thats been up there since last fall; Williams blew kisses to the seven station residents staying behind. Its great to see how much people care about our astronauts, Bowersox said, describing the pair as professional, devoted, committed, really outstanding. Astronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeings Starliner and transferred to SpaceXs Dragon for the ride back.  Their first flights were aboard NASAs space shuttle, followed by Russias Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.  As test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.  Starliner almost didnt make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab. NASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.  Engineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and its unclear when Starliner will fly again  with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancys sake and stand by that choice. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Private lunar lander Blue Ghost falls silent on the moon after a 2-week mission,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Its lights out for the first private lunar lander to pull off a fully successful moon mission.  Firefly Aerospaces Blue Ghost lander fell silent over the weekend, wrapping up two weeks of science experiments for NASA. The end came as the sun set at the moon, no longer providing energy for the landers solar panels.  Mission is completed, Firefly CEO Jason Kim said via X late Sunday night. But the Ghost still lives on in our hearts and minds for the journey its taken us on!  The lander operated five hours into the lunar night as planned before it died Sunday evening. Photos of the lunar sunset and glow will be released on Tuesday, Kim said. Blue Ghost launched from Cape Canaveral in January as part of NASAs commercial lunar delivery program. It landed at the moons far northeastern edge on March 2. It carried a drill, vacuum and other science and tech instruments for NASA. Firefly confirmed Monday that all 10 experiments worked.  Late last week, Blue Ghost observed a total solar eclipse from the moon  a total lunar eclipse as seen from Earth. The Texas-based Firefly became the first private company to land on the moon without falling or crashing after a string of failed missions by other companies over the past few years. Only five countries  the United States, Russia, China, India and Japan  have achieved a successful landing.  A Japanese companys lunar lander shared the SpaceX rocket ride, but took an even longer route to get to the moon. That lander from ispace is targeting an early June touchdown. 
        
     Another Texas company, Intuitive Machines, ended up sideways in a crater near the moons south pole earlier this month, dooming the mission. It was the second incomplete mission for Intuitive Machines. Its first lander put the U.S. back on the moon last year for the first time since the Apollo era after a less-than-perfect landing that hampered communications. Firefly is already working on its next lunar lander and striving for one moon landing a year.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Iguanas likely crossed the Pacific millions of years ago on a record-setting rafting trip,"NEW YORK (AP)  Researchers have long wondered how iguanas got to Fiji, a collection of remote islands in the South Pacific. Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas  thousands of miles and one giant ocean away.  They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed Fiji so far away.  But new research suggests that millions of years ago, iguanas pulled off the 5,000 mile (8,000 kilometer) odyssey on a raft of floating vegetation  masses of uprooted trees and small plants. That journey is thought to be a record  further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.  Scientists think thats how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.  The researchers created a statistical model using that information and other tidbits about where iguanas live today and how they may spread. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America. Given what we know now, their result is by far the most strongly supported, said Kevin de Queiroz, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the new study. 
        
     The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The journey from North America to Fiji could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been ideal passengers because they were adept at resisting dehydration and could have snacked on the plants underfoot. If you had to pick a vertebrate to survive a long trip on a raft across an ocean, iguanas would be the one, said study author Simon Scarpetta from the University of San Francisco, in an email. Many Fijian iguana species are endangered, and an invasive green iguana roams the islands today, said study author Robert Fisher of the United States Geological Survey. Figuring out where these creatures came from can equip scientists with the tools to better protect them in the future. - The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams return to Earth after 9 months stuck in space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Stuck in space no more, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth on Tuesday, hitching a different ride home to close out a saga that began with a bungled test flight more than nine months ago. Their SpaceX capsule parachuted into the Gulf of Mexico in the early evening, just hours after departing the International Space Station. Splashdown occurred off the coast of Tallahassee in the Florida Panhandle, bringing their unplanned odyssey to an end.

(SpaceX via AP) Within an hour, the astronauts were out of their capsule, waving and smiling at the cameras while being hustled away in reclining stretchers for routine medical checks. It all started with a flawed Boeing test flight last spring. The two expected to be gone just a week or so after launching on Boeings new Starliner crew capsule on June 5. So many problems cropped up on the way to the space station that NASA eventually sent Starliner back empty and transferred the test pilots to SpaceX, pushing their homecoming into February. Then SpaceX capsule issues added another months delay. Sundays arrival of their relief crew meant Wilmore and Williams could finally leave. NASA cut them loose a little early, given the iffy weather forecast later this week. They checked out with NASAs Nick Hague and Russias Alexander Gorbunov, who arrived in their own SpaceX capsule last fall with two empty seats reserved for the Starliner duo. 
        
     Wilmore and Williams ended up spending 286 days in space  278 days longer than anticipated when they launched. They circled Earth 4,576 times and traveled 121 million miles (195 million kilometers) by the time of splashdown.  On behalf of SpaceX, welcome home, radioed SpaceX Mission Control in California.

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis) What a ride, replied Hague, the capsules commander. I see a capsule full of grins ear to ear. Dolphins circled the capsule as divers readied it for hoisting onto the recovery ship. Once safely on board, the side hatch was opened and the astronauts were helped out, one by one. Williams was next-to-last out, followed by Wilmore who gave two gloved thumbs-up. Wilmore and Williams plight captured the worlds attention, giving new meaning to the phrase stuck at work and turning Butch and Suni into household names. While other astronauts had logged longer spaceflights over the decades, none had to deal with so much uncertainty or see the length of their mission expand by so much.

(NASA via AP) This image made from video by NASA shows astronauts, including Suni Williams, center, greeting each other after a SpaceX capsule docked with the International Space Station, Sunday, March 16, 2025. (NASA via AP) Wilmore and Williams quickly transitioned from guests to full-fledged station crew members, conducting experiments, fixing equipment and even spacewalking together. With 62 hours over nine spacewalks, Williams set a record: the most time spent spacewalking over a career among female astronauts. Both had lived on the orbiting lab before and knew the ropes, and brushed up on their station training before rocketing away. Williams became the stations commander three months into their stay and held the post until earlier this month.  Their mission took an unexpected twist in late January when President Donald Trump asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to accelerate the astronauts return and blamed the delay on the Biden administration. The replacement crews brand new SpaceX capsule still wasnt ready to fly, so SpaceX subbed it with a used one, hurrying things along by at least a few weeks.

(NASA via AP) After splashdown, Musk offered his congratulations via X. NASAs Joel Montalbano said the space agency was already looking at various options when Trump made his call to hurry the astronauts home. Even in the middle of the political storm, Wilmore and Williams continued to maintain an even keel at public appearances from orbit, casting no blame and insisting they supported NASAs decisions from the start.  NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing after the shuttle program ended, in order to have two competing U.S. companies for transporting astronauts to and from the space station until its abandoned in 2030 and steered to a fiery reentry. By then, it will have been up there more than three decades; the plan is to replace it with privately run stations so NASA can focus on moon and Mars expeditions. This has been nine months in the making, and I couldnt be prouder of our teams versatility, our teams ability to adapt and really build for the future of human spaceflight, NASAs commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said. With Starliner still under engineering investigation, SpaceX will launch the next crew for NASA as soon as July. Stich said NASA will have until summer to decide whether the crew after that one will be flown by SpaceX or Boeing  or whether Boeing will have to prove itself by flying cargo before people again.  Both retired Navy captains, Wilmore and Williams stressed they didnt mind spending more time in space  a prolonged deployment reminiscent of their military days. But they acknowledged it was tough on their families.

Williams, 59, had to settle for internet calls from space to her husband, mother and other relatives. We have not been worried about her because she has been in good spirits, said Falguni Pandya, who is married to Williams cousin. She was definitely ready to come home. Prayers for Williams and Wilmore were offered up at 21 Hindu temples in the U.S. in the months leading up to their return, said organizer Tejal Shah, president of World Hindu Council of America. Williams has spoken frequently about her Indian and Slovenian heritage. Prayers for their safe return also came from Wilmores Baptist church in Houston, where he serves as an elder.  Crowds in Jhulasan, the ancestral home of Williams father, danced and celebrated in a temple and performed rituals during the homecoming.  After returning in the gulf  Trump in January signed an executive order renaming the body of water Gulf of America  Wilmore and Williams will have to wait until theyre off the SpaceX recovery ship and flown to Houston before reuniting with their loved ones. The three NASA astronauts will be checked out by flight surgeons as they adjust to gravity, officials said, and should be allowed to go home after a day or two.  ___ AP journalist Deepa Bharath contributed to this report.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

SpaceX loses spacecraft after catching rocket booster at the launch pad in latest Starship test,"SpaceX launched its Starship rocket on its latest test flight Thursday, but the spacecraft was destroyed following a thrilling booster catch back at the pad. Elon Musks company said Starship broke apart  what it called a rapid unscheduled disassembly. The spacecrafts six engines appeared to shut down one by one during ascent, with contact lost just 8 1/2 minutes into the flight. The spacecraft  a new and upgraded model making its debut  was supposed to soar across the Gulf of Mexico from Texas on a near loop around the world similar to previous test flights. SpaceX had packed it with 10 dummy satellites for practice at releasing them.  A minute before the loss, SpaceX used the launch towers giant mechanical arms to catch the returning booster, a feat achieved only once before. The descending booster hovered over the launch pad before being gripped by the pair of arms dubbed chopsticks.  A group of people visiting the Turks and Caicos islands captured video of debris from the failed SpaceX rocket flying overhead, as the wreckage left behind a colorful stream of smoke. The thrill of the catch quickly turned into disappointment for not only the company, but the crowds gathered along the southern tip of Texas. It was great to see a booster come down, but we are obviously bummed out about ship, said SpaceX spokesman Dan Huot. Its a flight test. Its an experimental vehicle, he stressed. The last data received from the spacecraft indicated an altitude of 90 miles (146 kilometers) and a velocity of 13,245 mph (21,317 kph).  Musk said a preliminary analysis suggests leaking fuel may have built up pressure in a cavity above the engine firewall. Fire suppression will be added to the area, with increased venting and double-checking for leaks, he said via X.  
        
     The 400-foot (123-meter) rocket had thundered away in late afternoon from Boca Chica Beach near the Mexican border. The late hour ensured a daylight entry halfway around the world in the Indian Ocean. But the shiny retro-looking spacecraft never got nearly that far. SpaceX had made improvements to the spacecraft for the latest demo and added a fleet of satellite mockups. The test satellites were the same size as SpaceXs Starlink internet satellites and, like the spacecraft, were meant to be destroyed upon entry.  Musk plans to launch actual Starlinks on Starships before moving on to other satellites and, eventually, crews.  It was the seventh test flight for the worlds biggest and most powerful rocket. NASA has reserved a pair of Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. Musks goal is Mars. Hours earlier in Florida, another billionaires rocket company  Jeff Bezos Blue Origin  launched the newest supersized rocket, New Glenn. The rocket reached orbit on its first flight, successfully placing an experimental satellite thousands of miles above Earth. But the first-stage booster was destroyed, missing its targeted landing on a floating platform in the Atlantic. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASAs stuck astronaut steps out on a spacewalk after 7 months in orbit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  One of NASAs two stuck astronauts got a much welcomed change of scenery Thursday, stepping out on her first spacewalk since arriving at the International Space Station more than seven months ago.  Suni Williams, the stations commander, tackled some overdue outdoor repair work alongside NASAs Nick Hague. They emerged as the orbiting lab sailed 260 miles (420 kilometers) above Turkmenistan. Williams got a close-up look at the SpaceX capsule that will bring her home this spring, floating just a few feet away from the parked vessel as she struggled with a chore. She eventually prevailed without damaging her ride.  Plans called for Williams to head back out next week with Butch Wilmore on another spacewalk. The two launched aboard Boeings new Starliner capsule last June on what should have been a weeklong test flight.

     But Starliner trouble dragged out their return, and NASA ordered the capsule to come back empty. Then SpaceX delayed the launch of their replacements, meaning the two wont be home until late March or early April  ten months after launching. It was the first spacewalk by NASA astronauts since an aborted one last summer. U.S. spacewalks were put on hold after water leaked into the airlock from the cooling loop for an astronauts suit. NASA said the problem has been fixed. This was the eighth spacewalk for Williams, who has lived on the space station before. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

How to glimpse a parade of planets in the January night sky,"NEW YORK (AP)  Six planets grace the sky this month in whats known as a planetary parade, and most can be seen with the naked eye. These planetary hangouts happen when several planets appear to line up in the night sky at once.  Theyre not in a straight line, but theyre pretty close together on one side of the sun, said Hannah Sparkes, planetarium supervisor at the Bishop Museum of Science and Nature in Florida.  The astronomical linkup is fairly common and can happen at least every year depending on the number of planets. A similar parade took place last June, but only two planets could be seen without any special equipment. Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are visible to the naked eye this month and for part of February. Uranus and Neptune can be spotted with binoculars and telescopes. During this latest spectacle, Mars shines especially bright because its located directly opposite the sun. And last Friday and Saturday night, skygazers saw Venus and Saturn snuggle up extra close  just two degrees apart. Any clear, cloudless night this month is ideal to spot the planets. To get in on the sighting, go outside on a clear night a few hours after sunset and face south, said Kevin Williams, planetarium director at Buffalo State University. Venus and Saturn will glow in the southwestern sky, with Jupiter in the southern sky and Mars in the southeast or east. The planets will shine brighter than the stars, and Mars will look like a reddish-orange dot. 
        
     Consider downloading stargazing apps to help with where to look, Sparkes said.  A faint Mercury is set to join the parade as a bonus seventh planet at the end of February, and the planets will slowly make their exit through the spring. It gives us a little bit better sense of our place in the solar system and the universe, Williams said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

SpaceX launch accident likely caused by fire that sent trails of flaming debris near the Caribbean,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX suspects a fire may have caused its Starship to break apart during liftoff and send trails of flaming debris near the Caribbean.  SpaceXs Elon Musk said preliminary indications are that leaking fuel built up pressure in the cavity above the engine firewall. The resulting fire would have doomed the spacecraft.  On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered SpaceX to investigate what went wrong. The FAA said there were no reports of injuries from Starship debris.  The 400-foot Starship  the worlds biggest and most powerful rocket  launched from the southern tip of Texas on a test flight early Thursday evening. The booster made it back to the pad for a catch by giant mechanical arms, only the second time in Starship history. But the engines on the still ascending spacecraft shut down one by one, and communication was lost 8 1/2 minutes into the flight. Dramatic video taken near the Turks and Caicos Islands showed spacecraft debris raining down from the sky in a stream of fireballs. Flights near the falling debris had to be diverted, the FAA said.  SpaceX said Starship remained in its designated launch corridor over the Gulf of Mexico and then the Atlantic. Any surviving wreckage would have fallen along that path over water, the company said on its website.  Starship had been shooting for a controlled entry over the Indian Ocean, halfway around the world. Ten dummy satellites, mimicking SpaceXs Starlink internet satellites, were on board so the company could practice releasing them.  
        
     It was the seventh test flight of a Starship, but it featured a new and upgraded spacecraft. The FAA said it must approve SpaceXs accident findings and any corrective actions.  SpaceX said the booster and spacecraft for the eighth demo are already built and undergoing testing. Musk said on X the loss was barely a bump in the road in his plans to build a fleet of Starships to carry people to Mars.  NASA already has booked two Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo.  Spaceflight is not easy. Its anything but routine, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson posted on X after the accident. Thats why these tests are so important. Earlier Thursday, Jeff Bezos Blue Origin company also had mixed results with the debut of its massive New Glenn rocket. It achieved orbit on its first try, putting a test satellite thousands of miles above Earth. But the booster was destroyed after failing to land on a floating platform in the Atlantic. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A meteorite strike was captured on video by a Canadian homes doorbell camera,"NEW YORK (AP)  A doorbell camera on a Canadian home captured rare video and sound of a meteorite striking Earth as it crashed into a couples walkway.  When Laura Kelly and her partner returned home after an evening walk in July, they were surprised to find their walkway littered with dust and strange debris, according to the Meteoritical Society, which posted the video with its report. They checked their security camera and saw something slamming against their entranceway, producing a cloud of smoke and a crackle. The pair reported what they found to the University of Albertas Meteorite Reporting System and the curator, Chris Herd, examined samples of the debris to confirm its interstellar origins. Meteorites are bits of space rock that hit Earth after surviving a trip through its scorching atmosphere. About 48 tons (43,500 kilograms) of similar debris strikes Earth every day, according to NASA, but is much more likely to plunge into an ocean than onto someones front stoop. The space rocks also streak the night sky as shooting stars during meteor showers which happen several times a year. The footage is believed to be a first. While cameras have captured meteors streaking through the sky, its rare to capture the sound of a complete meteorite strike on video. The space rock, officially registered Monday, was named Charlottetown after the city on Prince Edward Island in eastern Canada where it struck. - The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

How scientists with disabilities are making research labs and fieldwork more accessible,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP)  The path to Lost Lake was steep and unpaved, lined with sharp rocks and holes. A group of scientists and students gingerly made their way, using canes or a helping hand to guide them. For those who couldnt make the trek, a drone brought the lake  blue and narrow  into view. The field trip was designed to illustrate the challenges disabled researchers often face and how barriers can be overcome. Just because you cant do it like someone else doesnt mean you cant do it, said Anita Marshall, a University of Florida geologist leading the outing. The group included scientists with sight, hearing and mobility disabilities.  Marshalls organization ran the field trip to the lake along the San Andreas Fault, outside of San Bernadino. Her group  the International Association for Geoscience Diversity  and others are working to improve access to field and lab work so that those with disabilities feel welcome and stay.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun) Taormina Lepore, a Western Michigan University paleontologist who went on the trip, said scientists tend to value a single, traditional way of getting things done. At Lost Lake, everyone got a view  even if they couldnt physically get there. Its really about empathy, as much as it is about science, said Lepore, who also researches science education. 
        
     Disabled people make up about 3% of the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, according to 2021 data from the National Science Foundation. Scientists with disabilities say thats in part because labs, classrooms and field sites arent designed to accommodate them. Students and faculty are still told that they cant work in a lab or do research safely, said Mark Leddy, who formerly managed disability-related grants for the National Science Foundation. The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, sets minimum regulations for new buildings and labs, including ramps and wheelchair-accessible walkways.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun) But modifying older labs can be a complicated and lengthy process. Alyssa Paparella is working on her doctorate in biology at Baylor College of Medicine and founded an online community for disabled scientists. She said a science building at one of her former schools had no automatic buttons to open doors. What is that saying about who you want actually working in the laboratories? she said. Thats the front door that theyre not even able to get in. Leddy said researchers with disabilities are invaluable because of their life experiences. They have to constantly come up with creative ways to get past barriers in their lives  a problem-solving skill thats indispensable in a lab. If they dont feel welcome, if they dont get access, then how can they contribute that talent? Leddy said. Venu Varanasi, a biomaterials engineer at the University of Texas at Arlington who has low vision, prints out signage using high-contrast color combinations and encourages his students to keep floors and counters clutter-free so he can navigate the lab more easily. He said those modifications also keep accidents to a minimum for non-disabled students.

At Purdue University in Indiana, engineering professor Brad Duerstock helped design an accessible biomedical lab years ago with support from the school and a National Institutes of Health grant, removing cabinets under sinks and fume hoods so that wheelchairs can easily pull up. The cost of making a lab more accessible varies depending on how extensive the changes are, Duerstock said. Some schools set aside money for improvements and science organizations can offer grants.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun) On the California geology field trip, the group explored the lake carved into the landscape by the San Andreas Fault, where the grating of two tectonic plates can cause earthquakes. The group included rock enthusiasts at all different stages of their careers. A handful were students. Others were professors, eager to explore the outdoors in a group they could trust to look after them. Central Connecticut State University professor Jennifer Piatek, who uses a wheelchair, saw the lake through drone footage and used a pocket lens to examine rocks brought back by other participants. She said it was nice to be part of a community that anticipated her needs. For example, their bus pulled forward to park at a flatter location to make it easier for her to get off. You can learn a lot from images and maps, but really you need to get to the space to be in it, said Piatek, who studies planetary geology.

Nature is not inherently accessible, she said. Nature just doesnt have ramps and the kinds of things that we might wish it had. But there are so many workarounds and ways that we as geoscientists can make things truly open. Bushra Hussaini uses tips from the field trips to support interns and volunteers with disabilities at New Yorks American Museum of Natural History, where she works.

She and others from the organization have been leading field trips every year as an offshoot from the Geological Society of Americas annual meeting.  As a doctoral student, Marshall would go on field trips with her peers only to wait back in the van, frustrated, because the organizers hadnt thought about how to accommodate her disabilities.  She wants things to be different for the next generation of scientists.  The whole point of these little day trips is to just plant that seed out there, Marshall said, that theres another way forward. ___ AP video journalist Eugene Garcia contributed to this report.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Scientists detect chirping cosmic waves in an unexpected part of space,"NEW YORK (AP)  Scientists have detected cosmic waves that sound like birds chirping in an unexpected place. These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency as human hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimic high-pitched bird calls.  Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where theyve never been measured before. That opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area, said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work. AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on scientists sensing a chirping chorus in an unexpected place. Scientists still arent sure how the perturbations happen, but they think Earths magnetic field may have something to do with it. The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft  NASAs Van Allen Probes  heard the chirps from Earths radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection.  The latest notes were picked up by NASAs Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and suns magnetic fields. The new research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications. 
        
     
        
     They are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space, said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email. The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earths magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didnt expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form.

A private US spacecraft headed to the moon captures a glorious view of Earth,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A private U.S. spacecraft bound for the moon has captured stunning images of Earth one week into its flight.  Still circling Earth, Firefly Aerospaces lunar lander fired its thrusters Thursday to put it on a path to reach the moon in over a month. Dubbed Blue Ghost, the spacecraft beamed back photos and video of the Blue Marble, our planet. The Texas company released the images Friday.  It carries experiments for NASA, part of the space agencys effort to return astronauts to the moon this decade.  Blue Ghost is one of two lunar landers launched from Florida by SpaceX on Jan. 15. Its targeting a moon touchdown on March 2. The other lander is sponsored by the Japanese company ispace and taking an even longer route, with a landing in late May or early June. Its the first moonshot for Firefly and the second for ispace, which crashed its first lander into the moon in 2023. Tokyo-based ispaces latest lander, Resilience, is still orbiting Earth and performing all its maneuvers to close in on the moon. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Are we all aliens? NASAs returned asteroid samples hold the ingredients of life from a watery world,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday. The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start. Thats the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life, said the Smithsonian Institutions Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, Pool, file) NASAs Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material. Small amounts of Bennus precious black grains  leftovers from the solar systems formation 4.5 billion years ago  were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code. Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu  similar to whats in the dry lakebeds of Californias Mojave Desert and Africas Sahara  would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites. This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth, the Institute of Science Tokyos Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.

(Keegan Barber/NASA via AP, file) Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, thats really the pathway to life, said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural Historys curator of meteorites. These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before. NASAs Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid  real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth. Bennu  a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across  was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues. Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizonas Dante Lauretta, the missions chief scientist who took part in both studies. Most of the $1 billion missions cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year. Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiters moon Europa and Saturns moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here. Are we alone? McCoy said. Thats one of the questions were trying to answer. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Many animals and plants are losing their genetic diversity, making them more vulnerable","WASHINGTON (AP)  Two-thirds of animal and plant populations are declining in genetic diversity, which makes it harder to adapt to environmental changes, according to research published Wednesday.  Long before a species goes extinct, the population becomes smaller and more fragmented, shrinking the number of potential mates and therefore genetic mixing. This leaves a species more vulnerable to future threats such as disease.  A surprisingly trend was that we saw genetic diversity declining even among many species that arent considered at risk, said co-author Catherine Grueber, a conservation biologist at the University of Sydney. Researchers examined data for 628 species studied between 1985 and 2019. The greatest losses in genetic variation were seen in birds and mammals.  Findings were published in the journal Nature.  When a species has different genetic solutions, its better able to deal with changes, said David Nogus-Bravo at the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved in the study. If a new disease spreads through a population or climate change alters summer rainfall, some individuals will fare better than others, in part because of their genes. Higher genetic diversity also means theres a greater chance of a species survival.  Conservation efforts to connect isolated populations  basically expanding the dating pool for a particular species  can help maintain or even restore genetic diversity. 
        
     Florida panthers are an endangered species that have steadily lost habitat to freeways and urban sprawl. By the mid-1990s, the remaining big cats in southern Florida showed clear signs of inbreeding  with kinked tails and low sperm counts in males. Biologists brought eight female panthers from Texas to Florida. Twenty years later, the number of Florida panthers in the wild has grown significantly and genetic diversity increased.  Isolated populations suffer, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not part of the research. The solution is to reconnect them. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Newly spotted asteroid has a tiny chance of hitting Earth in 2032,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A newly discovered asteroid has a tiny chance of smacking Earth in 2032, space agency officials said Wednesday.  Scientists put the odds of a strike at slightly more than 1%. We are not worried at all, because of this 99 percent chance it will miss, said Paul Chodas, director of NASAs Center for Near Earth Object Studies. But it deserves attention. First spotted last month by a telescope in Chile, the near-Earth asteroid  designated 2024 YR4  is estimated to be 130 to 330 feet (40 to 100 meters) across. Scientists are keeping close watch on the space rock, which is currently heading away from Earth. As the asteroids path around the sun becomes better understood, Chodas and others said theres a good chance the risk to Earth could drop to zero. The asteroid will gradually fade from view over the next few months, according to NASA and the European Space Agency. Until then, some of the worlds most powerful telescopes will keep monitoring it to better determine its size and path. Once out of sight, it wont be visible until it passes our way again in 2028. The asteroid came closest to Earth on Christmas Day  passing within roughly 500,000 miles (800,000 kilometers) of Earth, about twice the distance of the moon. It was discovered two days later.  Chodas said scientists are poring over sky surveys from 2016, when predictions show the asteroid also ventured close.  
        
     
        
     If scientists can find the space rock in images from then, they should be able to determine whether it will hit or miss the planet, he told The Associated Press. If we dont find that detection, the impact probability will just move slowly as we add more observations, he said. Earth gets clobbered by an asteroid this size every few thousand years, according to ESA, with the potential for severe damage. Thats why this one now tops ESAs asteroid risk list. The potential impact would occur on Dec. 22, 2032. Its much too soon to know where it might land if it did hit Earth. The good news, according to NASA, is that for now, no other known large asteroids have an impact probability above 1%. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASAs 2 stuck astronauts take their first spacewalk together,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs two stuck astronauts took their first spacewalk together Thursday, exiting the International Space Station almost eight months after moving in. Commander Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore removed a broken antenna and wiped the stations exterior for evidence of any microbes that might still be alive after launching from Earth and escaping through vents. After some initial trouble unbolting the balky antenna, the astronauts finally pried it off nearly four hours after popping out the hatch. Mission Control urged them to watch for any floating parts from the antenna removal.  During the job 260 miles (420 kilometers) up, Williams set a new spacewalking record for female astronauts.  The pair expected to stay just a week when they arrived at the space station last June. But their brand new ride, Boeings Starliner capsule, encountered so much trouble that NASA decided to return it empty.  That left the two test pilots, both retired Navy captains, in orbit until SpaceX can bring them home. That wont happen until late March or early April, extending their mission to 10 months because of a SpaceX delay in launching their replacements.  Williams performed a spacewalk two weeks ago with another NASA astronaut. It marked Wilmores first time outside this trip. Both racked up spacewalks during previous space station stays. With nine spacewalks, Williams set a new record for women: the most time spent spacewalking over a career. Retired astronaut Peggy Whitson held the old record of 60 hours and 21 minutes, accumulated over 10 spacewalks. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The oldest evidence for lead pollution comes from ancient Greece,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy  and, it turns out, lead pollution. Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago. Thats 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia. In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil. Silver was used for jewelry, for special objects  but it wasnt found in a pure state, but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment. The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the regions most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran. Lead released from smelting is the worlds first form of toxic or industrial pollution, said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study. The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region. 
        
     But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected a very strong and abrupt increase in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University. Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the regions society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.  Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.  Previous research  including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland  had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times. But the new study adds a more specific and local picture to how lead levels changed, said Nathan Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was not involved in the research. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

How an ancient asteroid strike carved out 2 grand canyons on the moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  New research shows that when an asteroid slammed into the moon billions of years ago, it carved out a pair of grand canyons on the lunar far side.  Thats good news for scientists and NASA, which is looking to land astronauts at the south pole on the near, Earth-facing side untouched by that impact and containing older rocks in original condition. U.S. and British scientists used photos and data from NASAs Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to map the area and calculate the path of debris that produced these canyons about 3.8 billion years ago. They reported their findings Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The incoming space rock passed over the lunar south pole before hitting, creating a huge basin and sending streams of boulders hurtling at a speed of nearly 1 mile a second (1 kilometer a second). The debris landed like missiles, digging out two canyons comparable in size to Arizonas Grand Canyon in barely 10 minutes. The latter, by comparison, took millions of years to form. This was a very violent, a very dramatic geologic process, said lead author David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.  Kring and his team estimate the asteroid was 15 miles (25 kilometers) across and that the energy needed to create these two canyons would have been more than 130 times that in the worlds current inventory of nuclear weapons. 
        
     Most of the ejected debris was thrown in a direction away from the south pole, Kring said.  That means NASAs targeted exploration zone around the pole mostly on the moons near side wont be buried under debris, keeping older rocks from 4 billion plus years ago exposed for collection by moonwalkers. These older rocks can help shed light not only on the moons origins, but also Earths.  Kring said its unclear whether these two canyons are permanently shadowed like some of the craters at the moons south pole. That is something that were clearly going to be reexamining, he said. Permanently shadowed areas at the bottom of the moon are thought to hold considerable ice, which could be turned into rocket fuel and drinking water by future moonwalkers.  NASAs Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade. The plan is to send astronauts around the moon next year, followed a year or so later by the first lunar touchdown by astronauts since Apollo. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A North Carolina wildlife crossing will save people. Can it save the last wild red wolves too?,"ALLIGATOR RIVER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, N.C. (AP)  Hunters were once the greatest human threat to the countrys only unique wolf species. Today, its motorists. That fact was brought home last June, when red wolf breeding male No. 2444 was struck and killed on U.S. 64 near Manns Harbor, North Carolina. His death likely meant five pups hed been providing for died, too. We were hoping the mother would return and resume care, but she never did, Joe Madison, head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services red wolf recovery program, said during a recent visit to the site.  For decades, conservationists have pushed for changes to U.S. 64, a busy two-lane highway to the popular Outer Banks that runs straight through the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge  one of just two places in the world where red wolves run free. They may finally be getting their wish. In this photo provided by the NC Wildlife Resources Commission, a coyote walks under U.S. 64 near Creswell, N.C., on March 9, 2023.

(AP Photo/Allen G. Breed) In late December, the Federal Highway Administration awarded the first grants under a new $125 million Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program. Unless the grants are somehow undone by President Donald Trump, part of the money will help state agencies and nonprofit groups rebuild a 2.5-mile section of the highway with fencing and a series of culverts, or small underpasses, to allow red wolves  as well as black bears, white-tailed deer and other animals  to pass safely underneath traffic. When you build wildlife bridges or underpasses, you reduce human-wildlife conflict, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who studies wildlife migrations but is not directly involved in the project. There is increasing awareness that reducing traffic collisions is smart for wildlife, smart for people too. 
        
     Other agency grants will support new bridges and underpasses for mule deer in Idaho, pronghorn antelope in New Mexico, and cougars and bears in Oregon, among other projects. But whats notable about the U.S. 64 project is that the goal is twofold: reducing dangerous collisions and roadkill  and saving a critically endangered species. There are thought to be fewer than 20 red wolves left in the wild; besides Alligator River, the other remaining habitat is in the nearby Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge. Madison calculates that No. 2444 represented 7% of the known wild red wolf population. So, every time you get a mortality, thats a significant hit, he said.

One congressional report estimated that dangerous highway collisions with large animals kill hundreds of people and cost more than $8 billion each year. Researchers have learned a lot about what works for different species.  Pronghorn dont want to go through tunnels or close spaces, so they avoid underpasses and need bridges, said Arthur Middleton, an ecologist who studies animal migration at the University of California, Berkeley. Whereas deer will go under or over. Male red wolf No. 2444 lies dead along U.S. 64 after being struck by a vehicle near Manns Harbor, N.C., on Wednesday, June 5, 2024.

(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service via AP) Gray wolves and coyotes  and, presumably, red wolves  will also use underpasses, or culverts, of 6 or 8 feet in diameter. Fencing is critical to funnel the animals to the structures. Along U.S. 30 in Wyoming, seven small underpasses and fencing cut mule deer collisions by 81%. In Canada, a series of overpasses and underpasses along the Trans-Canada Highway in Banff National Park reduced collisions with hooved animals by 94%. But whether wildlife crossings can help prevent extinctions is a harder question to answer. Conservation was always a part of the story, but now were seeing crossings increasingly pop up that have conservation as a primary rationale, said Ben Goldfarb, author of the book Crossings: How Road Ecology is Shaping the Future of Our Planet.  Some of the most ambitious crossings for conservation have just been built  and it will take time to assess the results. Outside Los Angeles, a wildlife crossing over 10 lanes of U.S. 101 is expected to open in 2026. The primary aim is to help connect the habitat of mountain lions, which need to cross the freeway to find suitable mates. Inbreeding among mountain lions in the LA region has already led to genetic mutations and decreased fertility. In Brazils Rio de Janeiro state, construction of a wildlife bridge spanning BR 101 was finished in 2020, then native seedlings were planted in a soil bed. Once those trees mature, researchers will study if the target species  an endangered monkey called a golden lion tamarin  uses the bridge regularly. Experts say the trees are necessary for creatures like monkeys or sloths to move across the bridge. Species that scamper on the ground, including foxes, anteaters and armadillos, are already crossing.

(AP Photo/Lucas Dumphreys, File) While its not certain that a wildlife crossing can save the last red wolves, scientists say that doing nothing will almost certainly hasten their demise. Canis rufus, often called Americas wolf, once roamed from central Texas to southern Iowa and as far east as Long Island, New York. After being declared extinct in the wild, red wolves were reintroduced in North Carolina in 1987.  For about 20 years, the population grew steadily to reach around 120 animals. Then their numbers crashed  with vehicle collisions a primary culprit. One study found that vehicle strikes had killed about 5% of the red wolf population each year between their reintroduction and 2022.

Huijser, a study co-author and a research ecologist at Montana State Universitys Western Transportation Institute, warned that the cost of doing nothing, including losing a wild species, can be far higher than the cost of implementing effective mitigation. In North Carolina, Fish and Wildlife biologists have tried other measures to prevent crashes  like flashing road signs and reflective collars  without much success. Following No. 2444s death, conservation groups like the Wildlands Network and the Center for Biological Diversity pushed for another solution.

(AP Photo/David Goldman, File) In September, the North Carolina Department of Transportation submitted a grant application for the Red Wolf Essential Survival Crossings Under Evacuation Route  or RESCUER  project. Plans for the U.S. 64 wildlife crossing call for a series of underpass structures  several of them big enough for wolves and other large mammals to pass through  and the accompanying fencing. The exact number and size of the underpasses has yet to be determined, said Travis W. Wilson, eastern habitat conservation coordinator for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. The estimated total cost for the project is about $31.5 million, including $4 million in private donations raised by conservation groups and an anonymous donors matching grant. This is one of the most important wildlife connectivity projects in the country, said Beth Pratt, founder of the nonprofit The Wildlife Crossing Fund, which raised funds for the project.

Jeff Bezos Blue Origin mimics the moons gravity for NASA experiments during spaceflight,"Jeff Bezos rocket company gave NASA a brief taste of the moons gravity Tuesday, without straying too far from home. Blue Origin launched the 29 lunar technology experiments to the edge of space from West Texas. The company later confirmed that roughly two minutes of artificial lunar gravity were achieved by spinning the capsule 11 times a minute.  It was Blue Origins first attempt at mimicking lunar gravity, which is one-sixth that of Earth.  NASA said it wants to test equipment on short spaceflights to weed out any problems before sending them to the moon. The experiments  mainly sponsored by NASA  included ways to keep lunar dust off future moonwalkers spacesuits and tools.  Mimicking the moons gravity on spaceflights can accelerate research at much lower costs and future trips can closely mirror Mars and other solar system gravity environments, Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp posted on X ahead of the flight. The New Shepard rocket landed as planned following the late morning liftoff. The capsule with the experiments parachuted back to the desert to close out the 10-minute flight. New Shepard alternates between flying passengers and experiments on short space hops. Blue Origins much bigger orbital rocket, New Glenn, made its debut launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, last month.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Scientists solve the mystery of sea turtles lost years,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Using satellite trackers, scientists have discovered the whereabouts of young sea turtles during a key part of their lives.  Weve had massive data gaps about the early baby to toddler life stages of sea turtles, said Kate Mansfield, a marine scientist at the University of Central Florida. This part of their long lives has been largely a mystery. For decades, scientists have wondered about what happens during the so-called lost years between when tiny hatchlings leave the beach and when they return to coastlines nearly grown  a span of about one to 10 years. New research published Tuesday begins to fill in that gap. For over a decade, Mansfield and colleagues attached GPS tags to the fast-growing shells of young wild turtles. Steering small boats, they looked for young turtles drifting among algae in the Gulf of Mexico, eventually tagging 114 animals  including endangered green turtles, loggerheads, hawksbills and Kemps ridleys. Eventually the GPS tags slough off because the outside of a young turtles shell sheds as they grow very quickly, said Katrina Phillips, a marine ecologist at the University of Central Florida and co-author of the new study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.  But each tag stayed on long enough to transmit a few weeks to a few months of location data. What the researchers found challenged many old ideas.  
        
     Scientists long thought that tiny turtles drifted passively with ocean currents, literally going with the flow. What weve uncovered is that the turtles are actually swimming, said co-author Nathan Putman, an ecologist at LGL Ecological Research Associates in Texas.  The scientists confirmed this by comparing location data of young turtles with the routes of drifting buoys set in the water at the same time. More than half of the buoys washed ashore while the turtles did not.  This tiny little hatchling is actually making its own decisions about where it wants to go in the ocean and what it wants to avoid, said Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.  The tracking data also showed more variability in locations than scientists expected, as the little turtles moved between continental shelf waters and open ocean. Besides the painstaking work of finding turtles, the trick was developing flexible solar-powered tags that could hang onto shells long enough to send back data.  For years, the technology couldnt match the dream, said Jeffrey Seminoff, a marine biologist at NOAA who was not involved in the study.  The findings give biologists a better idea of how young turtles use the Gulf of Mexico, a critical region for four species of endangered sea turtles. Its not that the sea turtles were ever lost, but that we had lost track of them, said Jeanette Wyneken at Florida Atlantic University, who had no role in the research.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"How to cook the perfect boiled egg, according to science","NEW YORK (AP)  Scientists say theyve cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg. Its a recipe you can test for yourself  though the timing isnt ideal with soaring egg prices in the United States from a bird flu outbreak.  The perfect boiled egg has a velvety yolk paired with a soft, solid white.  Achieving this balance can be a challenge because the yolk cooks at a lower temperature than the white. Hard boiling an egg can yield a chalky yolk, while cooking low and slow can produce jelly-like, undercooked whites. Researchers cooked hundreds of eggs and used math to tackle this runny conundrum. One equation dealt with how heat travels between a hot surface and an egg; another captured how the eggs contents morph from liquid to solid with a gel-like state in between. This photo provided by researchers in February 2025 shows two pots, one with boiling water, left, and the other with a basket of eggs in lukewarm water, in a new method of boiling eggs dubbed periodic cooking. (Emilia Di Lorenzo, Ernesto Di Maio via AP) This photo provided by researchers in February 2025 shows two pots, one with boiling water, left, and the other with a basket of eggs in lukewarm water, in a new method of boiling eggs dubbed periodic cooking. (Emilia Di Lorenzo, Ernesto Di Maio via AP) Their final recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water  one boiling and the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius)  for a total of 32 minutes before cooling under running water and peeling. You could definitely do this at home with half a dozen eggs or so, said Gregory Weiss, a chemist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research.  In the method proposed by the researchers, dubbed periodic cooking, the egg whites heated and cooled until fully set. The yolk, on the other hand, held firm at a constant temperature and cooked until creamy. 
        
     You can almost spread it, like on bread, said study author Emilia Di Lorenzo from the University of Naples Federico II. To confirm they had cooked up something new, the researchers tested the chemical makeup of the prepared eggs and served them to a panel of eight tasters alongside traditional boiled eggs. The research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Engineering. This new technique could mean more time in the kitchen compared to a standard hard-boiled egg, said food scientist Joanne Slavin from the University of Minnesota. But the blend of textures on the tongue could be worth the extra time. This is a slower process to get a better outcome, said Slavin, who had no role in the study. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Telescopes spy a monster radio jet streaming from a bright and early object in the universe,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Telescopes around the world have spotted a monster radio jet streaming from a quasar dating back to the first 1 billion years of the universe.  At double the width of our Milky Way galaxy, this jet of radio waves is the biggest ever detected so early in the history of the universe, astronomers reported Thursday.  Radio jets like this are not uncommon in our cosmic neighborhood. But theyve been elusive in the distant early universe  until now  because of the obscuring cosmic microwave background left over from the Big Bang. Its only because this object is so extreme that we can observe it from Earth, even though its really far away, lead author Anniek Gloudemans of the National Science Foundations NoirLab said in a statement. Observatories across Europe and in Hawaii and Texas contributed to the study appearing in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The double-sided radio wave is estimated to be at least 200,000 light-years across. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.  Discovered just a few years ago, the quasar powering this jet formed when the universe was just 9% of its current age  within the first 1.2 billion years. Some of the brightest objects in the universe, quasars are galactic cores with gas and dust falling into a black hole, releasing a tremendous amount of energy that makes them exceedingly luminous.  The mass of this quasar is equivalent to 450 million times our sun with a black hole that is not particularly massive. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Earths mini moon may have been a chunk of our actual moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Planet Earth is parting company with an asteroid thats been tagging along as a mini moon for the past two months. The harmless space rock will peel away on Monday, overcome by the stronger tug of the suns gravity. But it will zip closer for a quick visit in January.  NASA will use a radar antenna to observe the 33-foot (10-meter) asteroid then. That should deepen scientists understanding of the object known as 2024 PT5, quite possibly a boulder that was blasted off the moon by an impacting, crater-forming asteroid.

(AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) While not technically a moon  NASA stresses it was never captured by Earths gravity and fully in orbit  its an interesting object worthy of study. The astrophysicist brothers who identified the asteroids mini moon behavior, Raul and Carlos de la Fuente Marcos of Complutense University of Madrid, have collaborated with telescopes in the Canary Islands for hundreds of observations so far.  Currently more than 2 million miles (3.5 million kilometers) away, the object is too small and faint to see without a powerful telescope. It will pass as close as 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers) of Earth in January, maintaining a safe distance before it zooms farther into the solar system while orbiting the sun, not to return until 2055. Thats almost five times farther than the moon. First spotted in August, the asteroid began its semi jog around Earth in late September, after coming under the grips of Earths gravity and following a horseshoe-shaped path. By the time it returns next year, it will be moving too fast  more than double its speed from September  to hang around, said Raul de la Fuente Marcos. 
        
     NASA will track the asteroid for more than a week in January using the Goldstone solar system radar antenna in Californias Mojave Desert, part of the Deep Space Network. Current data suggest that during its 2055 visit, the sun-circling asteroid will once again make a temporary and partial lap around Earth.

Fossilized dinosaur feces and vomit help scientists reconstruct the creatures rise,"NEW YORK (AP)  Using fossilized feces and vomit samples from Poland, scientists have reconstructed how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth millions of years ago. Researchers arent sure whether dinosaurs rise over the course of 30 million years happened because of luck, skill, climate or some combination. But they came away knowing this: It was not a sudden thing, said study co-author Martin Qvarnstrm from Uppsala University.  The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, analyzed hundreds of dino droppings to reconstruct who was eating whom 200 million years ago.  The first dinosaurs were go-getters, Qvarnstrm said, eating whatever they could  including insects, fish and plants.  When climate conditions changed, they were quick to adapt. Plant-eating dinosaurs, for example, ate a greater variety of greens than other vegetarians of the time, so it was easier to expand their palates when wetter conditions gave rise to new plant species. Since the studys findings were limited to Polish fossils, Qvarnstrm said hed like to see if their ideas hold steady against fossil records from around the world. Its not uncommon for scientists to study ancient fecal matter to understand creatures of the past, said Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. But fossilized feces can resemble blobs or chunks of rock, and they are not always found near fossils of the animal that made them  which makes it hard for scientists to know where they came from.  
        
     In this study, researchers found fish scales, insect bits and bone shards nestled within the droppings. They are a really unassuming, quite plain part of the background, said Dunne, who was not involved with the new research. But they hold so much delicate, fine information. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Northern lights may be faintly visible across parts of the US this Thanksgiving,"NEW YORK (AP)  This Thanksgiving, solar storms may produce faint auroras across the northern rim of the United States. Pale auroras may be seen across many northern states Thursday and Friday, but they may be brief and and seeing them will depend on how intense the solar storms get, NOAA meteorologist Mike Bettwy said in an email.  Much of the following states are best positioned for potential auroras: Washington, Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Maine. Northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire may also see auroras.  Space weather experts say auroras could be visible from 10 p.m. EST Thursday to 1 a.m. Friday EST, though its difficult to pin down an exact window. Updated forecasts may be available as the event draws closer on NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app. To spy the spectacle, wait for clear skies to get dark and then go outside, ideally away from bright city lights. Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that arent visible to the naked eye. The sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, making solar surges and northern lights more frequent. Earlier this week, the sun shot a pulse of high-energy plasma towards Earth.  The active period is expected to last for at least another year, though scientists wont know when solar activity peaked until months after the fact, according to NASA and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
        
     Experts dont expect major communication disruptions from this weeks solar storm. In May, NOAA issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning  it was the strongest storm in more than two decades, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. Last month, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when auroras appeared in unexpected places, including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City. - The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Muddy footprints suggest 2 species of early humans were neighbors in Kenya 1.5 million years ago,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Muddy footprints left on a Kenyan lakeside suggest two of our early human ancestors were nearby neighbors some 1.5 million years ago. The footprints were left in the mud by two different species within a matter of hours, or at most days, said paleontologist Louise Leakey, co-author of the research published Thursday in the journal Science.  Scientists previously knew from fossil remains that these two extinct branches of the human evolutionary tree  called Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei  lived about the same time in the Turkana Basin. But dating fossils is not exact. Its plus or minus a few thousand years, said paleontologist William Harcourt-Smith of Lehman College and the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who was not involved in the study. Yet with fossil footprints, theres an actual moment in time preserved, he said. Its an amazing discovery. The tracks of fossil footprints were uncovered in 2021 in what is today Koobi Fora, Kenya, said Leaky, who is based at New Yorks Stony Brook University. Whether the two individuals passed by the eastern side of Lake Turkana at the same time  or a day or two apart  they likely knew of each others existence, said study co-author Kevin Hatala, a paleoanthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh. They probably saw each other, probably knew each other was there and probably influenced each other in some way, he said. 
        
     Scientists were able to distinguish between the two species because of the shape of the footprints, which holds clues to the anatomy of the foot and how its being used. H. erectus appeared to be walking similar to how modern humans walk  striking the ground heel first, then rolling weight over the ball of the foot and toes and pushing off again. The other species, which was also walking upright, was moving in a different way from anything else weve seen before, anywhere else, said co-author Erin Marie Williams-Hatala, a human evolutionary anatomist at Chatham. Among other details, the footprints suggest more mobility in their big toe, compared to H. erectus or modern humans, said Hatala. Our common primate ancestors probably had hands and feet adapted for grasping branches, but over time the feet of human ancestors evolved to enable walking upright, researchers say. The new study adds to a growing body of research that implies this transformation to bipedalism  walking on two feet  didnt happen at a single moment, in a single way. Rather, there may have been a variety of ways that early humans learned to walk, run, stumble and slide on prehistoric muddy slopes. It turns out, there are different gait mechanics  different ways of being bipedal, said Harcourt-Smith. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Billionaire who performed the first private spacewalk is Trumps pick to lead NASA,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A tech billionaire who bought a series of spaceflights from Elon Musks SpaceX and conducted the first private spacewalk was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to lead NASA. Jared Isaacman, 41, CEO and founder of a credit card-processing company, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with SpaceX. He took along contest winners on that 2021 trip and followed it in September with a flight where he briefly popped out the hatch to test SpaceXs new spacewalking suits. If confirmed, Isaacman will replace Bill Nelson, 82, a former Democratic senator from Florida who was nominated by President Joe Biden. Nelson flew aboard space shuttle Columbia in 1986  on the flight right before the Challenger disaster  while a congressman. Isaacman said he was honored to be nominated and would be grateful to serve. Having been fortunate to see our amazing planet from space, I am passionate about America leading the most incredible adventure in human history, he said via X.  During Nelsons tenure, NASA picked up steam in its effort to return astronauts to the moon. This next-generation Apollo program  named after Apollos mythological twin sister Artemis  plans to send four astronauts around the moon as soon as next year. The first moon landing in more than half a century would follow. NASA is counting on SpaceX to get astronauts to the lunar surface via Starship, the mega rocket launching out of Texas on test flights. 
        
     The space agency already relies on SpaceX to fly astronauts to and from the International Space Station along with supply runs. Boeing launched its first crew for NASA in June, but the Starliner capsule encountered so many problems that the two test pilots ended up stuck at the space station. Theyll catch a ride home with SpaceX in February, after more than eight months in orbit. Their mission should have lasted eight days. Also on NASAs plate right now: exploring the solar system. Robotic missions to the moon and beyond continues with a NASA spacecraft en route to Jupiters watery moon Europa and the Mars rover Perseverance collecting more rock and dirt samples.  Facing tight budgets, NASA is seeking a quicker, cheaper way of getting these Martian samples to Earth than the original plan, which had swollen to $11 billion with nothing arriving before 2040. As with human spaceflight, NASA has turned to industry and others for ideas and help. Musk congratulated Isaacman via X, describing him as a man of high ability and integrity. The fighter jet-piloting Isaacman, whose call name is Rook, short for rookie, has described himself as a space geek since kindergarten. He dropped out of high school when he was 16, got a GED certificate and started a business in his parents basement that became the genesis for Shift4. His business is based in eastern Pennsylvania, where he lives with his wife and their two young daughters.  He set a speed record flying around the world in 2009 while raising money for the Make-A-Wish program, and later established Draken International, the worlds largest private fleet of fighter jets. Isaacman has reserved two more flights with SpaceX, including a trip leading Starships first crew into orbit around Earth.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

European satellites launched to create artificial solar eclipses in a tech demo,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A pair of European satellites rocketed into orbit Thursday on the first mission to create artificial solar eclipses through fancy formation flying in space. Each fake eclipse should last six hours once operations begin next year. Thats considerably longer than the few minutes of totality offered by a natural eclipse here on Earth, allowing for prolonged study of the suns corona, or outer atmosphere. The launch took place from India. We are a very happy science team here in India, the European Space Agencys mission scientist Joe Zender said via email. Billed as a tech demo, the two satellites will separate in a month or so and fly 492 feet (150 meters) apart once reaching their destination high above Earth, lining up with the sun so that one spacecraft casts a shadow on the other. This will require extreme precision, within just one millimeter, equivalent to a fingernails thickness, according to the European Space Agency. To maintain their position, the satellites will rely on GPS, star trackers, lasers and radio links, flying autonomously. Each cube-shaped spacecraft is less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. The shadow-casting satellite holds a disk to block the sun from the telescope on the other satellite. This disk will mimic the moon in a natural total solar eclipse, with the darkened satellite posing as Earth. This has a huge scientific relevance in addition to testing high-precision formation flying, said the European Space Agencys technology and engineering director Dietmar Pilz. 
        
     Scientists need the glaring face of the sun completely blocked in order to scrutinize the wispy crown-like corona encircling it, getting an especially good look close to the solar rim on this mission. Theyre particularly interested to learn why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun, and also want to better understand coronal mass ejections, eruptions of billions of tons of plasma with magnetic fields out into space.  The resulting geomagnetic storms can disrupt power and communication on Earth and in orbit. Such outbursts can also produce stunning auroras in unexpected places.  With a lopsided orbit stretching from 370 miles (600 kilometers) to 37,000 miles (60,000 kilometers) away, the satellites will take nearly 20 hours to circle the world. Six of those hours  at the farther end of certain orbits  will be spent generating an eclipse. Other orbits will be strictly for formation flying experiments, according to the European Space Agency. The first eclipse results should be available in March, following checkout of both craft. Zender said eclipses will be created at least twice a week, with six hours of totality each time for corona observations. The frequency will depend on solar activity, he noted, and prove a boon for scientists who now must travel across the world for a mere three to five minutes of totality during the occasional eclipse. The $210 million mission, dubbed Proba-3, is aiming for at least 1,000 hours of on demand totality during its two-year operation. Once their job is done, both satellites will gradually drop lower until they burn up in the atmosphere, likely within five years. Liftoff was delayed a day by a last-minute issue with the backup propulsion system of one of the satellites, crucial for precision formation flying. The European Space Agency said engineers relied on a computer software fix. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASAs stuck astronauts hit 6 months in space. Just 2 more to go,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Known across the globe as the stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams hit the six-month mark in space Thursday with two more to go. The pair rocketed into orbit on June 5, the first to ride Boeings new Starliner crew capsule on what was supposed to be a weeklong test flight. They arrived at the International Space Station the next day, only after overcoming a cascade of thruster failures and helium leaks. NASA deemed the capsule too risky for a return flight, so it will be February before their long and trying mission comes to a close. While NASA managers bristle at calling them stuck or stranded, the two retired Navy captains shrug off the description of their plight. They insist theyre fine and accepting of their fate. Wilmore views it as a detour of sorts: Were just on a different path. I like everything about being up here, Williams told students Wednesday from an elementary school named for her in Needham, Massachusetts, her hometown. Just living in space is super fun. Both astronauts have lived up there before so they quickly became full-fledged members of the crew, helping with science experiments and chores like fixing a broken toilet, vacuuming the air vents and watering the plants. Williams took over as station commander in September. Mindset does go a long way, Wilmore said in response to a question from Nashville first-graders in October. Hes from Mount Juliet, Tennessee. I dont look at these situations in life as being downers. 
        
     Boeing flew its Starliner capsule home empty in September, and NASA moved Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight not due back until late February. Two other astronauts were bumped to make room and to keep to a six-month schedule for crew rotations. Like other station crews, Wilmore and Williams trained for spacewalks and any unexpected situations that might arise. When the crews go up, they know they could be there for up to a year, said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio found that out the hard way when the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement capsule for him and two cosmonauts in 2023, pushing their six-month mission to just past a year.  Boeing said this week that input from Wilmore and Williams has been invaluable in the ongoing inquiry of what went wrong. The company said in a statement that it is preparing for Starliners next flight but declined comment on when it might launch again. NASA also has high praise for the pair.  Whether it was luck or whether it was selection, they were great folks to have for this mission, NASAs chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, said during an interview with The Associated Press. On top of everything else, Williams, 59, has had to deal with rumors, as she calls them, of serious weight loss. She insists her weight is the same as it was on launch day, which Polk confirms. During Wednesdays student chat, Williams said she didnt have much of an appetite when she first arrived in space. But now shes super hungry and eating three meals a day plus snacks, while logging the required two hours of daily exercise.  Williams, a distance runner, uses the space station treadmill to support races in her home state. She competed in Cape Cods 7-mile Falmouth Road Race in August. She ran the 2007 Boston Marathon up there as well. She has a New England Patriots shirt with her for game days, as well as a Red Sox spring training shirt. Hopefully Ill be home before that happens -- but you never know, she said in November. Husband Michael Williams, a retired federal marshal and former Navy aviator, is caring for their dogs back home in Houston. As for Wilmore, 61, hes missing his younger daughters senior year in high school and his older daughters theater productions in college. We cant deny that being unexpectedly separated, especially during the holidays when the entire family gets together, brings increased yearnings to share the time and events together, his wife, Deanna Wilmore, told the AP in a text this week. Her husband has it worse than us since hes confined to the space station and can only connect via video for short periods. We are certainly looking forward to February!! she wrote. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA pushes back astronaut flights to the moon again,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA announced more delays Thursday in sending astronauts back to the moon more than 50 years after Apollo. Administrator Bill Nelson said the next mission in the Artemis program -- flying four astronauts around the moon and back  is now targeted for April 2026. It had been on the books for September 2025, after slipping from this year.  The investigation into heat shield damage from the capsules initial test flight two years ago took time, officials said, and other spacecraft improvements are still needed. This bumps the third Artemis mission  a moon landing by two other astronauts  to at least 2027. NASA had been aiming for 2026. NASAs Artemis program, a follow-up to the Apollo moonshots of the late 1960s and early 1970s, has completed only one mission. An empty Orion capsule circled the moon in 2022 after blasting off on NASAs new Space Launch System rocket. Although the launch and lunar laps went well, the capsule returned with an excessively charred and eroded bottom heat shield, damaged from the heat of reentry. It took until recently for engineers to pinpoint the cause and come up with a plan.  NASA will use the Orion capsule with its original heat shield for the next flight with four astronauts, according to Nelson, but make changes to the reentry path at flights end. To rip off and replace the heat shield would have meant at least a full years delay and stalled the moon landing even further, officials said. 
        
     During the flight test, NASA had the capsule dip in and out of the atmosphere during reentry, and gases built up in the heat shields outer layer, officials said. That resulted in cracking and uneven shedding of the outer material. The commander of the lunar fly-around, astronaut Reid Wiseman, took part in Thursdays news conference at NASA headquarters in Washington. His crew includes NASA astronauts Victor Glover and Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen.  Delays are agonizing and slowing down is agonizing and its not what we like to do, Wiseman said. But he said he and his crew wanted the heat shield damage from the first flight to be fully understood, regardless of how long it took. Now they can focus with this large decision behind us. Twenty-four astronauts flew to the moon during NASAs vaulted Apollo program, with 12 landing on it. The final bootprints in the lunar dust were made during Apollo 17 in December 1972. Nelson said the revised schedule should still have the United States getting astronauts back on the lunar surface before China, which has indicated 2030 for a crew moon landing.  The space agency has put all the Artemis contractors, including Elon Musks SpaceX, on notice to double-down to meet the schedule deadlines, according to Nelson. SpaceXs mega rocket Starship  making test flights from Texas with increasing frequency  is how astronauts will get from the Orion capsule in lunar orbit down to the surface on the first two Artemis moon landings. Nelson said hes already called Jared Isaacman, the SpaceX-flying billionaire nominated this week by Trump to lead NASA, and invited him to NASA headquarters in Washington.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

What are the benefits of weighted blankets? Heres what the science says,"NEW YORK (AP)  Rhonda James was skeptical when her husband ordered a weighted blanket for her online. But five minutes after she wrapped it around her body, she zonked out. It felt like a really big hug, said James, a banker in Charleston, South Carolina. As outside temperatures grow chilly, weighted blankets can be a popular choice to warm up. Some people say the added pressure helps them soothe the worries of the day and get to sleep faster. But research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets is limited. Heres what to know. Weighted blankets come with extra heft in the form of glass beads, pellets, cotton or another filling. Scientists havent studied exactly how the blankets work, but they have a few ideas. The blankets firm touch may calm the brains fight-or-flight response, said Dr. Neal Walia, a sleep medicine expert at UCLA Health. Weighted blankets on display in a Saatva mattress showroom in New York, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon) Weighted blankets on display in a Saatva mattress showroom in New York, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon) The evenly distributed weight on you tells your body, Hey, youre in a calm environment, he said. The extra pressure also may signal the brain to release whats called the love hormone, also known as oxytocin. Its produced during bonding and cuddling, and can also lower anxiety, Walia said. 
        
     For most healthy adults, experts say to choose a blanket that is about 10% of their body weight. So a 150-pound person may opt for a 15-pound blanket.  Weighted blankets are not recommended for babies or toddlers since they can hinder movement and breathing.  People with sleep apnea, sleep-related disorders or respiratory problems should check with a doctor before using a weighted blanket. 
        
     The blankets arent for everyone and each person gets the best out of their blanket differently. For example, some may find them too hot to use during warmer months. And the extra swaddling comes at a cost: quality weighted blankets can range from $50 to over $300 depending on the size, weight and material. James takes hers out of the closet to unwind when shes watching TV or sipping a glass of wine. Lucy Taylor, a freelance writer from Wales, uses her blanket to fall asleep when her anxiety spikes during the winter. If my bodys relaxed, my mind follows suit, she said. Weighted blankets on display in a Saatva mattress showroom in New York, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon) Weighted blankets on display in a Saatva mattress showroom in New York, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon) There isnt a ton of research on whether weighted blankets actually work, and the studies that do exist are on small groups. Most studies dont focus on the average sleeper. Instead, they investigate whether weighted blankets can help people with chronic sleep problems, mental health conditions or developmental disorders. There are some hints that weighted blankets can help with anxiety, chronic pain and sleep. But the research isnt conclusive. A study on 120 people with insomnia found that the weighted blankets helped them sleep better compared to a light blanket. Another study on 67 children with autism found the weighted blanket didnt affect their sleep at all  but the children and their parents preferred it to a regular blanket. And a third study on 94 adults with chronic pain found that a heavier weighted blanket didnt affect sleep, but was better at reducing pain compared to a lighter one.

"How to catch the Geminids, one of the strongest meteor showers of the year","The Geminids  among the few major meteor showers to come from asteroids  will be visible until Dec. 21, although peak viewing was on Dec. 13. Heres what to know about the Geminids and other meteor showers. Its one of the years last chances to see fireballs in the sky. The shower often produces meteors with a distinctly more yellow glow, likely due to the unusual origin material, said Sally Brummel, planetarium manager at the University of Minnesotas Bell Museum.  Under ideal viewing conditions, the Geminids typically put on one of the best and brightest shows of the year because of the high volume of meteors visible each hour. However, an almost full moon this year means up to 15 meteors per hour were expected at peak time, according to the American Meteor Society.  The moonlight will wash out a lot of them, Brummel said.  Viewing lasts until Dec. 21. Heres what to know about the Geminids and other meteor showers.  Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you dont need special equipment to see them.  Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets, but a few  including the Geminids  result from the debris of asteroids. The Geminids come from the sun-orbiting asteroid 3200 Phaethon.  When rocks from space enter Earths atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them  the end of a shooting star.  
        
     The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky. The rocky nature of asteroid debris makes the Geminids especially likely to produce fireballs, said NASAs William Cooke. Those are pretty tough rocks that can penetrate deep into the atmosphere, he said. Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.  Its easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest. And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you arent checking your phone.  The next meteor shower, the Ursids, will peak on Dec. 22. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Ancient genes pinpoint when humans and Neanderthals mixed and mingled,"NEW YORK (AP)  Neanderthals and humans likely mixed and mingled during a narrow time frame 45,000 years ago, scientists reported Thursday. Researchers analyzed ancient genes to pinpoint the time period, which is slightly more recent than previous estimates for the mating. Modern humans emerged in Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago and eventually spread to Europe, Asia and beyond. Somewhere along the way, they met and mated with Neanderthals, leaving a lasting fingerprint on our genetic code. Scientists dont know exactly when or how the two groups entangled. But ancient bone fragments and genes are helping scientists figure that out. Genetic data from these samples really helps us paint a picture in more and more detail, said study co-author Priya Moorjani at the University of California Berkeley. The research published Thursday in the journals Science and Nature. To pin down the timeline, researchers peeked at some of the oldest human genes from the skull of a woman, called Zlat k or Golden horse for a hill in the Czech Republic where it was found. They also examined bone fragments from an early human population in Ranis, Germany, about 140 miles (230 kilometers) away. They found snippets of Neanderthal DNA that placed the mating at around 45,000 years ago. In a separate study, researchers tracked signs of Neanderthal in our genetic code over 50,000 years. They found Neanderthal genes related to immunity and metabolism that may have helped early humans survive and thrive outside of Africa.  
        
     We still carry Neanderthals legacy in our DNA. Modern-day genetic quirks linked to skin color, hair color and even nose shape can be traced back to our extinct former neighbors. And our genetic code also contains echoes from another group of extinct human cousins called Denisovans. Future genetic studies can help scientists detangle exactly what  and who  were made of, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonians Human Origins program who was not involved with the new research. Out of many really compelling areas of scientific investigation, one of them is: well, who are we? Potts said. - The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How old are Saturns rings? Study suggests they could be 4.5 billion years old just like the planet,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  New research suggests that Saturns rings may be older than they look  possibly as old as the planet.  Instead of being a youthful 400 million years old as commonly thought, the icy, shimmering rings could be around 4.5 billion years old just like Saturn, a Japanese-led team reported Monday.  The scientists surmise Saturns rings may be pristine not because they are young but because they are dirt-resistant.  This April 25, 2007 image made available by NASA shows a part of the rings of the planet Saturn, as seen from the Cassini spacecraft. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute via AP) This April 25, 2007 image made available by NASA shows a part of the rings of the planet Saturn, as seen from the Cassini spacecraft. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute via AP) Saturns rings are long thought to be between 100 million and 400 million years old based on more than a decade of observations by NASAs Cassini spacecraft before its demise in 2017.  Images by Cassini showed no evidence of any darkening of the rings by impacting micrometeoroids  space rock particles smaller than a grain of sand  prompting scientists to conclude the rings formed long after the planet.  Through computer modeling, the Institute of Science Tokyos Ryuki Hyodo and his team demonstrated that micrometeoroids vaporize once slamming into the rings, with little if any dark and dirty residue left behind. They found that the resulting charged particles get sucked toward Saturn or out into space, keeping the rings spotless and challenging the baby rings theory. Their results appear in the journal Nature Geoscience. This Aug. 22, 2009 image made available by NASA shows a section of Saturns rings, as seen from the Cassini spacecraft. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute via AP) This Aug. 22, 2009 image made available by NASA shows a section of Saturns rings, as seen from the Cassini spacecraft. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute via AP) Hyodo said its possible Saturns rings could be somewhere between the two extreme ages  around the halfway mark of 2.25 billion years old. But the solar system was much more chaotic during its formative years with large planetary-type objects migrating and interacting all over the place, just the sort of scenario that would be conducive to producing Saturns rings.  
        
     Considering the solar systems evolutionary history, its more likely that the rings formed closer to Saturns earliest times, he said in an email. This July 6, 2017 image made available by NASA shows the planet Saturn on the sunlit side of the rings from a distance of about 47,000 miles (76,000 kilometers), as seen from the Cassini spacecraft.

Two stars may be orbiting each other near a supermassive black hole in our Milky Way galaxy,"NEW YORK (AP)  Scientists have spotted what appear to be two stars whipping around each other near the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. Nearly every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart. The one in the middle of the Milky Way, called Sagittarius A (with an asterisk denoting star), is about 4 million times more massive than our sun and is relatively quiet, occasionally swallowing gas or dust that comes its way. Scientists know stars can form near and even orbit these black hole behemoths, but theyve never seen a pair of stars survive so close by. The research was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The celestial sighting is interesting and unusual, and more research is needed to be certain of what the objects are, said astrophysicist Anna Ciurlo with the University of California, Los Angeles.  This leaves some questions still open, said Ciurlo, who was not involved with the new research. At about 2.7 million years old, the twin stars seem to be fairly young. Scientists said they appear to orbit each other at just the right distance: If they were too spread out, the black holes gravity would rip them apart. Any closer and theyd merge into a single star. Even so, the cosmic duo wont stay stable forever. They could meld into one eventually though the timing is uncertain, said study lead author Florian Peissker from the University of Cologne. We are actually in a really lucky situation, he said. We observed the system just in time. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASAs 2 stuck astronauts face more time in space with return delayed until at least late March,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs two stuck astronauts just got their space mission extended again. That means they wont be back on Earth until spring, 10 months after rocketing into orbit on Boeings Starliner capsule.  NASA announced the latest delay in Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams homecoming on Tuesday.  The two test pilots planned on being away just a week or so when they blasted off June 5 on Boeings first astronaut flight to the International Space Station. Their mission grew from eight days to eight months after NASA decided to send the companys problem-plagued Starliner capsule back empty in September.  Now the pair wont return until the end of March or even April because of a delay in launching their replacements, according to NASA.  A fresh crew needs to launch before Wilmore and Williams can return and the next mission has been bumped more than a month, according to the space agency.  NASAs next crew of four was supposed to launch in February, followed by Wilmore and Williams return home by the end of that month alongside two other astronauts. But SpaceX needs more time to prepare the brand new capsule for liftoff. That launch is now scheduled for no earlier than late March. NASA said it considered using a different SpaceX capsule to fly up the replacement crew in order to keep the flights on schedule. But it decided the best option was to wait for the new capsule to transport the next crew.  
        
     NASA prefers to have overlapping crews at the space station for a smoother transition, according to officials. Most space station missions last six months, with a few reaching a full year. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

A new neutrino detector in China aims to spot mysterious ghost particles lurking around us,"KAIPING, China (AP)  Underneath a granite hill in southern China, a massive detector is nearly complete that will sniff out the mysterious ghost particles lurking around us. The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory will soon begin the difficult task of spotting neutrinos: tiny cosmic particles with a mind-bogglingly small mass. The detector is one of three being built across the globe to study these elusive ghost particles in the finest detail yet. The other two, based in the United States and Japan, are still under construction. Spying neutrinos is no small feat in the quest to understand how the universe came to be. The Chinese effort, set to go online next year, will push the technology to new limits, said Andre de Gouvea, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University who is not involved with the project.  If they can pull that off, he said, it would be amazing. Neutrinos date back to the Big Bang, and trillions zoom through our bodies every second. They spew from stars like the sun and stream out when atomic bits collide in a particle accelerator. Scientists have known about the existence of neutrinos for almost a century, but theyre still in the early stages of figuring out what the particles really are. Its the least understood particle in our world, said Cao Jun, who helps manage the detector known as JUNO. Thats why we need to study it. 
        
     Theres no way to spot the tiny neutrinos whizzing around on their own. Instead, scientists measure what happens when they collide with other bits of matter, producing flashes of light or charged particles. Neutrinos bump into other particles only very rarely, so to up their chances of catching a collision, physicists have to think big. The solution for how we measure these neutrinos is to build very, very big detectors, de Gouvea said. The $300 million detector in Kaiping, China, took over nine years to build. Its location 2,297 feet (700 meters) underground protects from pesky cosmic rays and radiation that could throw off its neutrino-sniffing abilities. On Wednesday, workers began the final step in construction. Eventually, theyll fill the orb-shaped detector with a liquid designed to emit light when neutrinos pass through and submerge the whole thing in purified water. Itll study antineutrinos  an opposite to neutrinos which allow scientists to understand their behavior  produced from collisions inside two nuclear power plants located over 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. When the antineutrinos come into contact with particles inside the detector, theyll produce a flash of light. The detector is specially designed to answer a key question about a longstanding mystery. Neutrinos switch between three flavors as they zip through space, and scientists want to rank them from lightest to heaviest. Sensing these subtle shifts in the already evasive particles will be a challenge, said Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University who is not involved with the project.  Its actually a very daring thing to even go after it, she said. Chinas detector is set to operate during the second half of next year. After that, itll take some time to collect and analyze the data  so scientists will have to keep waiting to fully unearth the secret lives of neutrinos. Two similar neutrino detectors  Japans Hyper-Kamiokande and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment based in the United States  are under construction. Theyre set to go online around 2027 and 2031 and will cross-check the China detectors results using different approaches. In the end, we have a better understanding of the nature of physics, said Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of the Chinese effort.  Though neutrinos barely interact with other particles, theyve been around since the dawn of time. Studying these Big Bang relics can clue scientists into how the universe evolved and expanded billions of years ago. Theyre part of the big picture, Scholberg said. One question researchers hope neutrinos can help answer is why the universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter with its opposing counterpart  called antimatter  largely snuffed out.  Scientists dont know how things got to be so out of balance, but they think neutrinos could have helped write the earliest rules of matter. The proof, scientists say, may lie in the particles. Theyll have to catch them to find out. ___ AP video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this report.

The last meteor shower of the year peaks a few days before Christmas,"The last meteor shower of the year  the Ursids  peaks Sunday, a few days before Christmas.  While usually not as bright as the Geminids, the Ursid meteor shower can yield surprises.  The Ursids are generally a sparse meteor shower, producing about 5 to 10 visible meteors per hour under ideal viewing conditions, said Shyam Balaji at Kings College London.  But outbursts in 1945 and 1986 produced up to 100 meteors per hour, he said.  This unpredictability keeps skywatchers interested, said Balaji, adding its not possible to predict in advance what this year will bring.  Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets and theres no special equipment needed to view them. The Ursids come from the comet 8P/Tuttle.  The moon will be 59% full that night, obscuring some meteors. Viewing lasts until Dec. 26.

NASAs Parker Solar Probe aims to fly closer to the sun like never before,"NEW YORK (AP)  A NASA spacecraft aims to fly closer to the sun than any object sent before.  The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to get a close-up look at the sun. Since then, it has flown straight through the suns corona: the outer atmosphere visible during a total solar eclipse.  The next milestone: closest approach to the sun. Plans call for Parker on Tuesday to hurtle through the sizzling solar atmosphere and pass within a record-breaking 3.8 million miles (6 million kilometers) of the suns surface.  At that moment, if the sun and Earth were at opposite ends of a football field, Parker would be on the 4-yard line, said NASAs Joe Westlake. Mission managers wont know how Parker fared until days after the flyby since the spacecraft will be out of communication range.  Parker planned to get more than seven times closer to the sun than previous spacecraft, hitting 430,000 mph (690,000 kph) at closest approach. Its the fastest spacecraft ever built and is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand scorching temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius). Itll continue circling the sun at this distance until at least September. Scientists hope to better understand why the corona is hundreds of times hotter than the suns surface and what drives the solar wind, the supersonic stream of charged particles constantly blasting away from the sun.  The suns warming rays make life possible on Earth. But severe solar storms can temporarily scramble radio communications and disrupt power.  
        
     The sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, triggering colorful auroras in unexpected places.  It both is our closest, friendliest neighbor, Westlake said, but also at times is a little angry. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Northern lights could be visible in upper fringes of the US this New Years Eve,"NEW YORK (AP)  Theres a chance solar storms may bring northern lights to several northern U.S states just in time for the new year.  The sun expelled two bursts of plasma that are hurtling toward Earth and are expected to arrive early this week, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Once they arrive, they may spark colorful auroras Monday and Tuesday nights in Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. Parts of Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Iowa and New York may also get a piece of the view. The early morning hours on Tuesday while its still dark should have the best chance of producing a light show, NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl said.  Updated forecasts may be available as the event draws closer on NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app. To spy the spectacle, wait for clear skies to get dark and then go outside, ideally away from bright city lights. Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that arent visible to the naked eye. The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, making solar surges and northern lights more frequent.  The active period is expected to last for at least another year, though scientists wont know when solar activity peaked until months after the fact. 
        
     NOAA is monitoring this weeks solar storms for possible minor disruptions to high-frequency radio communications, which are used by airlines and amateur radio operators. In May, NOAA issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning  it was the strongest storm in more than two decades, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And in October, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when auroras appeared in unexpected places, including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City. - The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"How to catch the Quadrantids, the first meteor shower of 2025","WASHINGTON (AP)  When the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks on Friday, it will be the years first chance to see fireballs in the sky.  A waning crescent moon means good visibility under clear and dark conditions.  Most meteor showers are named for the constellations where they appear to originate from in the night sky. But the Quadrantids take their name from a constellation that doesnt exist anymore, said NASAs William Cooke.  These meteors usually dont have long trains, but the heads may appear as bright fireballs. The peak may reveal as many as 120 meteors per hour, according to NASA. Viewing lasts until Jan. 16. Heres what to know about the Quadrantids and other meteor showers.  As the Earth orbits the sun, several times a year it passes through debris left by passing comets  and sometimes asteroids. The source of the Quadrantids is debris from the asteroid 2003 EH1.  When these fast-moving space rocks enter Earths atmosphere, the debris encounters new resistance from the air and becomes very hot, eventually burning up.  Sometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail  the end of a shooting star. You dont need special equipment to see the various meteor showers that flash across annually, just a spot away from city lights. 
        
     The best time to watch a meteor shower is in the early predawn hours, when the moon is low in the sky. Competing sources of light  such as a bright moon or artificial glow  are the main obstacles to a clear view of meteors. Cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest are optimal viewing opportunities.  And keep looking up, not down. Your eyes will be better adapted to spot shooting stars if you arent checking your phone.  The Quadrantids will peak on a night with a slim crescent moon, just 11% full.

Takeaways from The Associated Press report on lost shipping containers,"LONG BEACH, Wash. (AP)  From clothes to metals used for manufacturing, most of the worlds everyday goods and raw materials moved over long distances are packed in large metal boxes the size of tractor-trailers and stacked on ships. Millions of containers cross the oceans every year. Not everything gets to its destination. The Associated Press looked at what happens to the thousands of shipping containers that fall off ships and are lost at sea. Sometimes hundreds of shipping containers are lost at once in storms or wrecks. Sometimes just a few containers go overboard. The fact that ships have been getting bigger over recent years has contributed to the problem. On the modern big ships, its like a high-rise building, said Jos Koning, a senior project manager at MARIN, a Netherlands-based maritime research organization that studies shipping risks. Todays largest cargo vessels are longer than three football fields. Cranes are used to lift containers and stack them in towering columns. When the industry took off some 50 years ago, ships could hold only about a tenth of the freight that todays huge ships carry. Greater size brings heightened risks. The largest ships are more difficult to maneuver and more prone to rolling in high waves. Theres a greater chance that any single box could be damaged and crushed. Such accidents can send a container stack cascading into the sea. 
        
     Accidents are often linked to cargo that has been inaccurately labeled, weighed or stored. But cargo ship operators dont have the capacity to verify all container weights and contents, and must rely on information that shippers provide. In a pilot study, the National Cargo Bureau, a nonprofit that works with the U.S. Coast Guard to inspect seagoing cargo, found that widespread mislabeling and improper stowage meant that nearly 70% of shipping containers arriving in the U.S. with dangerous goods failed the bureaus safety inspection. Despite all these problems, most of the time it arrives safely, said Ian Lennard, president of the National Cargo Bureau. Theres no clear answer. According to one trade group, at least 20,000 shipping containers have tumbled overboard in the last decade and a half. But tracking efforts are fragmented and incomplete. A few shipwrecks and disasters grab headlines, like the March crash of a cargo ship into a Baltimore bridge. But much less is known about how often containers are lost piecemeal or away from major ports. The most widely cited figures on lost shipping containers come from the World Shipping Council. The groups membership, which carries about 90% of global container traffic, self-reports their losses in a survey each year. Over 16 years of collected data through 2023, the group said an average of 1,480 containers were lost annually  but fewer in recent years. Their recent figures show 650 containers were lost in 2022 and only about 200 last year. But spills involving shippers that arent members of the council arent included in the tally. For example, not included in the 2023 total were 1,300 containers that sank near a Taiwanese port with the cargo ship Angel. Marine biologist Andrew DeVogelaere of Californias Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary has spent 15 years studying the environmental impacts of a single container that was found in sanctuary waters. We are leaving time capsules on the bottom of the sea of everything we buy and sell  sitting down there for maybe hundreds of years, he said. The first thing that happens is they land and crush everything underneath them, said DeVogelaere. Debris that washed ashore in Long Beach, Washington, matched items lost off the giant cargo ship ONE Apus in November 2020. When the ship hit heavy swells on a voyage from China to California, nearly 2,000 containers slid into the Pacific. Court documents and industry reports show the vessel was carrying more than $100,000 worth of bicycle helmets and thousands of cartons of Crocs, as well as electronics and other more hazardous goods: batteries, ethanol and 54 containers of fireworks. Researchers mapped the flow of debris to several Pacific coastlines thousands of miles apart, including in Washington state and the remote Midway Atoll, a national wildlife refuge for millions of seabirds near the Hawaiian Islands. In Sri Lanka, the consequences linger three years after a massive fire aboard the X-Press Pearl sank the container ship a few miles offshore. The disaster dumped more than 1,400 damaged shipping containers into the sea  releasing billions of plastic manufacturing pellets known as nurdles as well as thousands of tons of nitric acid, lead, methanol and sodium hydroxide, all toxic to marine life. Hemantha Withanage remembers how the beach near his home smelled of burnt chemicals. Volunteers soon collected thousands of dead fish, gills stuffed with chemical-laced plastic, and nearly 400 dead endangered sea turtles, more than 40 dolphins and six whales, their mouths jammed with plastic. It was like a war zone, he said. Cleanup crews wearing full-body hazmat suits strode into the tide with hand sieves to try to collect the lentil-size plastic pellets. The waterfront was closed to commercial fishing for three months, and the 12,000 families that depend on fishing for their income have only gotten a fraction of the $72 million that Withanage, founder of Sri Lankas nonprofit Centre for Environmental Justice, believes they are owed. Theres still an impact. This years summer winds washed thousands of plastic pellets ashore. Lloyds List Intelligence, a maritime intelligence company thats tracked thousands of marine accidents on container ships over the past decade, told AP that underreporting is rampant. Marine insurers, which are typically on the hook to pay for mishaps, likely have access to more complete data on losses  but no laws require that data to be collected and shared publicly. World Shipping Council president Joe Kramek said the industry is researching ways to reduce errors in loading and stacking containers, as well as navigating ships through turbulent waters Earlier this year, the United Nations International Maritime Organization adopted amendments to two global ocean treaties aimed at increasing transparency around lost shipping containers. Those changes, expected to take effect in 2026, will require ships to report losses to nearby coastal countries and to authorities where the vessel is registered. But with no enforceable penalties, it remains to be seen how extensively operators will comply. ___ Larson and Wieffering reported from Washington, D.C.

Solar flares may cause faint auroras across top of Northern Hemisphere,"NEW YORK (AP)  Solar storms may cause faint northern lights across fringes of the northern United States over the weekend as forecasters monitor for possible disruptions to power and communications. The suns magnetic field is currently at the peak of its 11-year cycle, making solar storms and northern lights more frequent. The sun shot out two strong flares this week, including one Thursday that was the biggest since 2017. Pale auroras may be visible as far south as South Dakota, Iowa and New York  but the storms could still intensify or weaken over the weekend. Theres still a fair amount of uncertainty, Erica Grow Cei, spokesperson for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Friday. Unusually strong solar storms in May produced jaw-dropping aurora displays across the Northern Hemisphere. This weeks storms featured fewer ejections of the high energy plasma that can drive a light show, according to NOAA. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Nobel Prize in chemistry honors 3 scientists who used AI to design proteins  lifes building blocks,"LONDON (AP)  Three scientists who discovered powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins  the building blocks of life  were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.  The prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London. Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said the award honored research that unraveled a grand challenge in chemistry, and in particular in biochemistry, for decades.  Its that breakthrough that gets awarded today, he said. 
        
     Proteins are complex molecules with thousands of atoms that twist, turn, loop and spiral in a countless array of shapes that determine their biological function. For decades, scientists have dreamed of being able to efficiently design and build new proteins.  Baker, 62, whose work has received funding from the National Institutes of Health since the 1990s, created a computer program called Rosetta that helped analyze information about existing proteins in comprehensive databases to build new proteins that dont exist in nature.  It seems that you can almost construct any type of protein now with this technology, said Johan qvist of the Nobel committee. Hassabis, 48, and Jumper, 39, created an artificial intelligence model that has predicted the structure of virtually all the 200 million proteins that researchers have ever identified. The duo managed to crack the code. With skillful use of artificial intelligence, they made it possible to predict the complex structure of essentially any known protein in nature, Linke said. The ability to custom design new proteins  and better understand existing proteins  could enable researchers to create new kinds of medicines and vaccines.  It could also allow scientists to design new enzymes to break down plastics or other waste materials that would neutralize pollution, Baker told a news conference, or even come up with entirely new material for semi conductors. I think theres fantastic prospects for making better medicines  medicines that are smarter, that only work in the right time and place in the body, Baker told The Associated Press. One example is a potential nasal spray that could slow or stop the rapid spread of specific viruses, such as COVID-19, he said. Another is a medicine to disrupt the cascade of symptoms known as cytokine storm.  That was always the holy grail. If you could figure out how protein sequences folded into their particular structures, then it might be possible to design protein sequences to fold into previously never seen structures that might be useful for us, said Jon Lorsch, a director at the NIH. Baker told the AP he found out he won the Nobel during the early hours of the morning alongside his wife, who immediately started screaming.  So it was a little deafening, too, he said. Hassabis said he was just having a normal morning at home when he eventually got the call.  The Nobel committee didnt initially have his number and first managed to get hold of his wife, but she hung up on them a few times, he told an online news briefing. They kept persisting and then I think she realized it was a Swedish number and then they asked for my number, he said. Its so incredible. Its so unreal at this moment, said Jumper, a researcher and director at Google DeepMind. And its wonderful.  One of Britains leading tech figures, Hassabis co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind in 2010, which was acquired by Google in 2014. Among its past breakthroughs was developing an AI system that mastered the Chinese game Go and defeated the games human world champion. In the past researchers labored for months or years to decode the structure of a single complex protein.  But the AI model created by the DeepMind researchers, called AlphaFold, can determine the structure of a protein pretty accurately within a few seconds or minutes, Hassabis told the AP in an interview, adding that this saves researchers years of potentially painstaking experimental work. The two research groups learned from each others work.  Baker said Hassabis and Jumpers artificial intelligence work gave his team a huge boost.  The breakthroughs made by Demis and John on protein structure prediction really highlighted to us the power that AI could have, said Baker. And that led us to apply these AI methods to protein design. Science has sped up, said Jumper. It is a key demonstration that AI will make science faster  Its the second Nobel prize this year awarded to someone with links to artificial intelligence research at Google.  Nobel physics prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, 76, often called the godfather of AI, also worked at the California-based tech company until quitting so he could speak more openly about the potential downsides of AI. Im hoping AI will lead to tremendous benefits, Hinton told a news conference Tuesday. Im convinced that it will do that in health care. My worry is that it may also lead to bad things. And in particular, when we get things more intelligent than ourselves, no one really knows whether were going to be able to control them. Wednesdays chemistry prize winners represent a younger generation taking forward the work of the AI pioneers honored for physics, said Michael Kearns, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.  They are making AI models scalable and practical and applying it to very important scientific problems.  Baker gets half of the 11 million Swedish Kronor ($1 million) prize money, while Hassabis and Jumper share the other half. The Nobel announcements opened Monday with medical researchers Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. Hinton and fellow AI pioneer John Hopfield, 91, won the physics prize. The awards continue with the literature prize Thursday, the Nobel Peace Prize Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. The prize money comes from a bequest by the awards creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobels death. ___ Larson reported from Washington, D.C, and Valdes from Seattle.

A spacecraft is on its way to a harmless asteroid slammed by NASA in a previous save-the-Earth test,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A spacecraft blasted off Monday to investigate the scene of a cosmic crash.  The European Space Agencys Hera spacecraft rocketed away on a two-year journey to the small, harmless asteroid rammed by NASA two years ago in a dress rehearsal for the day a killer space rock threatens Earth. Its the second part of a planetary defense test that could one day help save the planet. SpaceXs Falcon rocket quickly disappeared with Hera into the late morning clouds. An hour later, applause erupted in the control center in Germany as the spacecraft separated from the rockets upper stage and then called home. Its an amazing day, the space agencys director general Josef Aschbacher said afterward. The 2022 crash by NASAs Dart spacecraft shortened Dimorphos orbit around its bigger companion, demonstrating that if a dangerous rock was headed our way, theres a chance it could be knocked off course with enough advance notice. Scientists are eager to examine the impacts aftermath up close to know exactly how effective Dart was and what changes might be needed to safeguard Earth in the future. The more detail we can glean the better as it may be important for planning a future deflection mission should one be needed, University of Maryland astronomer Derek Richardson said before launch. Researchers want to know whether Dart  short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test  left a crater or perhaps reshaped the 500-foot (150-meter) asteroid more dramatically. It looked something like a flying saucer before Darts blow and may now resemble a kidney bean, said Richardson, who took part in the Dart mission and is helping with Hera. 
        
     Darts wallop sent rubble and even boulders flying off Dimorphos, providing an extra kick to the impacts momentum. The debris trail extended thousands of miles (more than 10,000 kilometers) into space for months.  Some boulders and other debris could still be hanging around the asteroid, posing a potential threat to Hera, said flight director Ignacio Tanco. We dont really know very well the environment in which we are going to operate, said Tanco. But thats the whole point of the mission is to go there and find out. European officials describe the $400 million (363 million euro) mission as a crash scene investigation.  Hera is going back to the crime site and getting all the scientific and technical information, said project manager Ian Carnelli. Carrying a dozen science instruments, the small car-sized Hera will need to swing past Mars in 2025 for a gravity boost, before arriving at Dimorphos by the end of 2026. Its a moonlet of Didymos, Greek for twin, a fast-spinning asteroid thats five times bigger. At that time, the asteroids will be 120 million miles (195 million kilometers) from Earth. Hera will attempt to go into orbit around the rocky pair, with the flyby distances gradually dropping from 18 miles (30 kilometers) all the way down to a half-mile (1 kilometer). The spacecraft will survey the moonlet for at least six months to ascertain its mass, shape and composition, as well as its orbit around Didymos. Before the impact, Dimorphos circled its larger companion from three-quarters of a mile (1,189 meters) out. Scientists believe the orbit is now tighter and oval-shaped, and that the moonlet may even be tumbling. Two shoebox-sized Cubesats will pop off Hera for even closer drone-like inspections, with one of them using radar to peer beneath the moonlets boulder-strewn surface. Scientists suspect Dimorphos was formed from material shed from Didymos. The radar observations should help confirm whether Didymos is indeed the little moons parent. The Cubesats will attempt to land on the moonlet once their survey is complete. If the moonlet is tumbling, that will complicate the endeavor. Hera may also end its mission with a precarious touchdown, but on the larger Didymos. Neither asteroid poses any threat to Earth  before or after Dart showed up. Thats why NASA picked the pair for humanitys first asteroid-deflecting demo. Leftovers from the solar systems formation 4.6 billion years ago, asteroids primarily orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in whats known as the main asteroid belt, where millions of them reside. They become near-Earth objects when theyre knocked out of the belt and into our neck of the woods. NASAs near-Earth object count currently tops 36,000, almost all asteroids but also some comets. More than 2,400 of them are considered potentially hazardous to Earth. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

A rare comet brightens the night skies in October,"NEW YORK (AP)  Prepare to spot a rare, bright comet.  The space rock is slinging toward Earth from the outer reaches of the solar system and will make its closest pass on Saturday. It should be visible through the end of October, clear skies permitting.  Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas should be bright enough to see with the naked eye, but binoculars and telescopes will give a better view.  Itll be this fuzzy circle with a long tail stretching away from it, said Sally Brummel, planetarium manager at the Bell Museum in Minnesota. Comets are frozen leftovers from the solar systems formation billions of years ago. They heat up as they swing toward the sun, releasing their characteristic streaming tails. In 2023, a green comet that last visited Earth 50,000 years ago zoomed by the planet again. Other notable flybys included Neowise in 2020, and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the mid to late 1990s. The comet, also designated C/2023 A3, was discovered last year and is named for the observatories in China and South Africa that spied it. It came from whats known as the Oort Cloud well beyond Pluto. After making its closest approach about 44 million miles (71 million kilometers) of Earth, it wont return for another 80,000 years  assuming it survives the trip.  Several comets are discovered every year, but many burn up near the sun or linger too far away to be visible without special equipment, according to Larry Denneau, a lead researcher with the Atlas telescope that helped discover the comet. 
        
     Those hoping to spot comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas should venture outside about an hour after sunset on a clear night and look to the west.  The comet should be visible from both the northern and southern hemispheres.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Scientists recreate the head of this ancient 9-foot-long bug,"WASHINGTON (AP)  As if the largest bug to ever live  a monster nearly 9 feet long with several dozen legs  wasnt terrifying enough, scientists could only just imagine what the extinct beasts head looked like. Thats because many of the fossils of these creatures are headless shells that were left behind when they molted, squirming out of their exoskeletons through the head opening as they grew ever bigger  up to 8 to 9 feet (2.6 meters) and more than 100 pounds (50 kilograms). Now, scientists have produced a mug shot after studying fossils of juveniles that were complete and very well preserved, if not quite cute. The giant bugs topper was a round bulb with two short bell-shaped antennae, two protruding eyes like a crab, and a rather small mouth adapted for grinding leaves and bark, according to new research published Wednesday in Science Advances.  Called Arthropleura, these were arthropods -- the group that includes crabs, spiders and insects  with features of modern-day centipedes and millipedes. But some of them were much, much bigger, and this one was a surprising mix.  We discovered that it had the body of a millipede, but head of a centipede, said study co-author and paleobiologist Mickael Lheritier at the University Claude Bernard Lyon in Villeurbanne, France. The largest Arthropleura may have been the biggest bugs to ever live, although there is still a debate. They may be a close second to an extinct giant sea scorpion. Researchers in Europe and North America have been collecting fragments and footprints of the huge bugs since the late 1800s. 
        
     We have been wanting to see what the head of this animal looked like for a really long time, said James Lamsdell, a paleobiologist at West Virginia University, who was not involved in the study. To produce a model of the head, researchers first used CT scans to study fossil specimens of fully intact juveniles embedded in rocks found in a French coal field in the 1980s. This technique allowed the researchers to scrutinize hidden details like bits of the head that are still embedded in the rock without marring the fossil, Lamsdell said. When you chip away at rock, you dont know what part of a delicate fossil may have been lost or damaged, he said. The juvenile fossil specimens only measured about 2 inches (6 centimeters) and its possible they were a type of Arthropleura that didnt grow to enormous sizes. But even if so, the researchers said they are close enough kin to provide a glimpse of what adults looked like  whether giant or of a less nightmarish size -- when they were alive 300 million years ago. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Severe solar storm could stress power grids even more as US deals with major back-to-back hurricanes,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A severe solar storm is headed to Earth that could stress power grids even more as the U.S. deals with major back-to-back hurricanes, space weather forecasters said Wednesday.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday into Friday after an outburst from the sun was detected earlier this week. Such a storm could temporarily disrupt power and radio signals. NOAA has notified operators of power plants and orbiting spacecraft to take precautions. It also alerted the Federal Emergency Management Agency about possible power disruptions, as the organization copes with the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene and gears up for Hurricane Milton barreling across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida.  Forecasters do not expect the latest solar storm to surpass the one that slammed Earth in May, the strongest in more than two decades. But they wont know for sure until its just 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, where spacecraft can measure it. Florida is far enough south to avoid any power disruptions from the solar surge unless it gets a lot bigger, said scientist Rob Steenburgh of NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center.  That adds a little bit more to the comfort level, Steenburgh said. Why were here is to let them know so that they can prepare. Experts are more concerned about potential effects to the power grids in areas slammed by Hurricane Helene two weeks ago, said NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl.  
        
     The storm also may trigger northern lights as far south in the U.S. as the lower Midwest and Northern California, though exact locations and times are uncertain, according to NOAA. Skygazers are reminded to point their smartphones upward for photos; the devices often can capture auroras that human eyes cannot. Mays solar storm produced dazzling auroras across the Northern Hemisphere and resulted in no major disruptions.  The sun is near the peak of its current 11-year cycle, sparking all the recent solar activity. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"In an engineering feat, mechanical SpaceX arms catch Starship rocket booster back at the launch pad","SpaceX pulled off the boldest test flight yet of its enormous Starship rocket on Sunday, catching the returning booster back at the launch pad with mechanical arms. A jubilant Elon Musk called it science fiction without the fiction part. AP AUDIO: Correspondent Julie Walker reports on SpaceXs latest engineering feat. Towering almost 400 feet (121 meters), the empty Starship blasted off at sunrise from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. It arced over the Gulf of Mexico like the four Starships before it that ended up being destroyed, either soon after liftoff or while ditching into the sea. The previous one in June had been the most successful until Sundays demo, completing its flight without exploding. This time, Musk, SpaceXs CEO and founder, upped the challenge for the rocket that he plans to use to send people back to the moon and on to Mars. At the flight directors command, the first-stage booster flew back to the launch pad where it had blasted off seven minutes earlier. The launch towers monstrous metal arms, dubbed chopsticks, caught the descending 232-foot (71-meter) stainless steel booster and gripped it tightly, dangling it well above the ground. The tower has caught the rocket!! Musk announced via X. Big step towards making life multiplanetary was made today. Company employees screamed in joy, jumping and pumping their fists into the air. NASA joined in the celebration, with Administrator Bill Nelson sending congratulations.  
        
     Continued testing of Starship will prepare the nation for landing astronauts at the moons south pole, Nelson noted. NASAs new Artemis program is the follow-up to Apollo, which put 12 men on the moon more than a half-century ago. Folks, this is a day for the engineering history books, SpaceX engineering manager Kate Tice said from SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Even in this day and age, what we just saw is magic, added company spokesman Dan Huot from near the launch and landing site. I am shaking right now. It was up to the flight director to decide, in real time with a manual control, whether to attempt the landing. SpaceX said both the booster and launch tower had to be in good, stable condition. Otherwise, it was going to end up in the gulf like the previous ones. Everything was judged to be ready for the catch. The retro-looking spacecraft launched by the booster continued around the world, soaring more than 130 miles (212 kilometers) high. An hour after liftoff, it made a controlled landing in the Indian Ocean, adding to the days achievement. Cameras on a nearby buoy showed flames shooting up from the water as the spacecraft impacted precisely at the targeted spot and sank, as planned. What a day, Huot said. Lets get ready for the next one. The June flight came up short at the end after pieces came off. SpaceX upgraded the software and reworked the heat shield, improving the thermal tiles. SpaceX has been recovering the first-stage boosters of its smaller Falcon 9 rockets for nine years, after delivering satellites and crews to orbit from Florida or California. But they land on floating ocean platforms or on concrete slabs several miles from their launch pads  not on them. Recycling Falcon boosters has sped up the launch rate and saved SpaceX millions. Musk intends to do the same for Starship, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built with 33 methane-fuel engines on the booster alone.  Musk said the captured Starship booster looked to be in good shape, with just a little warping of some of the outer engines from all the heat and aerodynamic forces. That can be fixed easily, he noted. NASA has ordered two Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. SpaceX intends to use Starship to send people and supplies to the moon and, eventually Mars. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASAs Europa Clipper spacecraft will scour Jupiter moon for the ingredients for life,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft has set sail for Jupiter and its moon Europa, one of the best bets for finding life beyond Earth. Europa Clipper will peer beneath the moons icy crust where an ocean is thought to be sloshing fairly close to the surface. It wont search for life, but rather determine whether conditions there could support it. Another mission would be needed to flush out any microorganisms lurking there. Its a chance for us to explore not a world that might have been habitable billions of years ago, but a world that might be habitable today  right now, said program scientist Curt Niebur. Its massive solar panels make Clipper the biggest craft built by NASA to investigate another planet. It will take 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter and will sneak within 16 miles (25 kilometers) of Europas surface  considerably closer than any other spacecraft. Clipper lifted off Monday aboard SpaceXs Falcon Heavy rocket from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. Mission cost: $5.2 billion. One of Jupiters 95 known moons, Europa is almost the size of our own moon. Its encased in an ice sheet estimated to be 10 miles to 15 miles or more (15 kilometers to 24 kilometers) thick. Scientists believe this frozen crust hides an ocean that could be 80 miles (120 kilometers) or more deep. The Hubble Space Telescope has spotted what appear to be geysers erupting from the surface. Discovered by Galileo in 1610, Europa is one of the four so-called Galilean moons of Jupiter, along with Ganymede, Io and Callisto. What type of life might Europa harbor? Besides water, organic compounds are needed for life as we know it, plus an energy source. In Europas case that could be thermal vents on the ocean floor. Deputy project scientist Bonnie Buratti imagines any life would be primitive like the bacterial life that originated in Earths deep ocean vents. We will not know from this mission because we cant see that deep, she said. Unlike missions to Mars where habitability is one of many questions, Clippers sole job is to establish whether the moon could support life in its ocean or possibly in any pockets of water in the ice.  
        
     When its solar wings and antennas are unfurled, Clipper is about the size of a basketball court  more than 100 feet (30 meters) end to end  and weighs nearly 13,000 pounds (6,000 kilograms). The supersized solar panels are needed because of Jupiters distance from the sun. The main body  about the size of a camper  is packed with nine science instruments, including radar that will penetrate the ice, cameras that will map virtually the entire moon and tools to tease out the contents of Europas surface and tenuous atmosphere. The name hearkens to the swift sailing ships of centuries past. The roundabout trip to Jupiter will span 1.8 billion miles (3 billion kilometers). For extra oomph, the spacecraft will swing past Mars early next year and then Earth in late 2026. It arrives at Jupiter in 2030 and begins science work the next year. While orbiting Jupiter, it will cross paths with Europa 49 times. The mission ends in 2034 with a planned crash into Ganymede  Jupiters biggest moon and the solar systems too. Theres more radiation around Jupiter than anywhere else in our solar system, besides the sun. Europa passes through Jupiters bands of radiation as it orbits the gas giant, making it especially menacing for spacecraft. Thats why Clippers electronics are inside a vault with dense aluminum and zinc walls. All this radiation would nix any life on Europas surface. But it could break down water molecules and, perhaps, release oxygen all the way down into the ocean that could possibly fuel sea life.  Earlier this year, NASA was in a panic that the spacecrafts many transistors might not withstand the intense radiation. But after months of analysis, engineers concluded the mission could proceed as planned. NASAs twin Pioneer spacecraft and then two Voyagers swept past Jupiter in the 1970s. The Voyagers provided the first detailed photos of Europa but from quite a distance. NASAs Galileo spacecraft had repeated flybys of the moon during the 1990s, passing as close as 124 miles (200 kilometers). Still in action around Jupiter, NASAs Juno spacecraft has added to Europas photo album. Arriving at Jupiter a year after Clipper will be the European Space Agencys Juice spacecraft, launched last year. Like Europa, Jupiters jumbo moon Ganymede is thought to host an underground ocean. But its frozen shell is much thicker  possibly 100 miles (160 kilometers) thick  making it tougher to probe the environment below. Callistos ice sheet may be even thicker, possibly hiding an ocean. Saturns moon Enceladus has geysers shooting up, but its much farther than Jupiter. Ditto for Saturns moon Titan, also suspected of having a subterranean sea. While no ocean worlds have been confirmed beyond our solar system, scientists believe theyre out there  and may even be relatively common. Like many robotic explorers before it, Clipper bears messages from Earth. Attached to the electronics vault is a triangular metal plate. On one side is a design labeled water words with representations of the word for water in 104 languages. On the opposite side: a poem about the moon by U.S. poet laureate Ada Limon and a silicon chip containing the names of 2.6 million people who signed up to vicariously ride along. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA spacecraft rockets toward Jupiters moon Europa in search of the right conditions for life,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a quest to explore Jupiters tantalizing moon Europa and reveal whether its vast hidden ocean might hold the keys to life. It will take Europa Clipper 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter, where it will slip into orbit around the giant gas planet and sneak close to Europa during dozens of radiation-drenched flybys. Scientists are almost certain a deep, global ocean exists beneath Europas icy crust. And where there is water, there could be life, making the moon one of the most promising places out there to hunt for it. Europa Clipper wont look for life; it has no life detectors. Instead, the spacecraft will zero in on the ingredients necessary to sustain life, searching for organic compounds and other clues as it peers beneath the ice for suitable conditions.  SpaceX started Clipper on its 1.8 billion-mile (3 billion-kilometer) journey, launching the spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Floridas Kennedy Space Center. An hour later, the spacecraft separated from the upper stage, floated off and called home.  Please say goodbye to Clipper on its way to Europa, NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratorys flight director Pranay Mishra announced from Southern California. The science on this is really captivating, NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free told The Associated Press back at the launch site. Scientists are still learning about the depths of our own ocean, and here we are looking that far out. 
        
     The $5.2 billion mission almost got derailed by transistors. NASA didnt learn until spring that Clippers transistors might be more vulnerable to Jupiters intense radiation field than anticipated. Clipper will endure the equivalent of several million chest X-rays during each of the 49 Europa flybys. The space agency spent months reviewing everything before concluding in September that the mission could proceed as planned. Hurricane Milton added to the anxiety, delaying the launch by several days. What a great day. Were so excited, JPL Director Laurie Leshin said after liftoff.  About the size of a basketball court with its solar wings unfurled, Clipper will swing past Mars and then Earth on its way to Jupiter for gravity assists. The nearly 13,000-pound (5,700-kilogram) probe should reach the solar systems biggest planet in 2030. Clipper will circle Jupiter every 21 days. One of those days will bring it close to Europa, among 95 known moons at Jupiter and close to our own moon in size.  The spacecraft will skim as low as 16 miles (25 kilometers) above Europa  much closer than the few previous visitors. Onboard radar will attempt to penetrate the moons ice sheet, believed to be 10 miles to 15 miles or more (15 kilometers to 24 kilometers) thick. The ocean below could be 80 miles (120 kilometers) or more deep. The spacecraft holds nine instruments, with its sensitive electronics stored in a vault with dense zinc and aluminum walls for protection against radiation. Exploration will last until 2034.  Ocean worlds like Europa are not only unique because they might be habitable, but they might be habitable today, NASAs Gina DiBraccio said on the eve of launch. If conditions are found to be favorable for life at Europa, then that opens up the possibility of life at other ocean worlds in our solar system and beyond, according to scientists. With an underground ocean and geysers, Saturns moon Enceladus is another top candidate. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Tubeworms, snails and other weird creatures found under the seafloor","NEW YORK (AP)  Scientists for the first time have uncovered an underworld of animal life thriving beneath the seafloor. An expedition to a volcanically active ridge in the Pacific off South America has revealed worms, snails, giant tubeworms and other strange creatures lurking below steamy underwater hot springs.  Researchers have long studied animal communities near such hydrothermal vents. Many thought only microbes and viruses could survive underneath. To their surprise, an underwater robot last summer overturned volcanic slabs and found diverse life under the vents.  This was totally unexpected, said study co-author Sabine Gollner with the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research. Young critters from above the seafloor could be traveling through the vents to settle in the depths, Gollner said. The research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. Future studies will help reveal whether colonies of animal life exist below other hydrothermal vents around the globe.  This is an initial discovery thats really promising, said Jason Sylvan, a microbiologist at Texas A&M University who was not involved with the research. ___ AP video producer Zara Eldridge contributed to this report from London.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Missed out on the northern lights? Scientists expect more solar storms to produce auroras,"NEW YORK (AP)  Expect to see more northern lights in unusual places as the sun continues to sizzle, space weather forecasters said Tuesday.  Strong solar storms this year have triggered shimmering auroras much farther south than usual, filling skies with hues of pink, purple, green and blue.  The sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, making solar surges and northern lights more frequent. This active period was expected to last for at least another year, though when solar activity will peak wont be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  This solar cycle has yielded more colorful auroras farther south and more are likely, said NASAs Kelly Korreck.  We still could possibly get some good shows in the next few months, she said. Such storms can also temporarily disrupt power and communications. Ahead of a solar outburst, NOAA would alert operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit.  In May, NOAA issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning. The storm that slammed Earth was the strongest in more than two decades, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. That same month, scientists recorded the biggest flare erupting from the sun, but Earth was out of the way.  Previous solar cycles have produced storms more intense than Mays so space forecasters are keeping a close eye on the sun to prepare for any major disruptions, said NOAAs Bill Murtagh.  
        
     Last week, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when auroras appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Octobers supermoon pairs with a comet for a special nighttime spectacle,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Octobers supermoon is the closest of the year and its teaming up with a comet for a rare stargazing two-for-one.  The third of four supermoons this year, it will be 222,055 miles (357,364 kilometers) away Wednesday night, making it seem even bigger and brighter than in August and September. It will reach its full lunar phase Thursday. In a twist of cosmic fate, a comet is in the neighborhood. Discovered last year, comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas is now prominent in the Northern Hemisphere after wowing stargazers in the Southern Hemisphere.  The moonlight will wash out some of the comets tail, but its still worth a look after sunset, said NASAs Bill Cooke.  Most astronomers hate the full moon because its bright light messes up observing other objects. So its a bit hard for us to wax poetic about it even if its the biggest supermoon of 2024, he said in an email. Better catch the comet; it may never return. But dont fret if you miss Thursdays supermoon. The fourth and final supermoon of the year will rise on Nov. 15.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) More a popular term than a scientific one, a supermoon occurs when a full lunar phase syncs up with an especially close swing around Earth. This usually happens only three or four times a year and consecutively, given the moons constantly shifting, oval-shaped orbit.  A supermoon obviously isnt bigger, but it can appear that way, although scientists say the difference can be barely perceptible. 
        
     Theres a quartet of supermoons this year.  The one in August was 224,917 miles (361,970 kilometers) away. Septembers was nearly 3,000 miles (4,484 kilometers) closer the night of Sept. 17 into the following morning. A partial lunar eclipse also unfolded that night, visible in much of the Americas, Africa and Europe as Earths shadow fell on the moon, resembling a small bite.  Octobers supermoon is the years closest at 222,055 miles (357,364 kilometers) from Earth, followed by the November supermoon at a distance of 224,853 miles (361,867 kilometers).

Its easier to detect the change in brightness  a supermoon can be 30% brighter than average.  With the U.S. and other countries ramping up lunar exploration with landers and eventually astronauts, the moon beckons brighter than ever.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Pressure grows for countries to deliver on promised biodiversity targets at UN conference,"Two years after reaching a historic biodiversity agreement, countries will gather next week to determine whether they are making progress on efforts to save Earths plant and animal life. The agreement signed by 196 countries at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference calls for protecting 30% of land and water by 2030, known as 30 by 30. When the agreement was signed, 17% of terrestrial and 10% of marine areas were protected  which hasnt changed significantly.  At the conference known as COP16, countries next will report on progress made toward the goals, and governments are expected to agree on mechanisms to assure the implementation of them, according to a European Parliament report.  The two-week meeting in Cali, Colombia will also focus on efforts to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to protect nature by 2030  with the payment of $20 billion for developing countries due next year. Twenty-three targets will be discussed including cutting food waste and preventing the introduction of invasive species.

     The nearly 200 countries are supposed to submit national plans ahead of the conference showing actions they are taking to meet the 30 by 30 goals. But as of this week, around 46% of countries have submitted targets and less than 15% submitted plans for reaching them. Australia has yet to submit its targets while India has not submitted a national plan. Brazil, which includes much of the Amazon rainforest, hasnt submitted targets or a plan.  The United States, which is not party to the biodiversity convention, is not required to submit any plans. But the Biden administration has committed to protecting a third of American land and waters by 2030. Some countries are expected to use the conference to unveil plans for creating or expanding protected areas and for how theyll spend biodiversity funding. Canada, for example, has committed to spending $800 million on four Indigenous-led projects.  FILE - Giraffes migrate in national parks and the surrounding areas, in South Sudan, June 18, 2024.

(AP Photo/Brian Inganga) Conservation groups are concerned that more countries have not yet detailed their biodiversity goals and how to achieve them.  Bernadette Fischler Hooper, head of global advocacy for WWF International, called the commitments so far disappointing. WWF, which is tracking the progress, also found some plans lack actions to halt biodiversity loss, funding to support efforts and sufficient buy-in from across government.  This is really, really getting close, Hooper said. There are some countries who can easily afford to update (their plans). Theres no reason why they didnt do it ... and there are countries that didnt get the support they needed. Of the 91 countries that submitted targets, the conventions secretariat found more than half had targets of protecting and conserving at least 30% of their terrestrial area and about a quarter had targets for 5% to 30%. For marine and coastal areas, more than one-third had a national target of 30% or more, and another third had targets between 5% and 30%. But Astrid Schomaker, executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, said the small number of countries submitting plans isnt surprising since governments first had to come up with targets and then develop action plans. These are complex processes that are meant to be a whole of government, she said of the plans that require coordination and buy-in from ministries, business leaders and community stakeholders, as well as raising money. Thats not happening overnight. Achieving these targets is especially critical to migratory species, more than 40% which a U.N. report found are declining.  Birds do not recognize boundaries of a protected area and move according to their feeding and roosting needs, said Jennifer George, who leads the Seoul-based East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership, a nonprofit focused on birds migrating between East Asia, Australia and New Zealand.

(AP Photo/Edmar Barros, File) Much like the U.N. climate talks, a big topic of debate at the biodiversity conference will be financing.  Poor countries pushed to include language requiring that $200 billion a year be raised by 2030 for biodiversity from a range of sources to fund the target-specific projects. Rich countries committed to providing developing countries $20 billion starting next year and gradually scaling that up to $30 billion by 2030.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported in September that development finance for biodiversity more than doubled from 2015 to 2022. But when it comes to funding for this agreement, the world was still 23% short of the $20 billion goal. Advocates said money will be critical since much of the biodiversity that needs protecting is in developing countries like those in Africa.

Is there enough progress? No, said Susan Lieberman, the vice president of international policy at Wildlife Conservation Society. Some countries are taking it seriously and other countries are saying, Oh we want to do this, but wheres the money? In addition to top-tier biodiversity targets, the conference will discuss a goal in the agreement to halt human-induced extinction of threatened species and, by 2050, to reduce extinction rates tenfold. The goal also calls for increasing the abundance of native wild species to healthy levels. But conservationists say the goals lack specifics and hope details can be agreed upon at the meeting. Many of these other targets need to be nailed down and quantified, like stopping species extinctions, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm. At the moment, they are terribly vague.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst, File) Countries plan to showcase the role biodiversity plays in achieving climate mitigation goals and in health, especially preventing future pandemics.  The meeting will also consider adoption of a global mechanism for sharing of benefits from digital data from genetic material derived from plants, animals, bacteria and viruses. The materials are often used to developed commercial products like drugs  and the hope is that an agreement will ensure profits are shared equitably. ___ The Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

A brown dwarf discovered 30 years ago is actually twins circling each other,"NEW YORK (AP)  A celestial object discovered decades ago is actually twins orbiting each other, a new study confirms. Scientists have puzzled over the object known as Gliese 229B, the first known brown dwarf discovered 30 years ago. Brown dwarfs are sometimes called failed stars because theyre lighter than stars, but heavier than gas giant planets.  This object appeared too dim for its mass. Astronomers collected light and chemical clues using the Very Large Telescope in Chile and observed its a duo circling close to each other.  It resolves a glaring discrepancy, said Kevin Luhman, an astronomer at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved with the research. The twins orbit a small star about 18 light-years away. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.  Astronomers have spotted brown dwarf pairs before, but these two whip around at much closer range. They orbit each other every 12 days, less than the time it takes for the moon to circle the Earth. It shows you how weird the universe is, and how different solar systems are from our own, said study co-author Rebecca Oppenheimer with the American Museum of Natural History. The research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The twins discovery means there could be other lurking brown dwarfs with a hidden partner, said co-author Jerry Xuan of the California Institute of Technology.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Moonlight may hamper views of the Orionid meteor shower, debris of Halleys comet","WASHINGTON (AP)  The Orionids  one of two annual meteor showers from Halleys comet  peak early Monday. A bright waning moon may make them difficult to spot.  The Orionid meteor shower can be unpredictable. It shines like a fireworks display in some years, but is fairly slow in other years.  This highly variable shower may result in anywhere from 20 to 60 visible meteors per hour under ideal viewing conditions, said NASAs Bill Cooke.  This years peak activity happens on a night when a waning moon is 83% full. The shower lasts through November 22.  Heres what to know about the Orionids and other meteor showers.  Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you dont need special equipment to see them.  Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. The source of the Orionids is Halleys comet.  When rocks from space enter Earths atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them  the end of a shooting star.  The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky. Halleys comet does not leave the same numbers of particles behind each year, making it hard to predict what kind of show viewers will see, said Cooke.  
        
     Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.  Its easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest. And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you arent checking your phone. It ruins your night vision, said Cooke. October has been an active time for celestial sightings including the latest supermoon and the comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas.  The meteor society keeps an updated list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions.  The next big one is the Southern Taurid meteor shower, which peaks in early November. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Giant fish thought to be extinct is spotted in the Mekong River,"WASHINGTON (AP)  A huge fish in the Mekong River thought to be extinct has been spotted three times in recent years.  The giant salmon carp is like a symbol of the Mekong region, said Chheana Chhut, a researcher at the Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The predatory fish can grow up to 4 feet in length, and has a conspicuous knob at the tip of its lower jaw. A striking patch of yellow surrounds its large eyes.  With the last confirmed sighting in 2005, this species of fish seems to have disappeared from the Mekong region for decades, said Chheana, who is a co-author of a study published online Monday in the journal Biological Conservation that documents the recent sightings. Since 2017, biologists tracking migratory fish species in Cambodia have developed relationships with local fishing communities, asking them to alert any unusual sightings.  Thats how the three giant salmon carp found in the Mekong River and a tributary in Cambodia between 2020 and 2023 came to the attention of researchers.  I was really surprised and excited to see the real fish for the first time, said Bunyeth Chan, a study co-author and researcher at Svay Rieng University in Cambodia.  Researchers say the sightings give them new hope for the fate of the species. One nickname for the species is ghost fish. This rediscovery is very exciting, positive news, said Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was part of the team.  
        
     But the plight of the fish also spotlights the perils facing all migratory species in the Mekong, which faces industrial pollution and overfishing.  More than 700 dams are built along the river and its tributaries and there are very few functional fish passages to help species navigate obstructions, said Brian Eyler, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, who was not involved in the research.  The biologists said they hope that working with local communities in Thailand and Laos will enable them to confirm if the fish still swims in other stretches of the Mekong River. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Red-cockaded woodpeckers recovery in southeast leads to status change from endangered to threatened,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The red-cockaded woodpecker, an iconic bird in southeastern forests, has recovered enough of its population to be downlisted from an endangered species to a threatened one, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Thursday.  The downlisting of the red-cockaded woodpecker marks a significant milestone in our nations commitment to preserving biodiversity, said Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in a statement. At one point in the 1970s, the red-cockaded woodpecker population had dipped as low as 1,470 clusters  or groups of nests, wildlife officials said. Today, there are an estimated 7,800 clusters. Its an amazing bird that has an unusual communal nesting structure, said Will Harlan of the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity. All nests usually cluster in the same tree, and the birds stick together as a family unit. Red-cockaded woodpeckers are habitat specialists that nest only in mature long-leaf pine forests, building nests in cavities of living trees partially hollowed out by a fungus. Long-leaf pine forests once spanned much of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal regions, from New Jersey to Texas, but logging and development in the region reduced that to only 3% of this original habitat today, said Harlan.  Red-cockaded woodpeckers were one of the first species designated as endangered in the United States in 1970, and the birds received full protections with passage of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. 
        
     Since then, habitat restoration and protection on both public and private lands have helped the species to partially recover. Managed efforts to relocate birds from stronghold areas to reestablish populations in other forests have also aided the species, said Georgetown ecologist Emily Williams. The news is exciting because its a conservation success story in many ways, she said. But there still needs to be caution to keep the species thriving. It will still be prohibited to take  meaning harass, hunt or harm  the woodpeckers or their habitat in most instances. But the status change allows for the possibility of some new exceptions to those protections. The species still has a long way to go for a full recovery, said Ramona McGee, senior attorney and wildlife program leader at the Southern Environmental Law Center. Removing endangered species protections now could reverse past gains. - The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"NASA decides to keep 2 astronauts in space until February, nixes return on troubled Boeing capsule","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA decided Saturday its too risky to bring two astronauts back to Earth in Boeings troubled new capsule, and theyll have to wait until next year for a ride home with SpaceX. What should have been a weeklong test flight for the pair will now last more than eight months.  The seasoned pilots have been stuck at the International Space Station since the beginning of June. A cascade of vexing thruster failures and helium leaks in the new capsule marred their trip to the space station, and they ended up in a holding pattern as engineers conducted tests and debated what to do about the flight back. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports NASA will bring stranded Boeing Starliner astronauts home on SpaceX. After almost three months, the decision finally came down from NASAs highest ranks on Saturday. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will come back in a SpaceX capsule in February. Their empty Starliner capsule will undock in early September and attempt to return on autopilot with a touchdown in the New Mexico desert. As Starliners test pilots, the pair should have overseen this critical last leg of the journey. A test flight by nature is neither safe nor routine, said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. The decision is a result of a commitment to safety. Nelson said lessons learned from NASAs two space shuttle accidents played a role. This time, he noted, open dialogue was encouraged rather than crushed. This has not been an easy decision, but it is absolutely the right one, added Jim Free, NASAs associate administrator. 
        
     It was a blow to Boeing, adding to the safety concerns plaguing the company on its airplane side. Boeing had counted on Starliners first crew trip to revive the troubled spacecraft program after years of delays and ballooning costs. The company had insisted Starliner was safe based on all the recent thruster tests both in space and on the ground.  Boeing did not participate in Saturdays news conference by NASA, but released a statement: Boeing continues to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. The company said it is preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful return. Rand Corp.'s Jan Osburg, a senior engineer who specializes in aerospace and defense, said NASA made the right choice. But the U.S. is still left with egg on its face due to the Starliner design issues that should have been caught earlier. Wilmore, 61, and Williams, 58, are both retired Navy captains with previous long-duration spaceflight experience. Before their June 5 launch from Cape Canaveral, Wilmore and Williams said their families bought into the uncertainty and stress of their professional careers decades ago.  During their lone orbital news conference last month, the astronauts said they had trust in the thruster testing being conducted. They had no complaints, they added, and enjoyed pitching in with space station work. Wilmores wife, Deanna, said she and their daughters, along with family and friends, were praying for a safe return on whatever spacecraft that may be. While they are disappointed that he will be away longer, we know that its the Lords plan, she said via text. Flight operations director Norm Knight said he talked to the astronauts Saturday and they fully support the decision to postpone their return. There were few options. The SpaceX capsule currently parked at the space station is reserved for the four residents who have been there since March. They will return in late September, their routine six-month stay extended a month by the Starliner dilemma. NASA said it would be unsafe to squeeze two more into the capsule, except in an emergency. The docked Russian Soyuz capsule is even tighter, capable of flying only three  two of them Russians wrapping up a yearlong stint. So Wilmore and Williams will wait for SpaceXs next taxi flight. Its due to launch in late September with two astronauts instead of the usual four. NASA is yanking two to make room for Wilmore and Williams on the return flight in late February.  NASA said no serious consideration was given to asking SpaceX for a quick stand-alone rescue. Last year, the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement Soyuz capsule for three men whose original craft was damaged by space junk. The switch pushed their six-month mission to just over a year. Former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, applauded the decision via X: Good to err on the side of caution for astronaut lives. Long missions are what astronauts work their entire career for. Id take it in a heartbeat! Starliners woes began long before its latest flight. Bad software fouled the first test flight without a crew in 2019, prompting a do-over in 2022. Then parachute and other issues cropped up, including a helium leak in the capsules propellant system that nixed a launch attempt in May. The leak eventually was deemed to be isolated and small enough to pose no concern. But more leaks sprouted following liftoff, and five thrusters also failed.  All but one of those small thrusters restarted in flight. But engineers were perplexed by ground testing that showed a thruster seal swelling and obstructing a propellant line. They theorized the seals in orbit may have expanded and then reverted to their normal size. Officials said the results marked the turning point, as their concerns grew. With all the uncertainty about how the thrusters might perform, There was too much risk for the crew, Steve Stich, NASAs commercial crew program manager, told reporters. These 28 thrusters are vital. Besides needed for space station rendezvous, they keep the capsule pointed in the right direction at flights end as bigger engines steer the craft out of orbit. Coming in crooked could result in catastrophe. With the Columbia disaster still fresh in many minds  the shuttle broke apart during reentry in 2003, killing all seven aboard  NASA made an extra effort to embrace open debate over Starliners return capability. Despite Saturdays decision, NASA isnt giving up on Boeing. Nelson said he is 100% certain that Starliner will fly again. NASA went into its commercial crew program a decade ago wanting two competing U.S. companies ferrying astronauts in the post-shuttle era. Boeing won the bigger contract: more than $4 billion, compared with SpaceXs $2.6 billion. With station supply runs already under its belt, SpaceX aced its first of now nine astronaut flights in 2020, while Boeing got bogged down in design flaws that set the company back more than $1 billion. NASA officials still hold out hope that Starliners problems can be corrected in time for another crew flight in another year or so. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Two NASA astronauts stuck in space have flown long missions before,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The two NASA astronauts left behind at the International Space Station following the return of Boeings troubled capsule are Navy test pilots who have ridden out long missions before. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are now full-time station crew members along with the seven others on board. NASA decided last month they wont be flying back in their Boeing Starliner capsule, but will wait for a ride with SpaceX in late February, pushing their mission to more than eight months. Their original itinerary on the test flight was eight days. On Friday, the empty Starliner capsule departed the space station and parachuted into the New Mexico desert.  Wilmore, 61, grew up in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, playing football for his high school team and later Tennessee Technological University. He joined the Navy, becoming a test pilot and racking up more than 8,000 hours of flying time and 663 aircraft carrier landings. He flew combat missions during the first Gulf War in 1991 and was serving as a flight test instructor when NASA chose him as an astronaut in 2000. Wilmore flew to the space station in 2009 as the pilot of shuttle Atlantis, delivering tons of replacement parts. Five years later, he moved into the orbiting lab for six months, launching on a Russian Soyuz from Kazakhstan and conducting four spacewalks. 
        
     Married with two daughters, Wilmore serves as an elder at his Houston-area Baptist church. Hes participated in prayer services with the congregation while in orbit. His family is used to the uncertainty and stress of his profession. He met wife Deanna amid Navy deployments, and their daughters were born in Houston, astronauts home base.

She grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, the youngest of three born to an Indian-born brain researcher and a Slovene American health care worker. She assumed shed go into science like them and considered becoming a veterinarian. But she ended up at the Naval Academy, itching to fly, and served in a Navy helicopter squadron overseas during the military buildup for the Gulf War.

(AP Photo/Chris OMeara, File) NASA chose her as an astronaut in 1998. Because of her own diverse background, she jumped at the chance to go to Russia to help behind the scenes with the still new space station. In 2006, she flew up aboard shuttle Discovery for her own lengthy mission. She had to stay longer than planned  6 1/2 months  after her ride home, Atlantis, suffered hail damage at the Florida pad. She returned to the space station in 2012, this time serving as its commander. She performed seven spacewalks during her two missions and even ran the Boston Marathon on a station treadmill and competed in a triathlon, substituting an exercise machine for the swimming event. Husband Michael Williams, a retired U.S. marshal and former Naval aviator, is tending to their dogs back home in Houston. Her widowed mother is the one who frets.

NASAs Perseverance rover on Mars begins steep climb to rim of a crater,"NEW YORK (AP)  NASAs Perseverance rover is tackling a steep new challenge on Mars. The six-wheeled rover has spent the last 3 1/2 years roaming around the bottom of a crater. On Tuesday, it began climbing to the top. The rover will go up 1,000 feet (305 meters) to the rim of Jezero Crater to dig up rock samples. Since landing on the red planet in 2021, Perseverance has collected 22 rock core samples from the floor of the crater, which was once filled with water. The rovers samples may help scientists piece together what the planets climate looked like billions of years ago  and learn whether any ancient Martian life lurked. NASA is exploring ways to bring the rock samples to Earth. The bedrock at the rim of the crater might yield clues as to how rocky planets like Mars and Earth came to be, said Steven Lee with NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. But the road ahead wont be easy. Perseverance will scale rocky terrain and slopes of up to 23 degrees on the monthslong journey. Perseverance has certainly been a real trooper, said Lee. The rover has logged around 18 miles (29 kilometers) during its exploration. The rock at the top of the crater may have come from past hydrothermal vents  sites where heated water and dissolved minerals spewed out after cycling underneath the planets surface. On Earth, similar sites  like at Yellowstone National Park  are considered a cradle for life. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

FAA grounds SpaceX after rocket falls over in flames at landing,"SpaceX launches are on hold after a booster rocket toppled over in flames while landing Wednesday.  The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the companys Falcon 9 rockets and ordered an investigation following the predawn accident off the Florida coast. No injuries or public damage were reported. Its too early to know how much impact this will have on SpaceXs upcoming crew flights, one private and the other for NASA. A billionaires chartered flight was delayed just a few hours earlier because of a poor weather forecast.  The rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and got all 21 Starlink internet satellites to orbit. But the first-stage booster fell over in a fireball moments after landing on an ocean platform, the first such accident in years. It was the 23rd time this particular booster had launched, a recycling record for SpaceX. The FAA said it must approve SpaceXs accident findings and corrective action before the company can resume Falcon 9 launches. A launch from California with more Starlinks was immediately called off following the accident. SpaceXs Jon Edwards, a vice president, said the company is working ASAP to understand what went wrong. Losing a booster is always sad. Each one of them has a unique history and character. Thankfully this doesnt happen often, Edwards posted on X. Besides the private spaceflight awaiting liftoff from Floridas Kennedy Space Center, SpaceX is due to launch a pair of astronauts for NASA late next month. Two seats will be set aside for the two astronauts who launched in June aboard Boeings new Starliner capsule, deemed unsafe by NASA for their return.  ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"NASA record holder can relate to astronauts stuck in space. He was, too","NASAs record-holding astronaut is urging his two stuck-in-space colleagues to stay positive and keep up the good work.  Frank Rubio knows firsthand about unexpectedly long spaceflights. His own visit to the International Space Station lasted just over a year, twice as long as planned.  So for the past two weeks, hes been helping out with his friends extended stay. He said he spoke with Suni Williams on Thursday and expressed pride in how she and Butch Wilmore have coped with their situation. Williams and Wilmore should have returned to Earth on Boeings troubled Starliner capsule back in June, a week after blasting off on its first test flight with a crew. After extensive tests and analysis of thruster problems and helium leaks, NASA decided last weekend it would be safer for SpaceX to fly them home, but that wont happen until February, more than eight months after they blasted off.  Theyre doing great work, really maintaining a positive attitude up there, setting a great example and knocking out a whole lot of extra work on the space station, Rubio told The Associated Press from NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston. While remaining in space until next year is not the optimal outcome, Rubio said, theyve done a fantastic job of dealing with adversity. Their families, like his own, also have had to make sacrifices because of the switch in plans. 
        
     But thats part of our job is just to adapt and overcome and make the best of the situation, he said, and theyve done just that, so super proud of them. Williams and Wilmore havent spoken publicly about the Starliner dilemma since their lone orbital news conference last month, well before the decision to bump them to SpaceX and bring Boeings capsule back empty in early September. Rubios own mission was extended after his Russian Soyuz capsule was hit by space junk and leaked all its coolant. A new Soyuz had to be rushed up for him and his two Russian crewmates, and they rode it back to Earth last September. Rubio holds the U.S. record for the longest single spaceflight with his 371-day mission. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Boeing will fly its empty capsule back to Earth soon. Two NASA astronauts will stay behind,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeing will attempt to return its problem-plagued capsule from the International Space Station later this week  with empty seats. NASA said Wednesday that everything is on track for the Starliner capsule to undock from the space station Friday evening. The fully automated capsule will aim for a touchdown in New Mexicos White Sands Missile Range six hours later. NASAs two stuck astronauts who flew up on Starliner will remain behind at the orbiting lab. Theyll ride home with SpaceX in February, eight months after launching on what should have been a weeklong test flight. Thruster trouble and helium leaks kept delaying their return until NASA decided that it was too risky for them to accompany Starliner back as originally planned. Its been a journey to get here and were excited to have Starliner return, said NASAs commercial crew program manager Steve Stich. NASAs Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will close the hatches between Starliner and the space station on Thursday. They are now considered full-time station crew members along with the seven others on board, helping with experiments and maintenance, and ramping up their exercise to keep their bones and muscles strong during their prolonged exposure to weightlessness. To make room for them on SpaceXs next taxi flight, the Dragon capsule will launch with two astronauts instead of the usual four. Two were cut late last week from the six-month expedition, which is due to blast off in late September. Boeing has to free up the parking place for SpaceXs arrival. 
        
     Boeing encountered serious flaws with Starliner long before its June 5 liftoff on the long-delayed astronaut demo. Starliners first test flight went so poorly in 2019  the capsule never reached the space station because of software errors  that the mission was repeated three years later. More problems surfaced, resulting in even more delays and more than $1 billion in repairs.  The capsule had suffered multiple thruster failures and propulsion-system helium leaks by the time it pulled up at the space station after launch. Boeing conducted extensive thruster tests in space and on the ground, and contended the capsule could safely bring the astronauts back. But NASA disagreed, setting the complex ride swap in motion. Starliner will make a faster, simpler getaway than planned, using springs to push away from the space station and then short thruster firings to gradually increase the distance. The original plan called for an hour of dallying near the station, mostly for picture-taking; that was cut to 20 or so minutes to reduce the stress on the capsules thrusters and keep the station safe. Additional test firings of Starliners 28 thrusters are planned before the all-important descent from orbit. Engineers want to learn as much as they can since the thrusters wont return to Earth; the section containing them will be ditched before the capsule reenters. The stuck astronauts  retired Navy captains  have lived on the space station before and settled in just fine, according to NASA officials. Even though their mission focus has changed, theyre just as dedicated for the success of human spaceflight going forward, flight director Anthony Vareha said.  Their blue Boeing spacesuits will return with the capsule, along with some old station equipment. NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX a decade ago to ferry its astronauts to and from the space station after its shuttles retired. SpaceX accomplished the feat in 2020 and has since launched nine crews for NASA and four for private customers.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Small, harmless asteroid burns up in Earths atmosphere over the Philippines","NEW YORK (AP)  A small asteroid discovered on Wednesday harmlessly burned up in Earths atmosphere the same day, NASA said.  The asteroid  about 3 feet (1 meter) across  was spotted by astronomers in Arizona and broke apart over the coast of the Philippines hours after the discovery.  This space rock, dubbed 2024 RW1, is only the ninth to have been spotted before its impact. Asteroids around this size hurtle toward Earth about every two weeks without posing any danger.

FDA has massive backlog of factory inspections as staffers leave for private sector jobs,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Federal regulators responsible for the safety of the U.S. drug supply are still struggling to get back to where they were in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic upended factory inspections in the U.S. and across the world, The Associated Press has found. An AP analysis of Food and Drug Administration data shows that agency staffers have not returned to roughly 2,000 pharmaceutical manufacturing firms to conduct surveillance inspections since before the pandemic, raising the risks of contamination and other issues in drugs used by millions of Americans. (AP Illustration/Peter Hamlin) (AP Illustration/Peter Hamlin) The firms that are overdue for safety and quality inspections represent about 42% of the 4,700 plants that are currently registered to produce drugs for the U.S. and previously underwent FDA review before May 2019, the AP found. The plants make hundreds of critical medicines, including antibiotics, blood thinners and cancer therapies. Under FDAs own guidelines, factories that havent been inspected in five or more years are considered a significant risk and are supposed to be prioritized for mandatory inspections. Most of the overdue plants are in the U.S., but more than 340 are in India and China, countries that together make up the largest source of drug ingredients used in low-cost U.S. prescriptions. Generic drugmakers are under intense pressure to cut their costs and some will do that by cutting quality, said David Ridley of Duke University, who studies the pharmaceutical industry. If theyre not inspected, then we wont know about it until  in a few tragic cases  its too late. 
        
     Last year, tainted eyedrops from an Indian factory led to an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that sickened more than 80 Americans, killing four of them and blinding more than a dozen others. The plant never registered with the FDA. Prior to COVID-19, dozens of common medications made at FDA-regulated plants were recalled due to traces of cancer-causing contaminants. The FDA didnt open its first overseas outposts until 2008, after dozens of U.S. deaths were linked to a contaminated blood thinner imported from a Chinese plant that hadnt been inspected. The U.S. drug supply is the safest on the planet and no other regulator conducts more inspections than the FDA, said FDA Associate Commissioner Michael Rogers, noting that the agency has increased drug inspections each year since 2021 while prioritizing foreign factories. But last years inspection numbers were still down almost 40% from the pre-pandemic period, when the FDA averaged around 4,300 annual inspections. Rogers offered no date for when the backlog of uninspected plants might be cleared. 
        
     The agencys work has been hampered by a wave of staff departures, he said, including longtime inspectors who have found new jobs that often allow them to work from home. Theres a significant cost to the agency associated with the loss through attrition of an experienced investigator, Rogers said. We need to retain these people, and we are.  The FDA halted all but the most mission critical inspections in March 2020. It gradually restarted prioritized inspections later that year, but regular international visits did not resume until 2022. In a statement, the FDA said that it receives inspection details from international partners, including European regulators, which help the agency decide whether a visit is necessary. The agency also began using video and other online tools to evaluate plants remotely during COVID-19, although those arent equivalent to physical inspections. The FDAs struggles overseeing the global pharmaceutical supply have been documented by the Government Accountability Office, which has flagged the area as a high risk issue every year since 2009. Beginning in the 1990s, drugmakers began shifting manufacturing overseas, first to Puerto Rico, and then to Asia in search of cheaper labor and materials. The FDA has largely been playing catch-up ever since. Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations former chief scientist, speaks during an interview in Harrisburg, Pa. (AP Photo/Shelby Lum) Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations former chief scientist, speaks during an interview in Harrisburg, Pa. (AP Photo/Shelby Lum) We have to recognize that this is the world we live in and we have to adapt to it, said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, FDAs former chief scientist. That has to include being able to get into these facilities and take a look at what theyre doing, particularly in India and China. The FDA keeps a confidential list of drug facilities to inspect, prioritizing them based on potential risks. The AP created its own list by compiling public records of FDA inspections from before COVID-19 and tracking which firms havent received a follow-up within five years. The data accounts for the vast majority of inspections, but has some omissions, including visits required for new drug approvals and those that are part of ongoing government investigations. The APs tally of overdue plants also doesnt include any of the new facilities that have registered with the agency since COVID-19 but havent yet had an initial inspection. FDAs internal list of sites for inspection has increased 14% over the past five years, the agency noted last year. The FDA said in a statement that it must be judicious and apply a risk-based approach, due to the enormity of its workload and limited budget. We prioritize the inspections that pose the greatest risk to public health, the agency said. On a global basis, FDA says only 6% of sites inspected last year had serious problems. But rates are higher in India, where 11% of plants were cited for violations, the most of any country. Nearly 90% of FDAs foreign inspections in fiscal 2023 were announced in advance, according to FDA correspondence with Congress obtained via public records requests. The GAO and other government watchdogs have long raised concerns about the practice, which typically gives companies up to 12 weeks to correct or conceal potential problems. Even with the advanced warnings, the FDA has found egregious violations in overseas factories. When agency staffers visited Intas Pharmaceuticals plant in northwest India for the first time in nearly three years they found what they called a cascade of failure. Among the violations, inspectors saw an employee pouring acetic acid in a trash bin to destroy company documents used for drug testing. Elsewhere inspectors found plastic bags filled with torn and discarded documents relating to quality control measures. This kind of behavior has been pointed out to the FDA time and time again by people like me for the last 10 years, said Dinesh Thakur, a former pharmaceutical industry executive who became a whistleblower for the U.S. government. In 2013, his work led to a $500 million settlement with Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy for falsifying generic drug data. If you do not prosecute people who do this kind of wrongdoing, it gives the implicit signal that the FDA will give companies a pass, Thakur said. In the case of Intas, FDA issued a warning letter  which has no legal repercussions  and blocked some of the companys exports to the U.S., while attempting to maintain shipments of the critical chemotherapy drug cisplatin. That strategy backfired in June 2023 when Intas abruptly shuttered the plant, triggering a nationwide shortage of cisplatin, which is used in more than a half-dozen cancers. FDA inspections in India have been accelerating, but 160 plants are overdue, including some which havent been inspected since 2015 yet continue shipping pain pills, antibiotics and other medications to the U.S., according to APs analysis. Mexico, France and Spain also have over 100 overdue firms between them.  In China, political tensions have made inspections even more challenging. Just two fulltime FDA inspectors are based in the country, where about 185 factories are overdue. Former FDA officials say the Chinese government has withheld visas from inspectors unless the U.S. reciprocates for Chinese nationals seeking to enter the U.S. 
        
     FDA Commissioner Robert Califf has acknowledged his discomfort with the current situation. Even if we do periodic inspections, its not the same as a society where you have more freedom of information, Califf told lawmakers at a hearing last year. I am very concerned about it. The FDA could seemingly address its inspection backlog by hiring more investigators or assigning extra work to current staffers. But the agency is struggling to hold onto inspectors who can often earn far more working for the companies they now regulate. On a call with FDA stakeholders in May, Rogers warned that our attrition rates and our inability to retain our staff would soon impact the agencys ability to oversee drugs and other medical supplies. The FDA currently has 225 vacancies on its inspection workforce, nearly four times as many as before COVID-19, according to agency records. New inspectors generally start at an annual salary of about $40,000 and can eventually rise to over $100,000. Job postings alert applicants they may have to travel up to 50% of the time. In 30 years as an FDA inspector, Jose Hernandez experienced firsthand the grueling pace and pressures of the job. When he began doing international inspections in the mid-1990s, it was on a volunteer basis and employees spent no more than six weeks per year outside the U.S. By the end of his government career, Hernandez was traveling overseas more than four months per year, making multiple trips to Asia. For each one-week inspection, he said he might need another week or more to write up his report, particularly if he found serious violations. Hernandez says that extra time and attention to detail wasnt always appreciated by his managers. They just wanted people who are like bean counters: walk in, walk out and find nothing so that they can get this report through the system and make their numbers, he said. Hernandez retired from the FDA in 2014, earning just over $100,000 in his final year. Today he is a private consultant and says former FDA inspectors can easily earn more than $250,000 working for industry. Now I fly business class, I stay in nice hotels, I rest when I get there and nobody tells me what to do, Hernandez said. I made the right decision. FDA says its exploring ways to make the jobs more attractive, including extra pay for experienced staffers and offering more flexible, comfortable travel arrangements.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) FILE - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration building is seen behind FDA logos at a bus stop on the agencys campus in Silver Spring, Md. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) The slowdown in inspections has attracted scrutiny from lawmakers and raised new questions about whether FDAs decades-old approach is working. House Republicans have peppered the agency with dozens of inquiries about the program since 2023. In their most recent letter, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee ask regulators to explain why FDA staffers making high-priority inspections in Asia are reporting less than half as many violations today compared with pre-COVID-19. The committee is concerned that FDAs fear of triggering additional drug shortages is driving the decreased rate that FDA issues warning letters, states the June letter. FDAs Rogers rejected the argument, saying inspectors follow strict guidelines when conducting inspections and that decisions about managing drug shortages are handled separately by other parts of the agency. A pilot program requested by the U.S. Defense Department takes an alternative approach to monitoring the drug supply. The Pentagon is collaborating with a private laboratory, Valisure, to evaluate 40 prescription drugs critical to military personnel, testing them for contaminants, dosing and other issues. Initial findings from the two-year program found serious flaws in about 10% of a subset of drugs tested, according to results shared with the AP. Laboratory testing of imported drugs has long been standard practice in Europe, where more than 70 private labs operate alongside government regulators. The testing approach has attracted interest from experts concerned that FDAs method  rooted in physical inspections and reviewing paperwork  may not be up to the task of uncovering manufacturing problems on the other side of the world. Stanford Universitys Dr. Kevin Schulman says one solution would be to incentivize U.S. pharmacy chains and drug distributors to only purchase drugs from high-quality manufacturers. Currently, U.S. companies decide which generic drugs to buy based on whichever company has the lowest price, Schulman said. Purchasers say, Well, its the FDAs job to worry about quality, not ours, he said. Even as the FDA struggles to recover from COVID-19 and reinspect plants worldwide, Schulman sees a potential upside. Maybe this is the straw that breaks the camels back, he said. That, in fact, we should just admit that one U.S. agency cant regulate the entire global manufacturing for this critically important market. ___ Forster reported from New York.

5 takeaways from APs report on the big backlog of uninspected drug factories,"WASHINGTON (AP)  As COVID-19 swept across the globe in early 2020, the Food and Drug Administration pulled most of its safety inspectors from the field, creating a massive backlog of uninspected pharmaceutical plants in the U.S. and overseas. Nearly five years later, The Associated Press wanted to assess the FDAs performance in catching up on inspections of factories that produce drugs used by millions of Americans. The FDA keeps a list of drug facilities to inspect annually, prioritizing them based on their potential risks. But the list is confidential, so the AP created its own list by compiling public records of FDA inspections before COVID-19 and tracking which firms havent received a follow-up. Here are five takeaways from the APs exclusive story: The overdue drug plants identified by the AP represent about 42% of the firms that are currently registered to produce drugs for the U.S. and previously underwent FDA surveillance inspections before May 2019. The plants make hundreds of critical medicines, including antibiotics, blood thinners and cancer therapies. Under FDAs own guidelines, factories that havent been inspected in five or more years are considered a significant risk and are supposed to be prioritized for inspection. While most of the overdue plants are in the U.S., more than 340 are in India and China, the main producers of generic drug ingredients for U.S. prescriptions. 
        
     FDA officials say the U.S. drug supply is the safest on the planet. Because of its enormous inspection workload, the agency says it prioritizes facilities that pose the greatest risk to the public. The FDA has been using online tools and information from European regulators to supplement its efforts. The FDA has been ramping up inspections since 2021, concentrating on overseas plants. But the agency still isnt inspecting at the level it was before COVID-19. Last years inspection numbers were down 40% from the prepandemic period, according to APs analysis. The agencys work has been slowed by attrition, according to one senior official. A wave of departures before and after the pandemic has left the agency with a less experienced workforce. We arent able to keep up with the pace of attrition and we have a number of investigators who are not as fully trained as their predecessors, said FDA Associate Commissioner Michael Rogers. We continue to increase their experience and training to get this group of investigators up to the same level we were able to utilize pre-pandemic. Despite years of recruitment efforts, the FDA still has more than 220 vacancies among its inspection workforce, according to agency records obtained by the AP. Today, the FDAs inspection team is 85% staffed, compared with more than 95% staffed in fiscal 2019.  When FDA inspectors do visit factories in India and other countries, they sometimes find egregious violations.  An FDA inspector visiting Intas Pharmaceuticals in India, for example, witnessed a company employee pouring acetic acid in a trash bin to destroy company documents related to drug testing. The FDA issued a warning letter last year documenting a number of violations at the plant, including inadequate recordkeeping and manufacturing practices. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Tiny glass beads suggest the moon had active volcanoes when dinosaurs roamed Earth,"NEW YORK (AP)  Volcanoes were still erupting on the moon when dinosaurs roamed Earth, new research suggests. The evidence: three tiny glass beads plucked from the surface of the moon and brought to Earth in 2020 by a Chinese spacecraft. Their chemical makeup indicates that there were active lunar volcanoes until about 120 million years ago, much more recent than scientists thought.  An earlier analysis of the rock samples from the Change 5 mission had suggested volcanoes petered out 2 billion years ago. Previous estimates stretched back to 4 billion years ago.  The research was published Thursday in the journal Science. It was a little bit unexpected, said Julie Stopar, a senior staff scientist with the Lunar and Planetary Institute who was not involved with the research.  Images from NASAs Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2014 had also suggested more recent volcanic activity. The glass beads are the first physical evidence, Stopar said, although more research is needed to confirm their origin. The Change 5 samples were the first moon rocks brought to Earth since those collected by NASAs Apollo astronauts and by Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. In June, China returned samples from the far side of the moon. The research may help us understand how long small planets and moons  including our own  can stay volcanically active, study co-author He Yuyang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said in an email.  
        
     Researchers studied around 3,000 lunar glass beads smaller than a pinhead and found three with signs they came from a volcano. Glass beads can form on the moon when molten droplets cool after a volcanic eruption or meteorite impact. Existing time lines suggest the moon had already cooled off past the point of volcanic activity by the time frame suggested by the new research, Stopar noted. It should inspire lots of other studies to try to understand how this could happen, she said. ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Two astronauts are left behind in space as Boeings troubled capsule returns to Earth empty,"Boeings first astronaut mission ended Friday night with an empty capsule landing and two test pilots still in space, left behind until next year because NASA judged their return too risky. Six hours after departing the International Space Station, Starliner parachuted into New Mexicos White Sands Missile Range, descending on autopilot through the desert darkness.  It was an uneventful close to a drama that began with the June launch of Boeings long-delayed crew debut and quickly escalated into a dragged-out cliffhanger of a mission stricken by thruster failures and helium leaks. For months, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams return was in question as engineers struggled to understand the capsules problems.  Boeing insisted after extensive testing that Starliner was safe to bring the two home, but NASA disagreed and booked a flight with SpaceX instead. Their SpaceX ride wont launch until the end of this month, which means theyll be up there until February  more than eight months after blasting off on what should have been a quick trip. Wilmore and Williams should have flown Starliner back to Earth by mid-June, a week after launching in it. But their ride to the space station was marred by the cascade of thruster trouble and helium loss, and NASA ultimately decided it was too risky to return them on Starliner.  So with fresh software updates, the fully automated capsule left with their empty seats and blue spacesuits along with some old station equipment.  
        
     
        
     Shes on her way home, Williams radioed as the white and blue-trimmed capsule undocked from the space station 260 miles (420 kilometers) over China and disappeared into the black void.  Williams stayed up late to see how everything turned out. A good landing, pretty awesome, said Boeings Mission Control. Cameras on the space station and a pair of NASA planes caught the capsule as a white streak coming in for the touchdown, which drew cheer. There were some snags during reentry, including more thruster issues, but Starliner made a bulls-eye landing, said NASAs commercial crew program manager Steve Stich. Even with the safe return, I think we made the right decision not to have Butch and Suni on board, Stich said at a news conference early Saturday. All of us feel happy about the successful landing. But then theres a piece of us, all of us, that we wish it would have been the way we had planned it.  Boeing did not participate in the Houston news briefing. But two of the companys top space and defense officials, Ted Colbert and Kay Sears, told employees in a note that they backed NASAs ruling. While this may not have been how we originally envisioned the test flight concluding, we support NASAs decision for Starliner and are proud of how our team and spacecraft performed, the executives wrote.  Starliners crew demo capped a journey filled with delays and setbacks. After the space shuttles retired more than a decade ago, NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX for orbital taxi service. Boeing ran into so many problems on its first test flight with no one aboard in 2019 that it had to repeat it. The 2022 do-over uncovered even more flaws and the repair bill topped $1 billion.  SpaceXs crew ferry flight later this month will be its 10th for NASA since 2020. The Dragon capsule will launch on the half-year expedition with only two astronauts since two seats are reserved for Wilmore and Williams for the return leg. As veteran astronauts and retired Navy captains, Wilmore and Williams anticipated hurdles on the test flight. Theyve kept busy in space, helping with repairs and experiments. The two are now full-time station crew members along with the seven others on board. Even before the pair launched on June 5 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, Starliners propulsion system was leaking helium. The leak was small and thought to be isolated, but four more cropped up after liftoff. Then five thrusters failed. Although four of the thrusters were recovered, it gave NASA pause as to whether more malfunctions might hamper the capsules descent from orbit. Boeing conducted numerous thruster tests in space and on the ground over the summer, and was convinced its spacecraft could safely bring the astronauts back. But NASA could not get comfortable with the thruster situation and went with SpaceX. Flight controllers conducted more test firings of the capsules thrusters following undocking; one failed to ignite. Engineers suspect the more the thrusters are fired, the hotter they become, causing protective seals to swell and obstruct the flow of propellant. They wont be able to examine any of the parts; the section holding the thrusters was ditched just before reentry.  Starliner will be transported in a couple weeks back to NASAs Kennedy Space Center, where the analyses will unfold.  NASA officials stressed that the space agency remains committed to having two competing U.S. companies transporting astronauts. The goal is for SpaceX and Boeing to take turns launching crews  one a year per company  until the space station is abandoned in 2030 right before its fiery reentry. That doesnt give Boeing much time to catch up, but the company intends to push forward with Starliner, according to NASA. Stich said post-landing its too early to know when the next Starliner flight with astronauts might occur.  It will take a little time to determine the path forward, he said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Talking about death can be tricky. Heres how to start the conversation,"NEW YORK (AP)  Dr. Vanessa Rodriguez is no stranger to talking about death. As a palliative care doctor at New Yorks Mount Sinai Hospital, she works with families of patients at the ends of their lives. Many are hesitant to talk about death before the fact since it means imagining a future without their loved one. Talking about death is never easy, but doing so early can help families prepare. Heres how to open the floor for an often tricky conversation. Thinking through details and resolving loose ends can help families cope when the inevitable happens: Where might their loved one like to be buried? Are finances squared away? It really can help ease the anxiety that this moment can bring, Rodriguez said. Settling other questions such as what song to play at a memorial or what old boxes to go through allows a loved one to have a say in their situation. Theyre tough conversations, Rodriguez said. But there are so many tough conversations we have to have in life, and this shouldnt be of less importance. Talking about death with a loved one doesnt make the loss hurt less, Rodriguez said. But it can help families know what to expect. Recently, Rodriguez sat down with a 93-year-old patient and her family. After talking through the patients care details, Rodriguez asked her daughter, Have you thought about what things might look like when your mom isnt here anymore? The daughter brushed it off at first. But as Rodriguez kept talking, tears welled in the daughters eyes. Having limited her mothers hospital visits as much as possible, she realized it was important to her that her mother died at home. Rodriguez then suggested setting the patient up with hospice care at home  treatment designed to reduce pain and suffering in the final months.  Conversations about death go over easier when they come from someone you trust, Rodriguez said. Its important to assess how a family member feels about the topic before going deep. 
        
     Conversations about death dont have to be heavy. Britna Savarese shrugs off the doom and gloom by being direct, asking: Ive been planning my death today. How about you? It almost shocks them, said Savarese, a death doula from Dallas who helps navigate the dying process. But then its kind of silly. And that can be disarming. Savarese hosts Death Cafes: coffee shop soirees where attendees of all ages eat cake and chat about dying. Discussion topics at the cafes, which take place globally, range from funeral horror stories to questions about the afterlife. Cutting through the fear of death can make it less scary to talk about, Savarese said.  But if someone is truly hesitant or scared to talk about it, she recommends framing the conversation around their needs: As scary as it may be to you, its important to me that you have the very best death that you can and that we are honoring you the way that you want to be honored.  Fear of death can stem from the uncertainty surrounding it. Voicing those concerns and preparing ahead of time can allow loved ones and their families to control what they can, Rodriguez said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA spacecraft to study Jupiter moons underground ocean cleared for October launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA on Monday approved next months launch to Jupiters moon Europa after reviewing the spacecrafts ability to withstand the intense radiation there. Questions about the reliability of the transistors on the Europa Clipper spacecraft arose earlier this year after similar problems cropped up elsewhere. With the tight launch window looming, NASA rushed to conduct tests to verify that the electronic parts could survive the $5 billion mission to determine whether the suspected ocean beneath Europas icy crust might be suitable for life. Liftoff remains scheduled for Oct. 10 aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. NASA has three weeks to launch the spacecraft before standing down for more than a year to await another proper planetary alignment; the spacecraft needs to swing past Mars and then Earth for gravity assists. Project manager Jordan Evans said the transistors  located in circuits across the entire spacecraft  are expected to degrade when Europa Clipper is exposed to the worst of the radiation during the 49 flybys of the moon. But they should recover during the three weeks between each encounter, said Evans of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  Teams from labs across the country came to that conclusion following round-the-clock testing over the past four months. The project has high confidence we can complete the original mission for exploring Europa as planned, Evans said. We are ready for Jupiter. 
        
     It will take six years for Europa Clipper to reach Jupiter, where it will orbit the gas giant every three weeks. Dozens of flybys are planned of Europa as close as 16 miles (25 kilometers), allowing cameras and other instruments  including ice-penetrating radar  to map virtually the entire moon. Europa Clipper is the biggest spacecraft ever built by NASA to investigate another planet, spanning more than 100 feet (30 meters) with its solar panels unfurled. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

SpaceX launches a billionaire to conduct the first private spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A daredevil billionaire rocketed back into orbit Tuesday, aiming to perform the first private spacewalk and venture farther than anyone since NASAs Apollo moonshots. Unlike his previous chartered flight, tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman shared the cost with SpaceX this time around, which included developing and testing brand new spacesuits to see how theyll hold up in the harsh vacuum. If all goes as planned, it will be the first time private citizens conduct a spacewalk, but they wont venture away from the capsule. Considered one of the riskiest parts of spaceflight, spacewalks have been the sole realm of professional astronauts since the former Soviet Union popped open the hatch in 1965, closely followed by the U.S. Today, they are routinely done at the International Space Station. Isaacman, along with a pair of SpaceX engineers and a former Air Force Thunderbirds pilot, launched before dawn aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Florida. The spacewalk is scheduled for Thursday, midway through the five-day flight. But first the passengers are shooting for way beyond the International Space Station  an altitude of 870 miles (1,400 kilometers), which would surpass the Earth-lapping record set during NASAs Project Gemini in 1966. Only the 24 Apollo astronauts who flew to the moon have ventured farther.  The plan is to spend 10 hours at that height  filled with extreme radiation and riddled with debris  before reducing the oval-shaped orbit by half. Even at this lower 435 miles (700 kilometers), the orbit would eclipse the space station and even the Hubble Space Telescope, the highest shuttle astronauts flew.  
        
     All four wore SpaceXs spacewalking suits because the entire Dragon capsule will be depressurized for the two-hour spacewalk, exposing everyone to the dangerous environment. Isaacman and SpaceXs Sarah Gillis will take turns briefly popping out of the hatch. Theyll test their white and black-trimmed custom suits by twisting their bodies. Both will always have a hand or foot touching the capsule or attached support structure that resembles the top of a pool ladder. There will be no dangling at the end of their 12-foot (3.6-meter) tethers and no jetpack showboating. Only NASAs suits at the space station come equipped with jetpacks, for emergency use only. Pilot Scott Kidd Poteet and SpaceXs Anna Menon will monitor the spacewalk from inside. Like SpaceXs previous astronaut flights, this one will end with a splashdown off the Florida coast. Were sending you hugs from the ground, Launch Director Frank Messina radioed after the crew reached orbit. May you make history and come home safely. Isaacman replied: We wouldnt be on this journey without all 14,000 of you back at SpaceX and everyone else cheering us on. At a preflight news conference, Isaacman  CEO and founder of the credit card processing company Shift4  refused to say how much he invested in the flight. Not a chance, he said.  SpaceX teamed up with Isaacman to pay for spacesuit development and associated costs, said William Gerstenmaier, a SpaceX vice president who once headed space mission operations for NASA. Were really starting to push the frontiers with the private sector, Gerstenmaier said.  Its the first of three trips that Isaacman bought from Elon Musk 2 1/2 years ago, soon after returning from his first private SpaceX spaceflight in 2021. Isaacman bankrolled that tourist ride for an undisclosed sum, taking along contest winners and a childhood cancer survivor. The trip raised hundreds of millions for St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. Spacesuit development took longer than anticipated, delaying this first so-called Polaris Dawn flight until now. Training was extensive; Poteet said it rivaled anything he experienced during his Air Force flying career. As SpaceX astronaut trainers, Gillis and Menon helped Isaacman and his previous team  as well as NASAs professional crews  prepare for their rides.  I wasnt alive when humans walked on the moon. Id certainly like my kids to see humans walking on the moon and Mars, and venturing out and exploring our solar system, the 41-year-old Isaacman said before liftoff. Poor weather caused a two-week delay. The crew needed favorable forecasts not only for launch, but for splashdown days later. With limited supplies and no ability to reach the space station, they had no choice but to wait for conditions to improve.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Spacewalking is the new domain of the super rich as a billionaire makes first private attempt,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  First came space tourism. Now comes an even bigger thrill for the monied masses: spacewalking. The stage is set for the first private spacewalk Thursday. Tech billionaire Jared Isaacman will pop out of the hatch of his orbiting SpaceX capsule, two days after blasting off from Florida on a chartered flight that lifted him and his crew higher than anyone since NASAs moonwalkers. He partnered with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to buy a series of rocket rides and help develop brand new spacesuits. SpaceX is the first private company to attempt a spacewalk, until now the domain of just 12 countries. Theres a reason why its such a niche and elite group: Spacewalking is considered the most dangerous part of any flight after launch and reentry, and demands extensive training. Spacewalks are a whole different entire ballgame than just strapping into a rocket and riding it, getting some zero-g time and coming back, said retired NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy. Cassidy knows firsthand about the dangers of spacewalking: He was working outside the International Space Station in 2013 when his partner, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, almost drowned. Parmitanos helmet filled with water from his cooling garment, and he barely made it back inside in time. Another 30 minutes that day and the answer might be different, Cassidy said. Cassidy worries theres a slippery slope where the wealthy could try to jump to the front of a spacewalking line with minimal training.  
        
     Risk and disaster analyst Ilan Kelman of University College London said its appropriate and inevitable that non-professionals will end up performing spacewalks. But he anticipates fatalities along the way. We can and should do plenty to reduce the risk, said Kelman. We must be entirely honest with anyone participating, especially the low chance of rescue when something major goes wrong. This spacewalk attempt wont be like what routinely happens at the International Space Station where astronauts float out to do repairs. Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis will venture just barely outside the capsule as they soar about 450 miles (more than 700 kilometers) above Earth. Their orbit was initially twice that high, but reduced for the spacewalk.  Besides being new to spacewalking, the crew of four will test suits fresh off the factory floor. All will be exposed to the vacuum of space since the Dragon capsule, unlike larger space vehicles, lacks an airlock.  For Isaacman, throwing away the cabin atmosphere and then restoring it is the riskiest part of the endeavor.  You cant afford to get anything wrong along that journey or you sidetrack it, Isaacman said. Were going out just long enough to do what we need to do to get the data.  The bulk of their training over the past two years has focused on the spacewalk, the highlight of their planned five-day flight. SpaceX put considerable preparation and testing into the capsule and suits, said SpaceXs Bill Gerstenmaier, a former NASA manager. For safety, Isaacman and Gillis will always keep a foot or hand on the capsule or the ladder-like support that theyll position above the hatch. They will be tethered to 12-foot (3.6-meter) lines, but there will be no dangling at the end of them.  The duo will take turns emerging from the hatch, each spending 15 to 20 minutes outside as they flex and test their suits. Their crewmates  SpaceX engineer Anna Menon and former Air Force Thunderbird pilot Scott Kidd Poteet  will monitor the spacewalk from inside. The entire spacewalk should last no more than two hours. Isaacman has refused to say how much he invested in the flight. To date, 263 individuals representing a dozen countries have performed spacewalks, according to NASA statistics, led by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in 1965 with NASAs Ed White close behind. China, the only other country to launch its own citizens into space, joined the spacewalking club in 2008. Europe, Japan, Canada and the United Arab Emirates also have seen their astronauts float outside, but always in NASA or Russian garb and under NASA or Russian control. With SpaceX intent on getting people to the moon and Mars, we need to start somewhere and the first step is what were doing on this mission, Gillis said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Tech billionaire pulls off first private spacewalk high above Earth,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A tech billionaire popped out from a SpaceX capsule hundreds of miles above Earth and performed the first private spacewalk Thursday, a high-risk endeavor once reserved for professional astronauts. Tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman teamed up with SpaceX to test the companys brand new spacesuits on his chartered flight. The daring feat also saw SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis going out once Isaacman was safely back inside. This spacewalk was simple and quick  the hatch was open barely a half hour  compared with the drawn-out affairs conducted by NASA. Astronauts at the International Space Station often need to move across the sprawling complex for repairs, always traveling in pairs and lugging gear. Station spacewalks can last seven to eight hours; this one clocked in at less than two hours. Isaacman emerged first, joining a small elite group of spacewalkers who until now had included only professional astronauts from a dozen countries.  Back at home, we all have a lot of work to do. But from here, it sure looks like a perfect world, Isaacman said as the capsule soared above the South Pacific. Cameras on board caught his silhouette, waist high at the hatch, with the blue Earth beneath. The commercial spacewalk was the main focus of the five-day flight financed by Isaacman and Elon Musks company, and the culmination of years of development geared toward settling Mars and other planets. 
        
     All four on board donned the new spacewalking suits to protect themselves from the harsh vacuum. They launched on Tuesday from Florida, rocketing farther from Earth than anyone since NASAs moonwalkers. The orbit was reduced by half  to 460 miles (740 kilometers)  for the spacewalk. This first spacewalking test involved more stretching than walking. Isaacman kept a hand or foot attached to the capsule the whole time as he flexed his arms and legs to see how the spacesuit held up. The hatch sported a walker-like structure for extra support. After roughly 10 minutes outside, Isaacman was replaced by Gillis to go through the same motions. The SpaceX engineer bobbed up and down in weightlessness, no higher than her knees out of the capsule, as she twisted her arms and sent reports back to Mission Control. Each had 12-foot (3.6-meter) tethers but did not unfurl them or dangle at the end unlike what happens at the space station, where astronauts routinely float out at a much lower orbit. More and more wealthy passengers are plunking down huge sums for rides aboard private rockets to experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Others have spent tens of millions to stay in space for days or even weeks. Space experts and risk analysts say its inevitable that some will seek the thrill of spacewalking, deemed one of the most dangerous parts of spaceflight after launch and reentry but also the most soul-stirring.  This operation was planned down to the minute with little room for error. Trying out new spacesuits from a spacecraft new to spacewalking added to the risk. So did the fact that the entire capsule was exposed to the vacuum of space. There were a few glitches. Isaacman had to manually pull the hatch open instead of pushing a button on board. Before heading out, Gillis reported seeing bulges in the hatch seal.  Scott Kidd Poteet, a former Air Force Thunderbird pilot, and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon stayed strapped to their seats to monitor from inside. All four underwent intensive training before the trip.  It went by in the blink of an eye, said SpaceX commentator Kate Tice.  Congratulations streamed in after the spacewalk concluded at one hour and 46 minutes  or a full swing and then some around Earth. Todays success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said via X. Isaacman, 41, CEO and founder of the Shift4 credit card-processing company, has declined to disclose how much he invested in the flight. It was the first of three flights in a program hes dubbed Polaris; this one was called Polaris Dawn. For SpaceXs inaugural private flight in 2021, he took up contest winners and a cancer survivor.  Until Thursday, only 263 people had conducted a spacewalk, representing 12 countries. The Soviet Unions Alexei Leonov kicked it off in 1965, followed a few months later by NASAs Ed White. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Solar storms may cause faint auroras overnight in parts of Northern Hemisphere,"NEW YORK (AP)  Solar storms may bring faint but visible auroras to the Northern Hemisphere starting late Thursday and extending into early Friday morning. But, experts say, dont expect power grids and communications to be disrupted much. People in Canada and northern U.S. states including Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota may be able to see faint colorful displays, according to the current space weather forecast. If the moderate solar storms become more intense as nighttime approaches, people as far south as Illinois and New York might be able to glimpse the phenomenon.  All the stars have to align for that to happen, said Erica Grow Cei, spokesperson for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To spy the spectacle, wait for skies to get dark and then go outside, ideally away from bright city lights. Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that arent visible to the naked eye. The suns magnetic field is at the peak of its 11-year cycle, making storms and aurora displays more frequent. Unusually strong solar storms in May produced vibrant aurora displays across the Northern Hemisphere.  The night storms are expected to be less intense, but could cause brief disruptions to precision GPS machinery like what farmers use to harvest crops, Grow Cei said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Stuck-in-space astronauts reflect on being left behind and adjusting to life in orbit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Stuck-in-space astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams said Friday its been tough dealing with their Boeing ride leaving without them and the prospect of spending several extra months in orbit. It was their first public comments since last weeks return of the Boeing Starliner capsule that took them to the International Space Station in June. They remained behind after NASA determined the problem-plagued capsule posed too much risk for them to ride back in. Their eight-day mission is now expected to last more than eight months. It was trying at times. There were some tough times all the way through, Wilmore said from 260 miles (420 kilometers) up. As spacecraft pilots, you dont want to see it go off without you, but thats where we wound up. While they never expected to be up there nearly a year, as Starliners first test pilots, they knew there could be problems that might delay their return. Thats how things go in this business, Williams said.  Wilmore and Williams are now full-fledged station crew members, chipping in on routine maintenance and experiments. Williams will take over command of the space station in a few more weeks, Wilmore told reporters during a news conference  only their second since blasting off from Florida on June 5. The duo, along with seven others on board, welcomed a Soyuz spacecraft carrying two Russians and an American earlier this week, temporarily raising the station population to 12, a near record. And two more astronauts will fly up on SpaceX later this month; two capsule seats will be left empty for Wilmore and Williams for the return leg.  
        
     The transition to station life was not that hard since both had previous stints there, said Williams, who logged two long space station stays years ago.  This is my happy place. I love being up here in space, she said.  Wilmore noted that if his adjustment wasnt instantaneous, it was pretty close. The astronauts said they appreciate all the prayers and well wishes from strangers back home, and that its helped them cope with everything theyll miss out on back home. Williams couldnt help but fret for a while over losing precious face-to-face time with her mother. Wilmore wont be around for his youngest daughters final year of high school. He just requested an absentee ballot on Friday so he can vote in the November election from orbit. Both stressed the importance of carrying out their civic duties as their mission goes on.  Their Starliner capsule marked the first Boeing spaceflight with astronauts. It endured a series of thruster failures and helium leaks before arriving at the space station on June 6. It landed safely in the New Mexico desert earlier this month, but Boeings path forward in NASAs commercial crew program remains uncertain.  The space agency hired SpaceX and Boeing as an orbital taxi service a decade ago after the shuttles retired. SpaceX has been flying astronauts since 2020. Williams said shes excited to fly two different spacecraft on the same mission. Were testers, thats what we do, she said.  We wanted to take Starliner to the completion and land it back on land at home, she added. But you have to turn the page and look at the next opportunity.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Its summer solstice time. What does that mean?,"DALLAS (AP)  Its time for the start of summer  with a full moon to boot. Heres what to know about the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere on Thursday.  The Earth spins on a tilt as it revolves around the sun. The summer solstice occurs for Earths upper half when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted most closely toward the sun. This also marks the longest day and shortest night of the year. Around the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is at its most extreme tilt away from the sun, entering winter solstice and its shortest day of the year. Six months later, the halves will switch it up: The Northern Hemisphere will experience a winter solstice, and the Southern Hemisphere will have a summer solstice. Equinoxes mark the start of spring and autumn, and happen when Earths axis and orbit line up such that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight. The vernal equinox on March 19 kicked off spring, and the autumnal equinox on Sept. 22 will usher in fall. This years summer solstice comes with a treat: the first full moon of the summer, coined the strawberry moon. The moon wont be pink or red in color: Its name comes from several Indigenous tribes who noticed that its timing coincided with the strawberry harvest. On Friday evening, cast your eyes to the southeast to glimpse the full moon peeking above the horizon. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Why NASA astronauts are delayed at the space station after Boeing Starliner launch,"NEW YORK (AP)  When two veteran NASA astronauts blasted off on a test drive of Boeings new capsule, they expected to head home from the International Space Station in a week or so. Its now three weeks and counting for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams as NASA and Boeing troubleshoot equipment problems that popped up on the way there. Three potential landing dates were called off and their return flight was put on hold. On Friday, officials said theres no rush to bring them home and more testing will be done first. I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space, said Steve Stich, NASAs commercial crew program manager. Stich said the astronauts could use the capsule if there was an emergency at the space station and they needed to make a quick getaway. The long-delayed test flight is the first with astronauts aboard. Boeing will eventually join SpaceX in ferrying crews to and from the space station for NASA. When the return trip was put on hold, NASA said it wanted more time to analyze problems in the spacecrafts propulsion system, which is used to maneuver in flight. The propulsion system is attached to the capsule, but it doesnt come back to Earth for inspection. It is ditched during reentry and burns up.  The space agency also said it didnt want the departure to conflict with spacewalks. But Mondays spacewalk was called off after water leaked from an astronauts spacesuit while she was still inside the orbiting lab. A spacewalk planned for Tuesday has been postponed until the end of July while the leak is scrutinized.  Five of the capsules 28 thrusters went down during docking, as the capsule closed in on the space station. All but one thruster was restarted, and they worked during a later test firing, NASA said. Officials suspect that heat from all the thruster action at docking caused the shutdown. The one faulty thruster has been turned off.  Stich said more thruster testing on the ground will be done before setting a return date. The capsule launched June 5 with one small helium leak, but four more leaks sprung up by the time it reached the space station. Helium is used to pressurize fuel for the thrusters, and a faulty rubber seal was suspected in the initial leak. Officials say theres an ample supply of helium, and Boeing says the leaks are stable and not a concern.  We understand these issues for safe return, said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi. We dont understand these issues well enough to fix them permanently. Stich said it will take a couple weeks for the thruster testing in the New Mexico desert. Initially, officials said the capsule could be at the space station for 45 days because of the batteries on board, but Friday they said that could be extended. Wilmore and Williams have been pitching in with chores and research at the space station, along with their duties checking out systems on the Boeing capsule. Both previously spent time at the space station. NASA said there were plenty of supplies at the space station for the pair and the seven long-term residents. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

A harmless asteroid will whiz past Earth Saturday. Heres how to spot it,"An asteroid will whiz harmlessly past Earth this weekend. With the right equipment and timing, you just might spot it. Called 2024 MK, the space rock will make its closest approach to Earth Saturday morning, passing by at about three-quarters the distance from Earth to the moon. It was first spotted two weeks ago by a South African observatory and is about 393 feet to 853 feet (120 meters to 260 meters) wide. Smaller objects shoot past Earth all the time, according to asteroid expert Davide Farnocchia with NASAs Center for Near-Earth Object Studies. Asteroids the size of this latest one fly by about every 25 years or so. Were going to see a few of those during our lifetimes, but its not something that happens every other day, he said. A 7,579-foot (2,310-meter) asteroid flew safely past Earth Thursday, but it was farther away and was only visible to professional telescopes. For Saturday, skywatchers will need to grab a small telescope since the asteroid isnt bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. And itll be moving quickly across the southern sky, making it difficult to spot. The asteroid will be plowing through that field of stars, said Nick Moskovitz, an astronomer at Lowell Observatory. Viewers in the Southern Hemisphere will have the best chance of seeing it since the asteroid will appear higher overhead. Those in the U.S. may want to wait until Saturday night, when the asteroid may appear less bright but will be easier to spot without interference from the suns blinding light. 
        
     If you miss out, mark your calendar for April 13, 2029, when an asteroid called Apophis will fly by Earth and will be visible to the naked eye from parts of Europe, Africa and Asia.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA astronauts will stay at the space station longer for more troubleshooting of Boeing capsule,"Two NASA astronauts will stay longer at the International Space Station as engineers troubleshoot problems on Boeings new space capsule that cropped up on the trip there. NASA on Friday did not set a return date until testing on the ground was complete and said the astronauts were safe.  Were not in any rush to come home, said NASAs commercial crew program manager Steve Stich.  Veteran NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams blasted off aboard Boeings Starliner capsule for the orbiting laboratory on June 5. It was the first astronaut launch for Boeing after years of delays and setbacks.  The test flight was expected to last a week or so, enough time for Wilmore and Williams to check out the capsule while docked at the station. But problems with the capsules propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft, prompted NASA and Boeing to delay the flight home several times while they analyzed the trouble.  They also wanted to avoid conflicting with spacewalks by station astronauts. But a spacewalk this week was canceled after water leaked from an astronauts spacesuit. The issue hasnt been resolved and the planned spacewalk next week was postponed.  As Starliner closed in on the space station a day after launch, last-minute thruster failures almost derailed the docking. Five of the capsules 28 thrusters went down during docking; all but one thruster was restarted.  
        
     Starliner already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit and several more leaks sprung up during the flight. Helium is used to pressurize fuel for the thrusters. Boeing said this week that the two problems arent a concern for the return trip.  In delaying the astronauts return, NASA and Boeing said they needed more time to collect information about the thruster trouble and leaks while the capsule was docked. Both are in the service module, a unit attached to the capsule that burns up during reentry.  NASA initially said the Starliner could stay docked at the space station for up to 45 days due to battery limits. But in-flight tests have shown that limit can be extended, Stich said. Officials said they wont set a return date while they do ground tests of capsule thrusters in the New Mexico desert, which were expected to last a couple of weeks. They want to try to replicate the situation that occurred during docking.  I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space, said Stich, adding that Starliner is designed for a mission of up to 210 days.  Stich said the astronauts could return to Earth in Starliner in the case of a space station emergency.  After the space shuttle fleet retired, NASA turned over astronaut rides to private companies.

"Astronauts confident Boeing space capsule can safely return them to Earth, despite failures","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Two astronauts who should have been back on Earth weeks ago said Wednesday that theyre confident that Boeings space capsule can return them safely, despite a string of vexing breakdowns. NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Boeings new Starliner capsule early last month, the first people to ride it. Helium leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at the International Space Station, and have kept them there much longer than planned. Now the earliest they could return may be the end of July, officials said. In their first news conference from orbit, the pair said they expect to return once thruster testing is complete here on Earth. They said theyre not complaining about getting extra time in orbit, and are enjoying helping the station crew. Both have previously spent stints at the orbiting lab, which is also home to seven others. I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem, Williams told reporters. The test flight should have lasted eight days, ending on June 14. NASAs commercial crew program director Steve Stich said the earliest the Starliner astronauts might return is the end of July. The goal is to get them back before SpaceX delivers a fresh crew in mid-August, but that, too, could change, he noted. This week, NASA and Boeing are trying to duplicate the Starliners thruster problems on a brand new unit at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, one of the prime landing sites in the U.S. western desert. The trouble is in the propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft. 
        
     Five thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. Wilmore said there should be enough working thrusters to get him and Williams out of orbit. There are also bigger engines that could fill in, if necessary. That mantra youve heard, failure is not an option, thats why we are staying here now, Wilmore said. We trust that the tests that were doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back. Boeing and NASA consider the ground tests essential to determine what might have gone wrong since that part of the capsule  the service module  is discarded before landing. The leaks also are located in this disposable section. So far, testing has not replicated the hot temperatures reached during the flight, according to Stich. Managers want to make sure the suspect thrusters are not damaged, before bringing Starliner back. They were fired more frequently than anticipated early in the flight, and the extra demand on them may have caused them to fail, Stich noted. At the same time, ground tests are being conducted to better understand the helium leaks, which could stem from bad seals. Officials have previously said there is ample helium left for the trip home. Hurricane Beryl slowed some of the work. Johnson Space Center in Houston, home to the control centers for both NASA and Boeing, was closed earlier this week to all but the most critical staff. Boeings Mark Nappi stressed that in an emergency, Starliner and its crew could return right now. While the company does not believe the thrusters are damaged, we want to fill in the blanks and run this test to assure ourselves of that.  NASA ordered up the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago for astronaut flights to and from the space station, paying each company billions of dollars. SpaceXs first taxi flight with astronauts was in 2020. Boeings first crew flight was repeatedly delayed because of software and other issues. There have been no discussions with SpaceX about sending up a rescue capsule, Stich said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Fossils show huge salamanderlike predator with sharp fangs existed before the dinosaurs,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Scientists have revealed fossils of a giant salamanderlike beast with sharp fangs that ruled waters before the first dinosaurs arrived.  The predator, which was larger than a person, likely used its wide, flat head and front teeth to suck in and chomp unsuspecting prey, researchers said. Its skull was about 2 feet (60 centimeters) long. Its acting like an aggressive stapler, said Michael Coates, a biologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the work. Fossil remnants of four creatures collected about a decade ago were analyzed, including a partial skull and backbone. The findings on Gaiasia jennyae were published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The creature existed some 40 million years before dinosaurs evolved.  Researchers have long examined such ancient predators to uncover the origins of tetrapods: four-legged animals that clambered onto land with fingers instead of fins and evolved to amphibians, birds and mammals including humans. Most early tetrapod fossils hail from hot, prehistoric coal swamps along the equator in whats now North America and Europe. But these latest remnants, dating back to about 280 million years ago, were found in modern-day Namibia, an area in Africa that was once encrusted with glaciers and ice. That means tetrapods may have thrived in colder climates earlier than scientists expected, prompting more questions about how and when they took over the Earth. 
        
     The early story of the first tetrapods is much more complex than we thought, said co-author Claudia Marsicano at the University of Buenos Aires, who was part of the research. The creatures name comes from the Gai-As rock formation in Namibia where the fossils were found and for the late paleontologist Jennifer Clack, who studied how tetrapods evolved. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

SpaceX rocket accident leaves companys Starlink satellites in wrong orbit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX rocket has failed for the first time in nearly a decade, leaving the companys internet satellites in an orbit so low that theyre doomed to fall through the atmosphere and burn up. The Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from California on Thursday night, carrying 20 Starlink satellites. Several minutes into the flight, the upper stage engine malfunctioned. SpaceX on Friday blamed a liquid oxygen leak. The company said flight controllers managed to make contact with half of the satellites and attempted to boost them to a higher orbit using onboard ion thrusters. But with the low end of their orbit only 84 miles (135 kilometers) above Earth  less than half what was intended  our maximum available thrust is unlikely to be enough to successfully raise the satellites, the company said via X.  SpaceX said the satellites will reenter the atmosphere and burn up. There was no mention of when they might come down. More than 6,000 orbiting Starlinks currently provide internet service to customers in some of the most remote corners of the world. The Federal Aviation Administration said the problem must be fixed before Falcon rockets can fly again. It was not known if or how the accident might impact SpaceXs upcoming crew flights. A billionaires spaceflight is scheduled for July 31 from Florida with plans for the first private spacewalk, followed in mid-August by an astronaut flight to the International Space Station for NASA. 
        
     The tech entrepreneur who will lead the private flight, Jared Isaacman, said Friday that SpaceXs Falcon 9 has an incredible track record and as well as an emergency escape system.  The last launch failure occurred in 2015 during a space station cargo run. Another rocket exploded the following year during testing on the ground. SpaceXs Elon Musk said the high flight rate will make it easier to identify and correct the problem.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Webb Space Telescopes latest cosmic shot shows pair of intertwined galaxies glowing in infrared,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Webb Space Telescope has captured a pair of intertwined galaxies glowing in the infrared. The observatory operated by NASA and the European Space Agency photographed the two galaxies 326 million light-years away, surrounded by a blue haze of stars and gas. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. The pictures, released Friday, marks the second anniversary of Webbs science operations.  The neighboring galaxies, nicknamed Penguin and the Egg, have been tangled up for tens of millions of years, according to NASA. Theyll eventually merge into a single galaxy. The same interaction will happen to our own Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy in 4 billion years, the space agency said.  Considered the successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope, Webb is the biggest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever launched. It rocketed away in 2021 and underwent six months of commissioning, before its first official images were released in July 2022.  Its positioned 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth. In just two years, Webb has transformed our view of the universe, NASAs Mark Clampin said in a statement.

"A cave on the moon is confirmed, and scientists suspect hundreds more like it could house future explorers","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Scientists have confirmed a cave on the moon, not far from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago, and suspect there are hundreds more that could house future astronauts. An Italian-led team reported Monday that theres evidence for a sizable cave accessible from the deepest known pit on the moon. Its located at the Sea of Tranquility, just 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Apollo 11s landing site. The pit, like the more than 200 others discovered up there, was created by the collapse of a lava tube. Researchers analyzed radar measurements by NASAs Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and compared the results with lava tubes on Earth. Their findings appeared in the journal Nature Astronomy.  The radar data reveals only the initial part of the underground cavity, according to the scientists. They estimate its at least 130 feet (40 meters) wide and tens of yards (meters) long, probably more. Lunar caves have remained a mystery for over 50 years. So it was exciting to be able to finally prove the existence of one, Leonardo Carrer and Lorenzo Bruzzone of the University of Trento, wrote in an email. Most of the pits seem to be located in the moons ancient lava plains, according to the scientists. There also could be some at the moons south pole, the planned location of NASAs astronaut landings later this decade. Permanently shadowed craters there are believed to hold frozen water that could provide drinking water and rocket fuel. 
        
     During NASAs Apollo program, 12 astronauts landed on the moon, beginning with Armstrong and Aldrin on July 20, 1969. The findings suggest there could be hundreds of pits on the moon and thousands of lava tubes. Such places could serve as a natural shelter for astronauts, protecting them from cosmic rays and solar radiation as well as from micrometeorite strikes. Building habitats from scratch would be more time-consuming and challenging, even when factoring in the potential need of reinforcing the cave walls to prevent a collapse, the team said.  Rocks and other material inside these caves  unaltered by the harsh surface conditions over the eons  also can help scientists better understand how the moon evolved, especially involving its volcanic activity ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How NASA and SpaceX will bring down the space station when its retired,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX will use a powerful, souped-up capsule to shove the International Space Station out of orbit once time is up for the sprawling lab. NASA and Elon Musks company on Wednesday outlined the plan to burn the space station up on reentry and plunge whats left into the ocean, ideally at the beginning of 2031 when it hits the 32-year mark. The space agency rejected other options, like taking the station apart and bringing everything home or handing the keys to someone else. NASA gave SpaceX a $843 million contract to bring down the station  the biggest structure ever built off the planet. Heres a rundown on the work and challenges ahead: The space station is already is showing signs of age. Russia and the U.S. launched the first pieces in late 1998, and astronauts moved in two years later. Europe and Japan added their own segments, and Canada provided robotic arms. By the time NASAs shuttles retired in 2011, the station had grown to the size of a football field, with a mass of nearly 1 million pounds (430,000 kilograms). NASA figures the station will last until at least 2030. The goal is for private companies to launch their own space stations by then, with NASA serving as one of many customers. That strategy  already in place for station cargo and crew deliveries  will free NASA up to focus on moon and Mars travel. NASA could decide to extend the stations life, too, if no commercial outposts are up there yet. The aim is to have an overlap so scientific research is not interrupted. NASA considered dismantling the space station and hauling the pieces back to Earth, or letting private companies salvage the parts for their own planned outposts. But the station was never intended to be taken apart in orbit, according to NASA, and any such effort would be expensive and also risky to the astronauts who would handle the disassembly. Besides, theres no spacecraft as big as NASAs old shuttles to bring everything down. Another option would be to boost the empty station to a higher, more stable orbit. But that, too, was dismissed given the logistical issues and the increased risk of space junk. Visiting spacecraft periodically boost the space station so it remains in an orbit approximately 260 miles (420 kilometers) high. Otherwise, it would keep getting lower and lower until it plunged, uncontrolled, from orbit. NASA wants to ensure a safe reentry over a remote section of the South Pacific or possibly the Indian Ocean, so that means launching a spacecraft that will dock to the station and steer it toward a watery grave. NASA expects some denser pieces to survive, ranging in size from a microwave oven to a sedan, in a narrow debris field 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) long. NASA and its partners considered using three Russian supply ships for the job, but a more robust craft was needed. The call went out to industry and, in June, SpaceX won the contract for a deorbit vehicle.  
        
     SpaceX plans to use an ordinary Dragon capsule  the kind that carries supplies and astronauts to the space station  but with a much bigger trunk housing a record 46 engines and more than 35,000 pounds (16,000 kilograms) of fuel. SpaceXs Sarah Walker said the challenge will be creating a spacecraft powerful enough to guide the space station while resisting the tugs and forces from increased atmospheric drag during final descent. This spacecraft will require an especially powerful rocket just to get to orbit, according to NASA. The capsule would be launched 1 1/2 years before the stations planned demise. Astronauts still would be aboard as its gradually lowered. Six months before the stations destruction, the crew would abandon ship and return home. Once the station is down to about 137 miles (220 kilometers), the Dragon would bring it down four days later.  NASAs first space station, Skylab, came crashing down in 1979, with debris raining down onto Australia and the surrounding Pacific. The space agency had hoped one of the first space shuttle crews could attach a rocket to control Skylabs descent or boost its orbit. But the shuttle wasnt ready by then, with its first flight not until 1981. Ground controllers managed to send Skylab into a slow tumble, aiming for the Indian Ocean. But some pieces also landed in Western Australia. Russia has had more experience with incoming space stations. Mir operated for 15 years before being guided to a fiery reentry over the Pacific in 2001. Before that, several Salyut stations bit the dust. NASA wants to bring back some small items from inside the space station for museum display, like the ships bell and logs, panels with patches and other mementos. Those can come down in SpaceX supply ships in the final year or two. Unfortunately, we cant bring home really, really big stuff, said NASAs Ken Bowersox. The emotional part of me would love to try and save some, but the most practical approach is to bring everything down in one destructive stroke, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Moon fests, moon movie and even a full moon mark 55th anniversary of Apollo 11 landing","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The cosmos is providing a full moon for the 55th anniversary of the first lunar landing this weekend, and plenty of other events honor Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrins giant leap. Aldrin, 94, the last surviving member of the Apollo 11 crew, headlines a gala at the San Diego Air and Space Museum on Saturday night. Hell be joined by astronaut Charlie Duke, who was the voice inside Mission Control for the July 20, 1969 moon landing. Museum President Jim Kidrick couldnt resist throwing a bash 55 years to the day of one of the most historic moments in not only the history of America, but in the history of the world. Cant make it to San Diego, Cape Canaveral or Houston? There are plenty of other ways to celebrate the moon landing, including the new film Fly Me to the Moon, a light-hearted lookback starring Scarlett Johansson. And you can explore all things Apollo 11 on a special website by the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum. If nothing else, soak in the full moon Saturday night into Sunday morning. Heres a rundown of some Apollo 11 tributes: NASAs Kennedy Space Center is holding a moon fest at its tourist stop, just a few miles from where the Saturn V rocket thundered away with Armstrong, Aldrin and Michael Collins on July 16, 1969. Houstons Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining. Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed, Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles (386,000 kilometers) away. No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message. 
        
     Thats one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohios Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museums tribute Saturday begins with a pair of Run to the Moon races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles (240 kilometers) away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix. Aldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering Magnificent desolation. They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrongs spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. Its on display at the Smithsonians National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012. The capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins  dubbed Columbia  splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds (22 kilograms) of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houstons Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972. NASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year  part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollos twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround  short for Space Launch System  is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. Its arriving by barge from NASAs Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025  at the earliest  with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Boeing is closer to understanding thruster failures on its first astronaut flight with latest test,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeing is closer to understanding what went wrong with its astronaut capsule in orbit, now that testing is complete on a spare thruster here on Earth.  The Starliner capsule has been docked at the International Space Station since June 6. It should have returned with its NASA test pilots by mid-June, but thruster failures and helium leaks prompted NASA and Boeing to extend its stay.  Officials said Thursday theres still no return date for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. Engineers will first disassemble the thruster that was test-fired in New Mexico over the past couple of weeks. Then theyll analyze the data before clearing Starliner for the trip home.  We collected an incredible amount of data on the thruster that could help us better understand what is going on in flight, NASAs commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said in a statement. The testing managed to replicate the thruster conditions up until the capsules docking at the space station, as well as what the thrusters will experience between undocking and descent, according to NASA.

NASA says no return date yet for astronauts and troubled Boeing capsule at space station,"Already more than a month late getting back, two NASA astronauts will remain at the International Space Station until engineers finish working on problems plaguing their Boeing capsule, officials said Thursday. Test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were supposed to visit the orbiting lab for about a week and return in mid-June, but thruster failures and helium leaks on Boeings new Starliner capsule prompted NASA and Boeing to keep them up longer.  NASAs commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said mission managers are not ready to announce a return date. The goal is to bring Wilmore and Williams back aboard Starliner, he added. Well come home when were ready, Stich said.  Stich acknowledged that backup options are under review. SpaceXs Dragon capsule is another means of getting NASA astronauts to and from the space station. NASA always has contingency options, he said. Engineers last week completed testing on a spare thruster in the New Mexico desert and will rip it apart to try to understand what went wrong ahead of the Starliners docking. Five thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. It appears degraded seals are to blame for the helium leaks and thruster problems  entirely separate issues  but more analysis is needed. The team will test-fire the capsules thrusters this weekend while docked to the space station to gather more data, said Boeings Mark Nappi. 
        
     Each of the 28 maneuvering thrusters can fit in a hand and weighs 2 pounds (1 kilogram). The capsule is also outfitted with bigger engines for dropping out of orbit at flights end. All these are part of a segment that is discarded before landing, which means nothing to study for future flights. After the space shuttles retired, NASA hired private companies for astronaut rides to the space station, paying Boeing and SpaceX billions of dollars.  This was the Boeings first test flight with a crew aboard. The initial demo in 2019, flying empty, never made it to the space station because of bad software, and Boeing repeated the test in 2022. More issues later cropped up. SpaceX has been ferrying astronauts since 2020. SpaceXs Falcon 9 rockets have been grounded for the past two weeks because of an upper-stage failure on a satellite-delivery mission. The longer the stand-down continues, the more likely upcoming crew flights will be delayed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA telescope spots a super Jupiter that takes more than a century to go around its star,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A super Jupiter has been spotted around a neighboring star by the Webb Space Telescope  and it has a super orbit.  The planet is roughly the same diameter as Jupiter, but with six times the mass. Its atmosphere is also rich in hydrogen like Jupiters. One big difference: It takes this planet more than a century, possibly as long as 250 years, to go around its star. Its 15 times the distance from its star than Earth is to the sun.  Scientists had long suspected a big planet circled this star 12 light-years away, but not this massive or far from its star. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. These new observations show the planet orbits the star Epsilon Indi A, part of a three-star system.  An international team led by Max Planck Institute for Astronomys Elisabeth Matthews in Germany collected the images last year and published the findings Wednesday in the journal Nature. Astronomers directly observed the incredibly old and cold gas giant  a rare and tricky feat  by masking the star through use of a special shading device on Webb. By blocking the starlight, the planet stood out as a pinpoint of infrared light.  The planet and star clock in at 3.5 billion years old, 1 billion years younger than our own solar system, but still considered old and brighter than expected, according to Matthews. The star is so close and bright to our own solar system that its visible with the naked eye in the Southern Hemisphere. 
        
     Dont bet on life, though. This is a gas giant with no hard surface or liquid water oceans, Matthews said in an email.  Its unlikely this solar system sports more gas giants, she said, but small rocky worlds could be lurking there. Worlds similar to Jupiter can help scientists understand how these planets evolve over giga-year timescales, she said.  The first planets outside our solar system  dubbed exoplanets  were confirmed in the early 1990s. NASAs tally now stands at 5,690 as of mid-July. The vast majority were detected via the transit method, in which a fleeting dip in starlight, repeated at regular intervals, indicates an orbiting planet. Telescopes in space and also on the ground are on the hunt for even more, especially planets that might be similar to Earth.  Launched in 2021, NASA and the European Space Agencys Webb telescope is the biggest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever placed in space.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Two meteor showers will flash across the sky around the same time in late July,"Get ready for a meteor shower doubleheader.  The Southern Delta Aquariid meteor shower peaks in late July. And this year, it will coincide with a second smaller meteor shower, the Alpha Capricornids.  The Delta Aquariids occur every year in North Americas late summer. This years peak activity happens early Tuesday morning, with an expected 15 to 20 meteors visible per hour in the Northern Hemisphere, under dark skies. Viewing should be even better in the Southern Hemisphere. The shower lasts through August 21, according to the American Meteor Society.  Around the same time, the Alpha Capricornid meteor shower should produce around five meteors per hour and lasts through August 15.  Heres what to know about the Delta Aquariids and other meteor showers.   Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you dont need special equipment to see them.  Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. The source of the Delta Aquariids is thought to be from the comet 96P/Machholz. The Alpha Capricornids originate from the comet 169P/NEAT. When rocks from space enter Earths atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them  the end of a shooting star.  The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky. 
        
     These two meteor showers are not high volume, but the Alpha Capricornids often produces very bright meteors, said University of Warwick astronomer Don Pollacco. For skygazers, one bright one is worth 20 faint ones, he said.   Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.  Its easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest. And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you arent checking your phone. It ruins your night vision, said NASAs Bill Cooke. The Southern Hemisphere will have the best view of Delta Aquariids. Coinciding with a waning moon around 30% full means the clearest viewing will happen after midnight.   The meteor society keeps an updated list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions.  The next major meteor shower will be the Perseids, peaking in mid-August.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA delays next crew launch to buy more time at the space station for Boeings troubled capsule,"NASA is delaying its next astronaut launch to buy more time at the International Space Station for Boeings troubled new crew capsule.  The space agency said Tuesday its bumping SpaceXs four-person flight from this month to next. Its now targeted for Sept. 24 at the earliest. Officials said that will give them more time to analyze thruster and leak problems that hit Boeings Starliner capsule after its June liftoff, its first with a crew on board.  Tuesday marked the two-month point at the space station for Starliners test pilots, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who should have been back by mid-June. NASA is weighing all its options for returning the two veteran astronauts, including a ride home in a SpaceX capsule. NASA and Boeing continue to evaluate the spacecrafts readiness, and no decisions have been made regarding Starliners return, NASA said in a statement. Further details were expected at a news conference set for Wednesday. Only two docking ports at the space station can accommodate U.S. astronaut capsules and, right now, both are occupied. So one will need to be vacated before the next SpaceX crew can arrive. Russia has its own parking places for its Soyuz capsules. The latest setback means the four astronauts who flew up with SpaceX in March now also face a longer mission than planned. Over the past several weeks, Boeing has conducted thruster test firings on the ground as well as in space to better understand why five thrusters failed ahead of Starliners June 6 arrival at the space station. All but one came back online. Helium leaks in the capsules propulsion system also cropped up.  
        
     Citing the testing, the company late last week said: Boeing remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew.  Boeing and SpaceX topped NASAs list for astronaut taxi service to and from the space station, after the shuttles retired in 2011. NASA signed contracts worth billions with both companies in order to have a backup in case one of them got sidelined by an accident.  SpaceX launched its first crew in 2020; the upcoming flight will be its 10th astronaut flight for NASA. Its also sent a few private crews into orbit. Boeing has had to overcome multiple Starliner problems over the years. The company had to launch an empty Starliner twice before committing to a crew, repeating the initial flight test because of bad software and other issues. The delays have cost the company more than $1 billion.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA says chances are growing that astronauts may switch from Boeing to a SpaceX ride back to Earth,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  What should have been a quick trip to the International Space Station may turn into an eight-month stay for two NASA astronauts if they have to switch from Boeing to SpaceX for a ride home.  Theres lingering uncertainty over the safety of Boeings new Starliner capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday, and the space agency is split over the risk. As a result, chances are increasing that test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty. If that happens, NASA would leave behind two of four astronauts from the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip next February. The pair expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as Starliners first crew.  NASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time, NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup,  At this point, we could take either path, said Ken Bowersox, NASAs space operations mission chief. During a recent meeting, We heard from a lot of folks that had concern, and the decision was not clear, he said. A final decision is expected by mid-August. Boeing issued a brief statement following NASAs news update, repeating its position that the capsule could still safely bring the astronauts home. 
        
     We still believe in Starliners capability and its flight rationale. the company said. Boeing will need to modify the capsules software in case Starliner ends up returning without a crew.  No serious consideration was given to launching a separate SpaceX flight just to retrieve Wilmore and Williams, according to commercial crew program manager Steve Stich. Tests on the ground have replicated the thrust problems, pointing to seals as one culprit. But its still not understood how or why those seals swell when overheated and then shrink back to the proper size, Stich noted. All but one of the Starliners five failed thrusters have since been reactivated in orbit. These thrusters are essential for allowing Starliner to back away from the space station following undocking, and for keeping the capsule in the proper position for the deorbit. At the same time, engineers are grappling over helium leaks in Starliners propulsion system, crucial for maneuvering. The first leak occurred before liftoff, but was deemed isolated and stable. Then more cropped up in flight. NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, after the shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX flew its first crew in 2020. Boeing stumbled on its first test flight without a crew and then fell further behind after a repeat demo. Officials repeated their desire for a backup taxi service on Wednesday, A situation like this one could happen again, and thats why we want multiple vehicles, Bowersox said. The next crew flight will be SpaceXs 10th for NASA. On Tuesday, it was delayed for a month until late September to allow for extra time to figure out how best to handle Starliners return. Three NASA astronauts and one Russian are assigned to the flight, and managers on Wednesday declined to say who might be bumped.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

The Perseids are here. Heres how to see the fireballs of summers brightest meteor shower,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The Perseids are back to dazzle the sky with bursts of light and color.  The annual meteor shower, active since July, peaks before dawn Monday. Its one of the brightest and most easily viewed showers of the year, producing bright blue meteors  and lots of them, said University of Warwick astronomer Don Pollacco.  More than 50 meteors per hour are expected, according to the American Meteor Society. The shower lasts through Sept. 1.  Heres what to know about the Perseids and other meteor showers.   Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you dont need special equipment to see them. Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. The source of the Perseids is the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. When rocks from space enter Earths atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them  the end of a shooting star. The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky. The Perseids result from bigger particles than a lot of other showers, said NASAs Bill Cooke, giving them the appearance of bright fireballs  easier to spot than many others.  Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours. Its easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest. The Northern Hemisphere will have the best view of the Perseids. This years peak coincides with a moon around 44% full.

"A wild orangutan used a medicinal plant to treat a wound, scientists say","WASHINGTON (AP)  An orangutan appeared to treat a wound with medicine from a tropical plant the latest example of how some animals attempt to soothe their own ills with remedies found in the wild, scientists reported Thursday. Scientists observed Rakus pluck and chew up leaves of a medicinal plant used by people throughout Southeast Asia to treat pain and inflammation. The adult male orangutan then used his fingers to apply the plant juices to an injury on the right cheek. Afterward, he pressed the chewed plant to cover the open wound like a makeshift bandage, according to a new study in Scientific Reports.  Previous research has documented several species of great apes foraging for medicines in forests to heal themselves, but scientists hadnt yet seen an animal treat itself in this way.  This is the first time that we have observed a wild animal applying a quite potent medicinal plant directly to a wound, said co-author Isabelle Laumer, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany.  The orangutans intriguing behavior was recorded in 2022 by Ulil Azhari, a co-author and field researcher at the Suaq Project in Medan, Indonesia. Photographs show the animals wound closed within a month without any problems.  This combination of photos provided by the Suaq foundation shows a facial wound on Rakus, a wild male Sumatran orangutan in Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia, on June 23, 2022, two days before he applied chewed leaves from a medicinal plant, left, and on Aug. 25, 2022, after his facial wound was barely visible. (Armas, Safruddin/Suaq foundation via AP) This combination of photos provided by the Suaq foundation shows a facial wound on Rakus, a wild male Sumatran orangutan in Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia, on June 23, 2022, two days before he applied chewed leaves from a medicinal plant, left, and on Aug. 25, 2022, after his facial wound was barely visible. (Armas, Safruddin/Suaq foundation via AP) Scientists have been observing orangutans in Indonesias Gunung Leuser National Park since 1994, but they hadnt previously seen this behavior.  
        
     Its a single observation, said Emory University biologist Jacobus de Roode, who was not involved in the study. But often we learn about new behaviors by starting with a single observation. Very likely its self-medication, said de Roode, adding that the orangutan applied the plant only to the wound and no other body part. Its possible Rakus learned the technique from other orangutans living outside the park and away from scientists daily scrutiny, said co-author Caroline Schuppli at Max Planck.  Rakus was born and lived as a juvenile outside the study area. Researchers believe the orangutan got hurt in a fight with another animal. Its not known whether Rakus earlier treated other injuries.  Scientists have previously recorded other primates using plants to treat themselves.  Bornean orangutans rubbed themselves with juices from a medicinal plant, possibly to reduce body pains or chase away parasites.  Chimpanzees in multiple locations have been observed chewing on the shoots of bitter-tasting plants to soothe their stomachs. Gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos swallow certain rough leaves whole to get rid of stomach parasites. If this behavior exists in some of our closest living relatives, what could that tell us about how medicine first evolved? said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, who had no role in the study. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Boeing is on the verge of launching astronauts aboard new capsule, the latest entry to space travel","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  After years of delays and stumbles, Boeing is finally poised to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. Its the first flight of Boeings Starliner capsule with a crew on board, a pair of NASA pilots who will check out the spacecraft during the test drive and a weeklong stay at the space station. NASA turned to U.S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musks SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of unoccupied test flights. Boeing program manager Mark Nappi wishes Starliner was further along. Theres no doubt about that, but were here now. The companys long-awaited astronaut demo is slated for liftoff Monday night. Provided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station. 
        
     A look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise: NASAs Boeing Crew Flight Test astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore exit the Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at the agencys Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a mission dress rehearsal on Friday, April 26, 2024.

Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at the agencys Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a mission dress rehearsal on Friday, April 26, 2024. (Frank Micheaux/NASA via AP) White with black and blue trim, Boeings Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeings early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner. No one was aboard Boeings two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldnt reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed. Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts. The duo have been involved in the capsules development and insist Starliner is ready for prime time, otherwise they would not strap in for the launch. Were not putting our heads in the sand, Williams told The Associated Press. Sure, Boeing has had its problems. But we are the QA (quality assurance). Our eyes are on the spacecraft. Boeing Crew Flight Test crew members Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore work in the Boeing Starliner simulator at the Johnson Space Center in Houston on Nov. 3, 2022. The first flight of Boeings Starliner capsule with a crew on board is scheduled for Monday, May 6, 2024. (NASA/Robert Markowitz) Boeing Crew Flight Test crew members Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore work in the Boeing Starliner simulator at the Johnson Space Center in Houston on Nov. 3, 2022. The first flight of Boeings Starliner capsule with a crew on board is scheduled for Monday, May 6, 2024. (NASA/Robert Markowitz) Starliner will blast off on United Launch Alliances Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It will be the first time astronauts ride an Atlas since NASAs Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Sixty-two years later, this will be the 100th launch of the Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft.  Were super careful with every mission. Were super, duper, duper careful with human missions, said Tory Bruno, CEO of ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.  Starliner should reach the space station in roughly 26 hours. The seven station residents will have their eyes peeled on the approaching capsule. The arrival of a new vehicle is a really big deal. You leave nothing to chance, NASA astronaut Michael Barratt told the AP from orbit. Starliner will remain docked for eight days, undergoing checkouts before landing in New Mexico or elsewhere in the American West. Both companies capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASAs Orion capsules for moon missions. Wilmore and Williams briefly will take manual control to wring out the systems on their way to the space station.  NASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was in the station delivery business and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing will use a more traditional astrovan equipped with a video screen that Wilmore said will be playing Top Gun: Maverick.  One big difference at flights end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea. Boeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the stations planned end in 2030. Boeings Nappi is reluctant to discuss other potential customers until this inaugural crew flight is over. But the company has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks. Coming soon: Sierra Spaces mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will deliver cargo to the station later this year or next, before accepting passengers.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Boeing calls off its first astronaut launch because of valve issue on rocket,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeing called off its first astronaut launch because of a valve problem on the rocket Monday night.  The two NASA test pilots had just strapped into Boeings Starliner capsule for a flight to the International Space Station when the countdown was halted, just two hours before the planned liftoff.  United Launch Alliance CEO Tory Bruno said an oxygen pressure-relief valve on the upper stage of the companys Atlas rocket started fluttering open and close, creating a loud buzz.  The valve may have exceeded its 200,000 lifetime cycles, Bruno said, which means it would have to be replaced, pushing the launch into next week. But if engineers can determine the valve is still within that limit, the launch team could try again as soon as Friday. It was the latest delay for Boeings first crew flight, on hold for years because of capsule trouble. Bruno said similar valve trouble had occurred in years past on a few other Atlas rockets launching satellites. It was quickly resolved by turning the troublesome valves off and back on. But the company has stricter flight rules for astronaut flights, prohibiting valve recycling when a crew is on board. And so we stayed with the rules and the procedures, and scrubbed as a result, Bruno said at a press conference. NASAs commercial crew program manager Steve Stich acknowledged it was a tough call. Were taking it one step at a time, and were going to launch when were ready and fly when its safe to do so, Stich told reporters. 
        
     Within minutes of the countdown halting, Boeings new astrovan was back at the launch pad to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams from their pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.  Starliners first test flight without a crew in 2019 failed to reach the space station and Boeing had to repeat the flight. Then the company encountered parachute issues and flammable tape.  NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX a decade ago to ferry astronauts to and from the space station after the shuttle program ended, paying the private companies billions of dollars.

"A scorching, rocky planet twice Earths size has a thick atmosphere, scientists say","DALLAS (AP)  A thick atmosphere has been detected around a planet thats twice as big as Earth in a nearby solar system, researchers reported Wednesday. The so-called super Earth  known as 55 Cancri e  is among the few rocky planets outside our solar system with a significant atmosphere, wrapped a blanket of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The exact amounts are unclear. Earths atmosphere is a blend of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and other gases. Its probably the firmest evidence yet that this planet has an atmosphere, said Ian Crossfield, an astronomer at the University of Kansas who studies exoplanets and was not involved with the research. The research was published in the journal Nature. Super Earth refers to a planets size  bigger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. The boiling temperatures on this planet  which can reach as hot as 4,200 degrees Fahrenheit (2,300 degrees Celsius)  mean that it is unlikely to host life.  Instead, scientists say the discovery is a promising sign that other such rocky planets with thick atmospheres could exist that may be more hospitable.  The exoplanet 41 light years away is eight times heavier than Earth and circles its star Copernicus so closely that it has permanent day and night sides. A light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles (9.7 trillion kilometers). Its surface is encrusted with magma oceans. To identify the makeup of its atmosphere, researchers studied Webb Space Telescope observations before and after the planet passed behind its star.  
        
     They separated the light emitted from the planet versus its star and used the data to calculate the planets temperature. Theres evidence the planets heat was being distributed more evenly across its surface  a party trick atmospheres are known for. Gases from its magma oceans may play a key role in holding its atmosphere steady. Exploring this super Earth may also yield clues to how Earth and Mars might have evolved first with magma oceans that have since cooled, scientists say.  Its a rare window, said Renyu Hu, a planetary scientist at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was part of the research. We can look into this early phase of planet evolution. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Solar storm hits Earth, producing colorful light shows across Northern Hemisphere","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An unusually strong solar storm hitting Earth produced stunning displays of color in the skies across the Northern Hemisphere early Saturday, with no immediate reports of disruptions to power and communications. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning when a solar outburst reached Earth on Friday afternoon, hours sooner than anticipated. The effects of the Northern Lights, which were prominently on display in Britain, were due to last through the weekend and possibly into next week. Many in the U.K. shared phone snaps of the lights on social media early Saturday, with the phenomenon seen as far south as London and southern England. There were sightings from top to tail across the country, said Chris Snell, a meteorologist at the Met Office, Britains weather agency. He added that the office received photos and information from other European locations including Prague and Barcelona. The aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, glow on the horizon at St. Marys Lighthouse in Whitley Bay on the North East coast, England, Friday, May 10, 2024. (Owen Humphreys/PA via AP) The aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, glow on the horizon at St. Marys Lighthouse in Whitley Bay on the North East coast, England, Friday, May 10, 2024. (Owen Humphreys/PA via AP) NOAA alerted operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to take precautions. For most people here on planet Earth, they wont have to do anything, said Rob Steenburgh, a scientist with NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, NOAA said. But it was hard to predict and experts stressed it would not be the dramatic curtains of color normally associated with the northern lights, but more like splashes of greenish hues. 
        
     Thats really the gift from space weather: the aurora, Steenburgh said. He and his colleagues said the best aurora views may come from phone cameras, which are better at capturing light than the naked eye. AP correspondent Shelley Adler reports a solar storm may have an effect on the U.S. Snap a picture of the sky and there might be actually a nice little treat there for you, said Mike Bettwy, operations chief for the prediction center. The most intense solar storm in recorded history, in 1859, prompted auroras in central America and possibly even Hawaii. We are not anticipating that but it could come close, NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl said. This storm poses a risk for high-voltage transmission lines for power grids, not the electrical lines ordinarily found in peoples homes, Dahl told reporters. Satellites also could be affected, which in turn could disrupt navigation and communication services here on Earth. An extreme geomagnetic storm in 2003, for example, took out power in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa. Even when the storm is over, signals between GPS satellites and ground receivers could be scrambled or lost, according to NOAA. But there are so many navigation satellites that any outages should not last long, Steenburgh noted. The sun has produced strong solar flares since Wednesday, resulting in at least seven outbursts of plasma. Each eruption, known as a coronal mass ejection, can contain billions of tons of plasma and magnetic field from the suns outer atmosphere, or corona. The flares seem to be associated with a sunspot thats 16 times the diameter of Earth, NOAA said. It is all part of the solar activity ramping up as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year cycle. NASA said the storm posed no serious threat to the seven astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The biggest concern is the increased radiation levels, and the crew could move to a better shielded part of the station if necessary, according to Steenburgh. Increased radiation also could threaten some of NASAs science satellites. Extremely sensitive instruments will be turned off, if necessary, to avoid damage, said Antti Pulkkinen, director of the space agencys heliophysics science division. Several sun-focused spacecraft are monitoring all the action. This is exactly the kinds of things we want to observe, Pulkkinen said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Federal agency says a second, if weaker, solar storm surge is likely Sunday","A U.S. government agency said a weaker repeat of Saturdays powerful solar storm was likely on Sunday.  The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that coronal mass ejections  clouds of ejected solar plasma that can cause power grid irregularities and issues with high-frequency communications and global positioning systems  will slam into the Earths magnetic field and outer atmosphere until at least Sunday night. On Saturday, the powerful solar storm put on an amazing skyward light show across the globe overnight but caused only minor disruptions to the electric power grid, communications and satellite positioning systems. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said that no FEMA region reported any significant impact from the storms. The U.S. Department of Energy said Saturday it was not aware of any impact from the storms on electric customers. SpaceXs Starlink satellite internet service said on its website Saturday that service had been degraded and its team was investigating. CEO Elon Musk wrote on the social platform X overnight that its satellites were under a lot of pressure, but holding up so far. Brilliant purple, green, yellow and pink hues of the Northern Lights were reported worldwide, with sightings in Germany, Switzerland, China, England, Spain and elsewhere.  
        
     In the U.S., Fridays solar storm pushed the lights much farther south than normal. The Miami office of the National Weather Service confirmed sightings in the areas of Fort Lauderdale and Fort Myers, Florida. Meteorologist Nick Carr said another forecaster who lives near Fort Lauderdale photographed the lights and was familiar with them because he previously lived in Alaska.

Snap a picture of the sky, and there might be actually a nice little treat there for you, said Mike Bettwy, operations chief for the prediction center.

(Hina Alam /The Canadian Press via AP) Aurora Borealis or the Northern Lights are seen in Fredericton, Saturday, May. 11, 2024. (Hina Alam /The Canadian Press via AP) The most intense solar storm in recorded history, in 1859, prompted auroras in central America and possibly even Hawaii.  This storm posed a risk for high-voltage transmission lines for power grids, not the electrical lines ordinarily found in peoples homes, NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl told reporters. Satellites also could be affected, which in turn could disrupt navigation and communication services here on Earth. An extreme geomagnetic storm in 2003, for example, took out power in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa. Even when the storm is over, signals between GPS satellites and ground receivers could be scrambled or lost, according to NOAA. But there are so many navigation satellites that any outages should not last long, Steenburgh noted. The sun has produced strong solar flares since Wednesday, resulting in at least seven outbursts of plasma. Each eruption, known as a coronal mass ejection, can contain billions of tons of plasma and magnetic field from the suns outer atmosphere, or corona. The flares seem to be associated with a sunspot that is 16 times the diameter of Earth, NOAA said. It is all part of the solar activity ramping up as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year cycle. ____ Dunn reported from Cape Canaveral, Florida, Krisher from Detroit and Funk from Omaha, Nebraska.",https://apnews.com/article/solar-storm-northern-lights-power-grid-disruption-eb7fabd1dfbd734a398192bf4c701ca5,science
Astronomers find the biggest known batch of planet ingredients swirling around young star,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have discovered what they believe is the biggest known batch of planet-making ingredients swirling around a young star. The diameter of this colossal disk is roughly 3,300 times the distance between Earth and the sun, with enough gas and dust to form super-sized planets in far-flung orbits, the U.S. and German researchers reported this week. First spotted in 2016, the disk around a star 1,000 light-years away was not confirmed to be a hotbed for new, emerging planets until recent observations by telescopes in Hawaii. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. Its so massive and rich in dust and gas, the building blocks of planets, that scientists can learn more about the birth and evolution of worlds beyond our own, said lead author Kristina Monsch of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  This so-called protoplanetary disk looks like a butterfly in the images, according to Monsch. The dark, dusty strip in the middle resembles the elongated body of a butterfly, she said, while the blue and white lobes seem like wings and the two narrow filaments on top the antennae. Findings were described in Mondays Astrophysical Journal Letters. Another paper by some of the same researchers also has been accepted for publication. The disk, designated as IRAS 23077, is about double the size of the previous record-holder, Monsch said.  
        
     NASAs Hubble and Webb space telescopes may be able to discern whether planets the size of Jupiter or even bigger are already forming, Monsch said. Any rocky planets like our own would likely be too small to see and even bigger planet-forming systems are probably out there.  We just have to look for them, she said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

This giant gas planet is as fluffy and puffy as cotton candy,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have identified a planet thats bigger than Jupiter yet surprisingly as fluffy and light as cotton candy.  The exoplanet has exceedingly low density for its size, an international team reported Tuesday. The gas giants in our solar system  Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune  are much denser.  The planet is basically super fluffy because its made mostly of light gases rather than solids, lead author Khalid Barkaoui of Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in a statement Scientists say an outlier like WASP-193b is ideal for studying unconventional planetary formation and evolution. The planet was confirmed last year, but it took extra time and work to determine its consistency based on observations by ground telescopes. Its thought to consist mostly of hydrogen and helium, according to the study published in Nature Astronomy.  The planet is located some 1,200 light-years away. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.

"Sun shoots out biggest solar flare in almost 2 decades, but Earth should be out of the way this time","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The sun produced its biggest flare in nearly two decades Tuesday, just days after severe solar storms pummeled Earth and created dazzling northern lights in unaccustomed places. Not done yet! the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced in an update. Its the biggest flare of this 11-year solar cycle, which is approaching its peak, according to NOAA. The good news is that Earth should be out of the line of fire this time because the flare erupted on a part of the sun rotating away from Earth. NASAs Solar Dynamics Observatory captured the bright flash of the X-ray flare. It was the strongest since 2005, rated on the scale for these flares as X8.7. Bryan Brasher at NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado said it may turn out to have been even stronger when scientists gather data from other sources.  It follows nearly a week of flares and mass ejections of coronal plasma that threatened to disrupt power and communications on Earth and in orbit. An ejection associated with Tuesdays flare appeared to have been directed away from our planet, although analysis is ongoing, Brasher noted. NASA said the weekend geomagnetic storm caused one of its environmental satellites to rotate unexpectedly because of reduced altitude from the space weather, and go into a protective hibernation known as safe mode. And at the International Space Station, the seven astronauts were advised to stay in areas with strong radiation shielding. The crew was never in any danger, according to NASA.

When the first warm-blooded dinosaurs roamed Earth,"DALLAS (AP)  Scientists once thought of dinosaurs as sluggish, cold-blooded creatures. Then research suggested that some could control their body temperature, but when and how that shift came about remained a mystery. Now, a new study estimates that the first warm-blooded dinosaurs may have roamed the Earth about 180 million years ago, about halfway through the creatures time on the planet. Warm-blooded creatures  including birds, who are descended from dinosaurs, and humans  keep their body temperature constant whether the world around them runs cold or hot. Cold-blooded animals, including reptiles like snakes and lizards, depend on outside sources to control their temperature: For example, basking in the sun to warm up. Knowing when dinosaurs evolved their stable internal thermometer could help scientists answer other questions about how they lived, including how active and social they were. To estimate the origin of the first warm-blooded dinosaurs, researchers analyzed over 1,000 fossils, climate models and dinosaurs family trees. They found that two major groups of dinosaurs  which include Tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptors and relatives of triceratops  migrated to chillier areas during the Early Jurassic period, indicating they may have developed the ability to stay warm. A third crop of dinosaurs, which includes brontosaurs, stuck to warmer areas. If something is capable of living in the Arctic, or very cold regions, it must have some way of heating up, said Alfio Allesandro Chiarenza, a study author and a postdoctoral fellow at University College London. 
        
     The research was published Wednesday in the journal Current Biology. Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral fellow at the Field Museum in Chicago, said a dinosaurs location is not the only way to determine whether it is warm-blooded. Research by Wiemann, who was not involved with the latest study, suggests that warm-blooded dinosaurs may have evolved closer to the beginning of their time on Earth, around 250 million years ago. She said compiling clues from multiple aspects of dinosaurs lives  including their body temperatures and diets  may help scientists paint a clearer picture of when they evolved to be warm-blooded. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Webb telescope uncovers merger of two massive black holes from early universe,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Webb Space Telescope has discovered the earliest known merger of black holes.  These two gigantic black holes and their galaxies consolidated just 740 million years after the universe-forming Big Bang. Its the most distant detection ever made of merging black holes, scientists reported Thursday.  One black hole is 50 million times more massive than our sun. The other is thought to be similar in size, but is buried in dense gas, which makes it harder to measure.  Until now, astronomers werent sure how supermassive black holes got so big.  The latest findings, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, suggest mergers are how black holes can grow so rapidly  even at cosmic dawn, said lead author Hannah Ubler of the University of Cambridge. Massive black holes have been shaping the evolution of galaxies from the very beginning, Ubler said in a statement. Launched in 2021 as the eventual successor to NASAs Hubble Space Telescope, Webb is the biggest and most powerful observatory ever sent into space. A joint U.S.-European project, the infrared observatory surveys the universe from a location 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Suns magnetic field may form close to the surface. This finding could improve solar storm forecasts,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  New research indicates the suns magnetic field originates much closer to the surface than previously thought, a finding that could help predict periods of extreme solar storms like the ones that slammed Earth earlier this month. The magnetic field appears to generate 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) beneath the suns surface. Previous calculations put the roots of this process more than 130,000 miles (209,000 kilometers) below, an international team reported Wednesday.  The suns intense magnetic energy is the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma known as coronal mass ejections. When directed toward Earth, they can create stunning auroras but also disrupt power and communications. We still dont understand the sun well enough to make accurate predictions of space weather, lead author Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh said in an email. The latest findings published in the journal Nature will be an important step toward finally resolving this mysterious process known as solar dynamo, added co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University.  Galileo was among the first astronomers to turn a telescope skyward and study sunspots, back in the early 1600s. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur near sunspots, dark patches as big as Earth that are located near the most intense portions of the suns shifting magnetic field. 
        
     Vasil and his team developed new models of the interaction between the suns magnetic field and the flow of plasma, which varies at different latitudes during an 11-year cycle. They fed their calculations into a NASA supercomputer in Northern California  the same one used in the 2015 movie The Martian to verify the best flight path to rescue the main character. The results suggested a shallow magnetic field and additional research is needed to confirm this.  The modeling was highly simplified, University of Wisconsin-Madisons Ellen Zweibel, who was not part of the team, said in an accompanying editorial.  The results are intriguing and sure to inspire future studies, Zweibel said.  The new knowledge should improve long-term solar forecasts, allowing scientists to better predict the strength of our stars future cycles. The sun is approaching its peak level of activity in the current 11-year cycle, thus the recent flareups. Strong solar flares and outbursts of billions of tons of plasma earlier this month unleashed severe solar storms that produced auroras in unexpected places. Last week, the sun spewed out the biggest solar flare in almost 20 years, but it steered clear of Earth. Better understanding of the sun can ensure we are prepared for when the next storm  potentially much more dangerous  hits Earth, Lecoanet said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How cockroaches spread around the globe to become the pest we know today,"DALLAS (AP)  Theyre six-legged, hairy home invaders that just wont die, no matter how hard you try. Cockroaches are experts at surviving indoors, hiding in kitchen pipes or musty drawers. But they didnt start out that way. A new study uses genetics to chart cockroaches spread across the globe, from humble beginnings in southeast Asia to Europe and beyond. The findings span thousands of years of cockroach history and suggest the pests may have scuttled across the globe by hitching a ride with another species: people.  Its not just an insect story, said Stephen Richards, an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine who studies insect genes and was not involved with the study. Its an insect and humanity story. Researchers analyzed the genes of over 280 cockroaches from 17 countries and six continents. They confirmed that the German cockroach  a species found worldwide  actually originated in southeast Asia, likely evolving from the Asian cockroach around 2,100 years ago. Scientists have long suspected the German cockroachs Asian origins since similar species still live there. The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The cockroaches then globe-trotted via two major routes. They traveled west to the Middle East about 1,200 years ago, perhaps hitchhiking in soldiers breadbaskets. And they may have stowed away on Dutch and British East India Company trade routes to get to Europe about 270 years ago, according to scientists reconstruction and historical records.  
        
     Once they arrived, inventions like the steam engine and indoor plumbing likely helped the insects travel further and get cozy living indoors, where they are most commonly found today. Researchers said exploring how cockroaches conquered past environments may lead to better pest control.  Modern-day cockroaches are tough to keep at bay because they evolve quickly to resist pesticides, according to study author Qian Tang, a postdoctoral researcher studying insects at Harvard University.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Black Americans are underrepresented in residential care communities, AP/CNHI News analysis finds","Norma Upshaw, 82, was living alone south of Nashville, when her doctor said she needed to start in-home dialysis.  Her closest family lived 40 miles away, and theyd already scrambled once when the independent senior living facility she had called home  a community of largely Black residents  had closed with 30 days notice. Here they were searching, yet again, for an assisted living facility or maybe an affordable apartment that was closer.  They couldnt find either, so Upshaws daughter built a small apartment onto her home.  Most of her doctors, her church, everything was within Nashville, said Danielle Cotton, Upshaws granddaughter, ... this was the best option for us. Nearly half of Americans over 65 will pay for some version of long-term health care, the landscape of which is quickly transitioning away from nursing homes and toward community living situations.  Black Americans are less likely to use residential care communities, such as assisted-living facilities, and more likely to live in nursing homes, CNHI News and The Associated Press found as part of an examination into Americas long-term care options. The opposite is true for white Americans.  The disparity is well-known to those who work in and research assisted-living settings, and experts say the reasons why are complicated. Where to place a parent or loved one is driven in part by personal and cultural preferences, but also insurance coverage and physical location of residential care communities. All of these factors vary state by state, family by family. 
        
     The result is older Black Americans may be left out of living situations that can create community, prevent isolation and provide help with daily tasks while allowing for a level of personal independence. The bottom line is white, richer people have a solution now  which is these incredible assisted-living communities  and minorities and low-income people dont, said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That is the fundamental challenge facing our country as our demographics are shifting. The AP and CNHI News analyzed data from the most recent National Post-acute and Long-term Care Study, published in 2020, and found Black people are underrepresented in residential care communities nationally by nearly 50%. Black Americans account for about 9% of people over 65 in the U.S. But they are underrepresented in residential care communities at 4.9% of the population, and overrepresented in nursing homes  about 16% of residents.  The situation is flipped for white Americans, who make up 75% of Americans over 65 but are 88% of the people in residential care communities. The AP-CNHI News analysis also found that other ethnic and racial groups are underrepresented in assisted living facilities, but only Black Americans were also overrepresented in nursing homes. 
        
     Lacking a universal definition for assisted living, the federal study created the residential community care category to represent settings that serve people who cannot live independently, but also do not require the more comprehensive care provided in nursing homes.  In short, theyre places where people can live and receive help with activities of daily living like bathing, dressing and managing medications, but do not provide round-the-clock nursing care. Financial barriers affect low-income people of all races, experts said, but theyre heightened for older Black Americans. Black workers make $878 weekly compared to $1,085 earned by white workers, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows this national gap has existed for decades.  That affects both the potential to spend on long-term care  and, earlier in life, homeownership rates. Many residents sell their homes to fund senior care, and more than 7 in 10 homeowners in the U.S. are white, according to 2020 U.S. Census Bureau data. One month in an assisted living facility runs $4,500 a month or $54,000 a year, according to a national median cost from the National Center for Assisted Living, which represents assisted living providers.  Most people pay privately, often through personal funds or long-term care insurance; nursing homes can be covered by Medicaid. That puts assisted living out of reach for many Black Americans, explained Cotton, who also founded and runs a Nashville nonprofit that helps financially strapped seniors find housing.  She said many can barely pay for government-subsidized housing, let alone expensive living communities: It leaves them in a gap. Those are the seniors that are really not even considered or thought about. In Palo Alto, California, the nonprofit Lytton Gardens uses funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to subsidize housing costs for low-income assisted living residents. But the cost of care  scheduled meals, help with bathing and taking medications  is still on the individual.  Staff have tried to reach Black and Hispanic seniors through social workers, libraries and senior centers. But the residents are still mostly white and Asian. Most of the time, Im begging somebody to move in, said Donna Quick, housing administrator for Lytton Gardens. But its just a matter of finding somebody who has the funds for this assisted living program. The process of paying for long-term care is as opaque as it can be, said Linda Couch, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit long-term care providers and researches long-term care. Because we dont have a comprehensive and cohesive long-term care financing system in this country, we are left with this patchwork, Couch said. Researchers major question as more assisted facilities open up across the U.S.  are they located near Black communities?  is hard to answer, too. The federal government doesnt even have a list of assisted living (facilities), said Lindsey Smith, health systems management and policy researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health. There is not, like, a registration. When COVID hit, they did not have a list. LaShuan Bethea, executive director of the National Center for Assisted Living, said more research is needed to fully know whether fewer Black people accessing assisted living means they are missing out on needed care, or if they are finding that support in other ways. Its really important to do the work ... trying to understand: What does this mean when Black and brown people cant access assisted living, knowing what it brings in terms of quality and outcomes? Bethea said. While affordability is one determining factor, researchers say it doesnt completely explain why more Black people are not moving into assisted living.  I think the other piece is that expectation that we want to keep people home as long as possible, said Candace Kemp of Georgia State Universitys Gerontology Institute. And within families of color, African American communities in particular, theres this desire to take care of family members.  Steven Nashs father could afford the most expensive assisted living facilities, but the former judge wanted to stay home. So while Nash ran one of the nations last remaining Black-owned nursing homes in the Washington, D.C., area, he also helped care for his father until he died at the age of 87. Even though it was very difficult for the family, we still kept that promise, he said. We try as hard as we can to honor the wishes of our elders. As smaller nursing homes and facilities that once catered to Black residents closed, theres a cultural competency gap, Nash said. He pointed to the kitchen, where beloved cultural food options are removed in favor of generic menu mainstays.  People want to live out their life the way theyve lived, he said.  Thats why the 95-year-old mother of Indiana state Sen. Gregory Porter still lives where she has for six decades, cared for by Porter, other family members and in-home health professionals. Porters daughter has promised to care for him similarly as he ages, a commitment that gave him a level of comfort. It means a lot, Porter said. It gives you the will to live. But for others, assisted living is an option for independence even as their daily needs grow. Older Black Americans are twice as likely to have Alzheimers or other dementias compared to older white people, according to the Alzheimers Association. Nash said hes seen more Black Americans interested in assisted living for dementia care; hes even planning to open a targeted facility in the coming years. In Texarkana, Texas, former lawyer Jay Cossey moved into an assisted living facility after multiple strokes more than seven years ago that caused him to lose most of his short-term memory. Hes one of a handful of Black residents at a facility that is blocks away from his old apartment. His church community urged the 70-year-old to move in, though his family in Alabama has pushed for him to come live with them.  My brother came and said he wanted to take me home, Cossey recalled. I told him I am home. Im home because I feel good here. ___ Gerber reported from Kokomo, Indiana; Shastri reported from Milwaukee; and Forster reported from New York. ___ The share of the U.S. population older than 65 keeps rising  and will for decades to come.

Massive cradle of baby stars revealed in new space telescope images,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A massive cradle of baby stars has been observed in new detail by a European space telescope, adding to its celestial collection of images.  The European Space Agency released the photos from the Euclid observatory on Thursday. They were taken following the telescopes Florida launch last year as a warm-up act to its main job currently underway: surveying the so-called dark universe.  From its perch 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth, Euclid will spend the next several years observing billions of galaxies covering more than one-third of the sky. The shape and size of all these galaxies can help scientists understand the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that make up most of the universe. Euclid is at the very beginning of its exciting journey to map the structure of the universe, the space agencys director general, Josef Aschbacher, said in a statement. Among the newly released pictures is one of an enormous cradle of baby stars some 1,300 light-years away known as Messier 78. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.

Boeings 1st astronaut flight now set for June after a review of small leak on new capsule,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeing is now aiming for its first astronaut launch at the beginning of June, after spending the past few weeks struggling with more problems on the space capsule. Officials for the company and NASA said Friday that intensive reviews indicate the Starliner capsule can safely fly two test pilots to the International Space Station, despite a propulsion system leak. The small helium leak was discovered following the first launch attempt on May 6 that was scuttled by an unrelated rocket problem now fixed. Engineers suspect a defective rubber seal the size of a shirt button, and say that even if the leak worsens, it could be managed in flight. All of the capsules other seals checked out, said NASAs commercial crew program manager Steve Stich, prompting managers to target June 1 for the launch. This will be the third test flight for Starliner. Demos in 2019 and 2022 had no one aboard. Boeing had to repeat the empty flight because of software and other flaws the first time. If not for the Atlas V rockets bad valve that halted the first countdown, Starliner would have launched from Cape Canaveral earlier this month with the leak first detected in orbit, according to Stich. Flight controllers would have managed the leak, and the astronauts would have been safe, officials stressed. Helium is used to pressurize the fuel lines of the propulsion system, which maneuvers the capsule in flight. Engineers now know the location of the leak and thats going to help us with improving the system in the future, said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi. 
        
     Remember, this is a test flight. Were still learning, Nappi told reporters. Identification of the Starliner leak led to the discovery of yet another problem  a design vulnerability in the propulsion system in the unlikely event of a string of failures, Stich said. The team has developed workaround methods to get the capsule safely out of orbit at flights end if such problems arise, he added. Were not going to fly until were sure were safe, NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free said.. Boeings Starliner capsule is already years late in transporting astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. SpaceX has been launching crews since 2020.

"Jupiters moon Europa may have less oxygen than expected, a finding that might put a damper on life","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  New research suggests theres less oxygen on the icy surface of Jupiters moon Europa than thought  and that could affect what if any life might be lurking in the moons underground ocean. Even with little or no oxygen, microbes might still be bustling around in the ocean believed to exist miles (kilometers) beneath Europas frozen crust. As for what else, who knows, said NASA scientist Kevin Hand, who was not involved in the study published Monday in Nature Astronomy. More work is needed to confirm these findings, which are contrary to earlier telescope observations of condensed oxygen in Europas ice, indicating a higher oxygen concentration, said Hand.  The new study is based on data collected by NASAs Juno spacecraft during a particularly close flyby of Europa in 2022  a distance of just 219 miles (353 kilometers). A U.S.-European team calculated that between 13 pounds and 39 pounds (6 kilograms and 18 kilograms) of oxygen are produced every second at Europas surface.  Previous estimates had a much wider spread, with as much as 2,245 pounds (1,100 kilograms) of oxygen produced per second. So unless Europas oxygen production was significantly higher in the past, the new measurements provide a narrower range to support habitability, the researchers wrote. This oxygen is formed, along with hydrogen, as Jupiters radiation blasts Europas global shell of frozen water.  
        
     Lead author James Szalay of Princeton University said Junos flyby was the first time a spacecraft directly sniffed Europas surroundings. We couldnt wait to peek behind the curtain of its complex environment, he said in an email. While its a significantly narrower range than we previously thought, theres still a lot we can learn, Szalay said.  Its unknown how much oxygen escapes into the moons atmosphere, how much remains in the ice and how much might find its way to the subterranean sea. NASA plans to launch the Europa Clipper this fall. The spacecraft will make dozens of close flybys of Europa  nearly the size of our moon  while orbiting the giant gas planet. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

4 new astronauts head to the International Space Station for a 6-month stay,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four astronauts headed to the International Space Station on Sunday where they will oversee the arrivals of two new rocketships during their half-year stint. SpaceXs Falcon rocket blasted off from Kennedy Space Center, carrying NASAs Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps and Russias Alexander Grebenkin.  The astronauts should reach the orbiting lab on Tuesday. They will replace a crew from the U.S., Denmark, Japan and Russia, who have been there since August. When are you getting here already? space station commander Andreas Mogensen asked via X, formerly Twitter, after three days of delay due to high wind. SpaceX Launch Control termed it fashionably late. There was almost another postponement Sunday night. A small crack in the seal of the SpaceX capsules hatch prompted a last-minute flurry of reviews, but it was deemed safe for the whole mission. The new crews six-month stay includes the arrival of two rocketships ordered by NASA. Boeings new Starliner capsule with test pilots is due in late April. A month or two later, Sierra Spaces Dream Chaser, a mini shuttle, should arrive. It is for delivering cargo to the station, but not passengers yet.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) Also new to space are Dominick, a Navy pilot, and Grebenkin, a former Russian military officer. Barratt, a doctor on his third mission, is the oldest full-time astronaut to fly in space. He turns 65 in April. Its kind of like a roller coaster ride with a bunch of really excited teenagers, Barratt said after reaching orbit. As for his age, he said before the flight, As long as we stay healthy and fit and engaged, were good to fly. Flight controllers are monitoring a growing cabin leak on Russias side of the space station. The leak has doubled in size in the past few weeks and the area has been sealed off, NASA program manager Joel Montalbano said. He stressed there is no impact to station operations or crew safety. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Ancient stone tools found in Ukraine date to over 1 million years ago, and may be oldest in Europe","WASHINGTON (AP)  Ancient stone tools found in western Ukraine may be the oldest known evidence of early human presence in Europe, according to research published Wednesday in the journal Nature.  The chipped stones, deliberately fashioned from volcanic rock, were excavated from a quarry in Korolevo in the 1970s. Archaeologists used new methods to date the layers of sedimentary rock surrounding the tools to more than 1 million years old.  This is the earliest evidence of any type of human in Europe that is dated, said Mads Faurschou Knudsen, a geophysicist at Aarhus University in Denmark and co-author of the new study.  He said its not certain which early human ancestors fashioned the tools, but it may have been Homo erectus, the first species to walk upright and master the use of fire.  We dont have fossil remains, so we cant be sure, said Roman Garba, an archaeologist at the Czech Academy of Sciences and co-author.  The chipped stone tools were likely used for cutting meat and perhaps scraping animal hides, he said. The researchers suggest the tools may be as old as 1.4 million years, but other experts say the study methodology suggests that they may be just over 1 million years old, placing them in roughly the same date range as other ancient tools unearthed in Spain.  The very earliest stone tools of this type were found in eastern Africa and date back to 2.8 million years ago, said Rick Potts, who directs the Smithsonian Institutions Human Origins Program.  
        
     The Ukraine site is significant because its the earliest site that far north, suggesting that the early humans who dispersed from Africa with these tools were able to survive in diverse environments. The oldest humans with this old stone tool technology were able to colonize everywhere from warm Iberia (Spain) to Ukraine, where its at least seasonally very cold  thats an amazing level of adaptability, said Potts.

How do animals react during a total solar eclipse? Scientists plan to find out in April,"WASHINGTON (AP)  When a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic? Will giraffes gallop? Will apes sing odd notes? Researchers will be standing by to observe how animals routines at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas are disrupted when skies dim on April 8. They previously detected other strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness.  To our astonishment, most of the animals did surprising things, said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a North Carolina State University researcher who led the observations published in the journal Animals. While there are many individual sightings of critters behaving bizarrely during historic eclipses, only in recent years have scientists started to rigorously study the altered behaviors of wild, domestic and zoo animals. Seven years ago, Galapagos tortoises at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, that generally do absolutely nothing all day  during the peak of the eclipse, they all started breeding, said Hartstone-Rose. The cause of the behavior is still unclear.  A mated pair of Siamangs, gibbons that usually call to each other in the morning, sang unusual tunes during the afternoon eclipse. A few male giraffes began to gallop in apparent anxiety. The flamingos huddled around their juveniles. Researchers say that many animals display behaviors connected with an early dusk. 
        
     In April, Hartstone-Roses team plans to study similar species in Texas to see if the behaviors they witnessed before in South Carolina point to larger patterns. Several other zoos along the path are also inviting visitors to help track animals, including zoos in Little Rock, Arkansas; Toledo, Ohio; and Indianapolis.  This years full solar eclipse in North America crisscrosses a different route than in 2017 and occurs in a different season, giving researchers and citizen scientists opportunities to observe new habits.  Its really high stakes. We have a really short period to observe them and we cant repeat the experiment, said Jennifer Tsuruda, a University of Tennessee entomologist who observed honeybee colonies during the 2017 eclipse.  The honeybees that Tsuruda studied decreased foraging during the eclipse, as they usually would at night, except for those from the hungriest hives.  During a solar eclipse, theres a conflict between their internal rhythms and external environment, said University of Albertas Olav Rueppell, adding that bees rely on polarized light from the sun to navigate. Nate Bickford, an animal researcher at Oregon Institute of Technology, said that solar eclipses actually mimic short, fast-moving storms, when skies darken and many animals take shelter. Primates sit in the sun at the Fort Worth Zoo in Fort Worth, Texas, Friday, Feb. 23, 2024. (AP Photo/LM Otero) Primates sit in the sun at the Fort Worth Zoo in Fort Worth, Texas, Friday, Feb. 23, 2024. (AP Photo/LM Otero) After the 2017 eclipse, he analyzed data from tracking devices previously placed on wild species to study habitat use. Flying bald eagles change the speed and direction theyre moving during an eclipse, he said. So do feral horses, probably taking cover, responding to the possibility of a storm out on the open plains. The last full U.S. solar eclipse to span coast to coast happened in late summer, in August. The upcoming eclipse in April gives researchers an opportunity to ask new questions including about potential impacts on spring migration.  Most songbird species migrate at night. When there are night-like conditions during the eclipse, will birds think its time to migrate and take flight? said Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University.  His team plans to test this by analyzing weather radar data  which also detects the presence of flying birds, bats and insects  to see if more birds take wing during the eclipse. As for indoor pets, they may react as much to what their owners are doing  whether theyre excited or nonchalant about the eclipse  as to any changes in the sky, said University of Arkansas animal researcher Raffaela Lesch. Dogs and cats pay a lot of attention to us, in addition to their internal clocks, she said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Four astronauts from four countries return to Earth after six months in orbit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four astronauts from four countries caught a lift back to Earth with SpaceX on Tuesday to end a half-year mission at the International Space Station. Their capsule streaked across the U.S. in the predawn darkness and splashed into the Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Panhandle. NASAs Jasmin Moghbeli, a Marine helicopter pilot, led the returning crew of Denmarks Andreas Mogensen, Japans Satoshi Furukawa and Russias Konstantin Borisov. They moved into the space station last August. Their replacements arrived last week in their own SpaceX capsule.  We left you some peanut butter and tortillas, Moghbeli radioed after departing the orbiting complex on Monday. Replied NASAs Loral OHara: I miss you guys already and thanks for that very generous gift. OHara has another few weeks at the space station before leaving aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule. Before leaving the space station, Mogensen said via X, formerly known as Twitter, that he couldnt wait to hear birds singing in the trees and also craved crunchy food. NASA prefers multiple travel options in case of rocket trouble. Boeing should start providing astronaut taxi service with a two-pilot test flight in early May. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

SpaceX comes close to completing test flight of mega rocket but loses spacecraft near end,"SpaceX came close to completing an hourlong test flight of its mega rocket on its third try Thursday, but the spacecraft was lost as it descended back to Earth. The company said it lost contact with Starship as it neared its goal, a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The first-stage booster also ended up in pieces, breaking apart much earlier in the flight over the Gulf of Mexico after launching from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The ship has been lost. So no splashdown today, said SpaceXs Dan Huot. But again, its incredible to see how much further we got this time around. Two test flights last year both ended in explosions minutes after liftoff. By surviving for close to 50 minutes this time, Thursdays effort was considered a win by not only SpaceXs Elon Musk, but NASA as well as Starship soared higher and farther than ever before. The space agency is counting on Starship to land its astronauts on the moon in another few years. The nearly 400-foot (121-meter) Starship, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built, headed out over the Gulf of Mexico after liftoff Thursday morning, flying east. Spectators crowded the nearby beaches in South Padre Island and Mexico. A few minutes later, the booster separated seamlessly from the spaceship, but broke apart 1,500 feet (462 meters) above the gulf, instead of plummeting into the water intact. By then, the spacecraft was well to the east and continuing upward, with no people or satellites on board. 
        
     Starship reached an altitude of about 145 miles (233 kilometers) as it coasted across the Atlantic and South Africa, before approaching the Indian Ocean. But 49 minutes into the flight  with just 15 minutes remaining  all contact was lost and the spacecraft presumably broke apart. During narration of the Starship text flight, SpaceX commentator Dan Huot says they lost contact with two systems. At that point, it was 40 miles (65 kilometers) high and traveling around 16,000 mph (25,700 kph).  SpaceXs Elon Musk had just congratulated his team a little earlier. SpaceX has come a long way, he said via X, formerly called Twitter. The rocket company was founded exactly 22 years ago Thursday.  NASA watched with keen interest: The space agency needs Starship to succeed in order to land astronauts on the moon in the next two or so years. This new crop of moonwalkers  the first since last centurys Apollo program  will descend to the lunar surface in a Starship after transferring from NASAs Orion capsule in lunar orbit. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson quickly congratulated SpaceX on what he called a successful test flight as part of the space agencys Artemis moon-landing program. 
        
     The stainless steel, bullet-shaped spacecraft launched atop a first-stage booster known as the Super Heavy. Both the booster and the spacecraft are designed to be reusable, although they were never meant to be salvaged Thursday. On Starships inaugural launch last April, several of the boosters 33 methane-fueled engines failed and the booster did not separate from the spacecraft, causing the entire vehicle to explode and crash into the gulf four minutes after liftoff.  SpaceX managed to double the length of the flight during Novembers trial run. While all 33 engines fired and the booster peeled away as planned, the flight ended in a pair of explosions, first the booster and then the spacecraft. The Federal Aviation Administration reviewed all the corrections made to Starship, before signing off on Thursdays launch. The FAA said after the flight that it would again investigate what happened. As during the second flight, all 33 booster engines performed well during ascent, according to SpaceX. Initially, SpaceX plans to use the mammoth rockets to launch the companys Starlink internet satellites, as well as other spacecraft. Test pilots would follow to orbit, before the company flies wealthy clients around the moon and back. Musk considers the moon a stepping stone to Mars, his ultimate quest. NASA is insisting that an empty Starship land successfully on the moon, before future moonwalkers climb aboard. The space agency is targeting the end of 2026 for the first moon landing crew under the Artemis program, named after the mythological twin sister of Apollo. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

These charts show COVID-19s summer surge in the US,"COVID-19 hasnt gone away, and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests its on the upswing around the country. Weve seen these summer increases every summer that COVID-19 has been with us, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a Johns Hopkins University infectious disease physician. Whats different about these cases this summer vs. prior summers is that they dont translate into hospitals in crisis. Adalja said factors in the seasonal increase could be increased travel, people staying indoors to avoid summer heat and the virus continued evolution  which could help it get around peoples immunity. Heres a look at the stats: Testing for COVID-19 is sporadic and the true number of cases isnt clear because many infections arent reported. But one way to spot trends is to see what percentage of lab tests come back positive. By that metric, COVID-19 is surging. 
        
     Nevertheless, doctors offices arent seeing an outsized share of people with symptoms of respiratory illness. 
        
     COVID-19-related hospitalizations are rising, but they remain below the levels seen in winter  and far below the peaks seen earlier in the pandemic. 
        
     The CDC also tries to monitor the spread of the coronavirus by looking for it in sewage and other wastewater at participating sites across the country. The most recent wastewater data  from the beginning of August  shows the highest levels since January. Detections were highest in the West and South, and lowest in the Northeast. The agency labels national wastewater viral activity level as very high. 
        
     Experts say to treat the data with caution because it has limitations. You just know it means theres a lot of virus out there, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University pandemic researcher. But you dont know how many people, how many infections that translates to. Nevertheless, the wastewater data shows theres a whole lot of COVID out there, she added. Adalja suggested staying up to date on your vaccinations and that people at higher risk of a serious illness consider wearing masks in crowded, indoor congregated areas. If you do get sick, note that the CDC recommends staying away from other people until your symptoms are improving and youve been fever-free for 24 hours. COVID-19 is now basically part of the human condition, Adalja said. Its unavoidable when you interact with humans. ___ AP journalists Laura Bargfeld, Mike Stobbe and Jonathan Poet contributed to this report.

Aprils total solar eclipse promises to be the best yet for experiments,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Aprils total solar eclipse promises to be a scientific bonanza, thanks to new spacecraft and telescopes  and cosmic chance. The moon will be extra close to Earth, providing a long and intense period of darkness, and the sun should be more active with the potential for dramatic bursts of plasma. Then theres totalitys densely populated corridor stretching from Mexico to the U.S. to Canada. Hundreds if not thousands of the tens of millions of spectators will double as citizen scientists, helping NASA and other research groups better understand our planet and star. Theyll photograph the suns outer crownlike atmosphere, or corona, as the moon passes between the sun and Earth, blotting out sunlight for up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds on April 8. Theyll observe the quieting of birds and other animals as midday darkness falls. Theyll also measure dropping temperatures, monitor clouds and use ham radios to gauge communication disruptions. At the same time, rockets will blast off with science instruments into the electrically charged portion of the atmosphere near the edge of space known as the ionosphere. The small rockets will soar from Wallops Island, Virginia  some 400 miles outside totality but with 81% of the sun obscured in a partial eclipse. Similar launches were conducted from New Mexico during last Octobers ring of fire solar eclipse that swept across the western U.S. and Central and South America. Time for the biggie! It is pretty exciting!!! Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Universitys Aroh Barjatya, the rockets mission director, said in an email. 
        
     NASAs high-altitude jets also will take to the air again, chasing the moons shadow with improved telescopes to study the suns corona and surrounding dust. Dust sounds boring, acknowledged NASAs eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck. But at the same time, dust is actually really interesting. Those are the leftover remnants from when the solar system was forming. More than 600 weather balloons will be launched by college students along the track, providing livestreams while studying atmospheric changes. Cloudy skies shouldnt matter. Lucky for us, the balloons flying to 80,000 feet and above dont care if its cloudy on the ground, said Angela Des Jardins, an astrophysicist at Montana State University whos coordinating the nationwide project. And if the Federal Aviation Administration approves, a 21-foot (6.5-meter) kite will lift a science instrument three miles (5 kilometers) above Texas in an experiment by the University of Hawaiis Shadia Habbal. She, too, wants to get above any clouds that might hamper her observations of the sun. Normally hidden by the suns glare, the corona is on full display during a total solar eclipse, making it a prime research target. The spiky tendrils emanating thousands of miles (kilometers) into space are mystifyingly hotter than the suns surface  in the millions of degrees, versus thousands. In terms of the value of total eclipses, science still cannot explain how the corona is heated to such extreme temperatures, said retired NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak, better known as Mr. Eclipse for all his charts and books on the subject. The U.S. wont see another total solar eclipse on this scale until 2045, so NASA and everyone else is pulling out all the stops. Aprils eclipse will begin in the Pacific and make landfall at Mazatlan, Mexico, heading up through Texas and 14 other U.S. states before crossing into Canada and exiting into the Atlantic at Newfoundland. Those outside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path, will get a partial eclipse.  Scientists got a taste of whats to come during the 2017 total solar eclipse that stretched from Oregon to South Carolina. This time, the moon is closer to Earth, resulting in more minutes of darkness and a wider path. Any time we can observe for longer, that gives scientists more data, Korreck said. Another scientific bonus this time: The sun will be just a year away from its maximum solar activity, as opposed to 2017 when it was near its minimum. That means lots more action at the sun, possibly even a coronal mass ejection during the eclipse, with massive amounts of plasma and magnetic field blasted into space. Plus there are two new spacecraft out there studying the sun: NASAs Parker Solar Probe and the European Space Agency and NASAs Solar Orbiter. Theyll join other spacecraft on eclipse duty, including the International Space Station and its astronauts. Closer to home, Aprils eclipse, unlike previous ones, will pass over three U.S. radar sites typically used for monitoring space weather. The stations will tune in to whats happening in the upper atmosphere as the skies dim. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Looking at a solar eclipse can be dangerous without eclipse glasses. Heres what to know,"DALLAS (AP)  Millions of people along a narrow band in North America will look up when the sky darkens during a total solar eclipse on April 8. When they do, safety is key. Staring directly at the sun during a solar eclipse or at any other time can lead to permanent eye damage. The eclipse is only safe to witness with the naked eye during totality, or the period of total darkness when the moon completely covers the sun. Those eager to experience the eclipse should buy eclipse glasses from a reputable vendor. Sunglasses are not protective enough, and binoculars and telescopes without a proper solar filter can magnify light from the sun, making them unsafe. Please, please put those glasses on, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said.    Since counterfeit glasses abound, consider purchasing glasses from a local science museum or order online from a seller cleared on the American Astronomical Societys website. Eclipse safety experts say legitimate eclipse glasses should block out ultraviolet light from the sun and nearly all visible light. When worn indoors, only very bright lights should be faintly visible  not household furniture or wallpaper. Old eclipse glasses from the 2017 total solar eclipse or Octobers ring of fire annular eclipse are safe to reuse, as long as they arent warped and dont have scratches or holes. Glasses should say they comply with ISO 12312-2 standards, though fake suppliers can also print this language on their products. NASA does not approve or certify eclipse glasses.  
        
     If you dont have eclipse glasses, you can still enjoy the spectacle through indirect ways such as making a pinhole projector using household materials. Reveka Pasternak, of Boston, left, and her sister Tristen, of Philadelphia, right, use pinhole projectors to view a partial solar eclipse, Monday, Aug. 21, 2017, in Cambridge, Mass.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne, File) Poke a hole through a piece of cardstock or cardboard, hold it up during the eclipse and look down to see a partial crescent projected below. Holding up a colander or a cracker will produce a similar effect. Another trick: Peering at the ground under a shady tree can yield crescent shadows as the sunlight filters through branches and leaves. Eye experts warn against viewing the eclipse through a phone camera. The suns bright rays can also damage a phones digital components.  Eye damage can occur without proper protection. The suns bright rays can burn cells in the retina at the back of the eye. The retina doesnt have pain receptors, so theres no way to feel the damage as it happens. Once the cells die, they dont come back. Symptoms of solar eye damage, called solar retinopathy, include blurred vision and color distortion. In a rare case of eclipse eye damage, a woman who viewed the 2017 eclipse without adequate protection came to Mount Sinais New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, complaining of a black spot in her vision. Doctors discovered retinal damage that corresponded to the eclipses shape. The dark spot she was describing was in the shape of a crescent, said Dr. Avnish Deobhakta, a Mount Sinai ophthalmologist. Theres no set rule for how long of a glance can lead to permanent damage. Severity varies based on cloudiness, air pollution and a persons vantage point.  But doctors say looking at a solar eclipse for even a few seconds unprotected isnt worth the risk. There are reports of solar retinopathy after every solar eclipse, and U.S. eye doctors saw dozens of extra visits after the one in 2017. Spectators who plan ahead can secure a stress-free eclipse viewing experience. It can be dangerous if we arent careful, but its also very safe if we take the basic precautions, said Dr. Geoffrey Emerson, a board member of the American Society of Retina Specialists. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Aprils total solar eclipse is nearly here. Heres why its worth the watch and how to stay safe,"The sun is about to pull another disappearing act across North America, turning day into night during a total solar eclipse.  The peak spectacle on April 8 will last up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds in the path of total darkness  twice as long as the total solar eclipse that dimmed U.S. skies in 2017.  This eclipse will take a different and more populated route, entering over Mexicos Pacific coast, dashing up through Texas and Oklahoma, and crisscrossing the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and New England, before exiting over eastern Canada into the Atlantic.  An estimated 44 million people live inside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path of totality stretching from Mazatln, Mexico to Newfoundland; about 32 million of them are in the U.S., guaranteeing jammed roads for the must-see celestial sensation. The eclipse will allow many to share in the wonder of the universe without going very far, said NASAs eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck.  Heres what to know about Aprils extravaganza and how to prepare:  The moon will line up perfectly between the Earth and the sun, blotting out the sunlight. It will slice a diagonal line from the southwest to the northeast across North America, briefly plunging communities along the track into darkness.  On April 8, a total solar eclipse will cross North America. It will be the last one visible from the contiguous United States until 2044. Heres what viewers should expect to see during each stage of the eclipse. (Feb. 16) (AP video: Christine Nguyen) Fifteen U.S. states will get a piece of the action, albeit two of them  Tennessee and Michigan  just barely. Among the cities smack dab in the action: Dallas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Indianapolis, Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; and Montreal  making for the continents biggest eclipse crowd. Dont fret if you dont have front-row seats. Practically everyone on the continent can catch at least a partial eclipse. The farther from the path of totality, the smaller the moons bite will be out of the sun. In Seattle and Portland, Oregon, about as far away as you can get in the continental U.S., one-third of the sun will be swallowed.  A total solar eclipse April 8 will be visible across a swath of North America.

An estimated 44 million people live inside the path of totality stretching from Mazatlan, Mexico to Newfoundland; about 32 million of them are in the U.S. (AP Photo) By a cosmic stroke of luck, the moon will make the months closest approach to Earth the day before the total solar eclipse. That puts the moon just 223,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away on eclipse day. The moon will appear slightly bigger in the sky thanks to that proximity, resulting in an especially long period of sun-blocked darkness.  Whats more, the Earth and moon will be 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the sun that day, the average distance.  When a closer moon pairs up with a more distant sun, totality can last as long as an astounding 7 1/2 minutes. The last time the world saw more than seven minutes of totality was in 1973 over Africa. That wont happen again until 2150 over the Pacific.

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File) Sunglasses wont cut it. Special eclipse glasses are crucial for safely observing the sun as the moon marches across the late morning and afternoon sky, covering more and more and then less and less of our star.  During totality when the sun is completely shrouded, its fine to remove your glasses and look with your naked eyes. But before and after, certified eclipse glasses are essential to avoid eye damage. Just make sure theyre not scratched or torn.  Cameras, binoculars and telescopes must be outfitted with special solar filters for safe viewing. Bottom line: Never look at an exposed sun without proper protection any day of the year. Towns up and down the path of totality are throwing star parties. Festivals, races, yoga retreats, drum circles and more will unfold at museums, fairgrounds, parks, stadiums, wineries, breweries and even one of Ohios oldest drive-in movie theaters and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.  Besides looking up, you can attend a space prom in Texas Hill Country, get married at eclipse-themed ceremonies in Tiffin, Ohio, and Russellville, Arkansas, or brush up on moonwalking history at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio  Neil Armstrongs hometown. As the eclipse unfolds, NASA will launch small rockets with science instruments into the upper atmosphere from Virginia and chase totalitys shadow from high-altitude planes. Satellites and the International Space Station crew will attempt to capture the show from space.  A total solar eclipse April 8 will enter over Mexicos Pacific coast, dash up through Texas and Oklahoma, crisscross the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and New England, before exiting over eastern Canada into the Atlantic. (AP Photo) A total solar eclipse April 8 will enter over Mexicos Pacific coast, dash up through Texas and Oklahoma, crisscross the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and New England, before exiting over eastern Canada into the Atlantic. (AP Photo) There will be numerous livestreams for those stuck with clouds or outside the path. Full solar eclipses occur every year or two or three, often in the middle of nowhere like the South Pacific or Antarctic. The next total solar eclipse, in 2026, will grace the northern fringes of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.  North America wont experience totality again until 2033, with Alaska getting sole dibs. Then thats it until 2044, when totality will be confined to Western Canada, Montana and North Dakota.  There wont be another U.S. eclipse, spanning coast to coast, until 2045. That one will stretch from Northern California all the way to Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Aside from Carbondale, Illinois, in the crosshairs of both the 2017 and 2024 eclipses, it usually takes 400 years to 1,000 years before totality returns to the same spot, according to NASAs Korreck.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Blind people can hear and feel Aprils total solar eclipse with new technology,"WASHINGTON (AP)  While eclipse watchers look to the skies, people who are blind or visually impaired will be able to hear and feel the celestial event. Sound and touch devices will be available at public gatherings on April 8, when a total solar eclipse crosses North America, the moon blotting out the sun for a few minutes. Eclipses are very beautiful things, and everyone should be able to experience it once in their lifetime, said Yuki Hatch, a high school senior in Austin, Texas. Hatch is a visually impaired student and a space enthusiast who hopes to one day become a computer scientist for NASA. On eclipse day, she and her classmates at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired plan to sit outside in the schools grassy quad and listen to a small device called a LightSound box that translates changing light into sounds. AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports on devices being made available to help people who are visually impaired enjoy the upcoming solar eclipse. When the sun is bright, there will be high, delicate flute notes. As the moon begins to cover the sun, the mid-range notes are those of a clarinet. Darkness is rendered by a low clicking sound. Im looking forward to being able to actually hear the eclipse instead of seeing it, said Hatch. The LightSound device is the result of a collaboration between Wanda Daz-Merced, an astronomer who is blind, and Harvard astronomer Allyson Bieryla. Daz-Merced regularly translates her data into audio to analyze patterns for her research. 
        
     A prototype was first used during the 2017 total solar eclipse that crossed the U.S., and the handheld device has been used at other eclipses.  This year, they are working with other institutions with the goal of distributing at least 750 devices to locations hosting eclipse events in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. They held workshops at universities and museums to construct the devices, and provide DIY instructions on the groups website. The sky belongs to everyone. And if this event is available to the rest of the world, it has to be available for the blind, too, said Daz-Merced. I want students to be able to hear the eclipse, to hear the stars. The Perkins Library  associated with the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts  plans to broadcast the changing tones of the LightSound device over Zoom for members to listen online and by telephone, said outreach manager Erin Fragola. In addition to students, many of the librarys senior patrons have age-related vision loss, he said.  We try to find ways to make things more accessible for everyone, he said. Others will experience the solar event through the sense of touch, with the Cadence tablet from Indianas Tactile Engineering. The tablet is about the size of a cellphone with rows of dots that pop up and down. It can be used for a variety of purposes: reading Braille, feeling graphics and movie clips, playing video games. For the eclipse, A student can put their hand over the device and feel the moon slowly move over the sun, said Tactile Engineerings Wunji Lau.  The Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired started incorporating the tablet into its curriculum last year. Some of the schools students experienced last Octobers ring of fire eclipse with the tablet. Sophomore Jazmine Nelson is looking forward to joining the crowd expected at NASAs big eclipse-watching event at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where the tablet will be available. With the tablet, You can feel like youre a part of something, she said. Added her classmate Minerva Pineda-Allen, a junior. This is a very rare opportunity, I might not get this opportunity again. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"From watch parties to music festivals, choose your April 8 total solar eclipse adventure","NEW YORK (AP)  Where will you be watching the April 8 total solar eclipse? There are just a few weeks left to pick your spot to see the skies darken along a strip of North America, whether by land, sea or air. For those who live inside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path of total darkness, it may be a matter of just stepping outside and donning special eclipse glasses to watch the spectacle unfold. For the millions outside the path, or those who just want to improve their chances of clear skies, it could mean hitting the road with a game plan. The eclipse reaches Mexicos Pacific coast in the morning, cuts diagonally across the U.S. from Texas to Maine and exits in eastern Canada by late afternoon. Most of the rest of the continent will see a partial eclipse.  The weather will be key, and spring weather along the path can be dicey. Mexico and Texas offer the best odds of sunny skies, said retired Canadian meteorologist Jay Anderson.  Theres no guarantee of sunshine anywhere  just better chances, he said.  Anderson studies satellite data for the previous 20 years to calculate how often a location has cloudy weather on any eclipse day. Besides Mexico and Texas, he said there are other promising spots on the path of totality, particularly along the Great Lakes. The advice: If youre flexible, start paying attention to local weather about 10 days out, and make your plans on the three-day forecast. Die-hard eclipse chasers often line up more than one location and make last-minute decisions based on the best forecast, he said. One veteran eclipse chaser recommends picking a location and make it a vacation so that the eclipse is the cherry on top and not the only highlight  just in case things dont work out.  Tom Schultz will be traveling from his retirement home in Costa Rica to watch the eclipse from his mother-in-laws house in Rochester, New York, along with other relatives.  If we get rained out, well get this great family reunion, said Schultz. Veteran Anne Marie Adkins could drive across town in San Antonio to see the total eclipse, but opted to join an astronomer-led tour to Mazatln, Mexico, betting on clear skies there. Shes been thwarted by clouds on other trips. For the 2017 U.S. eclipse, she went to Nebraska and had to scramble that day to find better skies. Its a gamble. You never know what you are going to get, said Adkins. Post-eclipse traffic is a particular worry, especially in more rural areas like the Texas Hill Country. Patricia Moore, of the Bandera visitors center, said last years ring of fire eclipse provided a dress rehearsal for police and other first responders. Tiny Bandera  the Cowboy Capital of the World  expects crowds from nearby weekend music festivals.  After the eclipse will be a challenge, she said. A total solar eclipse will cross North America in April. This animated map shows the path of totality across parts of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. (Feb. 29) (AP Animation: Panagiotis Mouzakis and Marshall Ritzel) With the eclipse falling on a Monday, cities and towns along the path have lined up a weekend full of activities and watch parties to attract visitors. There are a multitude of music festivals and gatherings planned at museums, parks, wineries and other businesses hoping to capitalize on the buzz. Niagara Falls has a slate of events for days and is expecting July Fourth-sized crowds for the eclipse, said Sara Harvey, spokeswoman for Destination Niagara USA.  There are multiple vantage points to watch the show from Niagara Falls State Park, and the famous Maid of the Mist tourist boats may be running, weather permitting, she said. Even if its cloudy, visitors will get a beautiful view of the falls, Harvey said. In Waco, Texas, festivities will culminate on eclipse day with science-themed activities outside Baylors McLane stadium, along whats called Touchdown Alley. It may be too late to snag a cabin on a cruise ship positioned off the Mexico coast for the eclipse, but there are other watery options including a ride on the paddle-wheeler Victorian Princess on Lake Erie from Erie, Pennsylvania.  If the sky beckons, Southwest and Delta have identified flights that will fly along or near the eclipse path. A special Delta flight from Austin to Detroit quickly sold out, prompting the airline to add another from Dallas. Looking for an different kind of place to watch the sun, moon and Earth align? The Indianapolis Motor Speedway will host NASA astronauts and other guests. Cedar Point amusement park on Lake Erie in Sandusky, Ohio, is opening for the day. And the Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas is throwing a tailgate fundraising party and inviting visitors to watch the zoos residents react to the midday darkness. You can also spend the day visiting the planets. In northern Maine, a scale model of the solar system is displayed along nearly 100 miles (160 kilometers) of U.S. Route 1. Retired geology professor Kevin McCartney expects to unveil a new 23- foot-tall (7-meters-tall) roadside sun at the University of Maine at Presque Isle on eclipse day. You wont be able to miss it, he said.  Anderson, the weather expert, said its well worth the travel to see the special magical moment of a total eclipse: Its the Taylor Swift of natural events.

"What to know about Mondays total solar eclipse in the US, Mexico and Canada","North America is on the verge of another masking of the sun. Mondays total solar eclipse will make landfall along Mexicos Pacific coast and cross into Texas and 14 other U.S. states, before exiting over Canada. It will last almost twice as long, with an even wider audience, than the total solar eclipse that stretched coast-to-coast in the U.S. in 2017. The moon will shroud the sun for up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds, a spectacle normally unfolding in remote corners of the globe but this time passing over major cities like Dallas, Indianapolis and Cleveland. An estimated 44 million people live within the path of totality, with another couple hundred million within 200 miles (320 kilometers), guaranteeing the continents biggest eclipse crowd ever. Practically everyone on the continent will get to see a partial eclipse. You can watch the whole thing unfold online, too. NASA is offering several hours of streaming online from several cities along the totality path. The Associated Press will bring live coverage of watch parties and festivities.  And dont forget your special glasses to safely watch the eclipse.  It all depends on the weather, of course. The National Weather Service is providing daily updates of its cloud cover forecasts along the path. Heres more to know about Mondays celestial showstopper: The moon will line up perfectly between the Earth and the sun at midday, blotting out the sunlight. The full eclipse will last longer than usual because the moon will be just 223,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) from Earth, one of the years closest approaches. The closer the moon is to Earth, the bigger it is in the sky from our perspective, resulting in an especially long and intense period of sun-blocked darkness. Totality will last the longest over Mexico at 4 minutes, 28 seconds. Elsewhere along the track, like in Syracuse, New York, totality will last just 1 1/2 minutes. 
        
     The moons shadow will slice a diagonal line from the southwest to the northeast across North America, briefly plunging communities along the track into darkness. Totality will enter the continent at Mazatlan, Mexico, and exit at Newfoundland in Canada. In between, 15 U.S. states from Texas to Maine will experience totality, including snippets of Tennessee and Michigan. It will be a repeat for Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Carbondale, Illinois, which were also in prime position for 2017s total solar eclipse. During totality, you may be able to spot a comet along with four planets, if youre lucky. Jupiter will be to the left of the sun and Venus to the right. Saturn and Mars will be to the right of Venus, but fainter. The solar systems three other planets will be in the vicinity, but virtually impossible to see with the naked eye. Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is swinging past Earth, as it does every 71 years. Still faint, it will be positioned near Jupiter during the eclipse. But it will take a sudden outburst of dust and gas to see this so-called devil comet without a telescope, according to Anita Cochran of the University of Texas at Austin. But dont waste time looking for it. There is lots to see and not that long a time, she said via email. The U.S. hasnt experienced a total solar eclipse since Aug. 21, 2017, although a ring of fire solar eclipse crossed a part of the country last October. The moon was too far away then to completely blot out the sun, leaving a brilliant, burning ring around our star. The dramatic ring of fire stretched from Oregon to Texas, and crossed over Central America and Colombia, before exiting over Brazil. Kerrville, Texas, just west of San Antonio, is back in the bulls-eye and expecting another packed house. After Monday, the next total solar eclipse wont occur until 2026. But it will graze the top of the world, dipping into Greenland, Iceland and Spain. The next one in 2027 will march across Spain and northern Africa, with totality lasting an incredible 6 1/2 minutes. North Americans will have to wait until 2033 for another total solar eclipse, but it will be limited to Alaska. In 2044, Western Canada, Montana and North Dakota will have front-row seats. And in 2045, the U.S. will once again experience a coast-to-coast total solar eclipse. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Eclipse weather forecast: Clouds could spoil view along much of the path,"If youre in Vermont, Maine and Canada, youre in luck. But for the rest of the path of Mondays total solar eclipse, it could be dicey weather-wise. Clouds are forecast for much of the eclipse route through the U.S. with some possible patches of clear skies in some spots, according to the latest forecast from the National Weather Service. Northern New England into Canada is still the best bet to witness the eclipse, when the moon blocks out the sun for a few minutes and day turns into night. Texas is likely to have the heaviest cloud cover. More concerning, the weather service is forecasting severe weather  tornadoes and hail  about the time of the eclipse for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.  The forecast for the eclipse path has been fairly consistent for the past 10 days, said David Roth, a meteorologist with the weather service. Things arent moving that fast, he said Sunday. The path of total darkness stretches from Mexico and Texas through Maine and parts of Canada. At the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland on Sunday, weather service meteorologist Alexa Maines tried to reassure visitors that all was not lost. A warm front was due to bring in clouds Monday morning, but they could clear out by eclipse time. Cloud cover is one of the trickiest things to forecast, she said. Eclipse weather expert Jay Anderson also thinks the eclipse could be visible from Dallas to Columbus through thin, high clouds. Not the best conditions but tolerable, Anderson, a retired Canadian meteorologist, said via email. South of Dallas, there is a lot of low cloud that will disappoint a lot of eclipse enthusiasts, he said.  You can still watch the total solar eclipse online. Associated Press journalists will also bring live coverage of the eclipse from across the path, starting at 10 a.m. EDT with views from Mazatln, Mexico, and other locations. NASA will stream telescope views of the sun and on NASA TV starting at 1 p.m. EDT.  The Exploratorium museum, Time and Date and Slooh will also broadcast eclipse day views. ___ AP reporter Adithi Ramakrishnan contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"East Coast earthquakes arent common, but they are felt by millions. Heres what to know","DALLAS (AP)  East Coast residents were jolted Friday by a 4.8-magnitude earthquake centered near Lebanon, New Jersey, with weak rumblings felt as far away as Baltimore and the Massachusetts-New Hampshire border. No life-threatening injuries or major damage have been reported. Heres what to know about earthquakes on the East Coast. The Richter scale, developed by Charles F. Richter in the 1930s, is no longer widely used. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, as more seismograph stations were installed worldwide to calculate the size of an earthquake, Richters method was valid only for certain distance and frequency ranges. Seismometers are instruments used to record the grounds motion. Magnitudes are measures of an earthquakes size. They range from 2.5 or less, which are usually not felt, to 8.0 or higher, which can cause great damage.  Earthquakes large enough to be felt by a lot of people are relatively uncommon on the East Coast. Since 1950 there have been about 20 quakes with a magnitude above 4.5, according to the United States Geological Survey. Thats compared with over 1,000 on the West Coast.  That said, East Coast quakes like the one experienced Friday do happen. Theres a history of similar-sized earthquakes in the New York region over the last few hundred years, said Jessica Thompson Jobe from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. In 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake near Mineral, Virginia, shook East Coast residents over a wide swath from Georgia to Maine and even southeastern Canada. The USGS called it one of the most widely felt quakes in North American history. The quake cost $200 to $300 million in property damages, including to the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. The West Coast lies on a boundary where sections of Earths crust rub together, causing stress and slippage along fault lines that generate earthquakes relatively often. East Coast quakes like Fridays are caused by compression over time of hard, brittle rock deep underground, according to Robert Thorson, an earth sciences professor at the University of Connecticut. Its like having a big block of ice in a vise and you are just slowly cranking up the vise, he said. Eventually, youre going to get some crackling on it. These East Coast quakes can be harder to pinpoint. And they tend to affect a broader area. Thats because colder, harder East Coast rocks are better at spreading the rattling energy from an earthquake. The distribution of cities across the East Coast also means that more people are around to experience the effects of a quake. We also have population centers over a large part of the northeast, said Leslie Sonder, a geophysicist at Dartmouth College, So a lot of people around here feel the earthquake. USGS experts say there is a risk of aftershocks for weeks to months, which are expected after any earthquake. They recommend paying attention to emergency messaging from local officials. To keep safe from shakes while sleeping, remove any furniture or objects that could fall and injure you or others. If you feel shaking, drop where you are. Cover your head and neck with one arm, crawl under a table for shelter and hold on. If theres no shelter nearby, grasp your head and neck with both hands until the shaking stops. ___ AP writers John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia, and Pat Eaton-Robb in Storrs, Connecticut, contributed to this report.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Small town businesses embrace total solar eclipse crowd, come rain or shine on Monday","WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP)  The last time a total solar eclipse passed through this Texas town, horses and buggies filled the streets and cotton fetched 9 cents a pound. Nearly 150 years later, one thing hasnt changed: the threat of clouds blocking the view. Overcast skies are forecast for Mondays cosmic wonder across Texas, already packing in eclipse chasers to the delight of small town businesses.  As the moon covers the sun, daytime darkness will follow a narrow corridor  from Mexicos Pacific coast to Texas and 14 other states all the way to Maine and the eastern fringes of Canada. The best U.S. forecast: northern New England.  Like other communities along the path of totality, Waxahachie, a half-hours drive south of Dallas, is pulling out all the stops with a weekend full of concerts and other festivities. Its the regions first total solar eclipse since 1878. The next one wont be for almost another 300 years. I feel so lucky that I dont have to go anywhere, the Ellis County Museums Suzette Pylant said Saturday as she welcomed visitors in town for the eclipse. I get to just look out my window, walk out my door and look up.  Shes praying the weather will cooperate, as are the owners of all the shops clustered around the historic courthouse made of red sandstone and pink granite in the center of town. Theyre bracing for a few hundred thousand visitors for Mondays 4 minutes, 20 seconds of totality, close to the maximum of 4 minutes, 28 seconds elsewhere on the path. 
        
     The Oily Bar Soapery is hosting a Bubble Blackout all weekend, with eclipse-themed soaps and giveaways. Among the handmade soaps: Luna, Solar Power, Mother Earth and Hachie Eclipse of the Heart. The next one is centuries away so we figured wed go all out, explained owner Kalee Hume. Nazir Moosa, who owns the Celebrity Cafe and Bakery, winced when he heard the weather report, but noted: Its weather. You cant control it.

The River Ranch County Park, which opened in July on the outskirts of the city of Liberty Hill, is sold out and ready to host hundreds on Monday It still has that new park smell, said Sam Gibson, the parks assistant office administrator. Stacie Kenyon is inviting people to watch the eclipse from her Main Street Marketplace in the heart of Liberty Hills historic downtown  and escape inside the boutique if it rains. We were really hopeful, but now with this weather it is kind of a bummer, Kenyon said. We will just have to wait and see. In Waxahachie, theres a sense of deja vu around the town of 45,000 residents. A banner in the museums front window, displaying newspaper headlines from the July 29, 1878, eclipse, detailed the cloudy skies all morning. But just before the moon lined up between the sun and Earth that afternoon, the sky cleared. Visiting from Campbell, California, Ed Yuhara studied weather patterns before settling on northern Texas to view the eclipse with his wife, Paula, and a few friends. It turns out it will be the exact opposite, he said while touring the museum. He was in Oregon for Octobers ring of fire solar eclipse, but got rained out. Rain or shine, the Yuharas and friend Liz Gibbons plan on celebrating. Its a visual and physical experience and at my age, which is 75, I will never see one again, Gibbons said. Totality wont sweep across the U.S. like this again until 2045, sidestepping almost all of Texas. It just blows me away, Moosa said as he served up a large breakfast crowd.

"Weather is the hot topic as eclipse spectators stake out their spots in US, Mexico and Canada","MESQUITE, Texas (AP)  Eclipse spectators staked out their spots across three countries Sunday, fervently hoping for clear skies despite forecasts calling for clouds along most of the sun-vanishing route. North America wont see another coast-to-coast total solar eclipse for 21 years, prompting the weekends worry and mad rush. Mondays extravaganza stretches from Mexicos Pacific beaches to Canadas rugged Atlantic shores, with 15 U.S. states in between. I have arrived in the path of totality! Ian Kluft announced Sunday afternoon after pulling into Mesquite from Portland, Oregon, a 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) drive. A total eclipse happens when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun, blotting out the sunlight. That means a little over four minutes of daytime darkness east of Dallas in Mesquite, where locals like Jorge Martinez have the day off. The land surveyor plans to witness history from home with his wife and their 3-year-old daughter, Nati.  Hopefully, shell remember. Shes excited, too, he said following breakfast at Dos Panchas Mexican Restaurant. Inside the jammed restaurant, manager Adrian Martinez figured on staying open Monday.  Wish it was going to be sunny like today, he said. But cloudiness? Hopefully, it still looks pretty good. Near Ennis, Texas, to the south, the Range Vintage Trailer Resort was also packed, selling out of spots more than a year ago. 
        
     I booked it instantly, then I told my wife, Were going to Texas, Gotham, Englands Chris Lomas said from the trailer resort Sunday. Even if clouds obscure the covered-up sun, it will still go dark. Its just about sharing the experience with other people, he added. In Cleveland, the eclipse persuaded womens Final Four fans Matt and Sheila Powell to stick around an extra day after Sundays game. But they were debating whether to begin their drive home to Missouri Valley, Iowa, early Monday in search of clearer skies along the eclipses path. Were trying to be flexible, Powell said. Even the eclipse professionals were up in the air. Eclipse mapmaker Michael Zeiler had a perfect record ahead of Monday, seeing 11 out of 11 total solar eclipses after successfully relocating three of those times at the last minute for better weather. We are the complete opposite of tornado chasers, always seeking clear skies, Zeiler said in an email over the weekend. This time, though, he was staying put in Fredericksburg, Texas, with his family, 10 of them altogether, and holding onto a considerable ray of hope. Farther north, in Buffalo, New York, Jeff Sherman flew in from Somerville, Massachusetts, to catch his second total solar eclipse. After seeing the U.S. coast-to-coast eclipse in 2017, now I have to see any one thats nearby, he said. Kluft also enjoyed clear skies for the 2017 eclipse, in Oregon, and rolled into Mesquite wearing the T-shirt from that big event. As for Mondays cloudy forecast across Texas, at least Ill be around people who are like-minded. Dicey weather was also predicted almost all the way to Lake Erie, despite Sundays gorgeous weather. The only places promised clear skies along Mondays narrow 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) corridor of totality were New England and Canada. Like everywhere else, the weather was the hot topic at the Buffalo Naval and Military Park on Sunday. By mid-morning, volunteer Tom Villa already had greeted tourists from several states, as well as Canada and Brazil. They hope its like this tomorrow, of course, but you know, the weather is the weather, he said. ___ AP reporters Jamie Stengle near Ennis, Texas; Carolyn Thompson in Buffalo, New York; and Stephanie Nano in Cleveland contributed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Total solar eclipse wows North America. Clouds part just in time for most,"MESQUITE, Texas (AP)  A chilly, midday darkness fell across North America on Monday as a total solar eclipse raced across the continent, thrilling those lucky enough to behold the spectacle through clear skies. Street lights blinked on and the planets came into view, as the moon shrouded the sun for a few minutes across the land. Dogs howled, frogs croaked and some people wept, all part of the eclipse mania gripping Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. Almost everyone in North America could see at least a partial eclipse, weather permitting. It was the continents biggest eclipse audience ever, with a couple hundred million people living in or near the shadows path, plus scores of out-of-towners flocking in to see it. With the next coast-to-coast eclipse 21 years out, the pressure was on to catch this one. Clouds blanketed most of Texas as the total solar eclipse began its diagonal dash across land, starting along Mexicos mostly clear Pacific coast and aiming for Texas and 14 other U.S. states, before exiting into the North Atlantic near Newfoundland.  In Georgetown, Texas, the skies cleared just in time to give spectators a clear view. In other spots, the eclipse played peek-a-boo with the clouds.  We are really lucky, said Georgetown resident Susan Robertson. Even with the clouds it is kind of nice, because when it clears up, it is like, Wow! 
        
     I will never unsee this, said Ahmed Husseim of Austin, who had the eclipse on his calendar for a year. People watch a total solar eclipse in Mazatlan, Mexico, Monday, April 8, 2024.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) Just east of Dallas, the hundreds gathered at Mesquites downtown area cheered and whistled as the clouds parted in the final minutes before totality. As the sun finally became cloaked, the crowd grew louder, whipping off their eclipse glasses to soak in the unforgettable view of the suns corona, or spiky outer atmosphere, and Venus shining brilliantly off to the right. Going into Mondays spectacle, northern New England into Canada had the best chances of clear skies, drawing in spectators. The ideal conditions resulted in massive, hourslong traffic jams as visitors headed home. Holly Randall, who watched from Colebrook, New Hampshire, said experiencing the eclipse was beyond her expectations. I didnt expect to cry when I saw it, she said, as tears ran down her face. The show got underway in the Pacific before noon EDT. As the darkness of totality reached the Mexican resort city of Mazatln, the faces of spectators were illuminated only by the screens of their cellphones. The cliff-hanging uncertainty of the weather added to the drama. But the mornings overcast skies in Mesquite didnt rattle Erin Froneberger, who was in town for business and brought along her eclipse glasses. We are always just rushing, rushing, rushing, she said. But this is an event that we can just take a moment, a few seconds that its going to happen and embrace it. A festival outside Austin wrapped up early on Monday because of the threat of afternoon storms. Festival organizers urged everyone to pack up and leave.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) In Rushville, Indiana, the street lights lit up as darkness fell, drawing cheers and applause from residents gathered on porches and sidewalks. For some, eclipse day was also their wedding day. Couples exchanged vows in a mass ceremony at a park in Trenton, Ohio. St. Louis was just outside totality, but that didnt stop residents from taking in the scene from the Mississippi River aboard the Tom Sawyer, a paddlewheel riverboat.  I almost enjoyed it a little bit more because it didnt go black, said passenger Jeff Smith of St. Louis. During Mondays full eclipse, the moon slipped right in front of the sun, entirely blocking it. The resulting twilight, with only the suns outer atmosphere or corona visible, was long enough for birds and other animals to fall silent, and for planets and stars to pop out. At the Fort Worth Zoo, Adam Hartstone-Rose, a researcher from North Carolina State University, said most animals remained relatively calm. One gorilla climbed atop a pole and stood there for several seconds, likely a sign of vigilance. Nobody was doing sort of bonkers behavior, he said. The out-of-sync darkness lasted up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds. Thats almost twice as long as it was during the U.S. coast-to-coast eclipse seven years ago because the moon was closer to Earth. It took just 1 hour, 40 minutes for the moons shadow to race more than 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) across the continent. The path of totality  approximately 115 miles (185 kilometers) wide  encompassed several major cities this time, including Dallas; Indianapolis; Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; and Montreal. An estimated 44 million people live within the track, with a couple hundred million more within 200 miles (320 kilometers). This may be the most viewed astronomical event in history, said National Air and Space Museum curator Teasel Muir-Harmony, standing outside the museum in Washington, awaiting a partial eclipse.  Experts from NASA and scores of universities were posted along the route, launching research rockets and weather balloons, and conducting experiments. Mondays celestial sensation held special meaning for Fallon Vahani, who followed the action from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Blind from birth, the 44-year-old Indianapolis resident moved her fingertips over a Braille table reader, feeling the small plastic bumps pulsing as they traced the moons path. Shed listened to a radio broadcast of the 2017 eclipse and was eager to try this new method.

"A cluster of lost cities in Ecuadorian Amazon that lasted 1,000 years has been mapped","WASHINGTON (AP)  Archeologists have uncovered a cluster of lost cities in the Amazon rainforest that was home to at least 10,000 farmers around 2,000 years ago. A series of earthen mounds and buried roads in Ecuador was first noticed more than two decades ago by archaeologist Stphen Rostain. But at the time, I wasnt sure how it all fit together, said Rostain, one of the researchers who reported on the finding Thursday in the journal Science.  Recent mapping by laser-sensor technology revealed those sites to be part of a dense network of settlements and connecting roadways, tucked into the forested foothills of the Andes, that lasted about 1,000 years. It was a lost valley of cities, said Rostain, who directs investigations at Frances National Center for Scientific Research. Its incredible. The settlements were occupied by the Upano people between around 500 B.C. and 300 to 600 A.D.  a period roughly contemporaneous with the Roman Empire in Europe, the researchers found.  Residential and ceremonial buildings erected on more than 6,000 earthen mounds were surrounded by agricultural fields with drainage canals. The largest roads were 33 feet (10 meters) wide and stretched for 6 to 12 miles (10 to 20 kilometers).  While its difficult to estimate populations, the site was home to at least 10,000 inhabitants  and perhaps as many as 15,000 or 30,000 at its peak, said archaeologist Antoine Dorison, a study co-author at the same French institute. Thats comparable to the estimated population of Roman-era London, then Britains largest city. 
        
     This shows a very dense occupation and an extremely complicated society, said University of Florida archeologist Michael Heckenberger, who was not involved in the study. For the region, its really in a class of its own in terms of how early it is. Jos Iriarte, a University of Exeter archaeologist, said it would have required an elaborate system of organized labor to build the roads and thousands of earthen mounds. The Incas and Mayans built with stone, but people in Amazonia didnt usually have stone available to build  they built with mud. Its still an immense amount of labor, said Iriarte, who had no role in the research. The Amazon is often thought of as a pristine wilderness with only small groups of people. But recent discoveries have shown us how much more complex the past really is, he said. Scientists have recently also found evidence of intricate rainforest societies that predated European contact elsewhere in the Amazon, including in Bolivia and in Brazil. Theres always been an incredible diversity of people and settlements in the Amazon, not only one way to live, said Rostain. Were just learning more about them. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

US companys lunar lander will burn up in Earths atmosphere after failed moonshot,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A U.S. companys lunar lander will soon burn up in Earths atmosphere after a failed moonshot.  Astrobotic Technology said its lander is now headed back toward Earth from the vicinity of the moon. Company officials expect the mission to end Thursday. Astrobotic is working with NASA to track the landers path and said it should pose no safety risk during its fiery reentry.  The lander, named Peregrine, rocketed from Cape Canaveral last Monday. It quickly developed a fuel leak that forced Astrobotic to abandon its attempt to make the first U.S. lunar landing in more than 50 years. The company suspects a stuck valve caused a tank to rupture. Astrobotic said it has consulted with NASA and other government officials on how best to end the mission. The company said it does not want to endanger satellites around Earth or create a hazard for future spacecraft flying to the moon.  It was a difficult decision, the company said in an online update late Sunday. By responsibly ending Peregrines mission, we are doing our part to preserve the future of space exploration.  NASA paid more than $100 million to fly experiments on the Peregrine lander. Its part of the space agencys bid to commercialize lunar deliveries by private businesses while the government works to get astronauts back to the moon.  The lander also carried a rover from Carnegie Mellon University and other privately sponsored research, as well as the ashes and DNA from about 70 people, including Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke.

Largest deep-sea coral reef to date is mapped by scientists off the US Atlantic coast,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Scientists have mapped the largest coral reef deep in the ocean, stretching hundreds of miles off the U.S. Atlantic coast.  While researchers have known since the 1960s that some coral were present off the Atlantic, the reefs size remained a mystery until new underwater mapping technology made it possible to construct 3D images of the ocean floor. The largest yet known deep coral reef has been right under our noses, waiting to be discovered, said Derek Sowers, an oceanographer at the nonprofit Ocean Exploration Trust. Sowers and other scientists, including several at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, recently published maps of the reef in the journal Geomatics. The reef extends for about 310 miles (499 kilometers) from Florida to South Carolina and at some points reaches 68 miles (109 kilometers) wide. The total area is nearly three times the size of Yellowstone National Park. Its eye-opening  its breathtaking in scale, said Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who was not involved in the study. The reef was found at depths ranging from 655 feet to 3,280 feet (200 meters to 1,000 meters), where sunlight doesnt penetrate. Unlike tropical coral reefs, where photosynthesis is important for growth, coral this far down must filter food particles out of the water for energy.  Deep coral reefs provide habitat for sharks, swordfish, sea stars, octopus, shrimp and many other kinds of fish, the scientists said. 
        
     Tropical reefs are better known to scientists  and snorkelers -- because theyre more accessible. The worlds largest tropical coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, stretches for about 1,430 miles (2,301 kilometers).  Sowers said its possible that larger deep-sea reefs will be discovered in the future since only about 25% of the worlds ocean floor has been mapped in high-resolution. Only 50% of U.S. offshore waters have been mapped. Maps of the ocean floor are created using high-resolution sonar devices carried on ships. Deep reefs cover more of the ocean floor than tropical reefs. Both kinds of habitat are susceptible to similar risks, including climate change and disturbance from oil and gas drilling, said Erik Cordes, a marine biologist at Temple University and co-author of the new study.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Astronauts from Turkey, Sweden and Italy launch to space station on latest chartered flight","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Turkeys first astronaut along with a Swede and Italian launched Thursday to the International Space Station on a chartered SpaceX flight. The Falcon rocket blasted off from NASAs Kennedy Space Center in late afternoon, carrying the three men, all with military pilot experience and representing their homelands. Their escort on the trip: A retired NASA astronaut who now works for the company that arranged the private flight. Their capsule should reach the space station on Saturday. They will spend two weeks performing experiments, chatting up schoolchildren and soaking in the views of Earth, before returning home. Its costing each of the three countries $55 million or more. Thats the rough per-person price for the trip, the third such journey organized by the Houston company Axiom Space with NASA and SpaceX. Russia has been welcoming paid visitors to the space station for more than two decades; NASA didnt until two years ago. Turkeys Alper Gezeravci, a former fighter pilot and captain for Turkish Airlines, is the first person from his country to rocket to space. He noted Turkey just celebrated its 100th anniversary, and, until now, the nations view of the sky has been limited to that we could see with our bare eyes. Now this mission is opening that curtain all the way, he told reporters before the flight. This is the beginning of our next centennial.

"Private US lander destroyed during reentry after failed mission to moon, company says","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A U.S. companys failed moonshot ended with a fiery plunge over the South Pacific, officials confirmed Friday. Astrobotic Technology said contact and then tracking was lost as its lunar lander reentered Earths atmosphere Thursday, 10 days after launching from Florida. It received confirmation Friday from U.S. Space Command that the spacecraft broke apart during its final moments, CEO John Thornton said.  A fuel leak shortly after liftoff had nixed any chance of a moon touchdown. What a wild adventure we were just on, Thornton said. Certainly not the outcome we were hoping for and certainly challenging right up front. After consulting with NASA and other government experts, Astrobotic took steps to destroy its crippled lander in order to protect other spacecraft. Flight controllers at the companys Pittsburgh headquarters briefly fired the engines, getting the lander in the right location for reentry despite little fuel.  Thornton said an investigation board will be convened to determine what went wrong. Engineers suspect a stuck valve in the propellant system caused a tank to rupture. We were coming from the highest high of the perfect launch and came down to a lowest low when the tank burst a few hours after liftoff, he told reporters. The 6-foot-tall (1.9-meter-tall) lander, named after the Peregrine falcon, made it all the way out to the moons orbit, more than 240,000 miles (390,000 kilometers) away, before doing a U-turn and hurtling back toward Earth.  
        
     It was the first U.S. lunar lander in more than a half-century. The next one is set to blast off next month, built and operated by Houstons Intuitive Machines. NASA paid millions of dollars to the two companies to fly its experiments to the moon, part of an effort to commercialize lunar deliveries ahead of astronauts arrival.  Right before Fridays U.S. news conference, a lunar lander from Japan touched down on the moon, but it was unable to generate crucial solar power. The U.S., Russia, China and India have successfully landed spacecraft on the moon and only the U.S. has landed astronauts. Astrobotics lander carried a variety of experiments  including five from NASA  as well as ashes and DNA from 70 space enthusiasts, including Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry.

Once unknown emperor penguin colonies have been spotted in Antarctica  though some are moving away,"Previously unknown colonies of emperor penguins have been spotted in new satellite imagery.  Emperor penguins, considered near threatened with extinction, are the worlds largest penguins. They raise their chicks in Antarctic winter on patches of frozen sea ice. But if the ice breaks up before the chicks have fledged, most will die. At least some emperor penguins are moving their colonies as melting ice from climate change threatens breeding grounds, according to research released on Wednesday.  One penguin colony near Halley Bay appears to have moved around 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the east, said Peter Fretwell, a researcher at the British Antarctic Survey. He said unstable conditions beginning in 2016 had made the old location perilous. Emperor penguins have taken it upon themselves to try to find more stable sea ice, he said.  The four newly found colonies likely existed for many years, but scientists hadnt previously spotted them, said Fretwell. They are mostly small colonies, with less than 1,000 breeding pairs each, he said. Scientists currently know of 66 emperor penguin colonies.  The newly spotted colonies dont greatly change overall population estimates  currently less than around 300,000 breeding pairs  but they help scientists understand where penguins might be moving, said Fretwell. Its unclear if any of the newly identified colonies could be breakaway groups from other larger colonies, said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study. 
        
     But its clear the breeding sites are in flux and a warming world means more penguins will be on the move, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Are insects drawn to light? New research shows its confusion, not fatal attraction","WASHINGTON (AP)  Like a moth to flame, many scientists and poets have long assumed that flying insects were simply, inexorably drawn to bright lights. But thats not exactly whats going on, a new study suggests. Rather than being attracted to light, researchers believe that artificial lights at night may actually scramble flying insects innate navigational systems, causing them to flutter in confusion around porch lamps, street lights and other artificial beacons. Insects have a navigational problem, said Tyson Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was not involved in the research. Theyre accustomed to using light as a cue to know which way is up. Insects do not fly directly toward a light source, but actually tilt their backs toward the light, said Sam Fabian, an Imperial College London entomologist and co-author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.  That would make sense if the strongest light source was in the sky. But in the presence of artificial lights, the result is midair confusion, not attraction.  For the study, researchers attached tiny sensors to moths and dragonflies in a laboratory to film motion-capture video of flight  similar to how filmmakers attach sensors to actors to track their movements.  They also used high-resolution cameras to film insects swirling around lights at a field site in Costa Rica.  
        
     This allowed them to study in detail how dragonflies will circle endlessly around light sources, positioning themselves with their backs facing the beams. They also documented that some insects will flip upside down  and often crash land  in the presence of lights that shine straight upward like search lights.  Insect flight was least disrupted by bright lights that shine straight downward, the researchers found.  For millions of years, insects oriented themselves by sensing that the sky is light, the ground is dark  until people invented artificial lights, said Avalon Owens, a Harvard entomologist who was not involved in the research.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASAs little helicopter on Mars has logged its last flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs little Mars helicopter has flown its last flight.  The space agency announced Thursday that the 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) chopper named Ingenuity can no longer fly because of rotor blade damage. While it remains upright and in contact with flight controllers, its $85 million mission is officially over, officials said.  Originally intended as a short-term tech demo, Ingenuity logged 72 flights over three years at Mars. It accumulated more than two hours of flight time, traveling 11 miles (18 kilometers). Thats more than 14 times farther than planned, according to NASA. It soared as high as 79 feet (24 meters) and hit speeds of up to 22.4 mph (36 kph). While we knew this day was inevitable, it doesnt make it any easier to announce the end of the mission, said NASAs Lori Glaze. Its almost an understatement to say that it has surpassed expectations. Ingenuity hitched a ride on NASAs Perseverance rover, landing on Mars in 2021. It ended up serving as a scout for the rover and proved powered flight was possible in the thin Martian atmosphere. Images beamed back this week from its last flight showed that one or more of its rotor blades suffered damage while landing and may have hit the surface. The blades are no longer usable, according to NASA. The helicopter ascended to 40 feet (12 meters) on its final flight last week, hovering for a few seconds before descending. It mysteriously lost contact with the nearby rover  its communication relay  while still 3 feet (1 meter) off the ground. Once communication was restored, the damage was confirmed. The reason for the loss of communication is under investigation. Ingenuitys success prompted NASA in 2022 to add two mini helicopters to a future Mars mission.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Hungry sea otters are helping save Californias marshlands from erosion,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The return of sea otters and their voracious appetites has helped rescue a section of California marshland, a new study shows. Sea otters eat constantly and one of their favorite snacks is the striped shore crab. These crabs dig burrows and also nibble away roots of the marsh grass pickleweed that holds dirt in place.  Left unchecked, the crabs turn the marsh banks into Swiss cheese, which can collapse when big waves or storms hit, said Brent Hughes, a Sonoma State University marine ecologist and co-author of the new study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. Researchers found that the return of the crab-eating sea otters to a tidal estuary near Monterey, California, helped curb erosion.  FILE - Sea otters loll in the water at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, Calif., March 26, 2018. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) FILE - Sea otters loll in the water at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, Calif., March 26, 2018. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) They dont completely reverse erosion, but slow it down to natural levels, said Hughes.  AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports.  For many years, there werent any sea otters in Elkhorn Slough.  The 19th century fur trade decimated their global population which once stretched from Alaska to California, as well as into Russia and Japan. At one point, as few as 2,000 animals remained, mostly in Alaska. Hunting bans and habitat restoration efforts helped sea otters recover some of their former range. The first returnees were spotted in Elkhorn Slough in 1984. The Monterey Bay Aquariums program for raising and releasing orphaned sea otters also boosted the estuarys population.  For the new study, researchers analyzed historic erosion rates dating back to the 1930s to assess the impact of sea otters return. They also set up fenced areas to keep otters away from some creek sections for three years  those creek banks eroded much faster. 
        
     Past studies about the return of top predators to various habitats  most famously, the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park  show how such species maintain ecosystem stability. Wolves curbed the number of elk and moose that ate saplings and slowed riverbank erosion. Many past studies relied on observations, but the design of the latest research left no doubt as to the sea otters impact, said Johan Eklf, a Stockholm University marine biologist who was not involved in the new study.

"Skyscraper-size asteroid will buzz Earth on Friday, safely passing within 1.7 million miles","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An asteroid as big as a skyscraper will pass within 1.7 million miles of Earth on Friday.

NASAs Center for Near Earth Object Studies estimates the space rock is between 690 feet and 1,575 feet (210 meters and 480 meters) across. That means the asteroid could be similar in size to New York Citys Empire State Building or Chicagos Willis Tower.  Discovered in 2008, the asteroid is designated as 2008 OS7. It wont be back our way again until 2032, but it will be a much more distant encounter, staying 45 million miles (72 million kilometers) away.

Saturns Death Star-looking moon may have vast underground ocean,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have found the best evidence yet of a vast, young ocean beneath the icy exterior of Saturns Death Star lookalike mini moon.  The French-led team analyzed changes in Mimas orbit and rotation and reported Wednesday that a hidden ocean 12 to 18 miles (20 to 30 kilometers) beneath the frozen crust was more likely than an elongated rocky core. The scientists based their findings on observations by NASAs Cassini spacecraft, which observed Saturn and its more than 140 moons for more than a decade before diving through the ringed planets atmosphere in 2017 and burning up.  Barely 250 miles (400 kilometers) in diameter, the heavily cratered moon lacks the fractures and geysers  typical signs of subsurface activity  of Saturns Enceladus and Jupiters Europa. Mimas was probably the most unlikely place to look for a global ocean  and liquid water more generally, co-author Valery Lainey of the Paris Observatory said in an email. So that looks like a potential habitable world. But nobody knows how much time is needed for life to arise. Results were published in the journal Nature.  The ocean is believed to fill half of Mimas volume, according to Lainey. Yet it represents only 1.2% to 1.4% of Earths oceans given the moons petite size. Despite being so small, Mimas boasts the second largest impact crater of any moon in the solar system  the reason its compared to the fictional Death Star space station in Star Wars. 
        
     The idea that relatively small, icy moons can harbor young oceans is inspiring, SETI Institutes Matija Cuk and Southwest Research Institutes Alyssa Rose Rhoden wrote in an accompanying editorial. They were not part of the study.  Believed between 5 million and 15 million years old, too young to mark the moons surface, this subterranean ocean would have an overall temperature right around freezing, according to Lainey. But at the seafloor, he said the water temperature could be much warmer.  Co-author Nick Cooper of Queen Mary University of London said the existence of a remarkably young ocean of liquid water makes Mimas a prime candidate for studying the origin of life.

NASA climate satellite blasts off to survey oceans and atmosphere of a warming Earth,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs newest climate satellite rocketed into orbit Thursday to survey the worlds oceans and atmosphere in never-before-seen detail.  SpaceX launched the Pace satellite on its $948 million mission before dawn, with the Falcon rocket heading south over the Atlantic to achieve a rare polar orbit. The satellite will spend at least three years studying the oceans from 420 miles (676 kilometers) up, as well as the atmosphere. It will scan the globe daily with two of the science instruments. A third instrument will take monthly measurements.  Its going to be an unprecedented view of our home planet, said project scientist Jeremy Werdell.

(NASA via AP) In this image taken from NASA video, the Pace (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem) satellite detaches from a SpaceX rocket in orbit, Thursday, Feb. 8, 2024. (NASA via AP) The observations will help scientists improve hurricane and other severe weather forecasts, detail Earths changes as temperatures rise and better predict when harmful algae blooms will happen.  NASA already has more than two dozen Earth-observing satellites and instruments in orbit. But Pace should give better insights into how atmospheric aerosols like pollutants and volcanic ash and sea life like algae and plankton interact with each other. 
        
     Pace will give us another dimension to what other satellites observe, said NASAs director of Earth science, Karen St. Germain.

(NASA via AP) Pace  short for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem  is the most advanced mission ever launched to study ocean biology.  Current Earth-observing satellites can see in seven or eight colors, according to Werdell. Pace will see in 200 colors that will allow scientists to identify the types of algae in the sea and types of particles in the air. Scientists expect to start getting data in a month or two.  NASA is collaborating with India on another advanced Earth-observing satellite due to launch this year. Named Nisar, it will use radar to measure the effect of rising temperatures on glaciers and other melting icy surfaces. NASAs Pace project persevered despite efforts by the Trump administration to cancel it.

"Astronauts from Turkey, Italy and Sweden return to Earth, ending private space station trip","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronauts from Turkey, Italy and Sweden returned to Earth on Friday, ending a private three-week mission to the International Space Station. The trio were accompanied by a retired NASA astronaut who now works for Axiom Space, the Houston company that arranged the chartered flight. The crew returned in a SpaceX capsule that parachuted into the Atlantic off the Florida coast. Turkey celebrated Alper Gezeravcis launch from Cape Canaveral last month. A former fighter pilot and captain for Turkish Airlines, he became the first person from his country to fly in space. Gezeravci was joined on the trip by Italian Air Force Col. Walter Villadei, Swedens Marcus Wandt, a former fighter pilot chosen as a reserve astronaut by the European Space Agency in 2022 and Michael Lopez-Alegria, their escort. Turkey, Italy and Sweden financed the mission, paying roughly $55 million apiece. It was Axioms third private mission to the space station; the fourth is planned later this year. Before leaving the space station, Gezeravci thanked his country for its bold and determined decision to send a citizen into space as part of its 100th anniversary as a republic. While in orbit, the astronauts conducted science experiments and chatted with schoolchildren and officials from their countries. They enjoyed a few extra days at the space station, waiting for the weather to improve in the splashdown zone. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Nearly half of the worlds migratory species are in decline, UN report says","WASHINGTON (AP)  Nearly half of the worlds migratory species are in decline, according to a new United Nations report released Monday.  Many songbirds, sea turtles, whales, sharks and other migratory animals move to different environments with changing seasons and are imperiled by habitat loss, illegal hunting and fishing, pollution and climate change. About 44% of migratory species worldwide are declining in population, the report found. More than a fifth of the nearly 1,200 species monitored by the U.N. are threatened with extinction.  These are species that move around the globe. They move to feed and breed and also need stopover sites along the way, said Kelly Malsch, lead author of the report released at a U.N. wildlife conference in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.  Habitat loss or other threats at any point in their journey can lead to dwindling populations.  Migration is essential for some species. If you cut the migration, youre going to kill the species, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the report.  The report relied on existing data, including information from the International Union for Conservation of Natures Red List, which tracks whether a species is endangered.  Participants of the U.N. meeting plan to evaluate proposals for conservation measures and also whether to formally list several new species of concern.  One country alone cannot save any of these species, said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society.  
        
     At the meeting, eight governments from South America are expected to jointly propose adding two species of declining Amazon catfish to the U.N. treatys list of migratory species of concern, she said. The Amazon River basin is worlds largest freshwater system. If the Amazon is intact, the catfish will thrive  its about protecting the habitat, Lieberman said. In 2022, governments pledged to protect 30% of the planets land and water resources for conservation at the U.N. Biodiversity Conference in Montreal, Canada.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

US companys lunar lander rockets toward the moon for a touchdown attempt next week,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Another private U.S. company took a shot at the moon Thursday, launching a month after a rivals lunar lander missed its mark and came crashing back. NASA, the main sponsor with experiments on board, is hoping for a successful moon landing next week as it seeks to jumpstart the lunar economy ahead of astronaut missions. SpaceXs Falcon rocket blasted off in the middle of the night from NASAs Kennedy Space Center, dispatching Intuitive Machines lunar lander on its way to the moon, 230,000 miles (370,000 kilometers) away.  The lander resembled a stunning six-pointed star jewel  each point a leg  as it successfully separated from the upper stage and drifted off into the black void with the blue Earth far below. If all goes well, a touchdown attempt would occur Feb. 22, after a day in lunar orbit. Only five countries  the U.S., Russia, China, India and Japan  have scored a lunar landing and no private business has yet done so. The U.S. has not returned to the moons surface since the Apollo program ended more than five decades ago.  There have been a lot of sleepless nights getting ready for this, Intuitive Machines co-founder and chief executive Steve Altemus said before the flight.  AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports the Falcon 9 has lifted a private companys craft on a mission to land on the moons south pole. The Houston-based company aims to put its 14-foot (4.3-meter) tall, six-legged lander down just 186 miles (300 kilometers) shy of the moons south pole, equivalent to landing within Antarctica on Earth. This region  full of treacherous craters and cliffs, yet potentially rich with frozen water  is where NASA plans to land astronauts later this decade. The space agency said its six navigation and tech experiments on the lander can help smooth the way. 
        
     NASAs first entry in its commercial lunar delivery service  Astrobotic Technologys Peregrine lander  stumbled shortly after liftoff in early January. A ruptured fuel tank and massive leak caused the spacecraft to bypass the moon and come tearing back through the atmosphere 10 days after launching, breaking apart and burning up over the Pacific. Others made it to the moon before wrecking. An Israeli nonprofits lander crashed in 2019. Last year, a Tokyo company saw its lander smash into the moon followed by Russias crash landing.  Only the U.S. has sent astronauts to the moon with Apollo 17s Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt closing out the program in December 1972. That was it for U.S. moon landings until Astrobotics short-lived try last month. Intuitive Machines nicknamed its lander after Homers hero in The Odyssey.  Godspeed, Odysseus. Now lets go make history, said Trent Martin, vice president of space systems.  NASA is paying Intuitive Machines $118 million to get its latest set of experiments to the moon. The company also drummed up its own customers, including Columbia Sportswear, which is testing a metallic jacket fabric as a thermal insulator on the lander, and sculptor Jeff Koons, who is sending up 125 inch-sized moon figurines in a see-through cube. The lander also is carrying Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Universitys Eaglecam, which will snap pictures of the lander as they both descend. The spacecraft will cease operations after a week on the surface.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASAs final tally shows spacecraft returned double the amount of asteroid rubble,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA finally has counted up all the asteroid samples returned by a spacecraft last fall  and its double the rubble return goal.  Officials reported Thursday that the Osiris-Rex spacecraft collected 121.6 grams (4.29 ounces) of dust and pebbles from asteroid Bennu. Thats just over half a cup and the biggest cosmic haul ever from beyond the moon. It took NASA longer than expected to pry open the sample container because of stuck fasteners.  The black, carbon-rich samples  the first ever collected from an asteroid by NASA  are stored at a special curation lab at Houstons Johnson Space Center.  Osiris-Rex returned the samples last September, three years after gathering them from the asteroid. The haul for the $1 billion mission would have been greater, but rocks jammed the lid of the container following the grab and some samples floated away. The spacecraft is now on its way to another space rock, but that will involve only a flyby with no stop for samples. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Astronomers find what may be the universes brightest object with a black hole devouring a sun a day,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have discovered what may be the brightest object in the universe, a quasar with a black hole at its heart growing so fast that it swallows the equivalent of a sun a day. The record-breaking quasar shines 500 trillion times brighter than our sun. The black hole powering this distant quasar is more than 17 billion times more immense than our sun, an Australian-led team reported Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.  While the quasar resembles a mere dot in images, scientists envision a ferocious place. The rotating disk around the quasars black hole  the luminous swirling gas and other matter from gobbled-up stars  is like a cosmic hurricane. This quasar is the most violent place that we know in the universe, lead author Christian Wolf of Australian National University said in an email. The European Southern Observatory spotted the object, J0529-4351, during a 1980 sky survey, but it was thought to be a star. It was not identified as a quasar  the extremely active and luminous core of a galaxy  until last year. Observations by telescopes in Australia and Chiles Atacama Desert clinched it. The exciting thing about this quasar is that it was hiding in plain sight and was misclassified as a star previously, Yale Universitys Priyamvada Natarajan, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.  These later observations and computer modeling have determined that the quasar is gobbling up the equivalent of 370 suns a year  roughly one a day. Further analysis shows the mass of the black hole to be 17 to 19 billion times that of our sun, according to the team. More observations are needed to understand its growth rate. 
        
     The quasar is 12 billion light-years away and has been around since the early days of the universe. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Ring of fire solar eclipse will slice across Americas on Saturday with millions along path,"Tens of millions in the Americas will have front-row seats for Saturdays rare ring of fire eclipse of the sun. Whats called an annular solar eclipse  better known as a ring of fire  will briefly dim the skies over parts of the western U.S. and Central and South America.  As the moon lines up precisely between Earth and the sun, it will blot out all but the suns outer rim. A bright, blazing border will appear around the moon for as much as five minutes, wowing skygazers along a narrow path stretching from Oregon to Brazil. The celestial showstopper will yield a partial eclipse across the rest of the Western Hemisphere. Its a prelude to the total solar eclipse that will sweep across Mexico, the eastern half of the U.S. and Canada, in six months. Unlike Saturday, when the moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the sun from our perspective, the moon will be at the perfect distance on April 8, 2024. Heres what you need to know about the ring of fire eclipse, where you can see it and how to protect your eyes: The eclipse will carve out a swath about 130 miles (210 kilometers) wide, starting in the North Pacific and entering the U.S. over Oregon around 8 a.m. PDT Saturday. It will culminate in the ring of fire a little over an hour later. From Oregon, the eclipse will head downward across Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas, encompassing slivers of Idaho, California, Arizona and Colorado, before exiting into the Gulf of Mexico at Corpus Christi. It will take less than an hour for the flaming halo to traverse the U.S. From there, the ring of fire will cross Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and, finally, Brazil before its grand finale over the Atlantic. The entire eclipse  from the moment the moon starts to obscure the sun until its back to normal  will last 2 1/2 to three hours at any given spot. The ring of fire portion lasts from three to five minutes, depending on location. In the U.S. alone, more than 6.5 million people live along the so-called path of annularity, with another 68 million within 200 miles (322 kilometers), according to NASAs Alex Lockwood, a planetary scientist. So a few hours short drive and you can have over 70 million witness this incredible celestial alignment, she said. At the same time, a crescent-shaped partial eclipse will be visible in every U.S. state, although just barely in Hawaii, provided the skies are clear. Canada, Central America and most of South America, also will see a partial eclipse. The closer to the ring of fire path, the bigger the bite the moon will appear to take out of the sun. Cant see it? NASA and others will provide a livestream of the eclipse.  Be sure to use safe, certified solar eclipse glasses, Lockwood stressed. Sunglasses arent enough to prevent eye damage. Proper protection is needed throughout the eclipse, from the initial partial phase to the ring of fire to the final partial phase.  There are other options if you dont have eclipse glasses. You can look indirectly with a pinhole projector that you can make yourself, including one made with a cereal box. Cameras  including those on cellphones  binoculars, or telescopes need special solar filters mounted at the front end. One patch of Texas near San Antonio will be in the cross-hairs of Saturdays eclipse and next Aprils, with Kerrville near the center. Its one of the locations hosting NASAs livestream.  Is the city of Kerrville excited? Absolutely!!! Mayor Judy Eychner said in an email. And having NASA here is just icing on the cake!!!  With Saturdays eclipse coinciding with art, music and river festivals, Eychner expects Kerrvilles population of 25,000 to double or even quadruple. Aprils total solar eclipse will crisscross the U.S. in the opposite direction. It will begin in the Pacific and head up through Mexico into Texas, then pass over Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, the northern fringes of Pennsylvania and New York, and New England, before cutting across Canada into the North Atlantic at New Brunswick and Newfoundland. Almost all these places missed out during the United States coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in 2017. It will be 2039 before another ring of fire is visible in the U.S., and Alaska will be the only state then in the path of totality. And it will be 2046 before another ring of fire crosses into the U.S. Lower 48. That doesnt mean they wont be happening elsewhere: The southernmost tip of South America will get one next October, and Antarctica in 2026. NASA and others plan a slew of observations during both eclipses, with rockets and hundreds of balloons soaring. Its going to be absolutely breathtaking for science, said NASA astrophysicist Madhulika Guhathakurta. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Universitys Aroh Barjatya will help launch three NASA-funded sounding rockets from New Mexicos White Sands Missile Range before, during and after Saturdays eclipse. The goal is to see how eclipses set off atmospheric waves in the ionosphere nearly 200 miles (320 kilometers) up that could disrupt communications. Barjatya will be just outside Saturdays ring of fire. And hell miss Aprils full eclipse, while launching rockets from Virginias Wallops Island. But the bittersweet moment of not seeing annularity or totality will certainly be made up by the science return, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Walgreens pharmacy staffers stage walkouts over work conditions,"NEW YORK (AP)  Walgreens has named a new CEO as pharmacy staff walked off the job this week over concerns that working conditions are putting employees and patients at risk. Tim Wentworth, who formerly headed Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, was named CEO as of Oct. 23. Walgreens Boots Alliances former CEO, Rosalind Brewer, stepped down in late August as the company was struggling with drug and staffing shortages.  Health care is suffering from wider worker dissatisfaction and staffing shortages that are not isolated to drugstores, as the recent Kaiser Permanente strike shows. The exact scale of the pharmacists protest was unclear. Organizers on Tuesday estimated that more than 300 Walgreens locations  out of nearly 9,000 nationwide  were affected by walkouts planned for Monday through Wednesday. A company spokesperson said no more than a dozen pharmacies experienced disruptions. A Walgreens pharmacy manager who helped organize the walkouts told The Associated Press that teams were short-staffed and overworked, especially with the additional demands from the COVID-19 pandemic. Its led to upset customers, said the organizer, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity for fear of being punished by the company. Its led to medication errors, vaccination errors, needle sticks. Many Walgreens workers arent unionized and the employees who walked out are organizing online. They shared three main requests for the company, the organizer said: to improve transparency about shifting hours and schedules; to set aside training hours for new team members; and to adjust tasks and expectations at each location based on staffing levels. 
        
     The organizer said if Walgreens does not address concerns from pharmacy staff, more walkouts could happen at the end of the month. Walgreens spokesman Fraser Engerman said the company is listening to the employees concerns. We are committed to ensuring that our entire pharmacy team has the support and resources necessary to continue to provide the best care to our patients while taking care of their own wellbeing, Engerman said in a statement. Drugstores across the country are challenged by heavy workloads heading into the busy fall season. And CVS locations in the Kansas City area also saw walkouts last month, after which the company promised to boost hiring. Many of these underlying concerns about working conditions have been building for years, said Bled Tanoe, a former pharmacist who has been supporting the walkouts on social media. But the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue by adding new demands like testing and vaccination, without the proper support for the people behind the counter, she said. Brewer, who left in late August, had said the company was limiting hours at 1,100 pharmacies, or about 12% of its U.S. locations. That was down from 1,600 earlier this year, but a company executive has said it doesnt expect to return all pharmacies to normal operating hours by years end. In a statement, Walgreens Executive Chairman Stefano Pessina said the company had been seeking a CEO with deep healthcare experience. We are confident he is the right person to lead WBAs next phase of growth in to a customer-centric healthcare company, Pessina said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA shows off its first asteroid samples delivered by a spacecraft,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA on Wednesday showed off its first asteroid samples delivered last month by a spacecraft  a jumble of black dust and rubble thats the most ever returned to Earth.  Scientists anticipated getting a cupful but are still unsure how much was grabbed from the carbon-rich asteroid named Bennu, almost 60 million miles (97 million kilometers) away. Thats because the main sample chamber has yet to be opened, officials said during an event at Johnson Space Center in Houston.  Its been going slow and meticulous, but the science is already starting, said the missions lead scientist, Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona.  NASAs Osiris-Rex spacecraft collected the samples three years ago from the surface of Bennu and then dropped them off sealed in a capsule during a flyby of Earth last month. The expected cupful was far more than the teaspoon or so that Japan brought back from a pair of missions.  Black dust and particles were scattered around the outside edge of the internal sample chamber, according to Lauretta. He said theres still a whole treasure chest of extraterrestrial material to be studied. The samples are priceless, the preserved building blocks from the dawn of the solar system. No one at Wednesdays celebration at Johnson got to see any of the samples firsthand  just photos and video. The asteroid pieces were behind locked doors in a new lab at the space center, accessible only to scientists in protective gear.  
        
     Besides carbon, the asteroid rubble holds water in the form of water-bearing clay minerals, Lauretta and others pointed out. That is how we think water got to the Earth, he said. Minerals like were seeing from Bennu landed on Earth 4 billion years ago to 4.5 billion years ago, making our world habitable. That was one of the primary reasons for the $1 billion, seven-year mission: to help learn how the solar system  and Earth in particular  formed. You cant get more exciting than that, said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. Back in 2020, Lauretta and his team lost some of their haul when the lid on the sample container jammed a few days after the spacecraft collected the material. It vacuumed up so many pieces from Bennu that small rocks got lodged under the lid and prevented it from closing, sending pieces floating off into space. Thats why scientists did not have a precise measurement of what was coming back; they estimated 250 grams, or about a cupful, ahead of the Sept. 24 landing in the Utah desert. They wont have a good count until the container is opened, within two weeks or so.  Much of the material shown Wednesday was overflow from when the lid was stuck open, before everything could be sealed inside the return capsule. The larger visible rocks were under an inch (2.5 centimeters) in size. We have a bounty of sample on our hands already and were not even inside the main sample container, said NASA astromaterials curator Francis McCubbin.  Once the samples are archived, the team will dole out particles to researchers around the world, while saving a fair amount for future analysis when better technology should be available. NASA has another asteroid-chasing spacecraft on a Florida launch pad, ready to blast off later this week. The destination will be a rare asteroid made of metal named Psyche. No samples will be coming back. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA spacecraft launched to mysterious and rare metal asteroid in first mission of its kind,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Psyche spacecraft rocketed away Friday on a six-year journey to a rare metal-covered asteroid. Most asteroids tend to be rocky or icy, and this is the first exploration of a metal world. Scientists believe it may be the battered remains of an early planets core, and could shed light on the inaccessible centers of Earth and other rocky planets. SpaceX launched the spacecraft into an overcast midmorning sky from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. Named for the asteroid its chasing, Psyche should reach the huge, potato-shaped object in 2029. Its so thrilling, said Laurie Leshin, director of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Added Arizona State Universitys Jim Bell, part of the Psyche team: What a great ride so far. An hour later, the spacecraft separated successfully from the rockets upper stage and floated away, drawing applause from ground controllers. After decades of visiting faraway worlds of rock, ice and gas, NASA is psyched to pursue one coated in metal. Of the nine or so metal-rich asteroids discovered so far, Psyche is the biggest, orbiting the sun in the outer portion of the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter alongside millions of other space rocks. It was discovered in 1852 and named after Greek mythologys captivating goddess of the soul. Its long been humans dream to go to the metal core of our Earth. I mean, ask Jules Verne, lead scientist Lindy Elkins-Tanton of Arizona State University said ahead of the launch.  
        
     The pressure is too high. The temperature is too high. The technology is impossible, she said. But theres one way in our solar system that we can look at a metal core and that is by going to this asteroid. Astronomers know from radar and other observations that the asteroid is big  about 144 miles (232 kilometers) across at its widest and 173 miles (280 kilometers) long. They believe its brimming with iron, nickel and other metals, and quite possibly silicates, with a dull, predominantly gray surface likely covered with fine metal grains from cosmic impacts. Otherwise, its a speck of light in the night sky, full of mystery until the spacecraft reaches it after traveling more than 2 billion miles (3.6 billion kilometers). Scientists envision spiky metal craters, huge metal cliffs and metal-encrusted eroded lava flows greenish-yellow from sulfur  almost certain to be completely wrong, according to Elkins-Tanton. Its also possible that trace amounts of gold, silver, platinum or iridium  iron-loving elements  could be dissolved in the asteroids iron and nickel, she said.  Theres a very good chance that its going to be outside of our imaginings, and that is my fondest hope, she said. Believed to be a planetary building block from the solar systems formation 4.5 billion years ago, the asteroid can help answer such fundamental questions as how did life arise on Earth and what makes our planet habitable, according to Elkins-Tanton. On Earth, the planets iron core is responsible for the magnetic field that shields our atmosphere and enables life. Led by Arizona State University on NASAs behalf, the $1.2 billion mission will use a roundabout route to get to the asteroid. The van-size spacecraft with solar panels big enough to fill a tennis court will swoop past Mars for a gravity boost in 2026. Three years later, it will reach the asteroid and attempt to go into orbit around it, circling as high as 440 miles (700 kilometers) and as close as 47 miles (75 kilometers) until at least 2031. The spacecraft relies on solar electric propulsion, using xenon gas-fed thrusters and their gentle blue-glowing pulses. An experimental communication system is also along for the ride, using lasers instead of radio waves in an attempt to expand the flow of data from deep space to Earth. NASA expects the test to yield more than 10 times the amount of data, enough to transmit videos from the moon or Mars one day. The spacecraft should have soared a year ago, but was held up by delays in flight software testing attributed to poor management and other issues. The revised schedule added extra travel time. So instead of arriving at the asteroid in 2026 as originally planned, the spacecraft wont get there until 2029. Thats the same year that another NASA spacecraft  the one that just returned asteroid samples to the Utah desert  will arrive at a different space rock as it buzzes Earth. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASAs Lucy spacecraft swoops past first of 10 asteroids on long journey to Jupiter,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Lucy spacecraft on Wednesday encountered the first of 10 asteroids on its long journey to Jupiter.  The spacecraft on Wednesday swooped past the pint-sized Dinkinesh, about 300 million miles (480 million kilometers) away in the main asteroid belt beyond Mars. It was a quick hello, according to NASA, with the spacecraft zooming by at 10,000 mph (16,000 kph). Lucy came within 270 miles (435 kilometers) of Dinkinesh, testing its instruments in a dry run for the bigger and more alluring asteroids ahead. Dinkinesh is just a half-mile (1 kilometer) across, quite possibly the smallest of the space rocks on Lucys tour.  Lucys main targets are the so-called Trojans, swarms of unexplored asteroids out near Jupiter that are considered to be time capsules from the dawn of the solar system. The spacecraft will swing past eight Trojans believed to be up to 10 to 100 times bigger than Dinkinesh. Its due to zip past the final two asteroids in 2033.  NASA launched Lucy on its nearly $1 billion mission two years ago. The spacecraft is named after the 3.2 million-year-old skeletal remains of a human ancestor found in Ethiopia in the 1970s. Lucy will next swing past an asteroid named after one of the fossil Lucys discoverers: Donald Johanson. One of two solar wings on the spacecraft remains loose. Flight controllers gave up trying to latch it down, but it is believed to be stable enough for the entire mission. 
        
     Wednesdays flyby caps what NASA is calling Asteroid Autumn. NASA returned its first samples of rubble from an asteroid in September. Then in October, it launched a spacecraft to a rare, metal-rich asteroid named Psyche. Unlike those missions, Lucy will not stop at any asteroids or collect any samples. It will take at least a week for the spacecraft to send back all its pictures and data from the flyby. Until now, Dinkineshs only been an unresolved smudge in the best telescopes, Southwest Research Institutes Hal Levison, the lead scientist, said in a statement.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Gazas limited water supply raises concerns for human health,"NEW YORK (AP)  A lack of clean water in the Gaza Strip is raising major concerns for human health. Gaza is running out of water, and Gaza is running out of life, said Philippe Lazzarini, chief of the U.N. agency for Palestinians. Gaza normally gets its water supplies from a combination of sources, including a pipeline from Israel, desalination plants on the Mediterranean Sea and wells. Those supplies were slashed when Israel cut off water, along with the fuel and electricity that power water and sewage plants, in the wake of the Hamas attacks. The United Nations recognizes access to water as a human right, and on a basic level, the human body needs a constant supply of water to survive. Next to air, water is really the most important thing for maintenance of your health, said Dr. Tsion Firew, an emergency physician at Columbia University who has worked on water access in humanitarian settings.  A report from the U.S. National Academies of Science and Medicine says men need to drink about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) and women need about 2.7 liters (91 ounces) per day to be adequately hydrated. Most of that comes from drinking water or beverages, and about 20% from food, including fruits. Many people cant survive more than a few days without water, Firew said  especially vulnerable groups like children, the elderly and those with health conditions. Dehydration can cause dizziness, fatigue and confusion and in severe cases lead to organ failure and death. 
        
     Water access is also crucial for sanitation, and a lack of clean water can lead to the spread of infections like cholera and dysentery. Diarrheal diseases that can be spread by unclean water are the leading cause of death for children under 5 across the world, Firew said. Health care settings are a particular concern as they rely on clean water to care for patients who are sick and injured. As hospitals across the Gaza Strip struggle to care for thousands of patients, the World Health Organization said the lack of water is putting lives in danger. Water is needed to ensure sanitary conditions on inpatient wards, in operation rooms, and emergency departments. It is essential for the prevention of hospital associated infections and for the prevention of outbreaks in hospitals, the WHO said in a statement. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA spacecraft discovers tiny moon around asteroid during close flyby,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The little asteroid visited by NASAs Lucy spacecraft this week had a big surprise for scientists. It turns out that the asteroid Dinkinesh has a dinky sidekick  a mini moon.  The discovery was made during Wednesdays flyby of Dinkinesh, 300 million miles (480 million kilometers) away in the main asteroid belt beyond Mars. The spacecraft snapped a picture of the pair when it was about 270 miles out (435 kilometers). In data and images beamed back to Earth, the spacecraft confirmed that Dinkinesh is barely a half-mile (790 meters) across. Its closely circling moon is a mere one-tenth-of-a-mile (220 meters) in size.  NASA sent Lucy past Dinkinesh as a rehearsal for the bigger, more mysterious asteroids out near Jupiter. Launched in 2021, the spacecraft will reach the first of these so-called Trojan asteroids in 2027 and explore them for at least six years. The original target list of seven asteroids now stands at 11. Dinkinesh means you are marvelous in the Amharic language of Ethiopia. Its also the Amharic name for Lucy, the 3.2 million-year-old remains of a human ancestor found in Ethiopia in the 1970s, for which the spacecraft is named. Dinkinesh really did live up to its name; this is marvelous, Southwest Research Institutes Hal Levison, the lead scientist, said in a statement. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Birds in North America will be renamed to avoid any harmful historical associations with people,"Birds in North America will no longer be named after people, the American Ornithological Society announced Wednesday.  Next year, the organization will begin to rename around 80 species found in the U.S. and Canada.  There is power in a name, and some English bird names have associations with the past that continue to be exclusionary and harmful today, the organizations president, Colleen Handel, said in a statement. Everyone who loves and cares about birds should be able to enjoy and study them freely. Rather than review each bird named after a person individually, all such birds will be renamed, the organization announced.  Birds that will be renamed include those currently called Wilsons warbler and Wilsons snipe, both named after the 19th century naturalist Alexander Wilson. Audubons shearwater, a seabird named for John James Audubon, also will get a new name. In 2020, the organization renamed a bird once referring to a Confederate Army general, John P. McCown, as the thick-billed longspur. Im really happy and excited about the announcement, said Emily Williams, an ornithologist at Georgetown University who was not involved in the decision.  She said heated discussions over bird names have been happening within birdwatching communities for the past several years.  Naming birds based on habitat or appearance is one of the least problematic approaches, she said. 
        
     Earlier this year, the National Audubon Society announced that it would retain its name, even as critics and some voices within the organization have argued that it should dump the association with a man, John James Audubon, whose family owned slaves.  The name has come to represent so much more than the work of one person, Susan Bell, chair of the National Audubon Societys Board of Directors, told Audubon magazine in March, adding, We must reckon with the racist legacy of John James Audubon. A 2020 encounter in New Yorks Central Park served as a public wake-up call about the discrimination that Black people sometimes face when trying to enjoy the outdoors.  Christian Cooper, a Black birdwatcher, was looking for birds when he asked a white woman, Amy Cooper, to follow local rules and leash her dog. Cooper called 911 and was later charged with filing a false police report, though the charges were later dropped. Soon after, a collective of birdwatchers organized the first Black Birders Week to increase the visibility of Black nature lovers and scientists.  And a group called Bird Names for Birds sent a petition to the ornithological society urging it to outline a plan to change harmful common names of birds. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Oldest black hole discovered dating back to 470 million years after the Big Bang,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Scientists have discovered the oldest black hole yet, a cosmic beast formed a mere 470 million years after the Big Bang.  The findings, published Monday, confirm what until now were theories that supermassive black holes existed at the dawn of the universe. NASAs James Webb Space Telescope and Chandra X-Ray Observatory teamed up over the past year to make the observations.  Given the universe is 13.7 billion years old, that puts the age of this black hole at 13.2 billion years. Even more astounding to scientists, this black hole is a whopper  10 times bigger than the black hole in our own Milky Way.  Its believed to weigh anywhere from 10% to 100% the mass of all the stars in its galaxy, said lead author Akos Bogdan of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. That is nowhere near the miniscule ratio of the black holes in our Milky Way and other nearby galaxies  an estimated 0.1%, he noted. Its just really early on in the universe to be such a behemoth, said Yale Universitys Priyamvada Natarajan, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy. A companion article appeared in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Its astounding how this thing actually is sitting in place already with its galaxy so early on in the universe. The researchers believe the black hole formed from colossal clouds of gas that collapsed in a galaxy next door to one with stars. The two galaxies merged, and the black hole took over. 
        
     The fact that Chandra detected it via X-ray confirms without a doubt that it is a black hole, according to Natarajan. With X-rays youre actually capturing the gas that is being gravitationally pulled into the black hole, sped up and it starts glowing in the X-rays, she said. This one is considered a quasar since its actively growing and the gas is blindingly bright, she added. The Webb telescope alone may have spotted a black hole that is 29 million years older, according to scientists, but its yet to be observed in X-rays and verified. Natarajan expects more early black holes will be found  perhaps not as far out, but still quite distant. We are expecting a new window to open in the universe, and I think this is the first crack, she said. The two space telescopes  Webb and Chandra  used a technique called gravitational lensing to magnify the region of space where this galaxy, UHZ1, and its black hole are located. The telescopes used the light from a much closer cluster of galaxies, a mere 3.2 billion light-years from Earth, to magnify UHZ1 and its black hole much farther in the background. Its a pretty faint object, and thanks to like luck, nature has magnified it for us, Natarajan said Launched in 2021 to a point 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, Webb is the biggest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever sent into space; it sees the universe in the infrared. The much older Chandra has X-ray vision; it rocketed into orbit in 1999. I absolutely find it amazing that Chandra can do such amazing discoveries 24 years after its launch, Bogdan said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Shimmering galaxies revealed in new photos by European space telescope,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Scientists on Tuesday unveiled the first pictures taken by the European space telescope Euclid, a shimmering and stunning collection of galaxies too numerous to count. The photos were revealed by the European Space Agency, four months after the telescope launched from Cape Canaveral.  Although these celestial landscapes have been observed before by the Hubble Space Telescope and others, Euclids snapshots provide razor-sharp astronomical images across such a large patch of the sky, and looking so far into the distant universe, the agency said.  In one picture, Euclid captured a group shot of 1,000 galaxies in a cluster 240 million light-years away, against a backdrop of more than 100,000 galaxies billions of light-years away. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. Dazzling, said the space agencys science director, Carole Mundell, as she showed off the galaxy cluster shot on a large screen at the control center in Germany.  Euclids instruments are sensitive enough to pick up the smallest galaxies, which were too faint to see until now. The results are crystal-clear and stunning images going back in cosmic time, Mundell said.  The telescope snapped pictures of a relatively close spiral galaxy that is a ringer for our own Milky Way. Although the Hubble Space Telescope previously observed the heart of this galaxy, Euclids shot reveals star formation across the entire region, scientists said. 
        
     Euclid also took fresh photos of the Horsehead Nebula in the constellation Orion, a dramatic nursery of baby stars made famous by Hubble. It took Euclid just an hour to capture the nebulas latest beauty shot; the five new photos accounted for less than a day of observing time. By measuring the shape and movement of galaxies as far as 10 billion light-years away, astronomers hope to learn more about the dark energy and matter that make up 95% of the universe.  The observatory will survey billions of galaxies over the next six years, creating the most comprehensive 3D map of the cosmos ever made. NASA is a partner in the $1.5 billion mission and supplied the telescopes infrared detectors.  Launched in July, Euclid orbits the sun some 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth. The telescope is named after the mathematician of ancient Greece. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Cheetahs become more nocturnal on hot days. Climate change may trigger fights among predators,"Cheetahs are usually daytime hunters, but the speedy big cats will shift their activity toward dawn and dusk hours during warmer weather, a new study finds. Unfortunately for endangered cheetahs, that sets them up for more potential conflicts with mostly nocturnal competing predators such as lions and leopards, say the authors of research published Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Changing temperatures can impact the behavior patterns of large carnivore species and also the dynamics among species, said University of Washington biologist Briana Abrahms, a study co-author. While cheetahs only eat fresh meat, lions and leopards will sometimes opportunistically scavenge from smaller predators. Lions and leopards normally kill prey themselves, but if they come across a cheetahs kill, they will try to take it, said Bettina Wachter, a behavioral biologist who leads the Cheetah Research Project at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research.  The cheetahs will not fight the larger cats, they will just leave, said Wachter, who is based in Namibia and was not involved in the study. Hunting at different times of the day is one long-evolved strategy to reduce encounters between the multiple predator species that share northern Botswanas mixed savannah and forest landscape. But the new study found that on the hottest days, when maximum daily temperatures soared to nearly 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), cheetahs became more nocturnal  increasing their overlapping hunting hours with rival big cats by 16%. 
        
     Theres a greater chance for more unfriendly encounters and less food for the cheetahs, said co-author Kasim Rafiq, a biologist at the University of Washington and the nonprofit Botswana Predator Conservation Trust. For the current study, researchers placed GPS tracking collars on 53 large carnivores  including cheetahs, lions, leopards and African wild dogs  and recorded their locations and hours of activity over eight years. They compared this data with maximum daily temperature records. While seasonal cycles explain most temperature fluctuations in the study window of 2011 to 2018, the scientists say the observed behavior changes offer a peek into the future of a warming world. In the next phase of research, the scientists plan to use audio-recording devices and accelerometers  like a Fitbit for big cats, said Rafiq  to document the frequency of encounters between large carnivores. In addition to competition with lions and leopards, cheetahs already face severe pressure from habitat fragmentation and conflict with humans. The fastest land animal, cheetahs are the rarest big cat in Africa, with fewer than 7,000 left in the wild.  These climate changes could become really critical if we look into the future  its predicted to become much warmer in this part of Africa where cheetahs live, in Botswana, Namibia and Zambia, said Wachter of the Cheetah Research Project. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

SpaceX will try again to launch its mega rocket into orbit after first attempt ended in an explosion,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX is aiming for another test flight of its mega rocket on Friday after getting final approval from federal regulators.   The first launch of Starship ended in an explosion minutes after lifting off from South Texas in April.  The Federal Aviation Administration issued its license Wednesday, noting that SpaceX has met safety, environmental and other requirements to launch again. Elon Musks rocket company said it was targeting Friday morning. After the self-destruct system blew up the rocket over the Gulf of Mexico, SpaceX made dozens of improvements to the nearly 400-foot (121-meter) rocket and to the launch pad, which ended up with a large crater beneath it. SpaceX has a $3 billion NASA contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface as early as 2025, using the spacecraft. A month ago, the FAA completed its safety review of the upcoming Starship launch. It needed more time to wrap up its environmental review. No one was injured in the first attempt, but the pad was heavily damaged as the rockets 33 main engines ignited at liftoff. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service later reported that concrete chunks, steel sheets and other objects were hurled thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) from the pad. It also said a plume of pulverized concrete sent material several miles (up to 10 kilometers) away. Wildlife and environmental groups sued the FAA over what they considered to be the FAAs failure to fully consider the environmental impacts of the Starship program near Boca Chica Beach. 
        
     Plans call for the test flight to last 1 /1/2 hours and fall short of a full orbit of Earth. The spacecraft would go eastward, passing over the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans before ditching near Hawaii. Nothing of value will be on board. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

SpaceX launched its giant new rocket but explosions end the second test flight,"SpaceX launched its mega rocket Starship but lost both the booster and the spacecraft in a pair of explosions minutes into Saturdays test flight.  The rocketship reached space following liftoff from South Texas before communication suddenly was lost. SpaceX officials said it appears the ships self-destruct system blew it up over the Gulf of Mexico.  Minutes earlier, the separated booster had exploded over the gulf. By then, though, its job was done.  Saturdays demo lasted eight or so minutes, about twice as long as the first test in April, which also ended in an explosion. The latest flight came to an end as the ships six engines were almost done firing to put it on an around-the-world path. At nearly 400 feet (121 meters), Starship is the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built, with the goal of ferrying people to the moon and Mars. 
        
     The real topping on the cake today, that successful liftoff, said SpaceX commentator John Insprucker, noting that all 33 booster engines fired as designed, unlike last time. The booster also separated seamlessly from the spaceship, which reached an altitude of 92 miles (148 kilometers).

SpaceX founder Elon Musk watched from behind launch controllers at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border, near Boca Chica Beach. At company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, employees cheered as Starship soared at daybreak. The room grew quiet once it was clear that the spaceship had been destroyed. SpaceX had been aiming for an altitude of 150 miles (240 kilometers), just high enough to send the bullet-shaped spacecraft around the globe before ditching into the Pacific near Hawaii about 1 1/2 hours after liftoff, short of a full orbit.

The Federal Aviation Administration cleared the rocket for flight on Wednesday, after confirming that all safety and environmental concerns had been met. After Saturdays launch, the FAA said no injuries or public damage had been reported and that an investigation was underway to determine what went wrong. SpaceX cannot launch another Starship until the review is complete and corrections made, the FAA added. NASA is counting on Starship to land astronauts on the moon by the end of 2025 or shortly thereafter. The space agency awarded SpaceX a $3 billion contract to make it happen, by transferring astronauts from its Orion capsule to Starship in lunar orbit before heading down to the surface.

New hardiness zone map will help US gardeners keep pace with climate change,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Southern staples like magnolia trees and camellias may now be able to grow without frost damage in once-frigid Boston.  The U.S. Department of Agricultures  plant hardiness zone map  was updated Wednesday for the first time in a decade, and it shows the impact that climate change will have on gardens and yards across the country.  Climate shifts arent even  the Midwest warmed more than the Southeast, for example. But the map will give new guidance to growers about which flowers, vegetables and shrubs are most likely to thrive in a particular region.  One key figure on the map is the lowest likely winter temperature in a given region, which is important for determining which plants may survive the season. Its calculated by averaging the lowest winter temperatures of the past 30 years. Across the lower 48 states, the lowest likely winter temperature overall is 2.5 degrees (1.4 degrees Celsius) warmer than when the last map was published in 2012, according to Chris Daly, a researcher at Oregon State Universitys PRISM Climate Group, which collaborates with the USDAs Agricultural Research Service to produce the map. Boston University plant ecologist Richard Primack, who was not involved in the map project, said: Half the U.S. has shifted to a slightly warmer climatic zone than it was 10 years ago. He called that a very striking finding. Primack said he has noticed changes in his own garden: The fig trees are now surviving without extensive steps to protect them from winter cold. He has also spotted camellias in a Boston botanical garden and southern magnolia trees surviving the past few winters without frost damage. These species are all generally associated with warmer, more southern climates. 
        
     Winter temperatures and nighttime temperatures are rising faster than daytime and summer temperatures, Primack said, which is why the lowest winter temperature is changing faster than the U.S. temperature overall. As the climate shifts, it can be tricky for plants  and growers  to keep up.  There are a lot of downsides to the warmer winter temperatures, too, said Theresa Crimmins, who studies climate change and growing seasons at the University of Arizona and was not involved in creating the map. When we dont have as cold winter temperatures, we dont have as severe die-backs of insects that carry diseases, like ticks and mosquitoes.  She added that hotter, drier summers in some regions may kill plants that once thrived there.  You wouldnt want to plant plants that arent adapted right now for where youre living, she said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Giving thanks isnt just a holiday tradition. Its part of how humans evolved,"NEW YORK (AP)  Its the season of giving thanks  and it turns out humans have been doing it for a long, long time. As more researchers dig into the science of gratitude, theyve found the feeling likely played a key role in helping our ancestors band together and survive.  That legacy continues today, as being in the mood for gratitude shapes who we are as a species and how we connect with the people around us. This is something that is part of our human DNA, said Sarah Schnitker, a psychologist at Baylor University. It is a glue, in a sense, that holds us together. Humans are social animals. Thats how weve lasted so long; not by being the biggest or the strongest, but by figuring out how to work together. A key part of building relationships is the idea of reciprocity: If you like me and do nice things for me, then I like you and do nice things for you, said Michael Tomasello, a developmental psychologist at Duke University. The animal kingdom has some parallel give-and-take behaviors, said Malini Suchak, an animal behavior researcher at Canisius University. In experiments with capuchin monkeys and chimpanzees, Suchak found the primates became more willing to help out a partner if that individual had helped them in the past.  Some scientists think the feeling of gratitude evolved to keep the helping exchanges going. In other words, if you were helped, youd feel like you should repay the debt with a good deed in return, said Jenae Nelson, who researches gratitude at Baylor and Harvard universities. 
        
     This give and take  this is very, very primal and very important to a cooperative society, Nelson said. Otherwise, you just get a culture of takers. In animals and in humans, these arent always one-to-one transactions. Sometimes, an ape that gets groomed by another will later back that partner up in a fight, Suchak said, showing that reciprocity might not be about keeping exact scores, but forming broader emotional ties.  Though we cant speak chimp well enough to know if theyre actually saying thanks, Suchak added, it makes sense that some form of this social debt showed up early in our lineage.  It didnt just pop out of nowhere when humans evolved, Suchak said. Thousands of years later, gratitude has taken root in humans.  Studies have found gratitude may show up in a few spots in our genes and brains  including ones linked to social bonding, feeling reward and seeing other peoples point of view. And the feeling emerges early on: Children as young as 2 and 3 demonstrate they want to return favors, said Amrisha Vaish, who studies moral development at the University of Virginia. At age 4, children also show a tendency to pay it forward, she added.  In a study, Vaish found that when kids got help completing a task  in this case, finding a key to unlock a box of stickers  they were more likely to share their sticker reward with a new person. Its that kind of behavior that shows gratitude is more than simple exchange, Schnitker said. It can make us more generous with other people in general  even if they didnt help us first. Giving thanks might be good for you, too: A 2016 study found that people who wrote letters of gratitude reported better mental health and saw changes in their brain activity  even months down the line. But Nelson pointed out that recognizing the giver, not just the gift, is key.  So, if Thanksgiving has you in a mood for gratitude, she suggested focusing on thanking the people in your life, rather than just making gratitude lists of the stuff you have. This is more in line with why the feeling evolved in the first place, she said.  Its not just about stuff and materialism, Nelson said. Its about relationships, and the things that people do for you, and then the things that you can in turn do back for other people. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

A six-planet solar system in perfect synchrony has been found in the Milky Way,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have discovered a rare in-sync solar system with six planets moving like a grand cosmic orchestra, untouched by outside forces since their birth billions of years ago. The find, announced Wednesday, can help explain how solar systems across the Milky Way galaxy came to be. This one is 100 light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. A pair of planet-hunting satellites  NASAs Tess and the European Space Agencys Cheops  teamed up for the observations. None of the planets in perfect synchrony are within the stars so-called habitable zone, which means little if any likelihood of life, at least as we know it. Here we have a golden target for comparison, said Adrien Leleu of the University of Geneva, who was part of an international team that published the results in the journal Nature.  This star, known as HD 110067, may have even more planets. The six found so far are roughly two to three times the size of Earth, but with densities closer to the gas giants in our own solar system. Their orbits range from nine to 54 days, putting them closer to their star than Venus is to the sun and making them exceedingly hot. As gas planets, theyre believed to have solid cores made of rock, metal or ice, enveloped by thick layers of hydrogen, according to the scientists. More observations are needed to determine whats in their atmospheres.  This solar system is unique because all six planets move similar to a perfectly synchronized symphony, scientists said. In technical terms, its known as resonance thats precise, very orderly, said co-author Enric Palle of the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands.  This illustration provided by the European Space Agency shows an artists rendering of the Cheops telescope in orbit above Earth. Astronomers have discovered six planets orbiting a bright nearby star in perfect rhythmic harmony. They say its a rare, frozen-in-time cosmic wonder that can help explain how solar systems across the galaxy came to be. The compact in-sync system, announced Wednesday, is 100 light-years away.

(European Space Agency via AP) The innermost planet completes three orbits for every two by its closest neighbor. Its the same for the second- and third-closest planets, and the third- and fourth-closest planets.  The two outermost planets complete an orbit in 41 and 54.7 days, resulting in four orbits for every three. The innermost planet, meanwhile, completes six orbits in exactly the time the outermost completes one. All solar systems, including our own, are thought to have started out like this one, according to the scientists. But its estimated only 1-in-100 systems have retained that synchrony, and ours isnt one of them. Giant planets can throw things off-kilter. So can meteor bombardments, close encounters with neighboring stars and other disturbances.  While astronomers know of 40 to 50 in-sync solar systems, none have as many planets in such perfect step or as bright a star as this one, Palle said.  The University of Berns Hugh Osborn, who was part of the team, was shocked and delighted when the orbital periods of this star systems planets came close to what scientists predicted. My jaw was on the floor, he said. That was a really nice moment. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Virgin Galactics first space tourists finally soar, an Olympian and a mother-daughter duo","TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP)  Virgin Galactic rocketed to the edge of space with its first tourists Thursday, a former British Olympian who bought his ticket 18 years ago and a mother-daughter duo from the Caribbean. The space plane glided back to a runway landing at Spaceport America in the New Mexico desert, after a brief flight that gave passengers a few minutes of weightlessness.  This first private customer flight had been delayed for years; its success means Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic can now start offering monthly rides, joining Jeff Bezos Blue Origin and Elon Musks SpaceX in the space tourism business. That was by far the most awesome thing Ive ever done in my life, said Jon Goodwin, who competed in canoeing in the 1972 Olympics. Goodwin, 80, was among the first to buy a Virgin Galactic ticket in 2005 and feared, after later being diagnosed with Parkinsons disease, that hed be out of luck. Since then hes climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and cycled back down, and said he hopes his spaceflight shows others with Parkinsons and other illnesses that it doesnt stop you doing things.  Ticket prices were $200,000 when Goodwin signed up. The cost is now $450,000. He was joined on the flight by sweepstakes winner Keisha Schahaff, 46, a health coach from Antigua, and her daughter, Anastatia Mayers, 18, a student at Scotlands University of Aberdeen. They high-fived and pumped their fists as the spaceport crowd cheered their return. 
        
     A childhood dream has come true, said Schahaff, who took pink Antiguan sand up with her. Added her daughter: I have no words. The only thought I had the whole time was Wow!  With the companys astronaut trainer and one of the two pilots, it marked the first time women outnumbered men on a spaceflight, four to two.  Cheers erupted from families and friends watching below when the crafts rocket motor fired after it was released from the twin-fuselage aircraft that had carried it aloft. The rocket ships portion of the flight lasted about 15 minutes and it reached 55 miles (88 kilometers) high.  It was Virgin Galactics seventh trip to space since 2018, but the first with a ticket-holder. Branson, the companys founder, hopped on board for the first full-size crew ride in 2021. Italian military and government researchers soared in June on the first commercial flight. About 800 people are currently on Virgin Galactics waiting list, according to the company. In contrast to Virgin Galactics plane-launched rocket ship, the capsules used by SpaceX and Blue Origin are fully automated and parachute back down. Like Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin aims for the fringes of space, quick ups-and-downs from West Texas. Blue Origin has launched 31 people so far, but flights are on hold following a rocket crash last fall. The capsule, carrying experiments but no passengers, landed intact. SpaceX, is the only private company flying customers all the way to orbit, charging a much heftier price, too: tens of millions of dollars per seat. Its already flown three private crews. NASA is its biggest customer, relying on SpaceX to ferry its astronauts to and from the International Space Station. since 2020. People have been taking on adventure travel for decades, the risks underscored by the recent implosion of the Titan submersible that killed five passengers on their way down to view the Titanic wreckage. Virgin Galactic suffered its own casualty in 2014 when its rocket plane broke apart during a test flight, killing one pilot. Yet space tourists are still lining up, ever since the first one rocketed into orbit in 2001 with the Russians. Branson, who lives in the British Virgin Islands, watched Thursdays flight from a party in Antigua. He was joined by the countrys prime minister, as well as Schahaffs mother and other relatives. Welcome to the club, he told the new spacefliers via X, formerly Twitter. Several months ago, Branson held a virtual lottery to establish a pecking order for the companys first 50 customers  dubbed the Founding Astronauts. Virgin Galactic said the group agreed Goodwin would go first, given his age and his Parkinsons. ___ This story has been updated to correct introductory price to $200,000, not $250,000. ___ Dunn reported from Cape Canaveral, Florida. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How a familys choice to donate a body for pig kidney research could help change transplants,"NEW YORK (AP)  Mary Miller-Duffy was dazed and grieving. Her brother suddenly collapsed and days later was brain-dead. Now she faced a tough question: Would she donate his body for research? Thats how the body of Maurice Mo Miller started its journey to a sunny corner of NYU Langone Healths intensive care unit  and became part of the quest to one day ease the nations transplant shortage with organs from animals. He always wanted to help people, said Miller-Duffy, who struggled with the choice but is proud of her brothers last act. This tragic death, this fast short death  something good has come out of it. Surgeons replaced Millers kidneys with one from a genetically modified pig on July 14. Then doctors and nurses cared for the deceased man like they would a living patient while anxiously ticking off the days. Remarkably, over a month later the new organ is performing all the bodily functions of a healthy kidney  the longest a pig kidney has ever worked in a person. Now the countdown is on to see if the kidney can last into September, a second month. The Associated Press got an inside look at the challenges of experiments with the dead that may help bring animal-to-human transplants closer to reality. ___ Getting an organ transplant today is a long shot. More than 100,000 people are on the national waiting list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting. Thousands more who could benefit arent even added to the list. 
        
     I had seven cardiac arrests before I even was sick enough to qualify for a new heart, said Dr. Robert Montgomery, chief of NYU Langones transplant institute. Hes a kidney transplant surgeon  and was lucky enough to get his own heart transplant in 2018. Filling the gap, hes convinced, will require using animal organs. Mary Miller-Duffy speaks with Dr. Robert Montgomery in the NYU Langone Health medical center in New York on Aug. 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Shelby Lum) Mary Miller-Duffy speaks with Dr. Robert Montgomery in the NYU Langone Health medical center in New York on Aug. 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Shelby Lum) After decades of failed attempts, now pigs genetically modified so their organs are more humanlike are renewing interest in so-called xenotransplantation. Last year, University of Maryland surgeons tried to save a dying man with a pig heart  and he survived for two months. Montgomery is getting more practice in the dead before taking a chance with a living patient. A handful of prior experiments at NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham have kept pig kidneys and hearts working in donated bodies for a few days to a week, avoiding the immediate rejection that doomed many earlier attempts. But the most common kind of organ rejection develops over a month. That pig heart in Maryland worked great for nearly 50 days until abruptly faltering. Watching how pig kidneys reach those timepoints in donated bodies could offer vital lessons  but how long could Montgomery expect a family to turn over their loved one? Im in awe of someone who can make a decision like that at, you know, one of the worst moments in their lives and really think about ... humanity, he said. ____ In Newburgh, New York, an ambulance had raced Miller to the hospital after he collapsed, a mass in his brain. He never woke up from the biopsy, brain-dead at just 57. Next steps were up to his sister, his closest relative. Miller-Duffy asked about donating his organs but he didnt qualify. That biopsy had found cancer.  Only then did the organ agency broach whole-body donation. Miller-Duffy wasnt familiar with that, but the goal of improving kidney transplants, that kind of struck a chord. Another brother had died of kidney disease as a toddler. Other relatives have kidney-damaging illnesses or even died on dialysis. Flipping through family photos, Miller-Duffy recalled how her brother would adopt animals and once took care of a terminally ill friend. Still, she had questions. This family photo provided in August 2023 shows siblings Maurice Mo Miller, left, and Mary Miller-Duffy as children playing with their Christmas gifts. (Courtesy Mary Miller-Duffy via AP) This family photo provided in August 2023 shows siblings Maurice Mo Miller, left, and Mary Miller-Duffy as children playing with their Christmas gifts. (Courtesy Mary Miller-Duffy via AP) In a video call, Montgomery explained the pig transplant to Miller-Duffy and her wife, Sue Duffy  and why it could make a difference. Montgomerys compassion won them over. His body is not being hurt, you know, Duffy said. Its just an incubation for the study to be done. ____ The experiment served as a rehearsal for one day operating in a living patient. Montgomery finished removing Millers own kidneys as a helicopter headed for the hospitals riverside landing pad. Drs. Jeffrey Stern and Adam Griesemer, fellow NYU surgeons, raced in kidneys theyd removed from a pig bred by Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor. Sewing a pig kidney into a donated body isnt much different than a regular transplant, Stern said. Post-surgery immune-suppressing drugs are standard, too. One twist: Tacked onto the pigs kidney was its thymus, a gland that trains immune cells  and thus might help protect the organ. Lots of extra steps come before and after surgery. First, what pig to use: Some have up to 10 genetic changes but Montgomery is betting one is enough  removal of a single porcine gene that triggers an immediate immune attack. While the pigs are housed in a germ-free facility, researchers performed extra testing for any hidden infection. Everyone in the operating room must have certain vaccinations and undergo blood tests of their own. Surgery over, doctors wheeled Millers body into the same ICU room where five years earlier Montgomery had recovered from his heart transplant. Next came more intense testing than living patients could tolerate. Every week doctors biopsy the kidney, putting samples under the microscope to spot any hints of rejection. Blood is continually monitored, the spleen got a peek, and nurses keep close watch that the body is being properly maintained on the ventilator. The first few weeks, Griesemer checked lab test results and vital signs multiple times a day: Youre like, OK, hopefully things are still good  but is this the day it starts to turn?  And theyre shipping biopsy samples to research partners across the country and as far away as France. Our staff doesnt sleep that much, said Elaina Weldon, a nurse practitioner who oversees the transplant research. But with each passing week, everybody is really now at the point of, what more can we do? How far can we push? Mary Miller-Duffy and her wife, Sue Duffy, leave the NYU Langone Health medical center in New York on Aug. 10, 2023. Research with her brother-in-laws body has changed Sues outlook on organ donation. Maybe I dont need all my organs when I go to heaven, she says. Before I was a hard no. ... Now Im a hard yes.

(AP Photo/Shelby Lum) She knows firsthand the huge interest: NYU quizzed community groups and religious leaders before embarking on research with donated bodies that might have sounded a little bit more on the sci-fi side of things. Instead, many people wanted to know how soon studies in the living could start, something the Food and Drug Administration will have to decide. Dozens have written Montgomery, eager to participate. ___ Montgomery regularly calls Miller-Duffy and her wife with updates, and invited them to NYU to meet the team. And as the studys initial one-month deadline approached, he had another ask: It was going so well, could they keep her brothers body for a second month? It meant further postponing plans for a memorial service but Miller-Duffy agreed. Her request: That she gets to be there when her brother is finally disconnected from the ventilator.  Whatever happens next, the experiment has changed Sue Duffys outlook on organ donation. Maybe I dont need all my organs when I go to heaven, she said. Before I was a hard no. ... Now Im a hard yes. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Fresh look at DNA from Oetzi the Iceman traces his roots to present day Turkey,"NEW YORK (AP)  Oetzi the Iceman has a new look. Decades after the famous glacier mummy was discovered in the Italian Alps, scientists have dug back into his DNA to paint a better picture of the ancient hunter. They determined that Oetzi was mostly descended from farmers from present day Turkey, and his head was balder and skin darker than what was initially thought, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Cell Genomics. Oetzi, who lived more than 5,000 years ago, was frozen into the ice after he was killed by an arrow to the back. His corpse was preserved as a natural mummy until 1991, when hikers found him along with some of his clothing and gear  including a copper ax, a longbow and a bearskin hat. Since then, many researchers have worked to uncover more about the mummy, which is displayed at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. An earlier draft of Oetzis genome was published in 2012. But ancient DNA research has advanced since then, so scientists decided to take another look at the icemans genes, explained study author Johannes Krause, a geneticist at Germanys Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. They used DNA extracted from the mummys hip bone. The updated genome is providing deeper insights into the history of this mummy, said Andreas Keller of Germanys Saarland University. Keller worked on the earlier version but was not involved with the latest study. 
        
     Based on the new genome, Oetzis appearance when he died around age 45 was much like the mummy looks today: Its dark and doesnt have much hair on it, said study author Albert Zink, head of the Institute for Mummy Studies at Eurac Research in Italy. Scientists previously thought the iceman was lighter-skinned and hairier in life, but that his mummified corpse had changed over time. His genome also showed an increased chance of obesity and diabetes, the researchers reported. And his ancestry suggests that he lived among an isolated population in the Alps, Zink said. Most Europeans today have a mix of genes from three groups: farmers from Anatolia, hunter-gatherers from the west and herders from the east. But 92% of Oetzis ancestry was from just the Anatolian farmers, without much mixing from the other groups. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Deep-sea hot tubs help octopus moms hatch their eggs faster,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Most octopuses lead solitary lives. So scientists were startled to find thousands of octopus huddled together, protecting their eggs at the bottom of the ocean off the central California coast. Now researchers may have solved the mystery of why these pearl octopus congregate: Heat seeping up from the base of an extinct underwater volcano helps their eggs hatch faster. There are clear advantages of basically sitting in this natural hot tub, said Janet Voight, an octopus biologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and co-author of the study, which was published Wednesday in Science Advances.  The researchers calculated that the heated nest location more than halved the time it took for eggs laid there to hatch  reducing the risk of being munched by snails, shrimp and other predators.  The nesting site, which the scientists dubbed an octopus garden, was first discovered in 2018 by researchers from the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and other institutions. The team used an underwater remote vehicle to film the throng of nearly 6,000 octopus nesting 2 miles deep. The octopus  about the size of a grapefruit  perched over their eggs laid on rocks heated by water seeping up from the sea floor.  It was completely incredible  we suddenly saw thousands of pearly-colored octopus, all upside down, with their legs up in the air and moving around. They were pushing away potential predators and turning over their eggs, for an even flow of water and oxygen, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration marine biologist Andrew DeVogelaere, a study co-author. 
        
     Only the hazy shimmer of escaping hot water meeting the frigid sea alerted the researchers to the hydrothermal seep. But they still didnt know exactly why the octopus had gathered there.  For three years, scientists monitored the site to understand the hatching cycle, recording both the developmental stage of eggs at 31 nests and the inevitable deaths of octopus moms.  After the hatchlings come out of the nest and swim off immediately into the dark, the mothers, who never left their nest and never appeared to feed during nesting, soon die, said James Barry, a biologist at the Monterey institute and co-author of the study. The researchers found that eggs at this site hatch after about 21 months  far shorter than the four years or more it takes for other known deep-sea octopus eggs.  Usually, colder water slows down metabolism and embryonic development and extends life span in the deep sea. But here in this spot, warmth appears to speed things up, said Adi Khen, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who was not involved in the study. Mike Vecchione, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist who was not involved in the study, praised the researchers tenacity to gather so much detailed data about such a remote location. Such octopus gardens may be widespread and really important in the deep sea, and we just previously knew very little about them, he said. Theres still so much to discover in the deep sea. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Loss of Antarctic ice hurting survival of emperor penguin chicks, study says","WASHINGTON (AP)  The loss of ice in one region of Antarctica last year likely resulted in none of the emperor penguin chicks surviving in four colonies, researchers reported Thursday.  Emperor penguins hatch their eggs and raise their chicks on the ice that forms around the continent each Antarctic winter and melts in the summer months. Researchers used satellite imagery to look at breeding colonies in a region near Antarcticas Bellingshausen Sea. The images showed no ice was left there in December during the Southern Hemispheres summer, as had occurred in 2021.  Researchers said it is likely that no chicks survived in four of the five breeding colonies they examined. Penguin chicks dont develop their adult waterproof feathers until close to the time they usually fledge, in late December or January, scientists say.  If the sea ice breaks up under them, the young chicks will drown or freeze to death, said Peter Fretwell, a researcher at the British Antarctic Survey and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment. Overall, the ice around Antarctica reached near record low levels last year. The researchers say that climate change will make such losses more frequent in the future. Fretwells team has also completed a preliminary analysis of known nesting sites  visible in satellite photos because of colored guano, or poop stains, left on white ice  across Antarctica, the only continent where the emperor penguin lives. There are about 300,000 breeding pairs left of the worlds largest penguins. 
        
     Of 62 known penguin colonies, around 30% were harmed by low sea-ice levels last year  and 13 likely failed entirely, Fretwell said. That this could happen doesnt shock me, but Im shocked that it has happened already. I thought it would be further down the line, said Daniel Zitterbart, a researcher who studies Antarctica for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, but was not involved in the new paper. If penguins arent successful breeding in one location, they may look for another site the next year, he said. While its possible for the population to recover from one or two bad breeding years, hes worried about the future. If you look further out down the line, how many suitable places will be left? he asked.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Launch of 4 astronauts to space station bumped to Saturday,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA and SpaceX halted the countdown late Thursday for the launch of four astronauts to the International Space Station. Mission managers rescheduled the liftoff for early Saturday morning, giving them an extra 24 hours to close out lingering issues, officials said. Nearly ideal weather was expected. The four astronauts, representing four countries, had not yet headed to the SpaceX Falcon rocket awaiting them on the pad.  They are expected to spend six months at the space station, replacing four astronauts who have been there for half a year. A NASA astronaut is leading the new crew, which includes a Japanese surgeon and Danish and Russian engineers.  Earlier Thursday, the station had to dodge a piece of space junk, just hours before a Russian supply ship showed up with a fresh delivery. The debris, a fragment from Chinas 2007 anti-satellite missile test, would have passed dangerously close if the stations orbit not been lowered. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

New crew for the space station launches with 4 astronauts from 4 countries,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four astronauts from four countries rocketed toward the International Space Station on Saturday. They should reach the orbiting lab in their SpaceX capsule Sunday, replacing four astronauts living up there since March. A NASA astronaut was joined on the predawn liftoff from Kennedy Space Center by fliers from Denmark, Japan and Russia. They clasped one anothers gloved hands upon reaching orbit. It was the first U.S. launch where every spacecraft seat was occupied by a different country  until now, NASA had always included two or three of its own on its SpaceX taxi flights. A fluke in timing led to the assignments, officials said. Were a united team with a common mission, NASAs Jasmin Moghbeli radioed from orbit. Added NASAs Ken Bowersox, space operations mission chief: Boy, what a beautiful launch ... and with four international crew members, really an exciting thing to see. Moghbeli, a Marine pilot serving as commander, is joined on the six-month mission by the European Space Agencys Andreas Mogensen, Japans Satoshi Furukawa and Russias Konstantin Borisov. To explore space, we need to do it together, the European Space Agencys director general, Josef Aschbacher, said minutes before liftoff. Space is really global, and international cooperation is key. The astronauts paths to space couldnt be more different. Moghbelis parents fled Iran during the 1979 revolution. Born in Germany and raised on New Yorks Long Island, she joined the Marines and flew attack helicopters in Afghanistan. The first-time space traveler hopes to show Iranian girls that they, too, can aim high. Belief in yourself is something really powerful, she said before the flight. 
        
     Mogensen worked on oil rigs off the West African coast after getting an engineering degree. He told people puzzled by his job choice that in the future we would need drillers in space like Bruce Willis character in the killer asteroid film Armageddon. Hes convinced the rig experience led to his selection as Denmarks first astronaut. Furukawa spent a decade as a surgeon before making Japans astronaut cut. Like Mogensen, hes visited the station before. Borisov, a space rookie, turned to engineering after studying business. He runs a freediving school in Moscow and judges the sport, in which divers shun oxygen tanks and hold their breath underwater. One of the perks of an international crew, they noted, is the food. Among the delicacies soaring: Persian herbed stew, Danish chocolate and Japanese mackerel.  SpaceXs first-stage booster returned to Cape Canaveral several minutes after liftoff, an extra treat for the thousands of spectators gathered in the early-morning darkness. Liftoff was delayed a day for additional data reviews of valves in the capsules life-support system. The countdown almost was halted again Saturday after a tiny fuel leak cropped up in the capsules thruster system. SpaceX engineers managed to verify the leak would pose no threat with barely two minutes remaining on the clock, said Benji Reed, the companys senior director for human spaceflight. Another NASA astronaut will launch to the station from Kazakhstan in mid-September under a barter agreement, along with two Russians. SpaceX has now launched eight crews for NASA. Boeing was hired at the same time nearly a decade ago, but has yet to fly astronauts. Its crew capsule is grounded until 2024 by parachute and other issues. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Rare blue supermoon brightens the night sky this week in the closest full moon of the year,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Stargazers are in for a double treat this week: a rare blue supermoon with Saturn peeking from behind. The cosmic curtain rises Wednesday night with the second full moon of the month, the reason its considered blue. Its dubbed a supermoon because its closer to Earth than usual, appearing especially big and bright. This will be the closest full moon of the year, just 222,043 miles (357,344 kilometers) or so away. Thats more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) closer than the Aug. 1 supermoon. As a bonus, Saturn will be visible as a bright point 5 degrees to the upper right of the moon at sunset in the east-southeastern sky, according to NASA. The ringed planet will appear to circle clockwise around the moon as the night wears on. If you missed the months first spectacle, better catch this one. There wont be another blue supermoon until 2037, according to Italian astronomer Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project. Clouds spoiled Masis attempt to livestream the supermoon rising earlier this month. Hes hoping for clearer skies this time so he can capture the blue supermoon shining above St. Peters Basilica at the Vatican. Weather permitting, observers dont need binoculars or telescopes  just their own eyes. said Masi.  Im always excited to admire the beauty of the night sky, he said, especially when it features a blue supermoon.

Rare blue supermoon dazzles stargazers around the globe,"A rare blue supermoon  the closest full moon of the year  dazzled stargazers Wednesday night. Saturn joined the celestial spectacle, visible alongside the moon, at least where skies were clear. It was the second full moon of August, thus the blue label.

NASA spacecraft around moon spots likely crash site of Russias lost lunar lander,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft around the moon has found the likely crash site of Russias lost lunar lander.  The Luna 25 lander slammed into the moon last month, a harsh end to Russias first moon mission in almost half a century. Based on observations by its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, NASA said Thursday that it appears the impact created a crater 33 feet (10 meters) across.  This fresh crater is about 250 miles (400 kilometers) short of the spacecrafts intended landing site at the lunar south pole, and farther north. NASAs spacecraft found no evidence of a crater in this spot in pictures taken during a flyover last year. Its located on the steep inner rim of an ancient and considerably larger crater. Since the newfound crater is close to where scientists believe Russias lunar lander crashed, it is likely to be from that mission, rather than a natural impactor, NASA said in a statement. Meanwhile, Indias rover is exploring the moons south polar region after successfully touching down a few days after Russias failure. India became only the fourth country to pull off a lunar landing. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

A 2nd Tommy John rehab could be tougher for Angels Shohei Ohtani. But its not a given,"NEW YORK (AP)  If Shohei Ohtani has a second Tommy John surgery, its possible his recovery might be more difficult than the first  but not a given. My first one, my rehab was pretty tough and I never felt 100%, Chicago Cubs pitcher Jameson Taillon said. People would come up to me and ask me, Hey, dude, what should I expect after getting Tommy John? Id be like: To never feel good ever again. My second one was just like a new arm. Ohtani tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow while pitching against Cincinnati on Aug. 26. The unprecedented two-way star is continuing to bat as a designated hitter but wont pitch again this year while considering his medical options. Now 29, Ohtani had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1, 2018, performed by Los Angeles Dodgers head team physician Neal ElAttrache. He returned to the Angels as a batter the following May 7 and to the mound on July 26, 2020, in a season delayed by the pandemic. He didnt retire a batter in his return, got just five outs on Aug. 2 and left with a strained forearm that kept him from pitching until 2021. Since then, hes gone 34-16 with a 2.84 ERA in 74 starts.  Combine that with his offense the last three seasons  a .278 average, 124 homers, 290 RBIs and 56 stolen bases entering Friday mostly as a designated hitter  and expectations before the injury were that the 2021 AL MVP could command a record $500 million-plus contract as a free agent this offseason. 
        
     If Ohtani has the surgery, he wouldnt pitch again until 2025 at the earliest. Recovery time for most pitchers ranges from 12 to 18 months, though positions players have returned quicker. Philadelphias Bryce Harper was back as a designated hitter in May, just 160 days after the operation. The UCL connects the humerus bone to ulna bone at the elbow. Doctors prefer to replace the torn ligament with an almaris longus tendon from the forearm. If that isnt available, a gracilus tendon removed from the knee is the No. 2 choice. A second surgery often is more complicated than a first, with recovery time impacted by scar tissues and bone spurs. Pitchers often can resume throwing in week 17 following their first Tommy John. New York Mets medical director Dr. David Altchek said after a second TJ surgery, throwing might be delayed until week 21 or even 41. What Ive seen is a big re-tear rate, said Altchek, who twice operated on Taillon and estimates he has performed 1,800 Tommy John surgeries since 1993. We think that some of the training methods may have something to do with it: The weighted balls. Im not against weighted balls. Weighted balls do definitely increase velocity, but they put a lot more pressure on the ligament. If I get to decide what my patients do, I dont want them to even go near throwing a weighted ball with any velocity for like a year and a half to two years after the surgery. Angels general manager Perry Minasian hasnt detailed the extent of the tear and said Ohtani and his agents were consulting medical experts. Theres a lot of information that we dont know yet that we will need to know before determining what kind of recovery process hes going to have to go through or whether or not a surgery will be needed, said Dr. Matthew Best, an orthopedic surgeon who is director of research at Johns Hopkins sports Medicine Division. A spreadsheet of Tommy John surgery patients compiled by baseball analyst Jon Roegele lists 2,345 procedures, starting with Tommy John himself on Sept. 25, 1974, through Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin on Friday. Roegele records 148 players who have had the procedure twice, including three times each for Jason Isringhausen, Jonny Venters, Ben Leeper and Corey Black. Its more complicated, said Yankees head team physician Christopher S. Ahmad of Columbia University. Theres issues with scar tissue. If there has been prior surgery to the ulnar nerve, that makes it more technically demanding on the surgeon because the nerve has to be dissected free again of scar tissue, moved out of the way, and then the reconstruction performed.  The exact placement of doing the surgery with tunnel creation, passing the graft becomes more challenging because the anatomy may be altered based on the prior surgery and the way that the healing has taken place. Having said all that, he added, revision Tommy John surgery is having more success than has been reported historically in the past. We used to say that Tommy John surgery done a second time may have a 50% success rate. Now the success rate is improving, 60, 70. Most prominent among those who have come back from a second TJ are Nathan Eovaldi and Taillon. Hyun Jin Ryu returned last month, Walker Buehler is nearing a comeback with the Dodgers, and Jacob deGrom had his second TJ operation in June. The assumption is that the new tissue, whatever you put in there, is going to heal slower because the environment has already been kind of mucked around with, Altchek said. ___ Freelance writer John Perrotto contributed to this report. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",https://apnews.com/article/ohtani-tommy-john-surgery-c608cd334a5aaadc48ff105cf95b0f39,science
Four astronauts return to Earth in SpaceX capsule to wrap up six-month station mission,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four astronauts returned to Earth early Monday after a six-month stay at the International Space Station.  Their SpaceX capsule parachuted into the Atlantic off the Florida coast. Returning were NASA astronauts Stephen Bowen and Warren Woody Hoburg, Russias Andrei Fedyaev and the United Arab Emirates Sultan al-Neyadi, the first person from the Arab world to spend an extended time in orbit.  Before departing the space station, they said they were craving hot showers, steaming cups of coffee and the ocean air since arriving in March. Their homecoming was delayed a day because of poor weather at the splashdown locations, but in the end, provided a spectacular middle-of-the-night show as the capsule streaked through the sky over Cape Canaveral toward a splashdown near Jacksonville. The astronauts said it was incredible to be back. Youve got a roomful of happy people here, SpaceX Mission Control radioed. SpaceX launched their replacements over a week ago.  Another crew switch will occur later this month with the long-awaited homecoming of two Russians and one American who have been up there an entire year. Their stay was doubled after their Soyuz capsule leaked all of its coolant and a new craft had to be launched. Between crew swaps, the space station is home to seven astronauts. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Farms with natural landscape features provide sanctuary for some Costa Rica rainforest birds,"Small farms with natural landscape features such as shade trees, hedgerows and tracts of intact forest provide a refuge for some tropical bird populations, according to an 18-year study in Costa Rica. For almost two decades, ornithologist James Zook has been collecting detailed records on nearly 430 tropical bird species found on small farms, plantations and undisturbed forests in the country. While birds thrive the most in undisturbed rainforests, Zook said some species usually found in forests can establish populations in diversified farms that partially mimic a natural forest environment. How you farm matters, said Nicholas Hendershot, a Stanford University ecologist and co-author of the study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In these diversified farms, you see growth over the long term in bird species with specialized needs, such as safe and shady nooks to build nests and a variety of food sources, Hendershot said.  That trend was in stark contrast to what we saw in intensive agriculture, or monocrop pineapple and banana plantations, he said. The findings may seem intuitive, but Natalia Ocampo-Penuela, a University of California, Santa Cruz conservation ecologist not involved in the study, said its extremely rare to have detailed long-term data from tropical regions to show that varied farming landscapes can sustain some forest bird populations. 
        
     With 18 years of data, you can show the species is persisting in that area, not simply passing by, she said. Three-quarters of the 305 species found in diversified farms showed stable or growing populations over the time of study. These include the collared aracari, a small toucan-like bird, with a yellow chest and enormous beak, as well as several members of the manakin family  small brightly colored forest birds known for elaborate courtship dances. Its a huge contribution to have documented that some birds arent just going there, but staying there and populations are growing, said Ruth Bennett, an ecologist at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, who was not involved in the research.  Still, such habitat sanctuaries dont offset overall population losses from the conversion of primary forests to plantations, the authors stressed. A pineapple plantation is like a bird desert here, said Zook. Increasingly, scientists say conserving species will require paying attention to landscapes with a human footprint  not just untouched areas. Modern conservation has to happen not only inside the fences of protected areas, but within agricultural areas and even urban areas, where theres potential habitat for at least some species, said the University of Californias Ocampo-Penuela. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Across the Northern Hemisphere, nows the time to catch a new comet before it vanishes for 400 years","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A newly discovered comet is swinging through our cosmic neighborhood for the first time in more than 400 years.  Stargazers across the Northern Hemisphere should catch a glimpse as soon as possible  either this week or early next  because it will be another 400 years before the wandering ice ball returns. The comet, which is kilometer-sized (1/2-mile), will sweep safely past Earth on Sept. 12, passing within 78 million miles (125 million kilometers).  Early risers should look toward the northeastern horizon about 1 1/2 hours before dawn  to be specific, less than 10 or so degrees above the horizon near the constellation Leo. The comet will brighten as it gets closer to the sun, but will drop lower in the sky, making it tricky to spot. Although visible to the naked eye, the comet is extremely faint.  So you really need a good pair of binoculars to pick it out and you also need to know where to look, said said Paul Chodas, manager of NASAs Center for Near-Earth Object Studies. The comet will come closest to the sun  closer than Mercury is  on about Sept. 17 before departing the solar system. Thats assuming it doesnt disintegrate when it buzzes the sun, though Chodas said its likely to survive its passage. Italian astronomer Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project, said in an email that the next week represents the last, feasible chances to see the comet from the Northern Hemisphere before its lost in the suns glare. 
        
     The comet looks amazing right now, with a long, highly structured tail, a joy to image with a telescope, he said. If it survives its brush with the sun, the comet should be visible in the Southern Hemisphere by the end of September, Masi said, sitting low on the horizon in the evening twilight.  Stargazers have been tracking the rare green comet ever since its discovery by an amateur Japanese astronomer in mid-August. The Nishimura comet now bears his name. Its unusual for an amateur to discover a comet these days, given all the professional sky surveys by powerful ground telescopes, Chodas said, adding, this is his third find, so good for him. The comet last visited about 430 years ago, Chodas said. Thats about a decade or two before Galileo invented the telescope. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"SpaceX cant launch its giant rocket again until fixes are made, FAA says","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX must take a series of steps before it can launch its mega rocket again after its debut ended in an explosion, federal regulators said Friday.  The Federal Aviation Administration said it closed its investigation into SpaceXs failed debut of Starship, the worlds biggest rocket. The agency is requiring SpaceX to take 63 corrective actions and to apply for a modified FAA license before launching again.  FAA official said multiple problems led to the April launch explosion, which sent pieces of concrete and metal hurtling for thousands of feet (meters) and created a plume of pulverized concrete that spread for miles (kilometers) around. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in the accidents aftermath that he improved the 394-foot (120-meter) rocket and strengthened the launch pad. A new Starship is on the redesigned pad, awaiting liftoff. It will fly empty, as before. During the initial test flight, the rocketship had to be destroyed after it tumbled out of control shortly after liftoff from Boca Chica Beach. The wreckage crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX said fuel leaks during ascent caused fires to erupt at the tail of the rocket, severing connection with the main flight computer and leading to a loss of control. That flight provided numerous lessons learned, the company said in a statement.  NASA wants to use Starship to land astronauts back on the moon in another few years. Musks ultimate goal is to build a fleet of Starships to carry people and supplies to Mars.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Special mosquitoes are being bred to fight dengue. How the old enemies are now becoming allies,"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP)  For decades, preventing dengue fever in Honduras has meant teaching people to fear mosquitoes and avoid their bites. Now, Hondurans are being educated about a potentially more effective way to control the disease  and it goes against everything theyve learned. Which explains why a dozen people cheered last month as Tegucigalpa resident Hector Enriquez held a glass jar filled with mosquitoes above his head, and then freed the buzzing insects into the air. Enriquez, a 52-year-old mason, had volunteered to help publicize a plan to suppress dengue by releasing millions of special mosquitoes in the Honduran capital. The mosquitoes Enriquez unleashed in his El Manchen neighborhood  an area rife with dengue  were bred by scientists to carry bacteria called Wolbachia that interrupt transmission of the disease. When these mosquitoes reproduce, they pass the bacteria to their offspring, reducing future outbreaks. 
        
     This emerging strategy for battling dengue was pioneered over the last decade by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, and it is being tested in more than a dozen countries. With more than half the worlds population at risk of contracting dengue, the World Health Organization is paying close attention to the mosquito releases in Honduras, and elsewhere, and it is poised to promote the strategy globally.

(AP Photo/Jaime Saldarriaga) In Honduras, where 10,000 people are known to be sickened by dengue each year, Doctors Without Borders is partnering with the mosquito program over the next six months to release close to 9 million mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia bacteria. There is a desperate need for new approaches, said Scott ONeill, founder of the mosquito program. Scientists have made great strides in recent decades in reducing the threat of mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria. But dengue is the exception: Its rate of infection keeps going up. Models estimate that around 400 million people across some 130 countries are infected each year with dengue. Mortality rates from dengue are low  an estimated 40,000 people die each year from it  but outbreaks can overwhelm health systems and force many people to miss work or school. When you come down with a case of dengue fever, its often akin to getting the worst case of influenza you can imagine, said Conor McMeniman, a mosquito researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Its commonly known as breakbone fever for a reason, McMeniman said. Traditional methods of preventing mosquito-borne illnesses havent been nearly as effective against dengue. The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that most commonly spread dengue have been resistant to insecticides, which have fleeting results even in the best-case scenario. And because dengue virus comes in four different forms, it is harder to control through vaccines. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are also a challenging foe because they are most active during the day  meaning thats when they bite  so bed nets arent much help against them. Because these mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet environments, and in dense cities, climate change and urbanization are expected to make the fight against dengue even harder.  We need better tools, said Raman Velayudhan, a researcher from the WHOs Global Neglected Tropical Diseases Program. Wolbachia is definitely a long-term, sustainable solution. Velayudhan and other experts from the WHO plan to publish a recommendation as early as this month to promote further testing of the Wolbachia strategy in other parts of the world.

(AP Photo/Elmer Martinez) The Wolbachia strategy has been decades in the making. The bacteria exist naturally in about 60% of insect species, just not in the Aedes aegypti mosquito. We worked for years on this, said ONeill, 61, who with help from his students in Australia eventually figured out how to transfer the bacteria from fruit flies into Aedes aegypti mosquito embryos by using microscopic glass needles.

Scientists are breeding the mosquitoes to carry the bacteria Wolbachia, which interrupts the transmission of dengue. (AP Photo/Jaime Saldarriaga) Around 40 years ago, scientists aimed to use Wolbachia in a different way: to drive down mosquito populations. Because male mosquitoes carrying the bacteria only produce offspring with females that also have it, scientists would release infected male mosquitoes into the wild to breed with uninfected females, whose eggs would not hatch. But along the way, ONeills team made a surprising discovery: Mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia didnt spread dengue  or other related diseases, including yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya. And since infected females pass Wolbachia to their offspring, they will eventually replace a local mosquito population with one that carries the virus-blocking bacteria. The replacement strategy has required a major shift in thinking about mosquito control, said Oliver Brady, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Everything in the past has been about killing mosquitoes, or at the very least, preventing mosquitoes from biting humans, Brady said. Since ONeills lab first tested the replacement strategy in Australia in 2011, the World Mosquito Program has run trials affecting 11 million people across 14 countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Fiji and Vietnam.

In 2019, a large-scale field trial in Indonesia showed a 76% drop in reported dengue cases after Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were released. Still, questions remain about whether the replacement strategy will be effective  and cost effective  on a global scale, ONeill said. The three-year Tegucigalpa trial will cost $900,000, or roughly $10 per person that Doctors Without Borders expects it to protect. Scientists arent yet sure how Wolbachia actually blocks viral transmission. And it isnt clear whether the bacteria will work equally well against all strains of the virus, or if some strains might become resistant over time, said Bobby Reiner, a mosquito researcher at the University of Washington. Its certainly not a one-and-done fix, forever guaranteed, Reiner said. A lab technician holds a male mosquito in the World Mosquito Programs factory, in Medellin, Colombia, Thursday, Aug. 10, 2023.

(AP Photo/Jaime Saldarriaga) Many of the worlds mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia were hatched in a warehouse in Medelln, Colombia, where the World Mosquito Program runs a factory that breeds 30 million of them per week. The factory imports dried mosquito eggs from different parts of the world to ensure the specially bred mosquitoes it eventually releases will have similar qualities to local populations, including resistance to insecticides, said Edgard Boqun, one of the Honduras project leaders working for Doctors Without Borders. The dried eggs are placed in water with powdered food. Once they hatch, they are allowed to breed with the mother colony  a lineage that carries Wolbachia and is made up of more females than males.

Caretakers ensure they have the best diet: Males get sugared water, while females bite into pouches of human blood kept at 97 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). We have the perfect conditions, the factorys coordinator, Marlene Salazar, said.

At half a dozen houses, they received permission to hang from tree branches glass jars containing water and a mosquito egg-filled capsule. After about 10 days, the mosquitoes would hatch and fly off. That same day, a dozen young workers from Doctors Without Borders fanned out across Northern Tegucigalpa on motorcycles carrying jars of the already hatched dengue-fighting mosquitoes and, at designated sites, released thousands of them into the breeze.

(AP Photo/Elmer Martinez) Because community engagement is key to the programs success, doctors and volunteers have spent the past six months educating neighborhood leaders, including influential gang members, to get their permission to work in areas under their control. Some of the most common questions from the community were about whether Wolbachia would harm people or the environment. Workers explained that any bites from the special mosquitoes or their offspring were harmless.

NASA says more science and less stigma are needed to understand UFOs,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA said Thursday that the study of UFOs will require new scientific techniques, including advanced satellites as well as a shift in how unidentified flying objects are perceived.  The space agency released the findings after a yearlong study into UFOs. In its 33-page report, an independent team commissioned by NASA cautioned that the negative perception surrounding UFOs poses an obstacle to collecting data. But officials said NASAs involvement should help reduce the stigma around what it calls UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena. We want to shift the conversation about UAPs from sensationalism to science, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. He promised an open and transparent approach. Officials stressed the panel found no evidence that UAPs had extraterrestrial origin. But Nelson acknowledged with billions of stars in billions of galaxies out there, another Earth could exist. If you ask me, do I believe theres life in a universe that is so vast that its hard for me to comprehend how big it is, my personal answer is yes, Nelson said at a news conference. His own scientists put the likelihood of life on another Earth-like planet at at least a trillion. When pressed by reporters on whether the U.S. or other governments are hiding aliens or otherworldly spaceships, Nelson said: Show me the evidence. NASA has said it doesnt actively search for unexplained sightings. But it operates a fleet of Earth-circling spacecraft that can help determine, for example, whether weather is behind a strange event.  
        
     The 16-member panel noted that artificial intelligence and machine learning are essential for identifying rare occurrences, including UFOs. NASA recently appointed a director of UAP research, but refused to divulge his identity at Thursday mornings news conference in hopes of avoiding the threats and harassment faced by panel members during the study.  Eight hours later, however, NASA said its Mark McInerney, who previously served as a liaison on the subject of UAPs between the space agency and the Defense Department. Hes also worked with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Hurricane Center. No top-secret files were accessed by the panels scientists, aviation and artificial intelligence experts, and retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, the first American to spend nearly a year in space. Instead, the group relied on unclassified data in an attempt to better understand unexplained sightings in the sky.  Officials said there are so few high-quality observations that no scientific conclusions can be drawn. Most events can be attributed to planes, drones, balloons or weather conditions, said panel chairman David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation, a scientific research group. The government refers to unexplained sightings as UAPs versus UFOs. NASA defines them as observations in the sky or elsewhere that cannot be readily identified or scientifically explained. The study was launched a year ago and cost under $100,000. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Pig kidney works a record 2 months in donated body, raising hope for animal-human transplants","NEW YORK (AP)  Dozens of doctors and nurses silently lined the hospital hallway in tribute: For a history-making two months, a pigs kidney worked normally inside the brain-dead man on the gurney rolling past them. The dramatic experiment came to an end Wednesday as surgeons at NYU Langone Health removed the pig kidney and returned the donated body of Maurice Mo Miller to his family for cremation. It marked the longest a genetically modified pig kidney has ever functioned inside a human, albeit a deceased one. And by pushing the boundaries of research with the dead, the scientists learned critical lessons theyre preparing to share with the Food and Drug Administration - in hopes of eventually testing pig kidneys in the living. Its a combination of excitement and relief, Dr. Robert Montgomery, the transplant surgeon who led the experiment, told The Associated Press. Two months is a lot to have a pig kidney in this good a condition. That gives you a lot of confidence for next attempts. Montgomery, himself a recipient of a heart transplant, sees animal-to-human transplants as crucial to ease the nations organ shortage. More than 100,000 people are on the national waiting list, most who need a kidney, and thousands will die waiting. So-called xenotransplantation attempts have failed for decades  the human immune system immediately destroyed foreign animal tissue. Whats new: Trying pigs genetically modified so their organs are more humanlike. 
        
     Some short experiments in deceased bodies avoided an immediate immune attack but shed no light on a more common form of rejection that can take a month to form. Last year, University of Maryland surgeons tried to save a dying man with a pig heart - but he survived only two months as the organ failed for reasons that arent completely clear. And the FDA gave Montgomerys team a list of questions about how pig organs really perform their jobs compared to human ones. Montgomery gambled that maintaining Millers body on a ventilator for two months to see how the pig kidney worked could answer some of those questions.  Im so proud of you, Millers sister, Mary Miller-Duffy, said in a tearful farewell at her brothers bedside this week.  Miller had collapsed and was declared brain-dead, unable to donate his organs because of cancer. After wrestling with the choice, Miller-Duffy donated the Newburgh, New York, mans body for the pig experiment. She recently got a card from a stranger in California whos awaiting a kidney transplant, thanking her for helping to move forward desperately needed research. This has been quite the journey, Miller-Duffy said as she and her wife Sue Duffy hugged Montgomerys team. On July 14, shortly before his 58th birthday, surgeons replaced Millers own kidneys with one pig kidney plus the animals thymus, a gland that trains immune cells. For the first month, the kidney worked with no signs of trouble.  But soon after, doctors measured a slight decrease in the amount of urine produced. A biopsy confirmed a subtle sign that rejection was beginning - giving doctors an opportunity to tell if it was treatable. Sure enough, the kidneys performance bounced back with a change in standard immune-suppressing medicines that patients use today. We are learning that this is actually doable, said NYU transplant immunologist Massimo Mangiola. The researchers checked off other FDA questions, including seeing no differences in how the pig kidney reacted to human hormones, excreted antibiotics or experienced medicine-related side effects. It looks beautiful, its exactly the way normal kidneys look, Dr. Jeffrey Stern said Wednesday after removing the pig kidney at the 61-day mark for closer examination. The next steps: Researchers took about 180 different tissue samples - from every major organ, lymph nodes, the digestive tract - to scour for any hints of problems due to the xenotransplant. Experiments in the deceased cannot predict that the organs will work the same in the living, cautioned Karen Maschke, a research scholar at the Hastings Center who is helping develop ethics and policy recommendations for xenotransplant clinical trials. But they can provide other valuable information, she said. That includes helping to tease out differences between pigs with up to 10 genetics changes that some research teams prefer  and those like Montgomery uses that have just a single change, removal of a gene that triggers an immediate immune attack. Why were doing this is because there are a lot of people that unfortunately die before having the opportunity of a second chance at life, said Mangiola, the immunologist. And we need to do something about it. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA spacecraft delivering biggest sample yet from an asteroid,"Planet Earth is about to receive a special delivery  the biggest sample yet from an asteroid.  A NASA spacecraft will fly by Earth on Sunday and drop off what is expected to be at least a cupful of rubble it grabbed from the asteroid Bennu, closing out a seven-year quest.  The sample capsule will parachute into the Utah desert as its mothership, the Osiris-Rex spacecraft, zooms off for an encounter with another asteroid. Scientists anticipate getting about a half pound (250 grams) of pebbles and dust, much more than the teaspoon or so brought back by Japan from two other asteroids. No other country has fetched pieces of asteroids, preserved time capsules from the dawn of our solar system that can help explain how Earth  and life  came to be. Sundays landing concludes a 4 billion-mile (6.2-billion-kilometer) journey highlighted by the rendezvous with the carbon-rich Bennu, a unique pogo stick-style touchdown and sample grab, a jammed lid that sent some of the stash spilling into space, and now the return of NASAs first asteroid samples. I ask myself how many heart-pounding moments can you have in one lifetime because I feel like I might be hitting my limit, said the University of Arizonas Dante Lauretta, the missions lead scientist. A brief look at the spacecraft and its cargo:  THE LONG JOURNEY Asteroid chaser Osiris-Rex blasted off on the $1 billion mission in 2016. It arrived at Bennu in 2018 and spent the next two years flying around the small spinning space rock and scouting out the best place to grab samples. Three years ago, the spacecraft swooped in and reached out with its 11-foot (3-meter) stick vacuum, momentarily touching the asteroids surface and sucking up dust and pebbles. The device pressed down with such force and grabbed so much that rocks became wedged around the rim of the lid. As samples drifted off into space, Lauretta and his team scrambled to get the remaining material into the capsule. The exact amount inside wont be known until the container is opened.  
        
     ASTEROID BENNU Discovered in 1999, Bennu is believed to be a remnant of a much larger asteroid that collided with another space rock. Its barely one-third of a mile (half a kilometer) wide, roughly the height of the Empire State Building, and its black rugged surface is packed with boulders. Roundish in shape like a spinning top, Bennu orbits the sun every 14 months, while rotating every four hours. Scientists believe Bennu holds leftovers from the solar systems formation 4.5 billion years ago. It may come dangerously close and strike Earth on Sept. 24, 2182  exactly 159 years after the asteroids first pieces arrive. Osiris-Rexs up-close study can help humanity figure out how to deflect Bennu if needed, Lauretta said. GAME DAY Osiris-Rex will release the sample capsule from 63,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) out, four hours before its due to touch down at the Defense Departments Utah Test and Training Range on Sunday morning. The release command will come from spacecraft builder Lockheed Martins control center in Colorado. Soon afterward, the mothership will steer away and take off to explore another asteroid. The capsule  nearly 3 feet wide (81 centimeters) and 1.6 feet tall (50 centimeters)  will hit the atmosphere at 27,650 mph (44,500 kph) for the final 13 minutes of descent remaining. The main parachute will slow the last mile (1.6 kilometers), allowing for a mild 11 mph (18 kph) touchdown. Once everything is deemed safe, the capsule will be hustled by helicopter to a makeshift clean lab at the range. The next morning, a plane will carry the sealed container full of rubble to Houston, home to NASAs Johnson Space Center. NASA is livestreaming the touchdown, set for around 10:55 a.m. EDT. CLEANER THAN CLEAN A new lab at Johnson will be limited to the Bennu rubble to avoid cross-contamination with other collections, said NASA curator Kevin Righter. Building 31 already holds the moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972, as well as comet dust and specks of solar wind collected during two previous missions and Mars meteorites found in Antarctica. The asteroid samples will be handled inside nitrogen-purging gloveboxes by staff in head-to-toe clean room suits. NASA plans a splashy public reveal of Bennus riches on Oct. 11. ASTEROID AUTUMN This fall is what NASA is calling Asteroid Autumn, with three asteroid missions marking major milestones. The Osiris-Rex touchdown will be followed by the launch of another asteroid hunter on Oct. 5. Both the NASA spacecraft and its target  a metal asteroid  are named Psyche. Then a month later, NASAs Lucy spacecraft will encounter its first asteroid since soaring from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2021. Lucy will swoop past Dinkinesh in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter on Nov. 1. Its a warmup for Lucys unprecedented tour of the so-called Trojans, swarms of asteroids that shadow Jupiter around the sun. Neither Psyche nor Lucy will collect souvenirs, nor will Osiris-Rex on its next assignment, to explore the asteroid Apophis in 2029.  OTHER SAMPLE RETURNS This is NASAs third sample return from deep space, not counting the hundreds of pounds (kilograms) of moon rocks gathered by the Apollo astronauts. The agencys first robotic sample grab ended with a bang in 2004. The capsule bearing solar wind particles slammed into the Utah desert and shattered, compromising the samples. Two years later, a U.S. capsule with comet dust landed intact. Japans first asteroid sample mission returned microscopic grains from asteroid Itokawa in 2010. Its second trip yielded about 5 grams  a teaspoon or so from the asteroid Ryugu in 2020. The Soviet Union transported moon samples to Earth during the 1970s, and China returned lunar material in 2020. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

DNA sucked into air filters can reveal what plants and animals are nearby,"NEW YORK (AP)  DNA is all around us  even in the air we breathe. Now scientists have found that air quality monitoring stations  which pull in air to test for pollution  also pick up lots of DNA that can reveal what plants and animals have been in the area. The method could help solve the tricky challenge of keeping tabs on biodiversity, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. The findings suggest that biodiversity data has been collected on massive scales literally for decades  and nobodys noticed, said study author Elizabeth Clare, a biologist at Canadas York University. As animals and plants go through their life cycles, they leave little bits of themselves in the environment  scales, fur, feathers, pollen  which carry their genetic signature. Scientists have long known that this kind of environmental DNA floats around in water, and have used it to track what species are swimming in lakes and rivers. But its been harder to get a genetic picture of whats roaming around on land, said Kristine Bohmann, who studies environmental DNA at the University of Copenhagen and was not involved with the latest study. In 2021, both Bohmann and Clare worked on similar projects to see whether they could pull animal DNA from thin air. After setting up vacuum pumps in local zoos, the teams were able to sequence DNA from dozens of species. You can actually, in a Ghostbuster kind of way, vacuum DNA out of the air, Bohmann said. 
        
     Then researchers wanted to try that on a bigger scale. For this latest study, Clare and her team tested air filters from two monitoring stations, one in London and one in Scotland, which are part of a national network to test for pollution. After extracting DNA from pieces of the filter disks, the scientists were able to identify more than 180 different kinds of plants and animals, said study author Joanne Littlefair, a biologist at Queen Mary University of London. The filters picked up on a wide range of wildlife, including grasses, fungi, deer, hedgehogs and songbirds  along with the ubiquitous pigeon, Littlefair said. Now, the team hopes that this method could track ecosystems all over the world. Even though biodiversity decline is a global issue, its hard to test for on a large scale, Clare said. And its an easy lift to use systems that are already in place, pointed out James Allerton, an air quality scientist at the UKs National Physical Laboratory. Many countries have networks set up to monitor air quality, and some of them store their old filters for years or even decades  an archive that could help show how ecosystems have changed over time. More research is needed to see if the data from these filters can show real biodiversity trends over time, said Fabian Roger, who has been working on a similar project at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. But its exciting that an existing system could be co-opted to monitor wildlife, he wrote in an email. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Small-brained ancient human cousins may have buried their dead, according to a surprising study","NEW YORK (AP)  An ancient human cousin may have buried its dead and carved symbols into cave walls, surprising findings for a creature with a small brain. Fossil remains of the species  named Homo naledi  were uncovered in underground caves in South Africa a decade ago. Now, researchers say theyve found evidence that the species was capable of complex behavior that so far has only been seen in those with bigger brains. We are facing a remarkable discovery here for a species with brains one-third the size of humans, said anthropologist Lee Berger, who led the research funded by the National Geographic Society, where he now works. Berger and colleagues describe their findings in studies posted online Monday. The research has not been peer-reviewed yet and some outside scientists think more evidence is needed to challenge what we know about how humans evolved their complex thinking. Theres still a lot to uncover, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonians Human Origins Program who was not involved in the research. H. naledi is a pretty new addition to the family tree of hominins, which includes our direct ancestors and other extinct relatives who walked on two legs. Berger and his team announced the species in 2015, after a tip from local spelunkers led them to the Rising Star cave system near Johannesburg where they uncovered fossils from at least 15 individuals who lived around 300,000 years ago. These creatures had some traits in common with modern humans, like legs made for walking upright and hands that could work with objects, said University of Wisconsin-Madison anthropologist John Hawks, a member of the research team. But other features looked more ancient, including their small brains. 
        
     In recent years, team members have ventured back into the caves, a tricky descent through tight underground spaces. Whats down there shows the species in a new light, they reported. One of the new studies describes what researchers say were intentional burial sites. The team uncovered fossil remains of adults and children in shallow holes in the ground, their bodies in a fetal position. Another study describes a series of marks carved into the cave walls, including geometric patterns and cross-hatched lines.  This is something that takes a lot of time and effort to do, said Berger, who led the initial research while at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. All of this behavior would be surprising for a creature whose brain was closer in size to an apes than a humans, experts said. Decades ago, we thought Homo sapiens were the only ones who could figure out how to use fire, bury their dead or create art, said Chris Stringer, a human evolution expert at Londons Natural History Museum who was not involved in the research.  Since then, weve learned that other groups like Neanderthals also lived complex lives. But those species still had big brains  unlike H. naledi, whose burials would raise further questions about human evolution, Stringer said. Scientists havent yet been able to identify how old the engravings are. So Potts said the current evidence cant say for sure whether H. naledi was truly the one to create the symbols, or if some other creature  maybe even H. sapiens  made its way down there at some point. For study author Agustin Fuentes, an anthropologist at Princeton University, the H. naledi evidence takes the focus off brain size. Big brains are still important, Fuentes said. They just dont explain what we thought they explained. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How to stay healthy as smoke spreads from Canada wildfires,"NEW YORK (AP)  Massive fires are burning up stretches of Canadian forests and sending plumes of smoke into the U.S. As a haze stretches over parts of the U.S., health authorities have raised the alarm about poor air quality. Heres how you can protect your health from the smoky haze. STAY INDOORS The small particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Its important to limit outdoor activities as much as possible to avoid breathing in these particles, health agencies say. You should especially avoid strenuous activities like going for a run, since heavy breathing will increase the amount of smoke you inhale. And bring pets inside too: Animals are also affected by smoky conditions. KEEP INSIDE AIR CLEAN When inside, keep doors, windows and fireplaces shut so that smoke stays out. If you have a portable air purifier or HVAC system, run it to help keep the air clean, the Environmental Protection Agency recommends. Check that your filters are high quality and up to date. Make sure any filters or air conditioners are set to recirculate indoor air to avoid bringing in smoke from outside. If you have a window air conditioner, check that its sealed to the window as tightly as possible. And try to avoid activities that would add more particles to the air in your home  like smoking, burning candles or frying meat. WEAR A MASK If you go outside in smoky conditions, consider wearing a mask, like an N95, to protect your lungs. The mask should fit over your nose and under your chin, and seal tightly to your face to keep out the smoky air. 
        
     KNOW YOUR RISK Some groups should be extra careful as they face higher risks from wildfire smoke. Children and older adults are especially sensitive to smoky conditions. Those with health conditions affecting the lungs or heart  like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  face higher risks from poor air quality, along with those who are pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People in these groups should take extra precautions and monitor for symptoms like coughing, trouble breathing or fatigue.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How safe is the air? Heres how to check and what the numbers mean,"NEW YORK (AP)  How can you check the air quality in your area and what do the numbers mean? The Environmental Protection Agency monitors the air around the country and compiles an air quality index, or AQI. Heres what to know about the index and how to keep tabs on your area, especially in U.S. regions dealing with smoke from Canadian wildfires. WHAT DOES THE AIR QUALITY INDEX MEASURE? The index rates how clean or polluted the air is each day. The EPA uses this measure to keep tabs on five kinds of air pollutants. The main concern from the wildfire smoke is fine particle pollution, or PM2.5. These particles are tiny enough to get deep into the lungs. They can cause short-term problems like coughing and itchy eyes, and in the long run, can affect the lungs and heart. WHAT DO THE NUMBERS AND COLORS MEAN? The index runs from zero to 500. The higher the number, the worse the air quality. That range is broken down into six color-coded categories. Green or yellow  in the zero to 100 range  the air is pretty clear. Once it gets up to orange, the air quality could be a concern for sensitive groups like kids, older adults or those with health conditions. In the red and purple zones, the air quality is considered unhealthy for everyone. And once it gets to maroon  at 301 or above  pollution levels are hazardous.  At these high levels, take precautions to avoid breathing in the dangerous air. That can mean reducing your outdoor activities, running air purifiers inside and wearing a well-fitting mask like an N95 when youre outside. 
        
     If you have to exert yourself, exert yourself less. Hydrate more, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, who studies environmental health at New York University. WHATS THE AIR LIKE IN MY AREA? Check AirNow.gov, which updates every hour. The site shows a real-time map of the air quality across the country and also includes a forecast for the day ahead. The map pulls in measurements from a network of air monitoring stations across the country. States and cities may also offer more local guidance. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Confidence in science fell in 2022 while political divides persisted, poll shows","NEW YORK (AP)  Confidence in the scientific community declined among U.S. adults in 2022, a major survey shows, driven by a partisan divide in views of both science and medicine that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Overall, 39% of U.S. adults said they had a great deal of confidence in the scientific community, down from 48% in 2018 and 2021. Thats according to the General Social Survey, a long-running poll conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago that has monitored Americans opinions on key topics since 1972. An additional 48% of adults in the latest survey reported only some confidence, while 13% reported hardly any, according to an analysis of the survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey showed low confidence levels among Republicans as partisan gaps that emerged during the pandemic era have stuck around, said Jennifer Benz, the centers deputy director. It doesnt look all that dramatic when you just look at the trends for the overall public, Benz said. But when you dig into that by peoples political affiliations, theres a really stark downturn and polarization. Between surveys in 2018 and 2021, as the pandemic took hold, the major parties trust levels headed in opposite directions. Democrats reported a growing level of confidence in science in 2021  perhaps as a rallying effect around things like COVID-19 vaccines and prevention measures, Benz said. At the same time, Republicans saw their confidence start to plummet. 
        
     In the 2022 survey, Democrats confidence fell back to around pre-pandemic levels, with 53% reporting a great deal of confidence compared with 55% in 2018. But Republicans confidence continued its downward trend, dropping to 22% from 45% in 2018. Confidence in medicine has also grown more polarized since 2018. That year, Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to say they had high confidence. By 2022, though, Republicans confidence had fallen to 26%, while Democrats has remained about the same as it was before the pandemic, at 42%. Overall, 34% of Americans reported a great deal of confidence in medicine in 2022, compared with 39% before the pandemic. Generally, scientists have had a high level of trust compared to other groups in the U.S., said John Besley, who studies public opinion about science at Michigan State University. And even with the latest declines, confidence in science is still higher than many other institutions, he pointed out. But the split between political parties is a cause for concern, experts said. You can definitely see the impact here of people taking cues from their political leaders, Benz said. For Sudip Parikh, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the drops were disappointing but not surprising. He sees them as part of an overall pulling apart of our communities and a loss of trust in many institutions. The latest survey found that distrust has grown for some other groups, too. According to the 2022 survey, confidence in the Supreme Court has plunged to its lowest level in at least 50 years. Americans also reported lower levels of trust in education, the press, major companies and organized religion. Besley said that scientists should communicate about their motives to help show that they are trustworthy: Not only do we have some expertise, but that also were using that expertise to try to make the world better, he said. Parikh thought the stakes are high for rebuilding trust in science  and doing so across political lines. Science must be bipartisan, he said. The causes of Alzheimers are the same whether youre a Republican or a Democrat. The fusion that goes on in the sun is the same whether you live in Topeka or you live in San Francisco. The General Social Survey has been conducted since 1972 by NORC at the University of Chicago. Sample sizes for each years survey vary from about 1,500 to about 4,000 adults, with margins of error falling between plus or minus 2 percentage points and plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The most recent survey was conducted May 5, 2022, through Dec. 20, 2022, and includes interviews with 3,544 American adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How search teams could use sound to find the Titan sub -- and why its a challenge,"Search teams racing to find the missing Titanic submersible have detected underwater noises in the area. But it wont be easy to find the source of that sound in the ocean. Its not a simple problem, said Matt Dzieciuch, an ocean acoustics expert at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The ocean is a noisy place, Dzieciuch said. There are many other potential sources of sound under water, including from fish, other animals and of course human-made instruments, he explained.  The Coast Guard said search teams heard banging noises at 30-minute intervals.  But its still speculative whether the banging noises were a true signal of life, said Art Trembanis, a marine scientist at the University of Delaware. Even this kind of pattern could come from an underwater instrument making repeated noise. Usually, an underwater vehicle will have a device called a pinger that can correspond with the surface and make it easier to locate, Dzieciuch said. But its unclear whether the Titan submersible was using one.  A big challenge is that the search team doesnt know exactly what kind of signal theyre looking for, said Lora Van Uffelen, an ocean engineering researcher at the University of Rhode Island. Theyre just kind of listening for anything, she said. Another challenge for the search team: Sound gets bent as it travels underwater, because of how pressure and temperature change at different depths, Dzieciuch said. This can create echo-like effects and make it hard to locate the source of a particular sound. 
        
     Someone tapping, say, an S.O.S. at the bottom of the ocean might sound like just some random banging at the surface of the ocean, he said. Its like shouting in a canyon. You cant really understand what the person at the other end of the canyon is saying. The sounds in the Titan search were picked up using devices called sonobuoys, which can be tossed out of airplanes to detect noises to avoid interference with ship sounds, Dzieciuch said. These devices could help triangulate the location of the sub, but searchers would need to deploy many buoys to make it work, experts said. But Van Uffelen said that despite the challenges, sound is one of the best hopes they have of finding it. Sound waves move farther underwater compared to on land, she said. And in the underwater environment, sound also travels farther than light, she pointed out  so its going to be easier to find it by listening than it would be by looking. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How to see 5 planets line up in the sky on Saturday morning,"NEW YORK (AP)  Wake up early this weekend to catch a celestial sight: Five planets will line up in the sky before sunrise on Saturday. Saturn, Neptune, Jupiter, Uranus and Mercury will appear together, weather permitting. Heres how to spot the planet parade. WHEN AND WHERE CAN I SEE THEM? For the best views, seek a spot with little light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Mercury will be the last to come into view, about an hour before sunrise. If you go outside at that time, youll be able to see all five planets stretching across the sky  from Mercury down by the horizon to Saturn higher up in the sky  until the sun rises. DO I NEED BINOCULARS OR A TELESCOPE? Some planets will be easier to spot than others. Jupiter and Saturn will be pretty bright and easiest to see. Mercury will be a little dimmer, though still possibly visible with the naked eye. To get a view of Neptune and Uranus, youll probably need to break out a pair of binoculars or a telescope. HOW COMMON IS THIS? There was another five-planet lineup in March, with a slightly different makeup. A three-planet alignment will happen in July. This happens when the planets orbits line them up on one side of the sun from Earths perspective. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Dolphin moms use baby talk to call to their young, recordings show","WASHINGTON (AP)  You know instantly when someone is speaking to an infant or small child. It turns out that dolphin mothers also use a kind of high-pitched baby talk. A study published Monday found that female bottlenose dolphins change their tone when addressing their calves. Researchers recorded the signature whistles of 19 mother dolphins in Florida, when accompanied by their young offspring and when swimming alone or with other adults.  Sound of recording of a wild dolphin whistling for its calf, from researchers who slowed down the audio by a factor of eight. The dolphin signature whistle is a unique and important signal  akin to calling out their own name.  They use these whistles to keep track of each other. Theyre periodically saying, Im here, Im here, said study co-author Laela Sayigh, a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution marine biologist in Massachusetts.  When directing the signal to their calves, the mothers whistle pitch is higher and her pitch range is greater than usual, according to the study published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That was true for every one of the moms in the study, all 19 of them, said biologist Peter Tyack, a study co-author from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Obtaining this data was no simple feat. Over more than three decades, scientists placed special microphones multiple times on the same wild dolphin mothers in Floridas Sarasota Bay to record their signature whistles. That included years when they had calves and when they didnt  dolphin calves stay with their mothers for an average of three years in Sarasota, and sometimes longer. Fathers dont play a prolonged role in parenting. 
        
     This is unprecedented, absolutely fantastic data, said Mauricio Cantor, an Oregon State University marine biologist who was not involved in the study. This study is the result of so much research effort.  Why people, dolphins or other creatures use baby talk isnt certain, but scientists believe it may help offspring learn to pronounce novel sounds. Research dating back to the 1980s suggests that human infants may pay more attention to speech with a greater pitch range. Female rhesus monkeys may alter their calls to attract and hold offsprings attention. And Zebra finches elevate their pitch and slow down their songs to address chicks, perhaps making it easier to learn birdsong.  For the dolphin study, the researchers focused solely on the signature call, so they dont know if dolphins also use baby talk for other exchanges  or whether it helps their offspring learn to talk as it seems to do with humans. It would make sense if there are similar adaptations in bottlenose dolphins  a long lived, highly acoustic species, where calves must learn to vocalize many sounds to communicate, said Frants Jensen, a behavioral ecologist at Denmarks Aarhus University and a study co-author. Another possible reason for using specific pitches is to catch the kids attention.

Saturns rings are glowing in Webb Space Telescopes latest cosmic shot,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Saturn has a fresh new look thanks to NASAs Webb Space Telescope.  The gas giant is dark in the latest photo by Webb, released Friday, but its icy rings are glowing.  Webb snapped the picture in the infrared last weekend. At this wavelength, the planet appears dark because sunlight is absorbed by methane in the atmosphere. But the icy rings remain bright.  Three of Saturns many moons also got caught on camera.  Scientists are thrilled with this latest shot, which captures Saturns atmosphere in detail. They hope to uncover new ring structures as well as any new, faint moons that might be lurking there. We look forward to digging into the deep exposures to see what discoveries may await, Matthew Tiscareno, a senior research scientist at the SETI Institute, said in a statement.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Scientists have finally heard the chorus of gravitational waves that ripple through the universe,"NEW YORK (AP)  Scientists have observed for the first time the faint ripples caused by the motion of black holes that are gently stretching and squeezing everything in the universe. They reported Wednesday that they were able to hear what are called low-frequency gravitational waves  changes in the fabric of the universe that are created by huge objects moving around and colliding in space.  Its really the first time that we have evidence of just this large-scale motion of everything in the universe, said Maura McLaughlin, co-director of NANOGrav, the research collaboration that published the results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Einstein predicted that when really heavy objects move through spacetime  the fabric of our universe  they create ripples that spread through that fabric. Scientists sometimes liken these ripples to the background music of the universe.  In 2015, scientists used an experiment called LIGO to detect gravitational waves for the first time and showed Einstein was right. But so far, those methods have only been able to catch waves at high frequencies, explained NANOGrav member Chiara Mingarelli, an astrophysicist at Yale University.  Those quick chirps come from specific moments when relatively small black holes and dead stars crash into each other, Mingarelli said.  In the latest research, scientists were searching for waves at much lower frequencies. These slow ripples can take years or even decades to cycle up and down, and probably come from some of the biggest objects in our universe: supermassive black holes billions of times the mass of our sun. 
        
     Galaxies across the universe are constantly colliding and merging together. As this happens, scientists believe the enormous black holes at the centers of these galaxies also come together and get locked into a dance before they finally collapse into each other, explained Szabolcs Marka, an astrophysicist at Columbia University who was not involved with the research. The black holes send off gravitational waves as they circle around in these pairings, known as binaries. Supermassive black hole binaries, slowly and calmly orbiting each other, are the tenors and bass of the cosmic opera, Marka said. No instruments on Earth could capture the ripples from these giants. So we had to build a detector that was roughly the size of the galaxy, said NANOGrav researcher Michael Lam of the SETI Institute. The results released this week included 15 years of data from NANOGrav, which has been using telescopes across North America to search for the waves. Other teams of gravitational wave hunters around the world also published studies, including in Europe, India, China and Australia. The scientists pointed telescopes at dead stars called pulsars, which send out flashes of radio waves as they spin around in space like lighthouses. These bursts are so regular that scientists know exactly when the radio waves are supposed to arrive on our planet  like a perfectly regular clock ticking away far out in space, said NANOGrav member Sarah Vigeland, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. But as gravitational waves warp the fabric of spacetime, they actually change the distance between Earth and these pulsars, throwing off that steady beat. By analyzing tiny changes in the ticking rate across different pulsars  with some pulses coming slightly early and others coming late  scientists could tell that gravitational waves were passing through. The NANOGrav team monitored 68 pulsars across the sky using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. Other teams found similar evidence from dozens of other pulsars, monitored with telescopes across the globe. So far, this method hasnt been able to trace where exactly these low-frequency waves are coming from, said Marc Kamionkowski, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the research.  Instead, its revealing the constant hum that is all around us  like when youre standing in the middle of a party, youll hear all of these people talking, but you wont hear anything in particular, Kamionkowski said. The background noise they found is louder than some scientists expected, Mingarelli said. This could mean that there are more, or bigger, black hole mergers happening out in space than we thought  or point to other sources of gravitational waves that could challenge our understanding of the universe. Researchers hope that continuing to study this kind of gravitational waves can help us learn more about the biggest objects in our universe. It could open new doors to cosmic archaeology that can track the history of black holes and galaxies merging all around us, Marka said. Were starting to open up this new window on the universe, Vigeland said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Hungry ticks can use this static trick to land on you and your pets,"NEW YORK (AP)  Hungry ticks have some slick tricks. They can zoom through the air using static electricity to latch onto people, pets and other animals, new research shows. Humans and animals naturally pick up static charges as they go about their days. And those charges are enough to give ticks a boost to their next blood meal, according to a study published Friday in the journal Current Biology. While the distance is tiny, its the equivalent of us jumping three or four flights of stairs in one go, said study author Sam England, an ecologist now at Berlins Natural History Museum. Ticks are ambush predators, explained Stephen Rich, a public health entomologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. They cant jump or fly onto their hosts, he said. Instead, they hang out on a branch or a blade of grass with their legs outstretched  a behavior known as questing  and wait for people or animals to pass by so they can grab on and bite.  It seemed that ticks were limited to how far they could stretch on their tippy toes, England said. But now, scientists are learning that static charges may help expand their reach. They can now actually end up latching onto hosts that dont make direct contact with them, he said.  The researchers looked at a species of tick called the castor bean tick, which is common across Europe. This bloodsucker and its cousins are major culprits in spreading diseases to animals and humans, including Lyme disease, and are most active in warm months. 
        
     Researchers found that when they charged up electrodes and placed them near young ticks, the creatures would whiz through the air to land on those electrodes. A normal level of static  the charge that fur, feathers, scales or clothes pick up with movement  could pull the critters across gaps of a fraction of an inch (a few millimeters or centimeters), according to the study. While those distances may seem small to us, for a tiny tick, they represent a big leap, England said. In the future, there might be ways developed to reduce that static, experts said. But for now, Rich said people should keep using classic tick prevention measures, including repellents, to keep themselves safe from bites. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

European telescope launched to hunt for clues to universes darkest secrets,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A European space telescope blasted off Saturday on a quest to explore the mysterious and invisible realm known as the dark universe. SpaceX launched the European Space Agencys Euclid observatory toward its ultimate destination 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away, the Webb Space Telescopes neighborhood. It will take a month to get there and another two months before it starts its ambitious six-year survey this fall. Flight controllers in Germany declared success nearly an hour into the flight, applauding and shouting Yes! as the telescope phoned home after a smooth liftoff.  Im so thrilled, Im so excited to see now this mission up in space, knowing it is on its way, the European Space Agencys director general, Josef Aschbacher, said from the Florida launch site. Named for antiquitys Greek mathematician, Euclid will scour billions of galaxies covering more than one-third of the sky. By pinpointing the location and shape of galaxies up to 10 billion light-years away  almost all the way back to the cosmos-creating Big Bang  scientists hope to glean insight into the dark energy and dark matter that make up most of the universe and keep it expanding. Scientists understand only 5 percent of the universe: stars, planets, us. The rest is still a mystery and an enigma, a huge frontier in modern physics that we hope this mission will actually help to push forward, the European Space Agencys science director, Carole Mundell, said just before liftoff. The telescopes highly anticipated 3D map of the cosmos will span both space and time in a bid to explain how the dark universe evolved and why its expansion is speeding up. 
        
     The lead scientist for the $1.5 billion mission (1.4 billion euros) said Euclid will measure dark energy and dark matter with unprecedented precision. Its more than a space telescope, Euclid. Its really a dark energy detector, Rene Laureijs noted. Fifteen feet (4.7 meters) tall and almost as wide, Euclid sports a 1.2-meter (4-foot) telescope and two scientific instruments capable of observing the cosmos in both visible light and the near infrared. A huge sunshield is designed to keep the sensitive systems at the properly frigid temperatures. NASA, which contributed Euclids infrared detectors, has its own mission coming up to better understand dark energy and dark matter: the Roman Space Telescope due to launch in 2027. The US-European Webb telescope can also join in this quest, officials said. Euclid was supposed to launch on a Russian rocket from French Guiana in South America, Europes main spaceport. The European and Russian space agencies cut ties following the invasion of Ukraine last year, and the telescope switched to a SpaceX ride from Cape Canaveral. Waiting for Europes next-generation, yet-to-fly Ariane rocket would have meant a two-year-plus delay, according to project manager Giuseppe Racca. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Lavish tomb in ancient Spain belonged to a woman, not a man, new research shows","WASHINGTON (AP)  When archaeologists first discovered the 5,000-year-old ornate tomb in Spain, they assumed it was for a man. It held a rock crystal dagger, ivory tusks and other lavish items. But now theyve determined the remains are those of a woman, and all it took was two teeth. The researchers used a new method of determining sex that analyzes tooth enamel. This technique, developed about five years ago, is more reliable than analyzing skeletal remains in poor condition, according to their study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. Most details about the life of the Ivory Lady, as researchers dubbed her, remain a mystery but there are some clues. She was buried alone in a tomb with very special artifacts, said Leonardo Garcia Sanjuan, a co-author and archaeologist at the University of Seville in Spain. That shows that she was a special person. The tomb is located a few miles west of Seville, near Spains southern coast, and was excavated in 2008. Archaeologists thought it contained a young man based on an examination of the poorly preserved bones and the fact that several precious items found in the tomb  including ostrich eggshells and amber along with the tusks and dagger  indicated that the individual held a high social status. The new technique detects differences in the chemistry of tooth enamel between males and females and can be used even when full DNA is not available. 
        
     This research provides one more piece of evidence questioning old historical narratives, said Alison Beach, an historian at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, who was not involved in the study. It shows that its not exclusively true that men have always been the most revered or held the most authority. Marta Cintas-Pena, a co-author and archaeologist at the University of Seville, maintains a database of Copper Age burials found at 21 different archaeological sites on the Iberian Peninsula, which includes Spain and Portugal. It currently has records for 1,723 individuals.  The Ivory Ladys burial stands out, head and shoulders, above everyone else  there is absolutely no known male or female burial that compares to hers, said Garcia Sanjuan. For around 250 years after the Ivory Ladys burial, newer graves were built around hers  but always with a 100-foot (30-meter) buffer zone, he said. And around 80 years after her death, people reentered her tomb and placed additional votive objects inside, including the crystal dagger. Researchers know little about the social or political structure of the society that she belonged to  which was roughly contemporaneous with the rise of the pharaohs in Egypts Nile River Valley and with the construction of the first planned city on the banks of the Euphrates in Mesopotamia. Katharina Rebay-Salisbury, a co-author and archaeologist at the University of Vienna in Austria, suspects the same misidentification might be true at other ancient tombs where researchers assumed, Oh, this is a rich and prominent person, it must be a male. Recently other researchers determined through DNA analysis that a decorated Viking warrior buried in Sweden was a woman, upending prior assumptions.  If we go back and test, we will get a few more surprises, Rebay-Salisbury said. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Webb Space Telescope spots most distant black hole yet. More may be lurking,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have discovered the most distant black hole yet using the Webb Space Telescope, but that record isnt expected to last.  The black hole is at the center of a galaxy dating to within a mere 570 million years of the Big Bang. Thats 100 million years closer to the beginning of the cosmos than a black hole identified in 2021 by a Chinese team using a telescope in Chile.  Webb already has spotted other black holes that appear to be even closer to the Big Bang nearly 14 billion years ago, but those findings are still under review, said University of Texas at Austin astronomer Steven Finkelstein, one of the lead researchers. The finding has been accepted for publication by the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Because the signals from this particular black hole are weak, more observations are needed, according to the Texas-led team.  There are untold numbers of dormant black holes, some even more distant than this one. But without any glowing gas, they are invisible, Finkelstein said. Detected in February, this particular one is active and actually puny as black holes go  equivalent to about 9 million times the mass of our sun. Thats close in size to the one in our own Milky Way galaxy, according to the team. Using Webb, the team also spotted two other small black holes from the early universe, dating to around 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The observations suggest that these downsized versions may have been more common as the cosmos took shape than previously thought.  
        
     There are probably many more hidden little monsters out there waiting to be found, Colby Colleges Dale Kocevski, who was part of the team, said in an email.

Pendants made from giant sloths suggest earlier arrival of people in the Americas,"New research suggests humans lived in South America at the same time as now extinct giant sloths, bolstering evidence that people arrived in the Americas earlier than once thought. Scientists analyzed triangular and teardrop-shaped pendants made of bony material from the sloths. They concluded that the carved and polished shapes and drilled holes were the work of deliberate craftsmanship. Dating of the ornaments and sediment at the Brazil site where they were found point to an age of 25,000 to 27,000 years ago, the researchers reported. Thats several thousand years before some earlier theories had suggested the first people arrived in the Americas, after migrating out from Africa and then Eurasia. We now have good evidence  together with other sites from South and North America  that we have to rethink our ideas about the migration of humans to the Americas, said Mirian Liza Alves Forancelli Pacheco, a study co-author and archaeologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil.  In the past decade, other research has challenged the conventional wisdom that people didnt reach the Americas until a few thousand years before rising sea levels covered the Bering land bridge between Russia and Alaska, perhaps around 15,000 years ago. The ornaments were discovered about 30 years ago at a rock shelter called Santa Elina in central Brazil. The new study is the first to analyze them extensively and rule out the possibility that humans had found and carved them thousands of years after the animals perished. 
        
     The team of researchers from Brazil, France and the United States said their analysis shows this handiwork was done within days to a few years after the animals had died, and before the materials had fossilized. The researchers also ruled out natural abrasion and other things that might explain the shapes and holes. They reported their findings Wednesday in Britains Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal. We think they were personal objects, possibly for personal adornment, said Thais Rabito Pansani, a co-author and paleontologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil.  Once among the largest creatures in South America, giant ground sloths were 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 meters) in length and usually walked on all four legs, using their sharp claws to dig burrows. They weighed more than a thousand pounds (450 kg) and their skin included bony structures under their fur  somewhat similar to the bony plates of modern armadillos. Two years ago, another team of researchers reported that fossilized human footprints found near White Sands, New Mexico, dated back to 21,000 to 23,000 years ago  though some researchers dispute these dates. Other evidence from Mexico suggests human presence around 26,000 years ago, and findings from Uruguay may suggest human occupation as much as 30,000 years ago. Jennifer Raff, an anthropological geneticist at the University of Kansas, who was not involved in the study, said the new paper was an important addition to the conversation, but like any findings on the topic, it may also draw pushback.  Still, the evidence from multiple sites forces scientists to rethink old assumptions that people arrived only in one great wave of migration over the Bering land bridge, said Briana Pobiner, a co-author and paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of Natural History in Washington.  Some may have died out, but its very likely that multiple waves of people came to Americas, she said. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Webb Space Telescope reveals moment of stellar birth, dramatic close-up of 50 baby stars","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Webb Space Telescope is marking one year of cosmic photographs with one of its best yet: the dramatic close-up of dozens of stars at the moment of birth. NASA unveiled the latest snapshot Wednesday, revealing 50 baby stars in a cloud complex 390 light-years away. A light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles (9.7 trillion kilometers). The region is relatively small and quiet yet full of illuminated gases, jets of hydrogen and even dense cocoons of dust with the delicate beginnings of even more stars. All of the young stars appear to be no bigger than our sun. Scientists said the breathtaking shot provides the best clarity yet of this brief phase of a stars life. Its like a glimpse of what our own system would have looked like billions of years ago when it was forming, NASA program scientist Eric Smith told The Associated Press. 
        
     Smith pointed out that the starlight visible in the image actually left there 390 years ago. On Earth in 1633, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei went on trial in Rome for saying that the Earth revolved around the sun. The Vatican in 1992 acknowledged Galileo was wronged.  The first anniversary image released Wednesday, July 12, 2023, by Space Telescope Science Institute Office of Public Outreach, shows NASAs James Webb Space Telescope displaying a star birth like its never been seen before, full of detailed, impressionistic texture. The subject is the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, the closest star-forming region to Earth.

The subject is the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, the closest star-forming region to Earth. (NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Klaus Pon via AP) This cloud complex, known as Rho Ophiuchi, is the closest star-forming region to Earth and is found in the sky near the border of the constellations Ophiuchus and Scorpius, the serpent-bearer and scorpion. With no stars in the foreground of the photo, NASA noted, the details stand out all the more. Some of the stars display shadows indicating possible planets in the making, according to NASA. It presents star birth as an impressionistic masterpiece, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a tweet.  Webb  the largest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever launched into space  has been churning out cosmic beauty shots for the past year. The first pictures from the $10 billion infrared telescope were unveiled last July, six months after its liftoff from French Guiana. Its considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, orbiting Earth for 33 years. A joint NASA-European Space Agency effort, Webb scans the universe from a more distant perch, 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away. Still ahead for Webb: Astronomers hope to behold the earliest stars and galaxies of the universe while scouring the cosmos for any hints of life on planets outside our solar system.  We havent found one of them yet, Smith said. But were still only one year into the mission. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Northern lights might be visible this week, but most of the US wont see them","NEW YORK (AP)  The northern lights could put on a show this week  though the audience will be much smaller than some early forecasts had suggested. The sky spectacle will be fairly typical: Stretches of Canada have a chance to spot the shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis, while a few in the U.S. could see a faint reddish glow on the horizon. Heres what to know about the updated predictions. An early forecast by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, suggested that the northern lights could be visible much farther south than usual this week. But that forecast was based on long-term predictions about the solar activity responsible for the display. Forecasts using more current data from NOAA predict nothing special for the U.S.  For the same reasons that its hard to predict weather on Earth, its hard to predict weather in space, said Northeastern University physicist Jonathan Blazek. In North America, the predictions show a broad stretch of Canada and Alaska could see the northern lights overhead Wednesday and Thursday. Those in small slices of the contiguous U.S.  including parts of Wisconsin, Michigan and Montana  could also get a peek. But for them the aurora will probably be a faint glow on the horizon, rather than a shimmering green curtain, said Lt. Bryan Brasher, a project manager for NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center. For those in range, seeking out clear, dark skies between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. will give the best chance to see the auroras colorful glow. 
        
     The northern lights happen when particles from the sun make their way toward Earth and collide with our planets atmosphere. The sun is constantly sending material our way in a stream known as the solar wind. These particles carry an electric charge, and when they bump into gases such as oxygen and nitrogen in the Earths atmosphere, they transfer some of their energy  like two billiard balls hitting each other, Brasher said. This puts the atoms and molecules in an excited state. They shake off some of that energy in the form of light, creating the colorful displays of greens, blues, pinks and reds. This solar wind is always flowing, but its levels can vary. There are solar storms where you get more particles than usual. Its windier than usual, Blazek said. Theres also periods when its fairly quiet. Its during those periods of stronger solar wind activity when we tend to see more auroras, Blazek explained. More solar particles can make the northern lights brighter and also push them down toward the equator  giving people farther south a view. Sometimes, the sun also shoots out huge amounts of plasma in whats known as a coronal mass ejection, Brasher said. If one of these outbursts hits Earth, even in a glancing blow, it can disturb our planets magnetic field and also cause shimmering auroras. Scientists are constantly monitoring the sun using telescopes on Earth and in space in part because space weather can impact radio communications, satellites, power grids and more, Brasher said. The sun spins on its axis once every 27 days. So, if scientists notice a spot with high activity, they might get a hint that it could come back around in a few weeks, he said. But conditions can change by the time the sun makes a full rotation. Even then, there are so many factors at play that it can be hard to be sure about whats to come. Generally, the suns activity is on the up-and-up as were heading toward a solar maximum in the next couple of years, Brasher said. So we may be seeing more solar storms soon  which will mean more northern lights. Everyone should stay tuned, because we probably have a lot more coming, Brasher said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Mammals may have hunted down dinosaurs for dinner, rare fossil suggests","NEW YORK (AP)  An unusual find in China suggests some early mammals may have hunted dinosaur for dinner.  The fossil shows a badgerlike creature chomping down on a small, beaked dinosaur, their skeletons intertwined. The find comes from a site known as Chinas Pompeii, where mud and debris from long-ago volcanoes buried creatures in their tracks.  It does seem like this is a prehistoric hunt, captured in stone, like a freeze frame, University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte, who was not involved with the study, said in an email. The fossil, described Tuesday in the journal Scientific Reports, shows two creatures from around 125 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period.  Even though the mammal is much smaller, researchers think it was attacking the dinosaur when they both got caught in the volcanic flow, said study author Jordan Mallon, a paleobiologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature. The mammal is perched on the dinosaur, its paws gripping the reptiles jaw and a hind limb while its teeth plunge into the ribcage. Ive never seen a fossil like this before, Mallon said.  That mammals ate dinosaur meat had been proposed before: another fossil showed a mammal died with dinosaur remains in its gut. But the new find also suggests that mammals may have actually preyed on dinosaurs several times their size, and didnt just scavenge ones that were already dead, Mallon said. 
        
     This turns the old story on its head, Brusatte said. Were used to thinking of the Age of Dinosaurs as a time when dinosaurs ruled the world, and the tiny mammals cowered in the shadows. The study authors acknowledged that there have been some fossil forgeries known from this part of the world, which Mallon said was a concern when they started their research. But after doing their own preparations of the skeletons and analyzing the rock samples, he said they were confident that the fossil  which was found by a farmer in 2012  was genuine, and would welcome other scientists to study the fossil as well. The mammal in the fossil duo is the meat-eating Repenomamus robustus, about the size of a house cat, Mallon said. The dinosaur  Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis  was about as big as a medium-sized dog with a parrotlike beak.  This species was a plant eater, but other dinosaurs were meat eaters or ate both. In the end, dinosaurs were probably still eating mammals more often than the other way around, Mallon said. And yet we now know that the mammals were able to fight back, at least at times, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

FAA gives OK for SpaceXs Starship test flight from Texas,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX has cleared the final hurdle for launching its new giant Starship from Texas as early as next week on a first test flight. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the long-awaited license on Friday. SpaceX announced that Starship  the worlds biggest and most powerful rocket  could soar as soon as Monday.  No people or satellites will be aboard the 394-foot (120-meter) rocket. SpaceX will attempt to send the spacecraft atop the colossal booster around the world, from the southern tip of Texas all the way to Hawaii. The first stage will be discarded in the Gulf of Mexico and the spacecraft into the Pacific. No landings will be attempted for this debut. It will be the first launch attempt of a full-size Starship, made of shiny stainless steel and powered by methane-fueled engines. The FAA said SpaceX had met all requirements, including safety and environmental. The license is valid for five years. We carefully analyzed the public safety risks during every stage of the mission and required SpaceX to mitigate those risks, the FAA added. Elon Musk envisions using Starships to send people to the moon and Mars. NASA has already signed up for a Starship to put astronauts on the lunar surface as early as 2025. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

What to know about 1st test flight of SpaceXs big Starship,"Elon Musks SpaceX is about to take its most daring leap yet with a round-the-world test flight of its mammoth Starship. Its the biggest and mightiest rocket ever built at 400 feet (120 meters), with the lofty goals of ferrying people to the moon and Mars. Mondays launch attempt was called off because of a stuck valve in the first-stage booster and there could be another try this week from South Texas. Musks company got the OK from the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday.  It will be the first launch with Starships two sections together. No one will be on on board. Early versions of the sci-fi-looking upper stage rocketed several miles into the stratosphere a few years back, crashing four times before finally landing upright in 2021. The towering first-stage rocket booster, dubbed Super Heavy, will soar for the first time. 
        
     For this demo, SpaceX wont attempt any landings of the rocket or the spacecraft. Everything will fall into the sea. Im not saying it will get to orbit, but I am guaranteeing excitement. It wont be boring, Musk promised at a Morgan Stanley conference last month. I think its got, I dont know, hopefully about a 50% chance of reaching orbit. Heres the rundown on Starships debut: SUPERSIZE ROCKET The stainless steel Starship has 33 main engines and 16.7 million pounds of thrust. All but two of the methane-fueled, first-stage engines ignited during a launch pad test in January  good enough to reach orbit, Musk noted. Given its muscle, Starship could lift as much as 250 tons and accommodate 100 people on a trip to Mars. The six-engine spacecraft accounts for 164 feet (50 meters) of its height. Musk anticipates using Starship to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit, including his own Starlinks for internet service, before strapping anyone in. Starship easily eclipses NASAs moon rockets  the Saturn V from the bygone Apollo era and the Space Launch System from the Artemis program that logged its first lunar trip late last year. It also outflanks the former Soviet Unions N1 moon rocket, which never made it past a minute into flight, exploding with no one aboard.  
        
     GAME PLAN The test flight will last 1 1/2 hours, and fall short of a full orbit of Earth. If Starship reaches the three-minute mark after launch, the booster will be commanded to separate and fall into the Gulf of Mexico. The spacecraft would continue eastward, passing over the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans before ditching near Hawaii. Starship is designed to be fully reusable but nothing will be saved from the test flight. Harvard astrophysicist and spacecraft tracker Jonathan McDowell will be more excited whenever Starship actually lands and returns intact from orbit. It will be a profound development in spaceflight if and when Starship is debugged and operational, he said. LAUNCH PAD Starship will take off from a remote site on the southernmost tip of Texas near Boca Chica Beach. Its just below South Padre Island, and about 20 miles from Brownsville. Down the road from the launch pad is the complex where SpaceX has been developing and building Starship prototypes for the past several years. The complex, called Starbase, has more than 1,800 employees, who live in Brownsville or elsewhere in the Rio Grande Valley. The Texas launch pad is equipped with giant robotic arms  called chopsticks  to eventually grab a returning booster as it lands. SpaceX is retooling one of its two Florida launch pads to accommodate Starships down the road. Florida is where SpaceXs Falcon rockets blast off with crew, space station cargo and satellites for NASA and other customers. THE ODDS As usual, Musk is remarkably blunt about his chances, giving even odds, at best, that Starship will reach orbit on its first flight. But with a fleet of Starships under construction at Starbase, he estimates an 80% chance that one of them will attain orbit by years end. He expects it will take a couple years to achieve full and rapid reusability. CUSTOMERS With Starship, the California-based SpaceX is focusing on the moon for now, with a $3 billion NASA contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface as early as 2025, using the upper stage spacecraft. It will be the first moon landing by astronauts in more than 50 years. The moonwalkers will leave Earth via NASAs Orion capsule and Space Launch System rocket, and then transfer to Starship in lunar orbit for the descent to the surface, and then back to Orion. To reach the moon and beyond, Starship will first need to refuel in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX envisions an orbiting depot with window-less Starships as tankers. But Starship isnt just for NASA. A private crew will be the first to fly Starship, orbiting Earth. Two private flights to the moon would follow  no landings, just flyarounds. OTHER PLAYERS There are other new rockets on the horizon. Jeff Bezos Blue Origin is readying the New Glenn rocket for its orbital debut from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the next year or so. Named after the first American to orbit the world, John Glenn, the rocket towers over the companys current New Shepard rocket, named for Mercury astronaut Alan Shepards 1961 suborbital hop. NASA will use New Glenn to send a pair of spacecraft to Mars in 2024. United Launch Alliance expects its new Vulcan rocket to make its inaugural launch later this year, hoisting a private lunar lander to the moon at NASAs behest. Europes Arianespace is close to launching its new, upgraded Ariane 6 rocket from French Guiana in South America. And NASAs Space Launch System moon rocket that will carry astronauts will morph into ever bigger versions. ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

SpaceX calls off 1st launch attempt of giant rocket in Texas,"SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas (AP)  SpaceX called off the first launch attempt of its giant rocket Monday after a problem cropped up during fueling.  Elon Musks company had planned to fly the nearly 400-foot Starship rocket from the southern tip of Texas, near the Mexican border.  The test flight was called off with just over eight minutes left in the countdown because of a stuck valve needed to pressurize the first-stage booster. Launch controllers couldnt fix the frozen valve in time, but for practice, took the clocks down to the 40-second mark before halting the countdown.  No people or satellites were aboard. There wont be another try until at least Thursday.  Learned a lot today, Musk tweeted after the flight was postponed. The company plans to use Starship to send people and cargo to the moon and, ultimately, Mars. On the eve of the launch attempt, cars, campers, RVs and even bicycles and horses jammed the only road leading to the launch pad, where the stainless steel rocket towered above the flat scrubland and prairie. Enthusiasts posed in front of the giant letters that spelled out Starbase at the entrance of the SpaceX complex, and in front of the rocket two miles farther down the road, which ended at a beach on the Gulf of Mexico. On Monday, spectators were barred from the area, and instead packed a beach about six miles away on South Padre Island. Ernesto and Maria Carreon drove two hours from Mission, Texas, with their two daughters, 5 and 7, to watch. 
        
     I got sad. They got sad, when the launch attempt was canceled, Maria Carreon said.  
        
     They cant return for the next try but planned to have fun on the beach Monday. Michelle Vancampenhout, on vacation from Green Bay, Wisconsin, said shell be back.

Mystery solved: Scientists ID Caribbean sea urchin killer,"NEW YORK (AP)  Last year, sea urchins in the Caribbean started getting sick  shedding their spines, dying off and throwing reef ecosystems into chaos. Now, scientists think theyve caught the killer in this marine murder mystery. A tiny single-celled parasite is to blame for the massive die-off, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. The case is closed, said study author Mya Breitbart, a marine microbiologist at the University of South Florida. These long-spined sea urchins, or Diadema antillarum, are prickly black creatures that hide out in reefs across the Caribbean. They play a key role as lawnmowers of the reef, Breitbart said, eating up the algae that grows on corals. But in January 2022, these animals started showing strange symptoms  their sharp spines drooping and falling off, their suction-cup feet losing their grip  before dying off in droves, from the Virgin Islands to Puerto Rico to Florida. For marine scientists, it was deja vu: Another die-off swept through the region in the 1980s and slashed sea urchin populations by around 98%. That case was never solved. But this time, an international team of researchers jumped into action, taking samples from sick urchins and healthy ones across the Caribbean to look for genetic clues. They didnt see signs of viruses or bacteria, said study author Ian Hewson, who researches marine diseases at Cornell University. But they did spot traces of tiny single-celled organisms called ciliates, which only showed up in the sick urchins. 
        
     Though most ciliates dont cause disease, this kind has been linked with other aquatic outbreaks, making it a prime suspect, Hewson said. To confirm theyd caught the killer, scientists placed the parasites in tanks with healthy urchins grown in captivity to see how theyd react. Out of 10 urchins who were pitted against the tiny creatures, 60% of them died  after showing the same symptoms researchers were seeing in the wild. Its possible that this same parasite also caused the die-off in the 1980s, but scientists cant be sure, Breitbart said. And they havent figured out a way to treat the diseased urchins. But theyre hopeful that knowing the source of the die-offs will help conserve the reefs, especially once they learn more about how the parasites spread, Breitbart said. These urchin deaths and other stresses have already transformed the reefs, added Don Levitan, a marine scientist at Florida State University who was not involved with the study. Back before the first sea urchin die-off, Levitan recalled seeing reefs in the U.S. Virgin Islands blanketed in the spiny creatures. Now, those reefs look much different  choked by algae, struck by coral disease and stressed out from rising temperatures. Coral reefs in the Caribbean are in trouble, Levitan said. Were at a different place than we were 30, 40 years ago. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Old NASA satellite falling to Earth, risk of danger low","An old NASA satellite is expected to fall to Earth this week, but experts tracking the spacecraft say chances are low it will pose any danger.  The defunct science satellite known as Rhessi will plummet through the atmosphere Wednesday night, according to NASA and the Defense Department. NASA said Tuesday that the reentry location is not being disclosed, given lingering uncertainty over when and where it might go down. Most of the 660-pound (300-kilogram) satellite should burn up upon return, but some parts are expected to survive.  The space agency said in a statement the risk of anyone on Earth being harmed by plunging satellite pieces is low  about 1-in-2,467. Rhessi  short for the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager  rocketed into orbit in 2002 to study the sun.  Before being shut down in 2018 because of communication problems, the satellite observed solar flares as well as coronal mass ejections from the sun. It captured images in high-energy X-rays and gamma rays, recording more than 100,000 solar events. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Awesome solar eclipse wows viewers in Australia, Indonesia","JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  Under a cloudless sky, 20,000 eclipse chasers crowded a tiny outpost to watch a rare solar eclipse plunge part of Australias northwest coast into brief midday darkness Thursday while temporarily cooling the tropical heat.  The remote tourist town of Exmouth, with fewer than 3,000 residents, was promoted as one of the best vantage points in Australia to see the eclipse that also crossed remote parts of Indonesia and East Timor.  An international crowd had been gathering for days, camping in tents and trailers on a red, dusty plain on the edge of town with cameras and other viewing equipment pointed skyward. NASA astronomer Henry Throop was among those at Exmouth cheering loudly in the darkness. Isnt it incredible? This is so fantastic. It was mind-blowing. It was so sharp and it was so bright. You could see the corona around the sun there, the visibly excited Washington resident said. Its only a minute long, but it really felt like a long time. Theres nothing else you can see which looks like that. It was just awesome. Spectacular. And then you could see Jupiter and Mercury and to be able to see those at the same time during the day  even seeing Mercury at all is pretty rare. So that was just awesome, Throop added. First-time eclipse chaser Julie Copson, who traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north from the Australian west-coast port city of Fremantle to Exmouth, said the phenomenon left her skin tingling. 
        
     I feel so emotional, like I could cry. The color changed and seeing the corona and sun flares , Copson said. It was very strong and the temperature dropped so much, she added, referring to a sudden 5-degree-Celsius (9-degree-Fahrenheit) fall in temperature from 29 degrees Celsius (84 Fahrenheit) when the moons shadow enveloped the region.  It was the fifth eclipse for Detroit resident Shane Varrti, who began planning his trip to Exmouth a year ago. Its very exciting. All this effort has come to fruition, Varrti said. In Indonesias capital, hundreds came to the Jakarta Planetarium to see the partial eclipse that was obscured by clouds. Azka Azzahra, 21, came with her sister and friends to get a closer look by using the telescopes with hundreds of other visitors. I am still happy to come even though it is cloudy. It is happy to see how people with high enthusiasm come here to see the eclipse, because it is rare, Azzahra said. The call to prayer resounded from the citys mosques when the eclipse phase began as Muslims in the country with the worlds largest Muslim population said eclipse prayers as a reminder of Gods greatness.  In East Timor, people gathered around the beach in Lautem municipality, waiting to witness the rare solar eclipse through their eclipse glasses. Some of them came from other countries and gathered with locals to have a clear view of the eclipse. Timor Leste is one of the unique countries where the experience is less humid, less cloudy, so we are expecting a clear sky, thats why many international astronomers wish to converge here. We are hoping that there is going to be a clear sky, Zahri Bin Ahmad, astrophile from the South East Asia Astronomy Network of Brunei said as they waited Thursday. People cheered as the sun and moon reached maximum eclipse. This is a very new natural phenomenon for Timor Leste. It is very important for us to be able to watch and experience it firsthand, said Martinho Fatima, a civil protection authority officer. The hybrid solar eclipse tracked from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and was mostly over water. The lucky few people in its path either saw the darkness of a total eclipse or a ring of fire as the sun peeked from behind the new moon. Such celestial events happen about once every decade: The last one was in 2013 and the next one isnt until 2031. They occur when Earth is in the sweet spot so the moon and the sun are almost the exact same size in the sky, said NASA solar expert Michael Kirk. At some points, the moon is a little closer and blocks out the sun in a total eclipse. But when the moon is a little farther away, it lets some of the suns light peek out in an annular eclipse. Its a crazy phenomenon, Kirk said. Youre actually watching the moon get larger in the sky. Several other upcoming solar eclipses will be easier to catch. An annular eclipse in mid-October and a total eclipse in April 2024 will both cross over millions of people in the Americas. ___ Burakoff reported from New York.

SpaceX giant rocket explodes minutes after launch from Texas,"SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas (AP)  SpaceXs giant new rocket exploded minutes after blasting off on its first test flight Thursday and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Elon Musks company was aiming to send the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built on a round-the-world trip from the southern tip of Texas, near the Mexican border. The nearly 400-foot (120-meter) Starship carried no people or satellites. SpaceX later said multiple engines on the 33-engine booster were not firing as the rocket ascended, causing it to lose altitude and begin to tumble. The rocket was intentionally destroyed by its self-destruct system, exploding and plummeting into the water. Instead of a best-case-scenario 1 1/2-hour flight with the spacecraft on top peeling away and taking a lap around the world, the whole thing lasted four minutes. The rocket reached a maximum speed of about 1,300 mph (2,100 kph) and as high as 24 miles (39 kilometers), before going sideways and dropping. Throngs of spectators watched from South Padre Island, several miles away from the Boca Chica Beach launch site, which was off-limits. As Starship lifted off with a thunderous roar, the crowd screamed: Go, baby, go! Musk, in a tweet, called it an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months. SpaceX termed it a rapid unscheduled disassembly. In the weeks leading up to the flight, Musk gave 50-50 odds that the spacecraft would reach orbit. He stressed that clearing the launch tower and not blowing up the pad would be a win. 
        
     You never know exactly whats going to happen, said SpaceX livestream commentator and engineer John Insprucker. But as we promised, excitement is guaranteed and Starship gave us a rather spectacular end. At liftoff, the rocket kicked up huge plumes of sand and dust around the pad. In Port Isabel, about 10 miles (6 kilometers) away, particles covered cars and other surfaces. The only other report, said John Sandoval, assistant to the city manager, was a shattered window at a local business. Yes, it shook, rattled and rolled, he said of the rocket. The Federal Aviation Administration said it would oversee the accident investigation, noting that no injuries or public property damage were reported. The agency also said that until it determines that there is no threat to public safety, Starships are grounded. SpaceX intends to use Starship to send people and cargo to the moon and, eventually, Mars. NASA has reserved a Starship for its next moonwalking team, and rich tourists are already booking lunar flybys. Despite the abbreviated flight, congratulations poured in from NASA chief Bill Nelson and others in the space industry. Retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield tweeted, Huge accomplishment, huge lessons, onwards to the next attempt. It fell somewhere between a small step and their hoped-for giant leap, but it still represents significant progress toward a reusable super-heavy lift rocket, University of Chicagos Jordan Bimm, a space historian, said in an email. At 394 feet and nearly 17 million pounds of thrust, Starship easily surpasses NASAs moon rockets  past, present and future. NASA successfully launched its new 322-foot (98-meter) moon rocket last November on a test flight, sending the empty Orion capsule around the moon. The stainless steel Starship rocket is designed to be fully reusable with fast turnaround, dramatically lowering costs, similar to what SpaceXs smaller Falcon rockets have done soaring from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Nothing was to be saved from this test flight, with the spacecraft  if all had gone well  aiming for a watery grave in the Pacific near Hawaii.  The futuristic spacecraft flew several miles into the air during testing a few years ago, landing successfully only once. But this was the inaugural launch of the first-stage booster with 33 methane-fueled engines. SpaceX has more boosters and spacecraft lined up for more test flight; the next set is almost ready to go. Musk wants to fire them off in quick succession, so he can start using Starships to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit and then put people on board. It was the second launch attempt. Mondays try was scrapped by a frozen booster valve. Jason and Lisa Flores drove down from Corpus Christi to watch the launch with their daughter, and noticed something was amiss. Lisa Flores cried seeing the liftoff and then realized, Its not working out the way it was supposed to.  Elizabeth Trujillo, 13, wearing a Star Wars shirt and carrying toy binoculars, skipped school to see the launch from the beach with her mother and other relatives. The crowd cheered when Starship cleared the tower. Despite the failed attempt, it was worth it, said Jessica Trujillo, Elizabeths mother. Just hearing and seeing the view, the excitement of the crowd, it was priceless. Practice makes perfect. They just got to practice some more, she added. ___ AP reporter Valerie Gonzalez contributed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

UAE spacecraft takes close-up photos of Mars little moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A spacecraft around Mars has sent back the most detailed photos yet of the red planets little moon. The United Arab Emirates Amal spacecraft flew within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of Deimos last month and the close-up shots were released Monday. Amal  Arabic for Hope  got a two-for-one when Mars photobombed some of the images. It was the closest a spacecraft has been to Deimos in almost a half-century. The spacecraft also observed the little explored far side of the odd-shaped, cratered moon, just 9 miles by 7 miles by 7 miles (15 kilometers by 12 kilometers by 12 kilometers).  Mars other moon, Phobos, is almost double that size and better understood since it orbits much closer to Mars  just 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) away, the closest of any planets moon in our solar system. Deimos orbit around Mars stretches 14,000 miles (23,000 kilometers) out. Thats close to the inner part of the spacecrafts orbit  which is what made observing Deimos such a compelling idea, said the missions lead scientist Hessa al-Matroushi. Phobos has got most of the attention up until now  now its Deimos turn! she added in an email. Al-Matroushi and other scientists with the UAE Space Agency said these new images indicate Deimos is not an asteroid that got captured in Mars orbit eons ago, the leading theory until now. Instead, they say the the moon appears to be of Martian origin  perhaps from the bigger Martian moon or from Mars itself. 
        
     The findings were presented Monday at the European Geosciences Unions general assembly in Vienna.  Amal will continue to sweep past Deimos this year, but not as closely as the March 10 encounter, according to al-Matroushi. NASAs Viking 2 came within 19 miles (30 kilometers) of Deimos in 1977. Since then, other spacecraft have photographed Deimos but from much farther away. Amal rocketed to Mars on July 19, 2020, one day shy of the 50th anniversary of humanitys first moon landing  Earths moon, that is  by Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Severe solar storm creates dazzling auroras farther south,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An intense solar storm has the northern lights gracing the skies farther south than usual.  A blast of superhot material from the sun late last week hurled scorching gases known as plasma toward Earth at nearly 2 million mph (3 million kph), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday.  Earth felt the brunt of the storm Sunday, according to NOAA, with forecasters warning operators of power plants and spacecraft of the potential for disruption.  Auroras were reported across parts of Europe and Asia. In the U.S., skygazers took in the sights from Wisconsin, Washington state, Colorado, California, New Mexico and even Arizona  mostly a reddish glow instead of the typical green shimmer.  I dont want any expectations of these green curtains moving back and forth so far south, said Bill Murtagh, program coordinator at the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado.  Although conditions have eased, auroras might still be visible as far south as South Dakota and Iowa late Monday and early Tuesday if skies are dark. The farther north, the better the show as the energized particles interact with the atmosphere closer to Earth, according to Murtagh. The farther south, the curvature of the Earth cuts off the most dazzling scenes as the particles interact higher in the atmosphere.  Murtagh said light pollution in Boulder prevented him from seeing the auroras Sunday night. But there could be more opportunities as the solar cycle ramps up.  
        
     Stay tuned, more to come, he said.  This was the third severe geomagnetic storm since the current 11-year solar cycle began in 2019, according to NOAA. The agency expects the cycle to peak in 2024. For those down under, the southern lights should provide equally good shows, Murtagh said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Rosalind Franklins role in DNA discovery gets a new twist,"NEW YORK (AP)  The discovery of DNAs double helix structure 70 years ago opened up a world of new science  and also sparked disputes over who contributed what and who deserves credit.  Much of the controversy comes from a central idea: that James Watson and Francis Crick  the first to figure out DNAs shape  stole data from another scientist named Rosalind Franklin. Now, two historians are suggesting that while parts of that story are accurate  Watson and Crick did rely on research from Franklin and her lab without their permission  Franklin was more a collaborator than just a victim.  In an opinion article published Tuesday in the journal Nature, the historians say the two different research teams were working in parallel toward solving the DNA puzzle and knew more about what the other team was doing than is widely believed. Its much less dramatic, said article author Matthew Cobb, a zoologist at the University of Manchester who is working on a biography of Crick. Its not a heist movie. The story dates back to the 1950s, when scientists were still working out how DNAs pieces fit together. Watson and Crick were working on modeling DNAs shape at Cambridge University. Meanwhile, Franklin  an expert in X-ray imaging  was studying the molecules at Kings College in London, along with a scientist named Maurice Wilkins. It was there that Franklin captured the iconic Photograph 51, an X-ray image showing DNAs criss-cross shape. 
        
     Then, the story gets tricky. In the version thats often told, Watson was able to look at Photograph 51 during a visit to Franklins lab. According to the story Franklin hadnt solved the structure, even months after making the image. But when Watson saw it, he suddenly, instantly knew that it was a helix, said author Nathaniel Comfort, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins University who is writing a biography of Watson.  Around the same time, the story goes, Crick also obtained a lab report that included Franklins data and used it without her consent. And according to this story, these two eureka moments  both based on Franklins work  Watson and Crick were able to go and solve the double helix in a few days, Comfort said.  This lore came in part from Watson himself in his book The Double Helix, the historians say. But the historians suggest this was a literary device to make the story more exciting and understandable to lay readers.  After digging in Franklins archives, the historians found new details that they say challenge this simplistic narrative  and suggest that Franklin contributed more than just one photograph along the way.  The proof? A draft of a Time magazine story from the time written in consultation with Franklin, but never published, described the work on DNAs structure as a joint effort between the two groups. And a letter from one of Franklins colleagues suggested Franklin knew her research was being shared with Crick, authors said. Taken together, this material suggests the four researchers were equal collaborators in the work, Comfort said. While there may have been some tensions, the scientists were sharing their findings more openly  not snatching them in secret. She deserves to be remembered not as the victim of the double helix, but as an equal contributor to the solution of the structure, the authors conclude.  Howard Markel, a historian of medicine at the University of Michigan, said hes not convinced by the updated story. Markel  who wrote a book about the double helix discovery  believes that Franklin got ripped off by the others and they cut her out in part because she was a Jewish woman in a male-dominated field. In the end, Franklin left her DNA work behind and went on to make other important discoveries in virus research, before dying of cancer at the age of 37. Four years later, Watson, Crick and Wilkins received a Nobel prize for their work on DNAs structure. Franklin wasnt included in that honor. Posthumous Nobel prizes have always been extremely rare, and now arent allowed.  What exactly happened, and in what order, will likely never be known for sure. Crick and Wilkins both died in 2004. Watson, 95, could not be reached and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he served as director, declined to comment on the paper.  But researchers agree Franklins work was critical for helping unravel DNAs double helix shape  no matter how the story unfolded. How should she be remembered? As a great scientist who was an equal contributor to the process, Markel said. It should be called the Watson-Crick-Franklin model. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Japanese company: High probability lander crashed on moon,"A Japanese companys spacecraft apparently crashed while attempting to land on the moon Wednesday, losing contact moments before touchdown and sending flight controllers scrambling to figure out what happened. More than six hours after communication ceased, the Tokyo company ispace finally confirmed what everyone had suspected, saying there was a high probability that the lander had slammed into the moon. It was a disappointing setback for ispace, which after a 4 1/2-month mission had been on the verge of doing what only three countries have done: successfully land a spacecraft on the moon. Takeshi Hakamada, founder and CEO of ispace, held out hope even after contact was lost as the lander descended the final 33 feet (10 meters). Flight controllers peered at their screens in Tokyo as minutes went by with only silence from the moon. A grim-faced team surrounded Hakamada as he announced that the landing likely failed. Official word finally came in a statement: It has been determined that there is a high probability that the lander eventually made a hard landing on the moons surface. If all had gone well, ispace would have been the first private business to pull off a lunar landing. Hakamada vowed to try again, saying a second moonshot is already in the works for next year. Only three governments have successfully touched down on the moon: Russia, the United States and China. An Israeli nonprofit tried to land on the moon in 2019, but its spacecraft was destroyed on impact.  
        
     If space is hard, landing is harder, tweeted Laurie Leshin, director of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I know from personal experience how awful this feels. Leshin worked on NASAs Mars Polar lander that crashed on the red planet in 1999. The 7-foot (2.3-meter) Japanese lander carried a mini lunar rover for the United Arab Emirates and a toylike robot from Japan designed to roll around in the moon dust for about 10 days. That was also the expected length of the full mission. Named Hakuto, Japanese for white rabbit, the spacecraft had targeted the Atlas crater in the northeastern section of the moons near side, more than 50 miles (87 kilometers) across and just over 1 mile (2 kilometers) deep.  It took a roundabout route to the moon following its December liftoff, beaming back photos of Earth along the way. The lander entered lunar orbit on March 21. Flight controllers ascertained that the lander was upright as it used its thrusters to slow during Wednesdays final approach. Engineers monitoring the fuel gauge noticed that as the tank approached empty, the lander picked up speed as it descended and communication was then lost, according to ispace.  Its possible the lander miscalculated its altitude and ran out of fuel before reaching the surface, company officials said at a news conference later in the day. Founded in 2010, ispace hopes to start turning a profit as a one-way taxi service to the moon for other businesses and organizations. The company has already raised $300 million to cover the first three missions, according to Hakamada. We will keep going, never quit lunar quest, he said. For this test flight, the two main experiments were government-sponsored: the UAEs 22-pound (10-kilogram) rover Rashid, named after Dubais royal family, and the Japanese Space Agencys orange-sized sphere designed to transform into a wheeled robot on the moon. The UAE  already in orbit around Earth with an astronaut aboard the International Space Station and in orbit around Mars  was seeking to extend its presence to the moon. The moon is suddenly hot again, with numerous countries and private companies clamoring to get on the lunar bandwagon. China has successfully landed three spacecraft on the moon since 2013, and U.S., China, India and South Korea have satellites currently circling the moon.  NASAs first test flight in its new moonshot program, Artemis, made it to the moon and back late last year, paving the way for four astronauts to follow by the end of next year and two others to actually land on the moon a year after that. Pittsburghs Astrobotic Technology and Houstons Intuitive Machines have lunar landers waiting in the wings, poised to launch later this year at NASAs behest. Hakuto and the Israeli spacecraft named Beresheet were finalists in the Google Lunar X Prize competition requiring a successful landing on the moon by 2018. The $20 million grand prize went unclaimed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Ants march, whales swoop in Museum of Natural History update","NEW YORK (AP)  The American Museum of Natural History in New York is set to open its new building, a sweeping piece of architecture designed to connect visitors with their place in the natural world. Tiny ants march along a glass bridge overhead in the new museum wing, The Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education and Innovation. Giant whales swoop along the walls in an immersive video display. And the buildings natural curves  inspired by canyons in the Southwest  are meant to highlight how all of it is intertwined. The $465 million center, nearly a decade in the making, is set to open to the public next Thursday, adding a new wow factor to one of the worlds most visited museums. Architect Jeanne Gang said at a media preview Wednesday that she asked herself how the space could contribute to peoples natural desire to learn. This led us to look at geological landscapes, where one can see how the natural forces actually shape the material, shape our world, she said.  The Gilder Center is already home to more than a half million tiny inhabitants, residents of an insect exhibition with 18 species of live critters, and an indoor garden where visitors can mingle with hundreds of moths and butterflies. The goal is to get people up close and personal with the bugs and highlight their importance to the natural world, said museum entomologist David Grimaldi. 
        
     Insects get a very bad rap because of this tiny, tiny fraction of biting or disease-transmitting insects, Grimaldi said. But most insect species pose no danger to humans and are an essential part of their bigger ecosystems, he said. Brightly colored butterflies flap around a garden  which is kept hot and humid to mimic their tropical homes  while giant beetles munch on decaying fruit. And then there are the ants: The museum shipped in around 500,000 leafcutter ants to build a massive colony in the insectarium. The tiny workers collect their leaves from one glass enclosure, then march across a skybridge to cultivate their fungal feasts in big glass bulbs along the wall. The ants needed some help adjusting to the space: scientists had to hold training sessions to show them where to go, said Cheryl Hayashi, the museums provost of science. Theyve since settled into their new home. A new interactive show highlights the ways our lives are intertwined with others. Invisible Worlds immerses visitors in different interactive scenes, alternately zooming in to show the proteins in human DNA and neural connections in the brain, or zooming out to a vantage point above the New York City skyline or a rainforest canopy. Through DNA, you are related to all life on Earth, the narration declares. The Gilder Center is also designed to bring the scientific process to the forefront, said museum president Sean Decatur. More than 4 million specimens from the museums collections are now being housed in the Gilder Center, some on display through big glass windows. This Collections Core shows off a wide range of items, from megalodon teeth to Mayan bricks to spools of spider silk, and gives visitors a peek at the stuff the science is based on: We literally show our evidence, Hayashi said. Building trust in the scientific process is more important than ever, said Ellen Futter, the museums former president who oversaw most of the Gilder Centers creation before retiring in March. That is the vision: To help visitors see and understand our world more deeply, Futter said. To appreciate that all life is interdependent. To trust science and to be inspired to protect our precious planet. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Chinas Mars rover finds signs of recent water in sand dunes,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Water may be more widespread and recent on Mars than previously thought, based on observations of Martian sand dunes by Chinas rover.  The finding highlights new, potentially fertile areas in the warmer regions of Mars where conditions might be suitable for life to exist, though more study is needed.  Fridays news comes days after mission leaders acknowledged that the Zhurong rover has yet to wake up since going into hibernation for the Martian winter nearly a year ago.  Its solar panels are likely covered with dust, choking off its power source and possibly preventing the rover from operating again, said Zhang Rongqiao, the missions chief designer. Before Zhurong fell silent, it observed salt-rich dunes with cracks and crusts, which researchers said likely were mixed with melting morning frost or snow as recently as a few hundred thousand years ago.  Their estimated date range for when the cracks and other dune features formed in Mars Utopia Planitia, a vast plain in the northern hemisphere: sometime after 1.4 million to 400,000 years ago or even younger.  Conditions during that period were similar to now on Mars, with rivers and lakes dried up and no longer flowing as they did billions of years earlier. Studying the structure and chemical makeup of these dunes can provide insights into the possibility of water activity during this period, the Beijing-based team wrote in a study published in Science Advances. 
        
     We think it could be a small amount ... no more than a film of water on the surface, co-author Xiaoguang Qin of the Institute of Geology and Geophysics said in an email. The rover did not directly detect any water in the form of frost or ice. But Qin said computer simulations and observations by other spacecraft at Mars indicate that even nowadays at certain times of year, conditions could be suitable for water to appear. Whats notable about the study is how young the dunes are, said planetary scientist Frederic Schmidt at the University of Paris-Saclay, who was not part of the study.  This is clearly a new piece of science for this region, he said in an email. Small pockets of water from thawing frost or snow, mixed with salt, likely resulted in the small cracks, hard crusty surfaces, loose particles and other dune features like depressions and ridges, the Chinese scientists said. They ruled out wind as a cause, as well as frost made of carbon dioxide, which makes up the bulk of Mars atmosphere. Martian frost has been observed since NASAs 1970s Viking missions, but these light dustings of morning frost were thought to occur in certain locations under specific conditions. The rover has now provided evidence that there may be a wider distribution of this process on Mars than previously identified, said Trinity College Dublins Mary Bourke, an expert in Mars geology.  However small this watery niche, it could be important for identifying habitable environments, she added. Launched in 2020, the six-wheeled Zhurong  named after a fire god in Chinese mythology  arrived at Mars in 2021 and spent a year roaming around before going into hibernation last May. The rover operated longer than intended, traveling more than a mile (1,921 meters).  ___ AP video producer Olivia Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Key radar antenna stuck on Europes Jupiter-bound spacecraft,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A critical antenna is jammed on a Jupiter-bound spacecraft launched two weeks ago, the European Space Agency reported Friday.  The 52-foot (16-meter) radar antenna on Juice unfolded only one-third of the way following liftoff, according to the space agency.  Engineers suspect a tiny pin may be protruding. Flight controllers in Germany plan to fire the spacecrafts engine in hopes of shaking the pin loose. If that doesnt work, they said they have plenty of time to solve the problem. Juice, short for Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, wont reach the giant planet until 2031. Its taking a roundabout path to get there, including gravity-assist flybys of Earth and our moon, and Venus. The radar antenna is needed to peer beneath the icy crust of three Jupiter moons suspected of harboring underground oceans and possibly life, a major goal of the nearly $1.8 billion mission. Its targets include Callisto, Europa and Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. The space agency said everything else is going well with the spacecraft, about the size of a small bus. A radio antenna, solar panels and a 35-foot (10.6-meter) boom for measuring Jupiters magnetic field have all been successfully deployed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Galactic gobble: Star swallows planet in one big gulp,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  For the first time, scientists have caught a star in the act of swallowing a planet  not just a nibble or bite, but one big gulp.  Astronomers on Wednesday reported their observations of what appeared to be a gas giant around the size of Jupiter or bigger being eaten by its star. The sun-like star had been puffing up with old age for eons and finally got so big that it engulfed the close-orbiting planet. Its a gloomy preview of what will happen to Earth when our sun morphs into a red giant and gobbles the four inner planets.  If its any consolation, this will happen in about 5 billion years, said co-author Morgan MacLeod of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  This galactic feast happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation when the star was around 10 billion years old. As the planet went down the stellar hatch, there was a swift hot outburst of light, followed by a long-lasting stream of dust shining brightly in cold infrared energy, the researchers said. While there had been previous signs of other stars nibbling at planets and their digestive aftermath, this was the first time the swallow itself was observed, according to the study appearing in the journal Nature. Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Kishalay De spotted the luminous outburst in 2020 while reviewing sky scans taken by the California Institute of Technologys Palomar Observatory. It took additional observations and data-crunching to unravel the mystery: Instead of a star gobbling up its companion star, this one had devoured its planet. 
        
     Given a stars lifetime of billions of years, the swallow itself was quite brief  occurring in essentially one fell swoop, said Caltechs Mansi Kasliwal, who was part of the study. The findings are very plausible, said Carole Haswell, an astrophysicist at Britains Open University, who had no role in the research. Haswell led a team in 2010 that used the Hubble Space Telescope to identify the star WASP-12 in the process of eating its planet. This is a different sort of eating. This star gobbled a whole planet in one gulp, Haswell said in an email. In contrast, WASP-12 b and the other hot Jupiters we have previously studied are being delicately licked and nibbled. Astronomers dont know if more planets are circling this star at a safer distance. If so, De said they may have thousands of years before becoming the stars second or third course. Now that they know what to look for, the researchers will be on the lookout for more cosmic gulps. They suspect thousands of planets around other stars will suffer the same fate as this one did and, eventually, so will our solar system.  All that we see around us, all the stuff that weve built around us, this will all be gone in a flash, De said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

1st lunar eclipse of 2023 dims full moon ever so slightly,"Stargazers in Asia and Australia had the best seats for the years first lunar eclipse. The four-hour eclipse got underway late Friday or early Saturday, depending on the location, as the moon slipped into the fringes of Earths shadow. In whats known as a penumbral lunar eclipse, the full moon passed within the outer part of Earths shadow, causing the moon to dim only slightly. Such an eclipse isnt as dramatic as a partial lunar eclipse or a total lunar eclipse when the moon, Earth and sun are perfectly aligned.  The eclipse was visible from beginning to end, weather permitting, as far west as Saudi Arabia and Africas western coast, as far east as Japan and New Zealands South Island, and from the South Pole to Siberia. Almost all of Europe also got in on some of the action. The Virtual Telescope Project showed a livestream of the moon rising over the countryside in Tuscany, Italy.  Even subtle astronomical events like this one make me excited and happy to share them, astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, the projects founder, said in an email.  The next lunar eclipse in October will put on a better display. The eastern portions of both Americas will get to see at least part of a partial lunar eclipse, when some but not all of the moon passes through the Earths dark, central shadow. Asia, Africa and Europe will be treated to the whole show. A total lunar eclipse isnt on tap until 2025 with North America and the western half of South America in front-row seats. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Koalas are dying from chlamydia. A new vaccine effort is trying to save them,"Australian scientists have begun vaccinating wild koalas against chlamydia in an ambitious field trial in New South Wales. The aim is to test a method for protecting the beloved marsupials against a widespread disease that causes blindness, infertility and death.  Its killing koalas because they become so sick they cant climb trees to get food, or escape predators, and females can become infertile, said Samuel Phillips, a microbiologist at the University of the Sunshine Coast who helped to develop the vaccine.  The scientists initial goal is to catch, vaccinate and monitor around half of the koala population in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales  that means vaccinating around 50 animals.  The safety and effectiveness of the single-shot vaccine, which has been designed specifically for koalas, has previously been tested by vaccinating a few hundred koalas brought to wildlife rescue centers for other afflictions.  Now scientists want to understand the impact of vaccinating a population of wild koalas. We want to evaluate what percentage of the koalas we need to vaccinate to meaningfully reduce infection and disease, said Phillips.  The first koalas were caught and vaccinated in March, and the effort is expected to last about three months.  Researchers use binoculars to spot koalas in eucalyptus trees, then construct circular enclosures around the tree bases with doors leading into cages. After a few hours or days, the koalas will eventually climb down from one tree to seek tasty leaves on another, and wander into the harmless traps. 
        
     Its hard to confuse a koala with any other animals  theyre pretty easy to spot, said Jodie Wakeman, veterinary care and clinical director at Friends of the Koala, a nonprofit that runs a wildlife hospital where the koalas are being brought for vaccination.  After a check-up to make sure the animals are in good condition, researchers administer anesthesia and shots of vaccine, then keep them under observation for 24 hours after they wake up, to confirm there are no unexpected side effects, said Wakeman. The goal is to vaccinate healthy koalas to prevent them from becoming infected with chlamydia.  Before release, the researchers mark the koalas with a dab of pink dye on their backs, to ensure the same animals arent caught twice.

     When the first vaccinated koala was returned to her habitat on March 9, the scientists placed her cage at the base of a tree and opened the door. She quickly emerged and bounded up the tree trunk. Koalas are iconic Australian marsupials, like wombats and kangaroos. They spend most of their time eating and sleeping in eucalyptus trees, and their paws have two opposing thumbs to help them grasp and climb up trunks.  Australias wild koala populations have declined steeply in the past two decades. Last February, Australias federal government declared koalas endangered in the eastern regions of New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory.  Facing compounded threats from disease, habitat loss and road collisions, koalas could become extinct by 2050, according to a 2020 assessment from the New South Wales government.  Around half of wild koalas in Queensland are already infected with chlamydia, scientists estimate.  In deciding to vaccinate, the scientists are balancing the risk of disturbing the animals against the danger of allowing the disease to spread. The trial was approved by multiple government bodies, including Australias agriculture department and New South Wales planning and environment department. The origins of chlamydia in koalas arent confirmed, but scientists believe its likely the marsupials initially caught the disease from exposure to the feces of infected sheep and cattle. Then its spread sexually, or passed from mother to offspring.  While humans and livestock infected with the bacteria that causes chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics, its not so simple for koalas.  The complex microbes inside the stomachs of koalas are designed to neutralize toxins in eucalyptus leaves that are their main food source, said Mathew Crowther, a conservation biologist at the University of Sydney. But their digestive systems can also neutralize some medicines so that means they dont respond well to antibiotics treatment, he said. Crowther has been monitoring a population of koalas in northern New South Wales for more than a decade. In 2008, 10% of animals tested there were infected with chlamydia. Today that rate is 80%.  Its been devastating  theres very, very low fertility, he said. You hardly see any babies. The other threats koalas face  including habitat destruction from land clearing and climate-enhanced wildfires  may increase their stress levels, weakening their immune systems and making them more susceptible to diseases including chlamydia, said Crowther. Rebecca Johnson, now chief scientist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., previously led the Koala Genome Consortium in Australia. She said that seeing the effects of the disease up close was heartbreaking.  A necropsy of one koala with advanced chlamydia that was euthanized revealed ovaries completely encased in cysts and intestines full of hard lumps of food, evidence that she couldnt properly digest food, recalled Johnson. She was obviously infertile and in pain. There are only a handful of other examples worldwide of scientists attempting to catch and inoculate endangered wildlife for conservation. In 2016, scientists began to vaccinate Hawaiian monk seals against a deadly strain of morbillivirus. Two and a half years ago, biologists in Brazil began to vaccinate golden lion tamarins against yellow fever. Vaccination for wildlife is certainly not routine yet, said Jacob Negrey, a biologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. But whether it should be used more often is a fundamental question that conservation biologists are really wrangling with right now. The Smithsonians Johnson said the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks for koalas. Vaccination is an incredibly resource-intensive thing to do. Koalas live high up in trees, she said.  But because the effects of chlamydia are so debilitating, I think its totally worth it.  ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"SpaceX launches US, Russia, UAE astronauts to space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched four astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA on Thursday, including the first person from the Arab world going up for an extended monthslong stay. The Falcon rocket bolted from Kennedy Space Center shortly after midnight, illuminating the night sky as it headed up the East Coast.  Nearly 80 spectators from the United Arab Emirates watched from the launch site as astronaut Sultan al-Neyadi  only the second Emirati to fly to space  blasted off on his six-month mission. Half a world away in Dubai and elsewhere across the UAE, schools and offices broadcast the launch live. Also riding the Dragon capsule thats due at the space station on Friday: NASAs Stephen Bowen, a retired Navy submariner who logged three space shuttle flights, and Warren Woody Hoburg, a former research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and space newbie, and Andrei Fedyaev, a space rookie whos retired from the Russian Air Force. Welcome to orbit, SpaceX Launch Control radioed, noting liftoff occurred four years to the day after the capsules first orbital test flight. If you enjoyed your ride, please dont forget to give us five stars. The first attempt to launch them was called off Monday at the last minute because of a clogged filter in the engine ignition system.  It may have taken two times, but it was worth the trip, Bowen said. 
        
     NASAs space operations mission chief, Kathy Lueders, said Thursdays launch enhanced a night sky already showcasing a conjunction of Venus and Jupiter. The two planets have appeared side by side all week, seeming to grow ever closer. We added a bright new star to that night sky tonight, she told reporters.  The space station newcomers will replace a U.S.-Russian-Japanese crew that has been up there since October. The other station residents are two Russians and an American whose six-month stay was doubled, until September, after their Soyuz capsule sprang a leak. A replacement Soyuz arrived last weekend. Al-Neyadi, a communications engineer, thanked everyone in Arabic and then English once reaching orbit. Launch was incredible. Amazing, he said. He served as backup for the first Emirati astronaut, Hazzaa al-Mansoori, who rode a Russian rocket to the space station in 2019 for a weeklong visit. The oil-rich federation paid for al-Neyadis seat on the SpaceX flight. The UAEs minister for public education and advanced technology, Sarah al-Amiri, said the long mission provides us a new venue for science and scientific discovery for the country.  We dont want to just go to space and then not have much to do there or not have impact, said the director general of the UAEs space center in Dubai, Salem al-Marri.  The Emirates already have a spacecraft orbiting Mars, and a mini rover is hitching a ride to the moon on a Japanese lander. Two new UAE astronauts are training with NASAs latest astronaut picks in Houston.  Saudi Prince Sultan bin Salman was the first Arab in space, launching aboard shuttle Discovery in 1985. He was followed two years later by Syrian astronaut Muhammed Faris, launched by Russia. Both were in space for about a week. Al-Neyadi will be joined this spring by two Saudi astronauts going to the space station on a short private SpaceX flight paid by their government.  Its going to be really exciting, really interesting to have three Arabs in space at once, he said last week. Our region is also thirsty to learn more.  Hes taking up lots of dates to share with his crewmates, especially during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month which begins this month. As for observing Ramadan in orbit, he said fasting isnt compulsory since it could make him weak and jeopardize his mission.  Bowen, the crews leader, said the four have jelled well as a team despite differences between their countries. Even with the tension over the war in Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia have continued to work together on the space station and trade seats on rides there. Its just tremendous to have the opportunity to fly with these guys, Bowen said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"New crew from US, Russia and UAE arrives at space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A new crew arrived at the International Space Station on Friday for a six-month mission, after overcoming trouble with one of the capsules docking hooks. The SpaceX capsule and its four astronauts had to wait 65 feet (20 meters) from the orbiting lab, as flight controllers in California scrambled to come up with a software fix. Its the same problem that cropped up shortly after Thursdays liftoff. Although all 12 hooks on the capsule appeared to be fine, the switch for one of them malfunctioned. SpaceX Mission Control urged patience, telling the U.S., Russian and Emerati astronauts they could stay in this holding pattern for up to two hours. Once new software commands were relayed, the astronauts received the go-ahead to proceed. In the end, the linkup occurred an hour late as the capsule and space station soared 260 miles (420 kilometers) above the coast of Somalia.  After a brief scenic detour, welcome to the International Space Station, SpaceX Mission Control radioed. NASA officials agreed the delay added to the anticipation. The new arrivals include United Arab Emirates Sultan al-Neyadi, the first astronaut from the Arab world who will spend an extended time in space. Al-Neyadi is only the second person from the UAE to rocket into orbit. I cant be happier than this, seeing old friends in space, gathering as a big family. This is the essence of space exploration, al-Neyadi said upon entering the station. The UAE is taking a great step toward pushing the boundaries of exploration. 
        
     Also flying up in the capsule: NASAs Stephen Bowen, a retired Navy submariner who made three space shuttle flights, and Warren Woody Hoburg, a space newbie and former research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Andrei Fedyaev, a space rookie whos retired from the Russian Air Force. SpaceX launched the four astronauts for NASA early Thursday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Their flight was delayed a few days by a clogged filter in an ignition fluid line. The UAE sent its first astronaut, Hazzaa al-Mansoori, to the space station in 2019 aboard a Russian rocket. It had been decades since the first Arab launched in 1985 during NASAs shuttle era. The longest spaceflight by any of them was about a week. A UAE space official, Hamad al-Mansoori, called the station from Dubai to wish el-Nayadi and his crew a safe and successful mission and said it represented a huge milestone. The space station will be home to 11 people for the next week. The newcomers will replace two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut who have been on the station since October and will return in their own SpaceX capsule next week. Two other Russians and an American traveled to the station in September on a Russian Soyuz capsule that had to be replaced because of a leak, pushing their mission to a full year. ___ This story corrects a previous version that said UAE astronaut Hazzaa al-Mansoori called the space station.

"First evidence for horseback riding dates back 5,000 years","WASHINGTON (AP)  Archaeologists have found the earliest direct evidence for horseback riding  an innovation that would transform history  in 5,000 year old human skeletons in central Europe. When you get on a horse and ride it fast, its a thrill  Im sure ancient humans felt the same way, said David Anthony, a co-author of the study and Hartwick College archaeologist. Horseback riding was the fastest a human could go before the railroads. Researchers analyzed more than 200 Bronze Age skeletal remains in museum collections in Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic to look for signs of what co-author and University of Helsinki anthropologist Martin Trautmann calls horse rider syndrome  six tell-tale markers that indicate a person was likely riding an animal, including characteristic wear marks on the hip sockets, thigh bone and pelvis. You can read bones like biographies, said Trautmann, who has previously studied similar wear patterns in skeletons from later periods when horseback riding is well-established in the historical record.  The researchers focused on human skeletons  which are more readily preserved than horse bones in burial sites and museums  and identified five likely riders who lived around 4,500 to 5,000 years ago and belonged to a Bronze Age people called the Yamnaya. There is earlier evidence for harnessing and milking of horses, but this is the earliest direct evidence so far for horseback riding, said University of Exeter archaeologist Alan Outram, who was not involved in the research, but praised the approach.  
        
     The study was published Friday in the journal Science Advances.  Domesticating wild horses on the plains of Eurasia was a process, not a single event, the researchers say. Archaeologists have previously found evidence of people consuming horse milk in dental remains and indications of horses controlled by harnesses and bits dating back more than 5,000 years, but that does not necessarily indicate the horses were ridden.  The Yamnaya culture, known for its characteristic burial mounds, originated in whats now part of Ukraine and western Russia, an area called the Pontic Caspian steppe. The horses they kept were distinct from modern horses  likely more easily startled and less tolerant of humans  although they may have been the immediate genetic ancestors of modern horses, which emerged a few centuries later, the researchers say. The Yamnaya are most significant because of their dramatic expansion across Eurasia in only a few generations  moving westward to Hungary and eastward to Mongolia, said University of Helsinki archaeologist and co-author Volker Heyd.  The spread of Indo European languages is linked to their movement, and they reshaped the genetic make-up of Europe, he said. Their relationship with horses may have partly enabled this stunning movement, the researchers suggest. Horses expand the concept of distance  you begin to think about places previously out of reach as being reachable, said co-author Anthony, the Hartwick College archaeologist. That does not mean the Yamnaya people were warriors on horseback, as the horses they rode were likely too skittish for stressful battlefield situations, he said. But horses may have allowed the Yamnaya to more effectively send communications, build alliances and manage the herds of cattle that were central to their economy.  Because only a small percentage of the skeletons studied clearly showed all six markers of riding horseback, it seems that a minority of the people at that time were riders  that does not suggest that a whole society was built on horseback riding, said molecular archaeologist Ludovic Orlando, who is based at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France and was not involved in the research. Still, he praised the work for helping to better pinpoint the potential genesis of horseback riding. This is about the origins of something that impacted human history like only a few other things have, said Orlando. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Nations reach accord to protect marine life on high seas,"WASHINGTON (AP)  For the first time, United Nations members have agreed on a unified treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas - representing a turning point for vast stretches of the planet where conservation has previously been hampered by a confusing patchwork of laws.  The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea came into force in 1994, before marine biodiversity was a well-established concept. The treaty agreement concluded two weeks of talks in New York. An updated framework to protect marine life in the regions outside national boundary waters, known as the high seas, had been in discussions for more than 20 years, but previous efforts to reach an agreement had repeatedly stalled. The unified agreement treaty, which applies to nearly half the planets surface, was reached late Saturday. We only really have two major global commons  the atmosphere and the oceans, said Georgetown marine biologist Rebecca Helm. While the oceans may draw less attention, protecting this half of earths surface is absolutely critical to the health of our planet. Nichola Clark, an oceans expert at the Pew Charitable Trusts who observed the talks in New York, called the long-awaited treaty text a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect the oceans  a major win for biodiversity. The treaty will create a new body to manage conservation of ocean life and establish marine protected areas in the high seas. And Clark said thats critical to achieve the U.N. Biodiversity Conferences recent pledge to protect 30% of the planets waters, as well as its land, for conservation. 
        
     Treaty negotiations initially were anticipated to conclude Friday, but stretched through the night and deep into Saturday. The crafting of the treaty, which at times looked in jeopardy, represents a historic and overwhelming success for international marine protection, said Steffi Lemke, Germanys environment minister. For the first time, we are getting a binding agreement for the high seas, which until now have hardly been protected, Lemke said. Comprehensive protection of endangered species and habitats is now finally possible on more than 40% of the Earths surface. The treaty also establishes ground rules for conducting environmental impact assessments for commercial activities in the oceans.  It means all activities planned for the high seas need to be looked at, though not all will go through a full assessment, said Jessica Battle, an oceans governance expert at the Worldwide Fund for Nature. Several marine species  including dolphins, whales, sea turtles and many fish  make long annual migrations, crossing national borders and the high seas. Efforts to protect them, along with human communities that rely on fishing or tourism related to marine life, have long proven difficult for international governing bodies. This treaty will help to knit together the different regional treaties to be able to address threats and concerns across species ranges, Battle said. That protection also helps coastal biodiversity and economies, said Gladys Martnez de Lemos, executive director of the nonprofit Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense focusing on environmental issues across Latin America. Governments have taken an important step that strengthens the legal protection of two-thirds of the ocean and with it marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of coastal communities, she said. The question now is how well the ambitious treaty will be implemented.  Formal adoption also remains outstanding, with numerous conservationists and environmental groups vowing to watch closely. The high seas have long suffered exploitation due to commercial fishing and mining, as well as pollution from chemicals and plastics. The new agreement is about acknowledging that the ocean is not a limitless resource, and it requires global cooperation to use the ocean sustainably, Rutgers University biologist Malin Pinsky said. ___ Associated Press writer Frank Jordans contributed to this report from Berlin. ___ Follow Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina and Whittle at @pxwhittle ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Latest astronaut from UAE getting used to space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  The second astronaut from the United Arab Emirates is still adjusting to life off the planet, after rocketing to the International Space Station last week.  Im still coping. Im still learning, Sultan al-Neyadi said Tuesday, but added that he hopes to improve in the coming days. Hes the second UAE astronaut to fly in space and the first from the Arab world to be assigned to a long spaceflight  the others stayed for about a week. Hell be up there until September. Al-Neyadi assured Dubais ruler in a video call Tuesday that he and the rest of his crew are in good health. But he joked that the small plush astronaut toy that he took up may be coping better with microgravity than he is. I am thankful to God you have reached the International Space Station and thank God for your safety, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who also serves as the countrys prime minister and vice president, said from the space center named after him.

3D-printed rockets debut launch aborted at last minute,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A rocket made almost entirely of 3D-printed parts remained on the pad Wednesday after its debut launch attempt was aborted at the last minute. California-based Relativity Space was attempting to launch the rocket to orbit from a former missile site at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. There was no immediate word on when the company might try again. On-board flight computers halted the countdown with just over a minute remaining because of a temperature issue with the rockets upper stage. Mission Control decided to fix the problem and try again before the launch window closed, but in the end called it quits for the day. Its a relatively small rocket, just 110 feet (33 meters), and wont be carrying anything for this test flight except for a memento: the first metal 3D print from the companys printers. About 85% of the rocket, named Terran, is made of 3D parts printed at the companys factory in Long Beach, California, including its engines. Relativity Space aims to increase that percentage on its future versions. SpaceXs Falcon rockets have been flying with 3D-printed parts for years, but not nearly to the extent of Relativity Spaces new rocket.

3D-printed rocket remains grounded after more launch aborts,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A rocket made almost completely of 3D-printed parts came within a half-second of blasting off Saturday on its debut flight, but remained grounded after back-to-back launch aborts. The engines ignited, but abruptly shut down, leaving Relativity Spaces rocket, named Terran, standing on its pad.  Launch controllers reset the countdown clocks and aimed for the last possible moment of the three-hour window at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. But once again, on-board flight computers halted the countdown, this time with 45 seconds remaining.  Relativity Space blamed the afternoons first problem on automation software and the second on low fuel pressure. The first launch attempt, on Wednesday, was aborted at the one-minute mark because of a bad valve. There was no immediate word on when the company might try again. At 110 feet (33 meters), the rocket is relatively small. Relativity Space said 85% of the rocket, including its engines, came out of its huge 3D printers at company headquarters in Long Beach, California.

"Four astronauts fly SpaceX back home, end 5-month mission","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four space station astronauts returned to Earth late Saturday after a quick SpaceX flight home.  Their capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast near Tampa. The U.S.-Russian-Japanese crew spent five months at the International Space Station, arriving last October. Besides dodging space junk, the astronauts had to deal with a pair of leaking Russian capsules docked to the orbiting outpost and the urgent delivery of a replacement craft for the stations other crew members.  Led by NASAs Nicole Mann, the first Native American woman to fly in space, the astronauts checked out of the station early Saturday morning. Less than 19 hours later, their Dragon capsule was bobbing in the sea as they awaited pickup. Earlier in the week, high wind and waves in the splashdown zones kept them at the station a few extra days. Their replacements arrived more than a week ago. That was one heck of a ride, Mann radioed moments after splashdown. Were happy to be home. Mann, a member of Northern Californias Wailacki of the Round Valley Indian Tribes, said she couldnt wait to feel the wind on her face, smell fresh grass and enjoy some delicious Earth food. Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata craved sushi, while Russian cosmonaut Anna Kikina yearned to drink hot tea from real cup, not from plastic bag. NASA astronaut Josh Cassadas to-do list included getting a rescue dog for his family. Please dont tell our two cats, he joked before departing the space station.

Future NASA moonwalkers to sport sleeker spacesuits,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Moonwalking astronauts will have sleeker, more flexible spacesuits that come in different sizes when they step onto the lunar surface later this decade. Exactly what that looks like remained under wraps. The company designing the next-generation spacesuits, Axiom Space, said Wednesday that it plans to have new versions for training purposes for NASA later this summer.  The moonsuits will be white like they were during NASAs Apollo program more than a half-century ago, according to the company. Thats so they can reflect heat and keep future moonwalkers cool. The suits will provide greater flexibility and more protection from the moons harsh environment, and will come in a wider range of sizes, according to the Houston-based company.  NASA awarded Axiom Space a $228.5 million contract to provide the outfits for the first moon landing in more than 50 years. The space agency is targeting late 2025 at the earliest to land two astronauts on the moons south pole. At Wednesdays event in Houston, an Axiom employee modeled a dark spacesuit, doing squats and twisting at the waist to demonstrate its flexibility. The company said the final version will be different, including the color.

NASA Webb telescope captures star on cusp of death,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Webb Space Telescope has captured the rare and fleeting phase of a star on the cusp of death. NASA released the picture Tuesday at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.  The observation was among the first made by Webb following its launch in late 2021. Its infrared eyes observed all the gas and dust flung into space by a huge, hot star 15,000 light-years away. A light-year is about 5.8 trillion miles. Shimmering in purple like a cherry blossom, the cast-off material once comprised the stars outer layer. The Hubble Space Telescope snapped a shot of the same transitioning star a few decades ago, but it appeared more like a fireball without the delicate details.  Such a transformation occurs only with some stars and normally is the last step before they explode, going supernova, according to scientists.  Weve never seen it like that before. Its really exciting, said Macarena Garcia Marin, a European Space Agency scientist who is part of the project.

Its the first day of spring: Heres what that really means,"NEW YORK (AP)  Spring has sprung!  Monday marked the spring equinox  at least for those in the Northern Hemisphere. But what does that actually mean?  As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle. For most of the year, the Earths axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the suns warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet. During the equinox, the Earths axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.  The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. Thats because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time  though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet. The spring  or vernal  equinox can land on March 19, 20 or 21, depending on the year. This year it landed on Monday at 5:24 p.m. Eastern time. There are two different ways to carve up the year: Meteorological and astronomical seasons. Meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring already started on March 1, and will run until May 31. But astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun. Equinoxes, when the sun lands equally on both hemispheres, mark the start of spring and autumn. Solstices, when the Earth sees its strongest tilt toward or away from the sun, kick off summer and winter. 
        
     For those north of the equator, daylight will keep stretching longer with earlier sunrises and later sunsets  until the summer solstice in June. The new season signals warmer weather, budding plants and migrating animals. The Southern Hemisphere will see the opposite: Days will keep getting shorter as this half of the planet heads out of summer and into autumn. According to the U.S. governments national outlook for the season, this spring is expected to bring wet weather that will continue to ease drought conditions in the western parts of the country. Melting snowpack may also bring flood risks in the Midwest. Much of the southern and eastern U.S. may see warmer than usual temperatures this spring, while parts of the Great Basin and northern Plains will likely be chillier than average. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

They werent able to crack the case of the German composers deafness or severe stomach ailments. But they did find a genetic risk for liver disease, plus a liver-damaging hepatitis B infection in the last months of his life. These factors, along with his chronic drinking, were probably enough to cause the liver failure that is widely believed to have killed him, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Current Biology. This Sunday marks the 196th anniversary of Beethovens death in Vienna on March 26, 1827, at the age of 56. The composer himself wrote that he wanted doctors to study his health problems after he died. With Beethoven in particular, it is the case that illnesses sometimes very much limited his creative work, said study author Axel Schmidt, a geneticist at University Hospital Bonn in Germany. And for physicians, it has always been a mystery what was really behind it. Since his death, scientists have long tried to piece together Beethovens medical history and have offered a variety of possible explanations for his many maladies.  Now, with advances in ancient DNA technology, researchers have been able to pull genetic clues from locks of Beethovens hair that had been snipped off and preserved as keepsakes. They focused on five locks that are almost certainly authentic, coming from the same European male, according to the study. 
        
     They also looked at three other historical locks, but werent able to confirm those were actually Beethovens. Previous tests on one of those locks suggested Beethoven had lead poisoning, but researchers concluded that sample was actually from a woman. After cleaning Beethovens hair one strand at a time, scientists dissolved the pieces into a solution and fished out chunks of DNA, said study author Tristan James Alexander Begg, a biological anthropologist at the University of Cambridge.   
        
     Getting genes out was a challenge, since DNA in hair gets chopped up into tiny fragments, explained author Johannes Krause, a paleogeneticist at Germanys Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. But eventually, after using up almost 10 feet (3 meters) of Beethovens hair, they were able to piece together a genome that they could quiz for signs of genetic disease, Krause said. While researchers didnt find any clear genetic signs of what caused Beethovens gastrointestinal issues, they found that celiac disease and lactose intolerance were unlikely causes. In the future, the genome may offer more clues as we learn more about how genes influence health, Begg said. The research also led to a surprising discovery: When they tested DNA from living members of the extended Beethoven family, scientists found a discrepancy in the Y chromosomes that get passed down on the fathers side. The Y chromosomes from the five men matched each other  but they didnt match the composers. This suggests there was an extra-pair paternity event somewhere in the generations before Beethoven was born, Begg said. In other words, a child born from an extramarital relationship in the composers family tree. The key question of what caused Beethovens hearing loss is still unanswered, said Ohio State Universitys Dr. Avraham Z. Cooper, who was not involved in the study. And it may be a difficult one to figure out, because genetics can only show us half of the nature and nurture equation that makes up our health. But he added that the mystery is part of what makes Beethoven so captivating: I think the fact that we cant know is OK, Cooper said.

"A fish can sense anothers fear, a study shows","WASHINGTON (AP)  Our capacity to care about others may have very, very ancient origins, a new study suggests. It might have been deep-rooted in prehistoric animals that lived millions of years ago, before fish and mammals like us diverged on the tree of life, according to researchers who published their study Thursday in the journal Science. Some of the mechanisms that underlie our ability to experience fear, or fall in and out of love, are clearly very ancient pathways, said Hans Hofmann, an evolutionary neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the research.  Scientists are usually reluctant to attribute humanlike feelings to animals. But its generally accepted that many animals have moods, including fish. The new study shows that fish can detect fear in other fish, and then become afraid too  and that this ability is regulated by oxytocin, the same brain chemical that underlies the capacity for empathy in humans. The researchers demonstrated this by deleting genes linked to producing and absorbing oxytocin in the brains of zebrafish, a small tropical fish often used for research. Those fish were then essentially antisocial  they failed to detect or change their behavior when other fish were anxious. But when some of the altered fish received oxytocin injections, their ability to sense and mirror the feelings of other fish was restored  what scientists call emotional contagion.  
        
     They respond to other individuals being frightened. In that regard, they behave just like us, said University of Calgary neuroscientist Ibukun Akinrinade, a co-author of the study. The study also showed that zebrafish will pay more attention to fish that have previously been stressed out  a behavior the researchers likened to consoling them. Previous research has shown that oxytocin plays a similar role in transmitting fear in mice. The new research illustrates the ancestral role of oxytocin in transmitting emotion, said Rui Oliveira, a behavioral biologist at Portugals Gulbenkian Institute of Science and a study co-author. This brain processing may have already been in place around 450 million years ago, when you and me and these little fish last had a common ancestor, explained Hofmann. Oxytocin is sometimes thought of as a love hormone, but Hofmann said its actually more like a thermostat that determines what is socially salient in a particular situation  activating neural circuits that may make you run from danger, or engage in courtship behavior. That could be fundamental to the survival of many animals, especially those who live in groups, said Stony Brook University ecologist Carl Safina, who was not involved in the study.  The most basic form of empathy is contagious fear  thats a very valuable thing to have to stay alive, if any member of your group spots a predator or some other danger. - Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

3D-printed rocket fails just after launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A rocket made almost entirely of 3D-printed parts made its launch debut Wednesday night, lifting off amid fanfare but failing three minutes into flight  far short of orbit. There was nothing aboard Relativity Spaces test flight except for the companys first metal 3D print made six years ago. The startup wanted to put the souvenir into a 125-mile-high (200-kilometer-high) orbit for several days before having it plunge through the atmosphere and burn up along with the upper stage of the rocket. As it turned out, the first stage did its job following liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and separated as planned. But the upper stage appeared to ignite and then shut down, sending it crashing into the Atlantic. It was the third launch attempt from what once was a missile site. Relativity Space came within a half-second of blasting off earlier this month, with the rockets engines igniting before abruptly shutting down. Although the upper stage malfunctioned and the mission did not reach orbit, maiden launches are always exciting and todays flight was no exception, Relativity Space launch commentator Arwa Tizani Kelly said after Wednesdays launch. Most of the 110-foot (33-meter) rocket, including its engines, came out of the companys huge 3D printers in Long Beach, California. Relativity Space said 3D-printed metal parts made up 85% of the rocket, named Terran. Larger versions of the rocket will have even more and also be reusable for multiple flights. 
        
     Other space companies also also rely on 3D-printing, but the pieces make up only a small part of their rockets. Founded in 2015 by a pair of young aerospace engineers, Relativity Space has attracted the attention of investors and venture capitalists. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Asteroid that could wipe out a city is near, but dont fear","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An asteroid big enough to wipe out a city will zip harmlessly between Earth and the moons orbit this weekend, missing both celestial bodies. Saturdays close encounter will offer astronomers the chance to study a space rock from just over 100,000 miles (168,000 kilometers) away. Thats less than half the distance from here to the moon, making it visible through binoculars and small telescopes. While asteroid flybys are common, NASA said its rare for one so big to come so close  about once a decade. Scientists estimate its size somewhere between 130 feet and 300 feet (40 meters and 90 meters). Discovered a month ago, the asteroid known as 2023 DZ2 will pass within 320,000 miles (515,000 kilometers) of the moon on Saturday and, several hours later, buzz the Indian Ocean at about 17,500 mph (28,000 kph). There is no chance of this city killer striking Earth, but its close approach offers a great opportunity for observations, the European Space Agencys planetary defense chief Richard Moissl said in a statement. Astronomers with the International Asteroid Warning Network see it as good practice for planetary defense if and when a dangerous asteroid heads our way, according to NASA. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a live webcast of the close approach.  The asteroid wont be back our way again until 2026. Although there initially seemed to be a slight chance it might strike Earth then, scientists have since ruled that out. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Bezos rocket company pins crash on overheated engine nozzle,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An overheated rocket engine nozzle caused last years Blue Origin launch failure that has grounded flights for six months, the company said Friday. Jeff Bezos rocket company Blue Origin said it expects to resume its quick trips to space from West Texas sometime later this year. The New Shepard rocket was carrying experiments but no passengers when its engine nozzle broke apart due to excessive temperatures last September.  As the rocket started veering off course a minute into flight, the escape system kicked in and the capsule catapulted off and parachuted to safety.  But the rocket came crashing down, with the wreckage confined to the designated keep-out zone.  No one was hurt and no property on the ground was damaged. All of the critical flight hardware was recovered within days. The investigation found that a design change led to the problem, which is being fixed, according to Blue Origin. The next flight will carry the experiments that were on the failed launch. It was the first launch accident for the Kent, Washington-based Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Bezos, who also started Amazon.  The company has launched 31 people to the edge of space since 2021, including Bezos and William Shatner, the original Captain Kirk of TVs Star Trek. The investigation included the Federal Aviation Administration, NASA and National Transportation Safety Board. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

A ravaged Quebec coast fights climate change by retreating,"PERCE, Quebec (AP)  Against the ravaging seas, Quebecs coastal communities have learned through bitter experience that the way to advance against climate change is to retreat. Over the past decade, civilization has been pulled back from the waters edge where possible along the eastern stretch of the Gaspe Peninsula where coastline is particularly vulnerable to erosion. Defenses erected against the sea ages ago have been dismantled, rock by rock, concrete chunk by chunk. Forillon National Park, nearly 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Perce, removed a road that the ocean turned into heaving chunks year after year as winters warmed and the shores protective sea ice vanished. In Perce, a town of several thousand that swells in summer, a manmade beach was nourished with pebbles and given to nature to sculpt. After storms wrecked the old seaside boardwalk, a new one was built farther from the water, without the concrete wall that had only added to storm wave fury.  When you try to wall off the sea, communities here learned, the sea prevails. Less destruction happens when waves have less to destroy. The idea is to move with the sea, not against it, said Marie-Dominique Nadeau-Girard, services manager at the Quebec park that encompasses the world renowned seabird sanctuary of Bonaventure Island and the enormous Perce Rock, a natural marvel and cultural touchstone that dominates the panorama. 
        
     We have to work with the elements, she said from offices of Parc national de llle-Bonaventure-et-du-Rocher-Perce. To fight nature is to realize were not going to win. So, too, at Forillon, where park ecologist Daniel Sigouin says: We decided to retreat, and let nature evolve naturally. Not every location in the world where climate change accelerates coastal erosion can roll with the punches like this. Condos crowding U.S. beachfronts arent going anywhere unless or until such seaside living becomes unsustainable.  But the Gaspe Peninsulas approach is a test case for far-flung places where strategic capitulation to nature is possible, even with historic human settlements in the mix. Along the peninsulas shores, once-dependable buffers of coastal ice in deep winter have been largely absent for a quarter century. In Perce, the ritual of trekking across ice floes to Bonaventure, 3 kilometers (almost 2 miles) from the town, hasnt been possible for several decades. It is probable, said meteorologist George Karaganis of the Canadian Ice Service, that 20 or 30 years on, those people who walked to Bonaventure Island will all be gone  people will never remember walking to Bonaventure. The story of modern Canadian winters, indeed all seasons, is one of disruption attributed to warming temperatures and rising seas. Historical warming has led to changes in rain and snow, rivers and lakes, ice, and coastal zones, said the Canadian governments 2019 climate report, and these changes are challenging our sense of what a normal climate is. At Forillon, Sigouin is author of a recent report on a seven-year project to adapt the park to climate change. In winter, there was always ice cover from December to late March, he said. That ice cover was protecting the coast from coastal erosion. But as temperatures are getting higher and higher, in that area, theres almost no ice anymore. As ice is less and less present, we have seen more and more the effect of coastal erosion. In the project at Forillon to yield to the coasts natural rhythms, officials also were mindful of preserving  and honoring  the human imprint. The peninsula is lightly populated and has much less wealth than the maritime playgrounds of the U.S. Atlantic coast. But its central in the founding of New France  French explorer Jacques Cartier made landfall in the early 1500s and colonists settled coastal hamlets in the late 1700s. The park is where the Irish Monument stands  recently relocated farther inIand  in memory of the 120 to 150 lives lost when the Carricks, an Irish ship bound for the St. Lawrence River, ran aground off the coast of Cap-des-Rosiers on April 28, 1847. For all of that history, the Forillon climate project still was able to eliminate infrastructure along 80% of the coastline. In addition to removing a road, relocating the monument and rehabilitating natural habitats, the park took away stacks of large rocks known as riprap  a common defense for seaside roads and facilities that has come to be seen as part of the problem. Then there is the Perce Rock, immortalized by explorers back to the 1500s and artists and poets ever since. It stands as testament to the natural processes of erosion even without climate change. The massive formation sheds hundreds of tons each year. Where once there were at least three arches, now there is only one, and some distant day the pierced rock itself will disappear. The picturesque town, though, is grappling with more immediate consequences of global warming. In Perce, violent weather in 2016 convinced officials that the old ways of holding back the sea would not do. By then it had become apparent rigid structures such as the towns damaged seawall often made the risks of destruction worse. Rather than absorbing wave energy, seawalls and riprap can create backwash that collides with incoming waves, engineers realized, setting off supercharged turbulence that chews away at shoreline protection. In Perces areas where rigid protections had been built over generations, the width of beaches decreased by about 70%.  In 2017, with such obstacles largely gone, 7,500 truckloads of coarse pebbles, like ones found naturally on the regions beaches, were deposited at the towns South Cove and left for the sea to arrange in a gentle slope. Officials project that the coves rehabilitation will last 40 to 50 years. But who really knows? Beyond the next few decades, the largest uncertainty about the magnitude of future climate change is rooted in uncertainty about human behaviour, says the 2019 Canadian study  namely whether the world will follow a pathway of low, medium or high emissions. Until climate is stabilized, it says, there will not be a new normal climate. ___ Larson reported from Washington.",https://apnews.com/article/442b24a9317c6f2a92aa91f90f2434eb,science
"Historic biodiversity pact inspires, but past failures loom","MONTREAL (AP)  A day after negotiators reached a landmark biodiversity agreement, the pressure was already growing on countries, business leaders and the environmental community to deliver on its ambitious promises to protect the planet  and not repeat the failures of past deals. Delegates expressed optimism Tuesday in Montreal that this time will be different, mostly due to greater financing provisions in the global biodiversity framework and stronger language around reporting, measuring and verifying progress by nations. There is also growing public awareness about threats facing rainforests, oceans and other ecologically important areas. Weve seen unprecedented mobilization for biodiversity protection, Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault said at the closing press conference of the United Nations Biodiversity Conference. The fact that Canada, the EU and many others would agree to double by 2025 and triple by 2030 our funding is a clear sign.  The most significant part of the agreement is a commitment to protect 30% of the worlds land and water considered important for biodiversity by 2030, known as 30 by 30. Currently, 17% of terrestrial and 10% of marine areas are protected.  The deal also calls for raising $200 billion by 2030 for biodiversity from a range of sources and working to phase out or reform subsidies that could provide another $500 billion for nature. As part of the financing package, the framework asks for increasing to at least $20 billion annually by 2025 the money that goes to poor countries. That number would increase to $30 billion each year by 2030. 
        
     The challenge now will be making good on those commitments. The new framework is the equivalent of simply agreeing on the to-do list  now the hard work must begin to ensure it gets done, said Terry Townshend, a Beijing-based fellow for the Paulson Institute, which had previously estimated the annual shortfall in biodiversity funding to be around $700 billion. The last time around, countries failed to fully achieve any of the targets in the previous 10-year agreement and only partially achieved six by 2020. The failures prompted some to question whether it was even worth setting more ambitious targets this time around. Some complained the past targets were too vague while others cited the delays of several years in setting up a reporting mechanism. There was also much less money in that deal. But the new targets are more precise and cover a wider array of issues affecting biodiversity, including pollution, invasive species and pesticides. There is also clearer language for protecting the rights of Indigenous communities and respecting their role in biodiversity decisions. U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press that part of the problem with targets set in 2010 was that negotiators were all inside the environmental bubble when agreeing to a framework. At this point, there is a global conversation happening, Andersen said. I would say the difference between these 12 years is that there is a broader societal engagement. Some countries will lean in and will get closer to those targets that weve now set, some will surpass them. Others may not. As part the framework, the nearly 190 parties are requested to update their national biodiversity strategies to with the targets and goals reached in Montreal. Those will be reviewed at COP16 in Turkey in 2024 to assess progress, challenges countries face and the progress on getting financing into the hands of developing countries. Global governments have clearly established specific, numerical targets to restore degraded land and habitat and similarly to expand protected areas, said Eliot Whittington, director of policy at the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm said these targets provide governments and civil society with a measure of whether we succeed or not. The devil is always in the details, said Pimm. Promises are made and not always fulfilled, but we do understand that money has to be involved. If were going to stop deforestation in Brazil and the Congo and Indonesia, its going to need some financing from richer countries. But others said the agreement fell short in setting up a strong system of monitoring country progress, meaning that it will be the responsibility of credible, independent third parties to measure progress. Countries failure to set robust systems in place for monitoring progress on the biodiversity targets is one notable weakness in the outcome, said Craig Hanson, managing director for programs for the nonprofit World Resources Institute. Monitoring progress with robust, credible systems is critical to ensuring that countries actions are delivering the intended impact and unlocking finance for nature-based solutions. Others praised the language in the document covering the private sector. It calls for legal and administrative policies that enable business, especially larger and transnational companies, to regularly monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity.  The target on corporate disclosure of biodiversity risk also sends a powerful signal to the private sector that it must adjust its business models and investment strategies towards a nature-positive economy, said the Paulson Institutes Townshend. But some environmental groups suggested big business had taken the conference hostage and that the language related to corporations was little more than greenwashing. The text does not stipulate any regulation on corporations and instead promotes greenwashing measures such as Nature-Based Solutions, which allow for offsetting for environmental destruction, Nele Marien, Friends of the Earth Internationals forests & biodiversity coordinator, said in a statement.  Kaddu Sebunya, CEO of African Wildlife Foundation, said the new agreement provides a basis for many of the changes we need in conservation, especially in the way conservation is financed. Nearly a third of the worlds biodiversity exists in Africa, although Africa receives less than 4% of global biodiversity financing, Sebunya said. That needs to be changed, he said, adding that the new framework could help jumpstart the change. ___ Larson reported from Washington, D.C. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Glass act: Scientists reveal secrets of frog transparency,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Now you see them, now you dont.  Some frogs found in South and Central America have the rare ability to turn on and off their nearly transparent appearance, researchers report Thursday in the journal Science.  During the day, these nocturnal frogs sleep by hanging underneath tree leaves. Their delicate, greenish transparent forms dont cast shadows, rendering them almost invisible to birds and other predators passing overhead or underneath.  But when northern glass frogs wake up and hop around in search of insects and mates, they take on an opaque reddish-brown color. When theyre transparent, its for their safety, said Junjie Yao, a Duke University biomedical engineer and study co-author. When theyre awake, they can actively evade predators, but when theyre sleeping and most vulnerable, they have adapted to remain hidden.  Using light and ultrasound imaging technology, the researchers discovered the secret: While asleep, the frogs concentrate, or hide, nearly 90% of their red blood cells in their liver.  Because they have transparent skin and other tissues, its the blood circulating through their bodies that would otherwise give them away. The frogs also shrink and pack together most of their internal organs, Yao said.  The research beautifully explains how glass frogs conceal blood in the liver to maintain transparency, said Juan Manuel Guayasamin, a frog biologist at University San Francisco of Quito, Ecuador, who was not involved in the study.  
        
     Exactly how they do this, and why it doesnt kill them, remains a mystery. For most animals, having very little blood circulating oxygen for several hours would be deadly. And concentrating blood so tightly would result in fatal clotting. But somehow, the frogs survive. Further research on the species could provide useful clues for the development of anti-blood clotting medications, said Carlos Taboada, a Duke University biologist and study co-author.  Only a few animals, mostly ocean dwellers, are naturally transparent, said Oxford University biologist Richard White, who was not involved in the study. Transparency is super rare in nature, and in land animals, its essentially unheard of outside of the glass frog, White said. Those that are transparent include some fish, shrimp, jellyfish, worms and insects  none of which move large quantities of red blood through their bodies. The trick of hiding blood while sleeping appears to be unique to the frogs.  Its just this really amazing, dynamic form of camouflage, said White. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"EXPLAINER: Arctic blast sweeps US, causes bomb cyclone","NEW YORK (AP)  An arctic blast has brought extreme cold, heavy snow and intense wind across much of the U.S.  just in time for the holidays. The weather system, dubbed a bomb cyclone, is disrupting travel and causing hazardous winter conditions. Where is this winter weather coming from, and whats in store for the coming days? WHATS HAPPENING? A front of cold air is moving down from the Arctic, sending temperatures plunging. Much of the U.S. will see below-average temperatures, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland. Temperatures may drop by more than 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) in just a few hours, the National Weather Service predicts. Wind chill temperatures could drop to dangerous lows far below zero  enough to cause frostbite within minutes. In parts of the Plains, the wind chill could dip as low as minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 57 Celsius). Those in the Plains, the Upper Midwest and the Great Lakes were cautioned to expect blizzard conditions as heavy winds whip up the snow, according to the National Weather Service. WHO WILL BE AFFECTED? Pretty much everyone east of the Rockies  around two-thirds of the country  will see extreme weather, said Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist in the Atlanta area. Though much of the West Coast will be shielded from the cold, the Arctic front is expected to pass east and south all the way through Florida. 
        
     Heavy snowfall and intense winds could be bad news for air travel, Oravec said. And for those planning to hit the road for the holidays, youre going to have pretty serious whiteout conditions, Maue cautioned. HOW LONG WILL IT LAST? This weather system is expected to bring some major weather whiplash, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research.  The cold isnt going to stick around for long. After the dramatic plunge that will keep temperatures low for about a week, everything will snap back to normal, Cohen said. Shortly after Christmas, temperatures are expected to start to warm up again, moving from west to east. They are likely to remain near normal through the end of the year in most of the U.S. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? It all started farther north, as frigid air collected over the snow-covered ground in the Arctic, Maue said. Then the jet stream  wobbling air currents in the middle and upper parts of the atmosphere  began pushing this cold pool down into the U.S.  As this arctic air is pushed into the warmer, moister air ahead of it, the system can quickly develop into serious weather  including whats known as a bomb cyclone, a fast-developing storm in which atmospheric pressure falls very quickly over 24 hours. These severe weather events usually form over bodies of water, which have lots of warmth and moisture to feed the storm, Maue said. But with the huge amount of cold air coming through, we could see a rare bomb cyclone forming over land. IS THIS NORMAL? The storm is definitely a strong one, but not unheard of for the winter seasons, Oravec said. Its pretty normal to have cold air build up in the winter. This week, though, shifts in the jet stream have pushed the air more to the southeast than usual, Oravec said  sweeping the freeze across the country and making storm conditions more intense. The U.S. probably wont reach record-breaking lows, like those seen in the cold snap of 1983 or the polar vortex of 2014, Maue said. Still, for most people alive, this will be a memorable, top-10 extreme cold event, Maue said.

"As COVID surges in China, US begins testing more travelers","NEWARK, N.J. (AP)  Shubham Chandra knows how dangerous the coronavirus can be: He lost his dad during the pandemic. So when he cleared customs at Newark Liberty International Airport and saw people offering anonymous COVID-19 testing, he was happy to volunteer. Its a minimum amount of effort to help a lot of people, said the 27-year-old New York City man, who had just stepped off a plane from Cancun, Mexico. The airport testing is part of the governments early warning system for detecting new variants, which began expanding recently in the wake of a COVID-19 surge in China. With the addition of Los Angeles and Seattle, there are now seven airports where arriving passengers can volunteer for COVID-19 tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program now covers about 500 flights from at least 30 countries, including more than half from China and surrounding areas.  As of Thursday, the CDC is also requiring travelers to the U.S. from China, Hong Kong and Macao to take a COVID-19 test no more than two days before travel and provide a negative result before boarding a flight. And down the road, some scientists are calling for wider use of an additional strategy: screening wastewater from toilet tanks on arriving airplanes. Without surveillance, its very hard to know whats going on, said Dr. Stuart Campbell Ray, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University. Hopefully, with more sampling, we will get more information about whats circulating. 
        
     Some scientists are worried the COVID-19 surge in China could unleash a new coronavirus mutant on the world, since every infection is another chance for the virus to change. Theres no sign of a new variant from China at this point. But one reason for new testing requirements, according to the CDC, is a lack of adequate and transparent information from China on viral strains infecting people there. We have very little control over what happens elsewhere, said epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina, a consultant to the CDC. What we can control is whats happening in the United States. The airport program is based on an unfortunate reality: Travelers  go across the globe quickly and they can get and spread infectious diseases really fast, said Dr. Cindy Friedman, chief of CDCs travelers health branch. Friedman said the program is a partnership with two companies that take care of the testing and lab work  XpresCheck and Concentric by Ginkgo. A pilot program was expanded around the time the first omicron variant emerged in the U.S. more than a year ago. Besides Newark, Seattle and Los Angeles, the program includes New Yorks Kennedy, Washingtons Dulles and airports in Atlanta and San Francisco.  The latest expansion of the traveler surveillance program aims to capture more flights from China. But on Wednesday in Newark, some of the targeted planes arrived from Mexico, France and Belgium. After clearing customs, travelers could stop at a table, swab their noses and fill out a form. Chandra said it took about a minute. Like other travelers, he wont get the results. But he tests for COVID-19 when he flies to Ohio every other month to see his mom, he said, since the last thing I want to do is bring (the virus) home to her. About 10% of people on targeted flights volunteer. Their samples are pooled and PCR tested. Positive ones are genetically sequenced. Volunteers get free home COVID-19 tests. Over time, Friedman expects the program to grow and potentially go global. Its already shown it can spot coronavirus variants early  detecting omicron variants BA.2 and BA.3 and reporting them to a global database weeks before others did. But Jetelina said a surveillance program at seven airports is just not that big so trying to spot variants might be like looking for a needle in the haystack. To aid the search, experts suggest taking more samples from airplane bathrooms. Its a little gross when you start thinking about it, Jetelina said. But these are really long flights and we would expect the majority of people would go to the bathroom. The CDC, which monitors wastewater in municipal systems, ran a pilot program last summer testing airplane wastewater at Kennedy airport. Friedman said the agency is working to expand this type of surveillance. Such testing has been used elsewhere. A study last year in the journal Environment International looked at wastewater testing from 37 flights chartered to bring Australians home earlier in the pandemic, concluding that the practice can provide an additional and effective tool for monitoring the virus coming into a country. Recently, Canada announced an expanded wastewater pilot program and Belgium said it would test wastewater from airplanes coming from China. As surveillance continues, scientists believe that the omicron variant BF.7, which is extremely adept at evading immunity, is driving Chinas current surge. CDC data shows BF.7 is already in the U.S., and currently accounts for about 2% of COVID-19 cases. The most prevalent mutant in the U.S. is XBB.1.5, another variant responsible for 41% of U.S. cases. Ray said this one attaches more tightly than its competitors to a receptor that allows viruses to enter a cell. Scientists said the virus will surely keep evolving  which is why they need to keep searching for new variants. The coronavirus is like a predator stalking humanity, Ray said, and the predator adapts to the prey. ___ Ungar reported from Louisville, Kentucky. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Old NASA satellite falling from sky this weekend, low threat","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A 38-year-old retired NASA satellite is about to fall from the sky. NASA said Friday the chance of wreckage falling on anybody is very low. Most of the 5,400-pound (2,450-kilogram) satellite will burn up upon reentry, according to NASA. But some pieces are expected to survive. The space agency put the odds of injury from falling debris at about 1-in-9,400. The science satellite is expected to come down Sunday night, give or take 17 hours, according to the Defense Department.  The California-based Aerospace Corp., however is targeting Monday morning, give or take 13 hours, along a track passing over Africa, Asia the Middle East and the westernmost areas of North and South America.  .The Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, known as ERBS, was launched in 1984 aboard space shuttle Challenger. Although its expected working lifetime was two years, the satellite kept making ozone and other atmospheric measurements until its retirement in 2005. The satellite studied how Earth absorbed and radiated energy from the sun. The satellite got a special sendoff from Challenger. Americas first woman in space, Sally Ride, released the satellite into orbit using the shuttles robot arm. That same mission also featured the first spacewalk by a U.S. woman: Kathryn Sullivan. It was the first time two female astronauts flew in space together. It was the second and final spaceflight for Ride, who died in 2012. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Old NASA satellite falls harmlessly from sky off Alaska,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  After almost 40 years circling Earth, a retired NASA science satellite plunged harmlessly through the atmosphere off the coast of Alaska, NASA reported Monday. The Defense Department confirmed that the satellite  placed in orbit in 1984 by astronaut Sally Ride  reentered late Sunday night over the Bering Sea, a few hundred miles from Alaska. NASA said its received no reports of injury or damage from falling debris. Late last week, NASA said it expected most of the 5,400-pound (2,450-kilogram) Earth Radiation Budget Satellite to burn up in the atmosphere, but that some pieces might survive. The space agency put the odds of falling debris injuring someone at 1-in-9,400. Space shuttle Challenger carried the satellite into orbit and the first American woman in space set it free. The satellite measured ozone in the atmosphere and studied how Earth absorbed and radiated energy from the sun, before being retired in 2005, well beyond its expected working lifetime.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Russia will launch new capsule to return space station crew,"MOSCOW (AP)  Russia will send up a new capsule next month to bring back three space station crew members whose original ride home was damaged, officials said Wednesday.  The two Russians and one American will stay several extra months at the International Space Station as a result of the capsule switch, possibly pushing their mission to close to a year, NASA and Russian space officials told reporters. Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, and astronaut Frank Rubio were supposed to return in March in the same Soyuz capsule that took them up last September. But that capsule was hit by a tiny meteoroid on Dec. 14, creating a small hole in the exterior radiator and sending coolant spewing into space.  Sergei Krikalev, head of human spaceflight for the Russian Space Agency, said barring an emergency at the space station, it would be too dangerous for the crew to use that capsule to return to Earth.  Although Russian engineers believe the capsule could survive reentry and land safely, the cabin temperature could reach the low 40s Celsius (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity because it couldnt shed heat generated by a computer and other electronics, noted Krikalev, a former cosmonaut.  The new Soyuz capsule will be launched from Kazakhstan on Feb. 20, a month earlier than planned. No one will be on board; the capsule will fly in automatic mode, Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Borisov announced earlier in the day. The original plan was to launch this new Soyuz in March with two Russians and one American, replacements for the three already up there. This new crew will now have to wait until late summer or fall to fly when another capsule is ready for them.  
        
     Russia will eventually bring back the damaged capsule with only science samples on board. NASA took part in all the discussions and agreed with the plan. Right now, the crew is safe on board space station, said NASAs space station program manager Joel Montalbano. Theres no immediate need for the crew to come home today. Backup plans are in the works, according to Montalbano and Krikalev, in case an emergency forces the seven space station residents to flee before the new Soyuz can be launched  like a fire or decompression. NASA is looking at the possibility of adding extra crew to the SpaceX capsule currently docked at the station. Neither Krikalev nor Montalbano could recall a similar case in which a substitute spacecraft needed to be quickly launched. Borisov said analysis confirmed the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid, not a piece of spacecraft debris or manufacturing defect. The resulting hole was about 1 millimeter in size or less than one-tenth of an inch. Montalbano said the three crew members took the news in stride. I may have to find some more ice cream to reward them on future cargo deliveries, he told reporters. Besides Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, the space station is home to NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada; Russian Anna Kikina and Japans Koichi Wakata. The four rode up on a SpaceX capsule last October. ___ Dunn reported from Cape Canaveral, Florida. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Moving species emerges as last resort as climate warms,"In a desperate effort to save a seabird species in Hawaii from rising ocean waters, scientists are moving chicks to a new island hundreds of miles away. Moving species to save them  once considered taboo  is quickly gaining traction as climate change upends habitats. Similar relocations are being suggested for birds, lizards, butterflies and even flowers. Concerns persist that the novel practice could cause unintended harm the same way invasive plants and animals have wreaked havoc on native species. But for the Tristrams storm petrels on northeastern Hawaiis Tern Island, which is just 6 feet (1.8 meters) above sea level, the relocation of about 40 chicks to artificial burrows more than 500 miles (805 kilometers) away on Oahu could offer new hope. The species is considered vulnerable to extinction, and the goal is for the young petrels return to their new home when old enough to breed. Tern Island is washing away, said biologist Eric VanderWerf of the nonprofit Pacific Rim Conservation. Climate change is causing a greater need for this  for taking a species outside its known historical range. A pending change to the U.S. Endangered Species Act by the Biden administration would make it easier to relocate some of the most imperiled species to places where theyve not previously been recorded.  In response, state wildlife officials and scientists have suggested moving a portion of some species struggling with climate change, including Key deer of southern Florida, the Karner blue butterfly of the Midwest and Northeast, desert flowers in Nevada and California and the St. Croix ground lizard in the Virgin Islands.  
        
     Republicans in western states  including Montana, New Mexico and Arizona  are against the proposal saying it could wreak ecological havoc as invasive species get purposefully introduced. The proposal, which federal officials expect to finalize in June, reflects a fundamental shift in the way we think of species protection and conservation, said University of Notre Dame biologist Jason McLachlan. The issue goes beyond endangered species, McLachlan said, and raises questions about what should be considered native now that shifting temperatures are pushing some species to higher elevations or toward the planets poles. Comparable temperature shifts in the past occurred over millennia, but the present one is happening over just decades and is drastically upending ecosystems. Eventually were going to have to start thinking about it in ways that will make people  including me  uncomfortable, he said. To say this species is OK and this species is not OK, thats asking a lot of human beings. To save storm petrels, VanderWerf said, scientists need to act before populations have crashed. In 30 years, these birds will certainly be rare, if we dont do something about it, he said. Relocation of species outside historical ranges is still a rarity, but U.S. wildlife officials have identified numerous threatened and endangered plants and animals already being affected by climate change: glacial stoneflies in Montana, emperor penguins in Antarctica, the Mt. Rainier ptarmigan, the saltmarsh sparrow of the Atlantic coast and numerous birds of Hawaii. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson Karen Armstrong said there are no current proposals to establish new populations of those particular species. In the future, some species ranges may shift due to climate change, or their current habitats might become unsuitable due to invasive species encroachment, Armstrong said in an email. We view experimental population establishment outside of their historical ranges as a potential tool for their management and conservation. One plan now being considered by U.S. wildlife officials concerns birds native to Guam, where kingfishers were decimated by brown tree snakes accidentally brought to the island around 1950 on military cargo ships.  The last 29 wild Guam kingfishers were captured in the 1980s and have been bred in captivity to buy time. Under a pending proposal, nine kingfishers would be released back into the wild beginning this year on Palmyra Island, more than 3,600 miles (5,800 kilometers) away. If a relocation is successful, the kingfishers would become one of the few species ever upgraded from extinct in the wild to critically endangered.  The hope is that the Guam kingfisher, also known locally as sihek, will eventually be returned to their native island, if the tree snake is controlled, said Erica Royer, a bird expert at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C. This kind of intensive management is necessary for us to have a reasonable shot at holding onto some species, said Don Lyons with National Audubon Societys Seabird Institute. Yet the potential danger  and scientific debate  lies in what humans cant predict. Humanity has been moving species around for centuries, often inadvertently and sometimes causing great harm. Examples abound: Asian carp have spread through rivers and streams across the U.S. Starlings from Europe destroy crops and drive out songbirds. Zebra mussels from Eurasia decimate native populations. And kudzu vines from Japan planted to stabilize soils have spread to dozens of states where they choke out other plants. Scientist Mark Schwartz at the University of California, Davis said he was initially skeptical of moving species for conservation when biologists began discussing the idea about a decade ago. The rapid rate of extinctions more recently has him thinking that sitting idle could be a costly error. Many, many species must be moved or could go extinct, said James Watson, a conservation scientist at the University of Queensland in Australia, where increasingly severe, climate-fueled wildfires have forced conversations on relocations. Unprecedented fires three years ago likely destroyed the last habitats of some endangered species, he said.  Weve already played Russian Roulette with the climate, were already on that ski run  we might as well take some more risks. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina and Matthew Brown: @MatthewBrownAP ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Say cheese! Galactic photo shoot captures 3 billion stars,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A galactic photo shoot has captured more than 3 billion stars and galaxies in one of the biggest sky surveys ever.  A dark-energy camera on a telescope in Chile made the observations over two years, focusing on the Southern Hemisphere sky. The National Science Foundations NOIRLab released the survey results this week.  Shown in remarkable detail, most of these Milky Way objects are stars. The count also includes small, distant galaxies that may have been mistaken as individual stars.  Its like taking a group shot and being able to distinguish not only each individual, but the color of their shirt, said lead researcher Andrew Saydjari, a doctoral candidate in physics at Harvard University. Despite many hours of staring at images containing tens of thousands of stars, I am not sure my mind has wrapped around the magnitude of these numbers, Saydjari said in an email.  This latest survey now covers 6.5% of the night sky, according to the researchers. It includes the results of a survey released in 2017 that catalogued 2 billion celestial objects, mostly stars. With hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way, the cosmic catalog is certain to grow. No further updates are planned for this particular survey, Saydjari said, but upcoming telescopes will tackle even larger areas of the sky. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Twinkle, twinkle fading stars: Hiding in our brighter skies","WASHINGTON (AP)  Every year, the night sky grows brighter, and the stars look dimmer.  A new study that analyzes data from more than 50,000 amateur stargazers finds that artificial lighting is making the night sky about 10% brighter each year. Thats a much faster rate of change than scientists had previously estimated looking at satellite data. The research, which includes data from 2011 to 2022, is published Thursday in the journal Science.  We are losing, year by year, the possibility to see the stars, said Fabio Falchi, a physicist at the University of Santiago de Compostela, who was not involved in the study.  If you can still see the dimmest stars, you are in a very dark place. But if you see only the brightest ones, you are in a very light-polluted place, he said. As cities expand and put up more lights, skyglow or artificial twilight, as the study authors call it, becomes more intense. The 10% annual change is a lot bigger than I expected  something youll notice clearly within a lifetime, said Christopher Kyba, a study co-author and physicist at the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. Kyba and his colleagues gave this example: A child is born where 250 stars are visible on a clear night. By the time that child turns 18, only 100 stars are still visible. This is real pollution, affecting people and wildlife, said Kyba, who said he hoped that policymakers would do more to curb light pollution. Some localities have set limits. 
        
     The study data from amateur stargazers in the nonprofit Globe at Night project was collected in a similar fashion. Volunteers look for the constellation Orion  remember the three stars of his belt  and match what they see in the night sky to a series of charts showing an increasing number of surrounding stars.  Prior studies of artificial lighting, which used satellite images of the Earth at night, had estimated the annual increase in sky brightness to be about 2% a year. But the satellites used arent able to detect light with wavelengths toward the blue end of the spectrum  including the light emitted by energy-efficient LED bulbs.  More than half of the new outdoor lights installed in the United States in the past decade have been LED lights, according to the researchers. The satellites are also better at detecting light that scatters upward, like a spotlight, than light that scatters horizontally, like the glow of an illuminated billboard at night, said Kyba. Skyglow disrupts human circadian rhythms, as well as other forms of life, said Georgetown biologist Emily Williams, who was not part of the study.  Migratory songbirds normally use starlight to orient where they are in the sky at night, she said. And when sea turtle babies hatch, they use light to orient toward the ocean  light pollution is a huge deal for them.  Part of whats being lost is a universal human experience, said Falchi, the physicist at University of Santiago de Compostela. The night sky has been, for all the generations before ours, a source of inspiration for art, science, literature, he said. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at: larsonchristina  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

First Native American woman in space steps out on spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The first Native American woman in space ventured out on a spacewalk Friday to prep the International Space Station for more solar panels. NASA astronaut Nicole Mann emerged alongside Japans Koichi Wakata, lugging an equipment bag. Their job was to install support struts and brackets for new solar panels launching this summer, part of a continuing effort by NASA to expand the space stations power grid.  Mann, a Marine colonel and test pilot, rocketed into orbit last fall with SpaceX, becoming the first Native American woman in space. She is a member of the Wailacki of the Round Valley Indian Tribes in Northern California.  Wakata, Japans spaceflight leader with five missions, also flew up on SpaceX. He helped build the station during the shuttle era.  Friday was the first spacewalk for both.

"Asteroid coming exceedingly close to Earth, but will miss","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An asteroid the size of a delivery truck will whip past Earth on Thursday night, one of the closest such encounters ever recorded. NASA insists it will be a near miss with no chance of the asteroid hitting Earth. NASA said Wednesday that this newly discovered asteroid will zoom 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) above the southern tip of South America. Thats 10 times closer than the bevy of communication satellites circling overhead.  The closest approach will occur at 7:27 p.m. EST (9:27 p.m. local.) Even if the space rock came a lot closer, scientists said most of it would burn up in the atmosphere, with some of the bigger pieces possibly falling as meteorites. NASAs impact hazard assessment system, called Scout, quickly ruled out a strike, said its developer, Davide Farnocchia, an engineer at the agencys Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. But despite the very few observations, it was nonetheless able to predict that the asteroid would make an extraordinarily close approach with Earth, Farnocchia said in a statement. In fact, this is one of the closest approaches by a known near-Earth object ever recorded. Discovered Saturday, the asteroid known as 2023 BU is believed to be between 11 feet (3.5 meters) and 28 feet (8.5 meters) feet across. It was first spotted by the same amateur astronomer in Crimea, Gennady Borisov, who discovered an interstellar comet in 2019. Within a few days, dozens of observations were made by astronomers around the world, allowing them to refine the asteroids orbit. 
        
     The asteroids path drastically will be altered by Earths gravity once it zips by. Instead of circling the sun every 359 days, it will move into an oval orbit lasting 425 days, according to NASA. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA marks 20 years since space shuttle Columbia disaster,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA marked the 20th anniversary of the space shuttle Columbia tragedy with somber ceremonies and remembrances during its annual tribute to fallen astronauts on Thursday.  More than 100 people gathered under a gray sky at Kennedy Space Center to remember not only Columbias crew of seven, but the 18 other astronauts killed in the line of duty. NASAs two shuttle accidents account for more than half of the names carved into the black granite of the Space Mirror Memorial; plane crashes are to blame for the rest.  None of the Columbia astronaut family members attended the morning ceremony. But Zvi Konikov, a local rabbi, recalled how Israels first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, asked him before the flight how to observe the Sabbath during two weeks in orbit with multiple sunsets a day.  Ilan taught us a powerful message. No matter how fast were going, no matter how important our work, we must pause and think about why were here on Earth, and thats what were doing today. We pause to recall the memory of all those courageous souls, said Konikov.  Columbia was destroyed during reentry on Feb. 1, 2003, after a piece of fuel-tank foam came off and punctured the left wing during liftoff 16 days earlier. The shuttle broke apart over Texas, just 16 minutes from its planned Florida touchdown. NASA managers dismissed the impact during the flight despite the concerns of others. That same kind of cultural blunder led to the loss of shuttle Challenger during liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven aboard, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. 
        
     The Apollo 1 launch pad fire claimed three astronauts lives on Jan. 27, 1967. Because of the clustering of these three dates, NASA sets aside the last Thursday of every January to commemorate its fallen astronauts. At space centers across the country, flags were lowered to half-staff, with ceremonies held along with spaceflight safety discussions. Like NASAs earlier tragedies, Columbias loss was avoidable, said former shuttle commander Bob Cabana, now NASAs associate administrator. When we look back, why do we have to keep repeating the same hard lessons? he said. I dont ever want to have to go through another Columbia. Besides Ramon, Columbias last crew included commander Rick Husband, pilot Willie McCool, Michael Anderson, Kalpana Chawla, David Brown and Laurel Clark.  A ships bell pealed after each of the 25 names were read as the ceremony drew to a close. Bob and Diane Kalander interrupted their sailing trip from their home in Jamestown, Rhode Island, to Floridas Key West to honor the lost shuttle crews. Their daughter and her boyfriend joined them at Kennedy. Its fading from peoples memory, Diane Kalander said. Theres been a de-emphasis on space because people say, Lets worry about problems on Earth as opposed to the future. Weve got to look toward the future. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Green comet zooming our way, last visited 50,000 years ago","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A comet is streaking back our way after 50,000 years. The dirty snowball last visited during Neanderthal times, according to NASA. It will come within 26 million miles (42 million kilometers) of Earth Wednesday before speeding away again, unlikely to return for millions of years. So do look up, contrary to the title of the killer-comet movie Dont Look Up. Discovered less than a year ago, this harmless green comet already is visible in the northern night sky with binoculars and small telescopes, and possibly the naked eye in the darkest corners of the Northern Hemisphere. Its expected to brighten as it draws closer and rises higher over the horizon through the end of January, best seen in the predawn hours. By Feb. 10, it will be near Mars, a good landmark.  Skygazers in the Southern Hemisphere will have to wait until next month for a glimpse. While plenty of comets have graced the sky over the past year, this one seems probably a little bit bigger and therefore a little bit brighter and its coming a little bit closer to the Earths orbit, said NASAs comet and asteroid-tracking guru, Paul Chodas.  Green from all the carbon in the gas cloud, or coma, surrounding the nucleus, this long-period comet was discovered last March by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility, a wide field camera at Caltechs Palomar Observatory. That explains its official, cumbersome name: comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF). 
        
     On Wednesday, it will hurtle between the orbits of Earth and Mars at a relative speed of 128,500 mph (207,000 kilometers). Its nucleus is thought to be about a mile (1.6 kilometers) across, with its tails extending millions of miles (kilometers).  The comet isnt expected to be nearly as bright as Neowise in 2020, or Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the mid to late 1990s.  But it will be bright by virtue of its close Earth passage ... which allows scientists to do more experiments and the public to be able to see a beautiful comet, University of Hawaii astronomer Karen Meech said in an email. Scientists are confident in their orbital calculations putting the comets last swing through the solar systems planetary neighborhood at 50,000 years ago. But they dont know how close it came to Earth or whether it was even visible to the Neanderthals, said Chodas, director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.  When it returns, though, is tougher to judge.  Every time the comet skirts the sun and planets, their gravitational tugs alter the iceballs path ever so slightly, leading to major course changes over time. Another wild card: jets of dust and gas streaming off the comet as it heats up near the sun.  We dont really know exactly how much they are pushing this comet around, Chodas said. The comet  a time capsule from the emerging solar system 4.5 billion years ago  came from whats known as the Oort Cloud well beyond Pluto. This deep-freeze haven for comets is believed to stretch more than one-quarter of the way to the next star.  While comet ZTF originated in our solar system, we cant be sure it will stay there, Chodas said. If it gets booted out of the solar system, it will never return, he added. Dont fret if you miss it. In the comet business, you just wait for the next one because there are dozens of these, Chodas said. And the next one might be bigger, might be brighter, might be closer. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"Dolphins, humans both benefit from fishing collaboration","A fishing community in southern Brazil has an unusual ally: wild dolphins.  Accounts of people and dolphins working together to hunt fish go back millennia, from the time of the Roman Empire near what is now southern France to 19th century Queensland, Australia. But while historians and storytellers have recounted the human point of view, its been impossible to confirm how the dolphins have benefited  or if theyve been taken advantage of  before sonar and underwater microphones could track them underwater. In the seaside city of Laguna, scientists have, for the first time, used drones, underwater sound recordings and other tools to document how local people and dolphins coordinate actions and benefit from each others labor. The most successful humans and dolphins are skilled at reading each others body language. The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Laguna residents work with wild bottlenose dolphins to catch schools of migratory silver fish called mullet. Its a locally famous alliance that has been recorded in newspaper records going back 150 years.  This study clearly shows that both dolphins and humans are paying attention to each others behavior, and that dolphins provide a cue to when the nets should be cast, said Stephanie King, a biologist who studies dolphin communication at the University of Bristol and was not involved in the research.  
        
     This is really incredible cooperative behavior, she added. By working with the dolphins, the people catch more fish, and the dolphins are more successful in foraging, too.  Dolphins and humans are both highly intelligent and long-lived social animals. But when it comes to fishing, they have different abilities. The water is really murky here, so the people cant see the schools of fish. But the dolphins use sounds to find them, by emitting small clicks, much as bats use echolocation, said Mauricio Cantor, an Oregon State University marine biologist and study co-author.  As the dolphins herd the fish toward the coast, the people run into the water holding hand nets.  They wait for dolphins to signal exactly where fish are  the most common signal is what locals call a jump, or a sudden deep dive, said Cantor, who is also affiliated with the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianpolis, Brazil.  The researchers used sonar and underwater microphones to track the positions of the dolphins and fish, while drones recorded the interactions from above, and GPS devices attached to residents wrists recorded when they cast their nets.  The more closely the people synchronized their net-casting to the dolphins signals, the more likely they were to trap a large catch.  So whats in it for the dolphins?  The descending nets startle the fish, which break into smaller schools that are easier for dolphins to hunt. The dolphins may also take one or two fish from the net  sometimes fishers can feel dolphin tugging a little on the net, said Cantor.  The Laguna residents categorize the individual dolphins as good, bad, or lazy  based on their skill in hunting and affinity for cooperating with humans, said Cantor. The people get most excited when they see a good dolphin approaching shore.  These dolphins and humans have developed a joint foraging culture that allows them both to do better, said Boris Worm, a marine ecologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, who was not involved in the research. Its not clear how the Laguna cooperation first emerged, but its survived multiple human and dolphin generations  with knowledge passed down by experienced fishers and dolphins to the next generation of each species. Still, the researchers in Brazil worry that the Laguna alliance, perhaps one of the last of its kind, may be in danger as well, as pollution threatens the dolphins and artisanal fishing gives way to industrial methods.  Human-wildlife cooperation is disappearing because were decimating the wildlife populations, said Janet Mann, a dolphin researcher at Georgetown University, who was not involved in the study.  Scientists hope that greater awareness of the unusual interspecies cooperation can help drive support to protect it.

"Bring back dodo? Ambitious plan draws investors, critics","WASHINGTON (AP)  The dodo bird isnt coming back anytime soon. Nor is the woolly mammoth. But a company working on technologies to bring back extinct species has attracted more investors, while other scientists are skeptical such feats are possible or a good idea. Colossal Biosciences first announced its ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth two years ago, and on Tuesday said it wanted to bring back the dodo bird, too. The dodo is a symbol of man-made extinction, said Ben Lamm, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder and CEO of Colossal. The company has formed a division to focus on bird-related genetic technologies. The last dodo, a flightless bird about the size of a turkey, was killed in 1681 on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. The Dallas company, which launched in 2021, also announced Tuesday it had raised an additional $150 million in funding. To date, it has raised $225 million from wide-ranging investors that include United States Innovative Technology Fund, Breyer Capital and In-Q-Tel, the CIAs venture capital firm which invests in technology. The prospect of bringing the dodo back isnt expected to directly make money, said Lamm. But the genetic tools and equipment that the company develops to try to do it may have other uses, including for human health care, he said. For example, Colossal is now testing tools to tweak several parts of the genome simultaneously. Its also working on technologies for what is sometimes called an artificial womb, he said. 
        
     The dodos closest living relative is the Nicobar pigeon, said Beth Shapiro, a molecular biologist on Colossals scientific advisory board, who has been studying the dodo for two decades. Shapiro is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports The Associated Press Health and Science Department. Her team plans to study DNA differences between the Nicobar pigeon and the dodo to understand what are the genes that really make a dodo a dodo, she said. The team may then attempt to edit Nicobar pigeon cells to make them resemble dodo cells. It may be possible to put the tweaked cells into developing eggs of other birds, such as pigeons or chickens, to create offspring that may in turn naturally produce dodo eggs, said Shapiro. The concept is still in an early theoretical stage for dodos.  Because animals are a product of both their genetics and their environment  which has changed dramatically since the 1600s  Shapiro said that its not possible to recreate a 100% identical copy of something thats gone. Other scientists wonder if its even advisable to try, and question whether de-extinction diverts attention and money away from efforts to save species still on Earth. Theres a real hazard in saying that if we destroy nature, we can just put it back together again  because we cant, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who has no connection to Colossal. And where on Earth would you put a woolly mammoth, other than in a cage? asked Pimm, who noted that the ecosystems where mammoths lived disappeared long ago.  On a practical level, conservation biologists familiar with captive breeding programs say that it can be tricky for zoo-bred animals to ever adapt to the wild.  It helps if they can learn from other wild animals of their kind  an advantage that potential dodos and mammoths wont have, said Boris Worm, a biologist at the University of Dalhousie in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who has no connection to Colossal.  Preventing species from going extinct in the first place should be our priority, and in most cases, its a lot cheaper, said Worm. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

How to make a mummy: Ancient Egyptian workshop has new clues,"NEW YORK (AP)  For thousands of years, ancient Egyptians mummified their dead in the search for eternal life. Now, researchers have used chemistry and an unusual collection of jars to figure out how they did it. Their study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, is based on a rare archaeological find: An embalming workshop with a trove of pottery around 2,500 years old. Many jars from the site were still inscribed with instructions like to wash or to put on his head. By matching the writing on the outside of the vessels with the chemical traces inside, researchers uncovered new details about the recipes that helped preserve bodies for thousands of years. Its like a time machine, really, said Joann Fletcher, an archaeologist at University of York who was not involved with the study. Its allowed us to not quite see over the shoulders of the ancient embalmers, but probably as close as well ever get. Those recipes showed that embalmers had deep knowledge about what substances would help preserve their dead, said Fletcher, whose partner was a co-author on the study. And they included materials from far-flung parts of the world  meaning Egyptians went to great lengths to make their mummies as perfect as they could possibly be. The workshop  uncovered in 2016 by study author Ramadan Hussein, who passed away last year  is located in the famous burial grounds of Saqqara. Parts of it sit above the surface, but a shaft stretches down to an embalming room and burial chamber underground, where the jars were discovered. 
        
     It was in rooms like these where the last phase of the process took place, said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at The American University in Cairo who was not involved with the study. After drying out the the body with salts, which probably took place above ground, embalmers would then take the bodies below.  This was the last phase of your transformation where the secret rites, the religious rites, were being performed, Ikram said. People would be chanting spells and hymns while you were being wrapped and resin was being anointed all over your body. Experts already had some clues about what substances were used in those final steps, mainly from testing individual mummies and looking at written texts. But a lot of gaps remained, said senior author Philipp Stockhammer, an archaeologist at Ludwig Maximilian University in Germany. The new finds helped crack the case.  Take the word antiu, which shows up in a lot of Egyptian texts but didnt have a direct translation, Stockhammer said. In the new study, scientists found that several jars labeled as antiu contained a mixture of different substances  including animal fat, cedar oil and juniper resin. These substances, along with others found in the jars, have key properties that would help preserve the mummies, said lead author Maxime Rageot, an archaeologist at Germanys University of Tubingen.  Plant oils  which were used to protect the liver and treat the bandages  could ward off bacteria and fungi, while also improving the smell. Hard materials like beeswax, used on the stomach and skin, could help keep out water and seal the pores.  Some of the substances came from very far away  like dammar and elemi, types of resin that come from the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. These results show that ancient Egyptians would trade far and wide to get the most effective materials, the authors said. Its interesting to see the complexity, Stockhammer said. Having this global network on the one hand, having all this chemical knowledge on the other side. Ikram said an important next step for the research will be to test different parts of actual mummies to see if the same substances show up. And these recipes probably werent universal  they changed over time and varied between workshops. Still, the study gives a basis for understanding the past, and can bring us closer to people who lived long ago, she said. The ancient Egyptians have been separated from us through time and space, yet we still have this connection, Ikram said. Human beings all throughout history have been scared of death.

SpaceX nails booster landings after foggy military launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched its mega Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time in more than three years Tuesday, hoisting satellites for the military and then nailing side-by-side booster landings back near the pad. Thick fog shrouded NASAs Kennedy Space Center as the rocket blasted off at midmorning. The crowd at the launch site couldnt even see the pad three miles (5 kilometers) away, but heard the roar of the 27 first-stage engines.  Both side boosters peeled away two minutes after liftoff, flew back to Cape Canaveral, and landed alongside one another, just a few seconds apart. The core stage was discarded at sea, its entire energy needed to get the Space Forces satellites to their intended extra-high orbit.  This was SpaceXs fourth flight of a Falcon Heavy, currently the most powerful rocket in use. The first, in 2018, launched SpaceX chief Elon Musks red Tesla convertible; the next two Heavy launches followed in 2019, lifting satellites. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Closest known black hole to Earth spotted by astronomers,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have discovered the closest known black hole to Earth, just 1,600 light-years away.  Scientists reported Friday that this black hole is 10 times more massive than our sun. And its three times closer than the previous record-holder.  It was identified by observing the motion of its companion star, which orbits the black hole at about the same distance as Earth orbits the sun.  The black hole was initially identified using the European Space Agencys Gaia spacecraft, said Kareem El-Badry of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  El-Badry and his team followed up with the International Gemini Observatory in Hawaii to confirm their findings, which were published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The researchers are uncertain how the system formed in the Milky Way. Named Gaia BH1, its located in the constellation Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASAs moon rocket returns to pad for next launch attempt,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs moon rocket is back on the pad for another launch attempt, following more repairs.  The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket departed its hangar in the middle of the night and completed the 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) trip shortly after sunrise Friday.  NASA is aiming for a launch attempt on Nov. 14, sending an empty crew capsule around the moon and back in a dramatic flight test before astronauts climb aboard in a couple years. Forecasters are keeping their eyes on potential tropical weather that could interfere. It is NASAs biggest step yet to get astronauts back on the moon by 2025. The space agency is nearing the 50th anniversary of its last human moon landing: Apollo 17 in December 1972. Although shorter, this early version of the rocket is even more powerful than the Saturn V that sent Apollo astronauts to the moon.  Fuel leaks have kept the rocket grounded since August. Then Hurricane Ian forced the rocket back to the hangar at Kennedy Space Center at the end of September. NASA used the time to make repairs and replace critical batteries. NASA still does not know why hydrogen keeps leaking every time the rocket is fueled, but engineers are confident they can manage any future leaks, said Cliff Lanham, a senior manager. Liftoff would be in the wee hours for the next three launch opportunities. While NASA prefers a daytime launch for test flights to capture as many pictures as possible, its not a requirement. Radar and infrared cameras should provide ample coverage, said Jim Free, a NASA associate administrator.

Last total lunar eclipse for three years arrives Tuesday,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Better catch the moons disappearing act Tuesday  there wont be another like it for three years. The total lunar eclipse will be visible throughout North America in the predawn hours  the farther west, the better  and across Asia, Australia and the rest of the Pacific after sunset. As an extra treat, Uranus will be visible just a fingers width above the moon, resembling a bright star. Totality will last nearly 1 1/2 hours  from 5:16 a.m. to 6:41 a.m. EST  as Earth passes directly between the moon and sun. Known as a blood moon, it will appear a reddish-orange from the light of Earths sunsets and sunrises. At the peak of the eclipse, the moon will be 242,740 miles (390,653 kilometers) away, according to NASA scientists. Binoculars and telescopes will enhance viewing, provided the skies are clear.  South America will get a glimpse of Tuesdays lunar eclipse, weather permitting. Striking out altogether, Africa, the Middle East and most of Europe will have to wait until 2025. Among those providing a livestream of Tuesdays lunar extravaganza: Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and the Italian-based Virtual Telescope Project. Its the second total lunar eclipse this year; the first was in May. The next one wont be until 2025.

Solar panel trouble on cargo capsule bound for space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A Northrop Grumman cargo capsule ran into trouble with a solar panel after Mondays liftoff to the International Space Station. Only one of the two solar panels on the Cygnus capsule opened successfully following the predawn liftoff from Virginia.  Northrop Grumman officials assured NASA that theres enough power from the solar panel for Wednesdays planned space station rendezvous, but the space agency was still assessing the situation. Its too early to know whether the capsule would be stable enough to be captured by the space stations robot arm, if the problem persists, said NASAs Dina Contella, a space station manager. Northrop Grumman launched the capsule from coastal Wallops Island with more than 8,200 pounds of equipment and experiments, including brackets needed for upcoming spacewalks to upgrade the space stations power grid. Its dubbed the S.S. Sally Ride after the first American woman in space who died a decade ago. The Virginia-based company has been sending shipments to the space station since 2013. Theres been only one failure in its previous 18 supply runs, a launch explosion in 2014.

Cargo ship reaches space station despite jammed solar panel,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A Northrop Grumman capsule delivered several tons of supplies to the International Space Station on Wednesday despite a jammed solar panel.  The shipment arrived two days after launching from Virginia. Only one of the cargo ships two round solar panels opened following liftoff. Flight controllers tried in vain to open the stuck panel, but managed to draw enough power for the flight with just one.  As the capsule made its slow approach, the space station crew took pictures so engineers might understand what went wrong. NASA astronaut Nicole Mann then used the stations robot arm to grab the spacecraft, dubbed the S.S. Sally Ride in honor of Americas first woman in space. A company vice president, Cyrus Dhalla, later said a piece of debris from the Antares rocket became lodged in one of the solar panels mechanisms during liftoff and prevented its release.  Among the 8,200 pounds (3,700 kilograms) of supplies: brackets needed for a spacewalk next week to expand the stations power, as well as apples, blueberries, cheese, peanut butter and ice cream for the stations U.S., Russian and Japanese crew of seven.

Section of destroyed shuttle Challenger found on ocean floor,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A large section of the destroyed space shuttle Challenger has been found buried in sand at the bottom of the Atlantic, more than three decades after the tragedy that killed a schoolteacher and six others. NASAs Kennedy Space Center announced the discovery Thursday.  Of course, the emotions come back, right? said Michael Ciannilli, a NASA manager who confirmed the remnants authenticity. When he saw the underwater video footage, My heart skipped a beat, I must say, and it brought me right back to 1986 ... and what we all went through as a nation. Its one of the biggest pieces of Challenger found in the decades since the acciden t, according to Ciannilli, and the first remnant to be discovered since two fragments from the left wing washed ashore in 1996. Divers for a TV documentary first spotted the piece in March while looking for wreckage of a World War II plane. NASA verified through video a few months ago that the piece was part of the shuttle that broke apart shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. All seven on board were killed, including the first schoolteacher bound for space, Christa McAuliffe.  The underwater video provided pretty clear and convincing evidence, said Ciannilli. The piece is more than 15 feet by 15 feet (4.5 meters by 4.5 meters); its likely bigger because part of it is covered with sand. Because there are square thermal tiles on the piece, its believed to be from the shuttles belly, Ciannilli said.  
        
     The fragment remains on the ocean floor just off the Florida coast near Cape Canaveral as NASA determines the next step. It remains the property of the U.S. government. The families of all seven Challenger crew members have been notified.  We want to make sure whatever we do, we do the right thing for the legacy of the crew, Ciannilli said. Roughly 118 tons (107 metric tons) of Challenger debris have been recovered since the accident. That represents about 47% of the entire vehicle, including parts of the two solid-fuel boosters and external fuel tank. Most of the recovered wreckage remains buried in abandoned missile silos at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The exception is a left side shuttle panel on display at Kennedy Space Centers visitor complex, alongside the charred cockpit window frame from shuttle Columbia, which broke apart over Texas during reentry in 2003, killing seven astronauts. Far less has been recovered of Columbia  42 tons (38 metric tons) representing 38% of the shuttle. The Columbia remains are stored in converted offices inside Kennedys massive hangar.  Launched on an exceptionally cold morning, Challenger was brought down by eroded O-ring seals in the right booster. Columbia ended up with a slashed left wing, the result of foam insulation breaking off the external fuel tank at liftoff. Mismanagement was also blamed..

"NASA: Moon rocket endured hurricane, set for 1st test flight","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs moon rocket needs only minor repairs after enduring a hurricane at the pad and is on track for its first test flight next week, a top official said Friday.  Right now, theres nothing preventing us from attempting a launch on Wednesday, said NASAs Jim Free, an associate administrator. The wind never exceeded the rockets design limits as Hurricane Nicole swept through Kennedy Space Center on Thursday, according to Free. But he acknowledged if the launch team had known in advance that a hurricane was going to hit, they likely would have kept the rocket indoors. The rocket was moved out to the pad late last week for its $4.1 billion demo mission. Gusts reached 100 mph (160 kph) atop the launch tower, but were not nearly as strong farther down at the rocket. Computer models indicate there should be no strength or fatigue issues from the storm, even deep inside the rocket, Free noted. NASA had been aiming for an early Monday launch, but put it on hold for two days because of the storm.  The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket, known as SLS for Space Launch System, is the most powerful ever built by NASA. A crew capsule atop the rocket, with three test dummies on board, will shoot for the moon  the first such flight in 50 years when Apollo astronauts last visited the moon.  NASA wants to test all the systems before putting astronauts on board in 2024 for a trip around the moon.

Climate reshapes life for tenacious gannets on Quebec isle,"PERCE, Quebec (AP)  On Quebecs Bonaventure Island, the ghosts of human habitation from years past and the birds that breed there now in extraordinary numbers tell the same story: of lives lived hard in a place of fairy-tale beauty. You see this from the tender ages on the family gravestones of islanders who scratched out a living from the late 1700s to when Bonaventure went entirely to the birds a half century ago. You see it from the tenacious colony of 100,000-plus northern gannets as they plunge into the sea for prey, soar back to their nests and fight at the least provocation, sometimes to the death, for their territory on a plateau high above the waters or in crannies of the cliffs. Nothing is easy for the gannets. Not in this age of warming seas, competition with trawlers for fish, pollution, supercharged storms and the onset of avian flu.  Northern gannets dive for fish near Perce Rock just after sunrise in Perce, Quebec, Canada, Thursday, Sept. 15, 2022. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Northern gannets dive for fish near Perce Rock just after sunrise in Perce, Quebec, Canada, Thursday, Sept. 15, 2022. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Thats especially so when those perils are combined with their curious compulsion, shared by many seabirds, to return each spring to the exact spot they left the year before. For these spirited divas, the next nesting spot over just wont do. Worldwide, it remains difficult or impossible to tie any one massive die-off of seabirds or breeding calamity solely to global warming, for nature has its own jarring rhythms of abundance and deprivation. But the evidence writ large, over decades, is unassailable: Warming and rising seas and the erratic weather events fueled by a changing climate are taking a heavy toll on seabirds. University of British Columbia researchers say seabird populations have fallen 70% since the mid-20th century. 
        
     Climate-related losses have, for example, hit albatrosses in the central Pacific, common murres and Cassins auklets along the U.S. West Coast, puffins off the Maine coast, penguins in South Africa, endangered roseate terns off New England, and brown pelicans on vanishing islands off southeastern Louisiana.   
        
     The struggles of many seabird species occur in marine wilderness far from humans. Those of the Bonaventure gannets, however, play out in plain sight, in a gift to scientists and the public, on the protected grounds of the Quebec governments Parc national de llle-Bonaventure-et-du-Rocher-Perce.  The Bonaventure gannets display a clumsy and funny little side on land which has nothing to do with what it is when it is at sea, said David Pelletier, a leading Quebec researcher of the birds. At sea the gannets are magnificent in their grace and power. Using air currents off the water, they fly effortlessly high over the sea and dive nearly straight down in their hunt for fish, piercing the surface at 100 kilometers (60 miles) an hour like so many white missiles. Their black-tipped wings, which span 2 meters (6 feet), are tightly tucked behind them.  They dive in huge numbers near the island when mackerel  the prey that gives them the most energy  or herring or other smaller fish are abundant there.  Its a sight that amazes even the most seasoned scientists every time. Its so wow, said Magella Guillemette, a pre-eminent gannet researcher at the University of Quebec in Rimouski, as he described watching the feeding frenzy from his small boat in the thick of it.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) With the island less than 3 kilometers (under 2 miles) from the Perce harbor, these Bonaventure birds are remarkably accessible to biologists and visitors who hike on trails thick with wildflowers in summer to see the birds up close. The clamor of the birds greets the hikers even before the full colony comes into view. The gannets, unlike many other seabirds, seem utterly indifferent to humans. They gaze right through you with their porcelain blue eyes. Its rare that we have the possibility to look at wild animals like this, said Marie-Dominique Nadeau-Girard, the parks services manager. And they stay there, they dont look at you, they live their life, and youre just looking at them and learning.   
        
     Guillemettes student researchers are busy each summer studying the birds. Over the years, they have put leg bands and GPS systems on hundreds of them. Whats striking about gannets is that the researchers can simply pick them up, without fear of disturbing their nests.  You just catch that bird, Guillemette said. You weigh them, you put some devices on them and then you put it back to the nest and its just staying there. ___ All of this makes the Bonaventure gannets ideal sentinels for the health of the marine ecosystem in the gulf and clattering storytellers to the planet. They form the worlds second largest gannet colony and are easier to reach than the largest, on Scotlands remote Bass Island. Quebecs on-the-ground experts on the colony, Canadian government biologists, and seabird scientists globally say there is little to no question that global warming is reshaping the lives of the northern gannets. Warmer sea temperatures drive their prey to cooler depths, distant waters or both. But the full impact of climate change is not yet established and overfishing may be an even greater danger. In tandem, the threats from fishing and warming are forcing the gannets to go farther from their Bonaventure nests in search of food for their island chicks and themselves. The distance the birds fly on a single fishing trip has more than doubled in recent years to an average of 500 kilometers (300 miles), leaving one mate and the chick waiting several days or longer to be fed by the hunter, Guillemette said. If the mate on the nest gets too weak from hunger, it may fly off for food, too, leaving the young one to starve or to wander from the nest and risk being killed by an adult. Like many seabirds, adult gannets are highly territorial and may kill any intruders to their nesting areas; AP journalists witnessed two such deadly attacks on the young on a day shortly before the winter migration. Researchers have been able to draw a strong correlation between the supply of mackerel in the gulf and the number of chicks produced. In 2012, when there were almost no mackerel, only 4% of the nests produced a chick, Guillemette said, a record low attributed to unusually warm waters that year.  Since then, productivity has been highly variable year to year while remaining low on average, said seabird biologist Jean-Franois Rail of the Canadian Wildlife Service, an agency of Environment and Climate Change Canada.  Everything points in the direction of reduced availability of mackerel and herring, which results in lower breeding success, he said.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Whats clear is that birds now need to work harder to find food. Beginning in 2012, Guillemettes researchers began outfitting gannets with a GPS device, in little boxes taped above their tails, which lets them track how far they fly, how deep they dive, and how many times they dive each day.  In March, just as the spring fishing season was opening, Canada shut commercial fishing for Atlantic mackerel and spring herring in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, saying stocks had entered a critical zone. Earlier efforts to restore stocks failed, in part because warmer waters had depleted the microscopic crustaceans that are the main food for the fish.  Mackerel is a star of the gulf ecosystem, not only for gannets. Theyre prized as a commercial species as well as bait for the lucrative lobster, crab and tuna fisheries. The gulfs abundant grey seals gobble as many as they can get. With all the competition for food, gannets have found ways to adapt, but at a cost. This year, the Bonaventure colony also had to contend with the avian flu. The contamination rate was high in the spring, Guillemette said, but faded. Other colonies in Canada had it much worse.    
        
     ___ Over winter, northern gannets are solitary birds that live widely dispersed on the water  along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida, some even in the Gulf of Mexico. But mates reunite year after year on their breeding grounds, for 15 years or so, producing one chick each season. They have a monogamous nature and an elaborate means of communicating mate to mate. In gannet-speak, a beak turned skyward signals its time to go forage; mates clacking their bills together as if in a swordfight signal a welcome home after the hunt. You might think they are lovebirds; alas, these sentinels are not sentimental. People are more romantic and think they are faithful to their partner, but its not the case, Nadeau-Girard says with a laugh. The gannet is faithful to his territory, his nest. And if the baby goes out of the nest, the parents wont recognize him because ... they recognize the nest, not the individual. Each time they see each other its like they meet for the first time. The nests are only 80 centimeters (30 inches) apart, center to center, and these are sizable birds. At certain vantage points, the colony appears as a carpet of white as far as the eye can see, dotted with the dark-feathered young ones, and all of it against the backdrop of sea and sky. The birds arrive in April, lay their eggs in May and tend them until they hatch more than 40 days later. Then its three months of raising the chicks. By the time of the southern migration in late September or early October, the young are plenty plump, weighing 1 kilogram (over 2 pounds) more than their parents. The extra fat will sustain them at sea as they learn to fly and dive for fish.  There are no training wheels for the portly juveniles. Instead, lots of practice beating their wings on the ground, followed by a departure from the cliffs that is part flight, part plop. If they survive that, the journey south will teach them their grace and power on the wing and into the deep.   
        
     ___ From the town of Perce, the mainland cliffs with the red-roofed houses, the commanding Perce Rock and Bonaventure Island make for an iconic panorama, and a mystical one for the people of the Gaspe Peninsula and travelers from around the world. When boats bring visitors to the island, park employees corral them to explain the trails and what they can and cannot do. Services are primarily in French. On a September day, the multilingual Rudiger Spraul pulled aside the English-speaking visitors to give them the drill. He came from Germany, fell in love with the place and spent the summer and early fall working for the park until it closed last month after the gannets left for the winter. He looked out on the colony every day from a small food operation where visitors can picnic and hope they arent leeward of the days winds, for the colony can stink. It gave me so much peace that I decided Im going to stay here, he said. Im actually an engineer. Now Im selling sandwiches on this lonesome spot. The island is such a beautiful small little paradise. Its like time stands still there. You go there, you see that old houses, no people living for so many years, but still you can get the impression how it was there, how hard it was. The island was settled in the late 18th century by cod fishermen, reaching its population peak of 172 in 1831. The last remaining families left in 1971 when it was taken over by the government to become part of the park.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Altogether, some 250,000 birds inhabit the teardrop-shaped island, about 3 kilometers (under 2 miles) at its longest. Seals frequent the rocks and shore and whales are a common sight. Foxes poke from island bushes and snag an occasional gannet on the colonys periphery.  Theyre all out making a living in a changing ecosystem that tests the ability of creatures great and small to adapt. The northern gannet is, for me, a resilient species, strong, capable of turning on a dime ... as we say in Quebec, se tourner sur un 10 cents, said Pelletier, a teacher-researcher at Cegep de Rimouski, a public college. How much and how fast must they pivot as their habitat and our planet continue to warm? What fish will be there for them in the spring, and how far and how deep will they be?

NASAs moon rocket on track for Wednesday launch attempt,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA remained on track for Wednesdays planned liftoff of its new moon rocket, after determining that hurricane damage provided little extra risk to the test flight. Hurricane Nicoles high winds caused a 10-foot (3-meter) section of caulking to peel away near the crew capsule at the top of the rocket last Thursday. The material tore away in small pieces, rather than one big strip, said mission manager Mike Sarafin. Were comfortable flying as is, based on flight experience with this material, Sarafin told reporters Monday night. Liftoff is scheduled for the early morning hours of Wednesday from NASAs Kennedy Space Center, with test dummies rather than astronauts on board. Its the first test flight for the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket, the most powerful ever built by NASA, and will attempt to send the capsule into lunar orbit. The nearly monthlong $4 billion mission has been grounded since August by fuel leaks and Hurricane Ian, which forced the rocket back into its hangar for shelter at the end of September. The rocket remained at the pad for Nicole; managers said there wasnt enough time to move it once it became clear the storm was going to be stronger than anticipated. Sarafin acknowledged Monday night that theres a small likelihood that more of the pliable, lightweight caulking might come off during liftoff. The most likely place to be hit would be a particularly large and robust section of the rocket, he noted, resulting in minimal damage.  
        
     Engineers never determined what caused the dangerous hydrogen fuel leaks during the two late summer launch attempts. But the launch team is confident that slowing the flow rate will put less pressure on the sensitive fuel line seals and keep any leakage within acceptable limits, said Jeremy Parsons, a deputy program manager. The space agency plans to send astronauts around the moon in 2024 and land a crew on the lunar surface in 2025.  Astronauts last visited the moon in December 1972, closing out the Apollo program. A microwave oven-size NASA satellite, meanwhile, arrived Sunday in a special lunar orbit following a summer liftoff from New Zealand. This elongated orbit, stretching as much as tens of thousands of miles (kilometers), is where the space agency plans to build a depot for lunar crews. The way station, known as Gateway, will serve astronauts going to and from the lunar surface.  The satellite, called Capstone, will spend six months testing a navigation system in this orbit. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"EXPLAINER: NASAs new mega moon rocket, Orion crew capsule","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is kicking off its new moon program with a test flight of a brand-new rocket and capsule. Liftoff was slated for early Wednesday morning from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The test flight aims to send an empty crew capsule into a far-flung lunar orbit, 50 years after NASAs famed Apollo moonshots.  The project is years late and billions over budget. The price tag for the test flight: more than $4 billion.  A rundown of the new rocket and capsule, part of NASAs Artemis program, named after Apollos mythological twin sister: ROCKET POWER At 322 feet (98 meters), the new rocket is shorter and slimmer than the Saturn V rockets that hurled 24 Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. But its mightier, packing 8.8 million pounds (4 million kilograms) of thrust. Its called the Space Launch System rocket, SLS for short, although a less clunky name is under discussion. Unlike the streamlined Saturn V, the new rocket has a pair of side boosters refashioned from NASAs space shuttles. The boosters peel away after two minutes, just like the shuttle boosters. The core stage keeps firing before crashing into the Pacific. Less than two hours after liftoff, an upper stage sends the capsule, Orion, racing toward the moon.  MOONSHIP NASAs high-tech, automated Orion capsule is named after the constellation, among the night skys brightest. At 11 feet (3 meters) tall, its roomier than Apollos capsule, seating four astronauts instead of three. For the test flight, a full-size dummy in an orange flight suit occupies the commanders seat, rigged with vibration and acceleration sensors. Two other mannequins made of material simulating human tissue  heads and female torsos, but no limbs  measure cosmic radiation, one of the biggest risks of spaceflight. Unlike the rocket, Orion has launched before, making two laps around Earth in 2014. For the test flight, the European Space Agencys service module was attached for propulsion and solar power via four wings. 
        
     FLIGHT PLAN Orions flight is set to last 25 days from its Florida liftoff to Pacific splashdown, about the same as astronaut trips. It takes nearly a week to reach the moon. After whipping closely around the moon, the capsule enters a distant orbit with a far point of close to 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers). That would put Orion about 270, 000 miles (435,000) from Earth, farther than Apollo. The big test comes at missions end, as Orion hits the atmosphere at 25,000 mph (40,000 kph) on its way to a splashdown in the Pacific. The heat shield uses the same material as the Apollo capsules to withstand reentry temperatures of 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,750 degrees Celsius). But the advanced design anticipates the faster, hotter returns by future Mars crews. HITCHHIKERS Besides three test dummies, the test flight includes a slew of stowaways for deep space research. Ten shoebox-size satellites pop off once Orion is hurtling toward the moon. NASA expects some to fail, given the low-cost, high-risk nature of these mini satellites. In a back-to-the-future salute, Orion carries a few slivers of moon rocks collected by Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969, and a bolt from one of their rocket engines, salvaged from the sea a decade ago.  APOLLO VS. ARTEMIS More than 50 years later, Apollo still stands as NASAs greatest achievement. Using 1960s technology, NASA took just eight years to go from launching its first astronaut, Alan Shepard, and landing Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon. By contrast, Artemis already has dragged on for more than a decade, despite building on the short-lived moon exploration program Constellation. Twelve Apollo astronauts walked on the moon from 1969 through 1972, staying no longer than three days at a time. For Artemis, NASA will draw from a diverse astronaut pool and is extending the time crews spend on the moon to at least a week. The goal is to create a long-term lunar presence that will grease the skids for sending people to Mars.  WHATS NEXT Theres a lot more to be done before astronauts step on the moon again. A second test flight will send four astronauts around the moon and back, perhaps as early as 2024. A year or so later, NASA aims to send another four up, with two of them touching down at the lunar south pole. Orion doesnt come with its own lunar lander like the Apollo spacecraft did, so NASA has hired Elon Musks SpaceX to provide its Starship spacecraft for the first Artemis moon landing. Two other private companies are developing moonwalking suits. The sci-fi-looking Starship would link up with Orion at the moon and take a pair of astronauts to the surface and back to the capsule for the ride home. So far, Starship has only soared six miles (10 kilometers).  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASA fixes new leak, resumes fueling moon rocket for launch","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA managed to plug a leak late Tuesday night while fueling its new moon rocket for a middle-of-the-night launch, its third try to put an empty capsule around the moon for the first time in 50 years. Hydrogen fuel sprouted from a valve on the launch pad  a different location than leaks during previous launch attempts. Two technicians and a safety official rushed into the blast zone to tighten the valve, with emergency rescue workers on standby. The quick repair fixed the leak, allowing hydrogen to resume flowing into the rocket. But then a Space Force radar tracking site went down because of a bad ethernet switch, leading to yet another scramble. The problems pushed the launch into the wee hours of Wednesday, as the countdown clocks held at the 10-minute mark.  We are slipping indefinitely into the launch window, said NASA launch commentator Derrol Nail. uel leaks plagued the first two attempts in late summer, then a pair of hurricanes caused more delays. While engineers never pinpointed the cause of the escaping hydrogen, they altered the fueling process to minimize leakage and expressed confidence that all the plumbing in the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket would remain tight and intact. NASA added an hour to the operation to account for the slower fill-up, vital for reducing pressure on the fuel lines and keeping the seals in place. It seemed to work, but an intermittent hydrogen leak cropped up near the end of the six-hour operation. This particular leaky valve is on the launch platform, not the rocket, officials stressed, and is needed to replenish liquid hydrogen as it dissipates from the core stage. 
        
     The rocket was gassed up with nearly 1 million gallons (3.7 million liters) of super-cold hydrogen and oxygen, when the latest leak occurred.  NASA expected 15,000 to jam Kennedy Space Center for the launch in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, with thousands more lining the beaches and roads outside the gates. The space agency had two hours to get the rocket off, before standing down until Saturday. The debut of the Space Launch System rocket, known as SLS, had three test dummies but no astronauts inside the crew capsule on top, which NASA hoped to put into lunar orbit.  This first test flight was expected to last three weeks, ending with a splashdown in the Pacific. NASAs top priority for the $4.1 billion mission is to verify the capsules heat shield during reentry, so four astronauts can strap in for the next moonshot in 2024. That would be followed by a two-person lunar landing in 2025. NASA last sent astronauts to the moon in December 1972, closing out the Apollo program. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA capsule on way to moon after launch by giant new rocket,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A space capsule hurtled toward the moon Wednesday for the first time in 50 years, following a thunderous launch of NASAs mightiest rocket in a dress rehearsal for astronaut flights. No one was on board this debut flight, just three test dummies. The capsule is headed for a wide orbit around the moon and then a return to Earth with a Pacific splashdown in about three weeks.  After years of delays and billions in cost overruns, the Space Launch System rocket roared skyward, rising from Kennedy Space Center on 8.8 million pounds (4 million kilograms) of thrust and hitting 100 mph (160 kph) within seconds. The Orion capsule was perched on top and, less than two hours into the flight, busted out of Earths orbit toward the moon. It was pretty overwhelming, said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. Were going out to explore the heavens, and this is the next step. The moonshot follows nearly three months of vexing fuel leaks that kept the rocket bouncing between its hangar and the pad. Forced back indoors by Hurricane Ian at the end of September, the rocket stood its ground outside as Nicole swept through last week with gusts of more than 80 mph (130 kph). Although the wind caused some damage, managers gave the green light for the launch. An estimated 15,000 people jammed the launch site, with thousands more lining the beaches and roads outside the gates, to witness NASAs long-awaited sequel to Project Apollo, when 12 astronauts walked on the moon from 1969 and 1972. Crowds also gathered outside NASA centers in Houston and Huntsville, Alabama, to watch the spectacle on giant screens. 
        
     The rocket rode a huge trail of flames toward space, with a half-moon glowing brightly and buildings shaking. The liftoff marked the start of NASAs Artemis lunar exploration program, named after Apollos mythological twin sister. The space agency is aiming to send four astronauts around the moon on the next flight, in 2024, and land humans there as early as 2025. For the Artemis generation, this is for you, launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson called out, referring to all those born after Apollo. She later told her team: You have earned your place in history. The 322-foot (98-meter) SLS is the most powerful rocket built by NASA, with more thrust than either the space shuttle or the mighty Saturn V that carried men to the moon. A series of hydrogen fuel leaks plagued the summertime launch attempts as well as countdown tests. A fresh leak erupted at a new spot during Tuesday nights fueling, but an emergency team tightened the faulty valve on the pad. Then a U.S. Space Force radar station went down, resulting in another scramble, this time to replace an ethernet switch.  The rocket, its alive. Its creaking. Its making venting noises. Its pretty scary, said Trent Annis, one of the three men who entered the blast danger zone to fix the leak. My heart was pumping. My nerves were going. Orion should reach the moon by Monday, more than 230,000 miles (370,000 kilometers) from Earth. After coming within 80 miles (130 kilometers) of the moon, the capsule will enter a far-flung orbit stretching about 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) beyond. The $4.1 billion test flight is set to last 25 days, roughly the same as when crews will be aboard. The space agency intends to push the spacecraft to its limits and uncover any problems before astronauts strap in. The test dummies  NASA calls them moonikins  are fitted with sensors to measure such things as vibration, acceleration and cosmic radiation. Nelson cautioned things will go wrong during this demo. A few minor issues cropped up early in the flight, although preliminary indications were the boosters and engines performed well.  I personally am not going to rest well until we get safely to splashdown and recovery, said mission manager Mike Sarafin. The rocket was supposed to have made its dry run by 2017. Government watchdogs estimate NASA will have spent $93 billion on the project by 2025. Ultimately, NASA hopes to establish a base on the moon and send astronauts to Mars by the late 2030s or early 2040s. Many hurdles still need to be cleared. The Orion capsule will take astronauts only to lunar orbit, not the surface.  NASA has hired Elon Musks SpaceX to develop Starship, the 21st-century answer to Apollos lunar lander. Starship will carry astronauts back and forth between Orion and the lunar surface, at least on the first trip in 2025. The plan is to station Starship and eventually other companies landers in orbit around the moon, ready for use whenever new Orion crews pull up. Reprising an argument that was made during the 1960s, Duke University historian Alex Roland questions the value of human spaceflight, saying robots and remote-controlled spacecraft could get the job done more cheaply, efficiently and safely. In all these years, no evidence has emerged to justify the investment we have made in human spaceflight  save the prestige involved in this conspicuous consumption, he said. NASA is waiting until this test flight is over before introducing the astronauts who will be on the next one and those who will follow in the bootsteps of Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Most of NASAs corps of 42 active astronauts and 10 trainees were not even born yet when Apollo 17 moonwalkers Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt closed out the era, 50 years ago next month. We are jumping out of our spacesuits with excitement, astronaut Christina Koch said before the launch.  After a nearly yearlong International Space Station mission and all-female spacewalk, Koch, 43, is on NASAs short list for a lunar flight. So is astronaut Kayla Barron, 35, who finally got to witness her first rocket launch, not counting her own a year ago. It took my breath away, and I was tearing up, Barron said. What an amazing accomplishment for this team. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Webb Space Telescope spots early galaxies hidden from Hubble,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Webb Space Telescope is finding bright, early galaxies that until now were hidden from view, including one that may have formed a mere 350 million years after the cosmic-creating Big Bang.  Astronomers said Thursday that if the results are verified, this newly discovered throng of stars would beat the most distant galaxy identified by the Hubble Space Telescope, a record-holder that formed 400 million years after the universe began.  Launched last December as a successor to Hubble, the Webb telescope is indicating stars may have formed sooner than previously thought  perhaps within a couple million years of creation.  Webbs latest discoveries were detailed in the Astrophysical Journal Letters by an international team led by Rohan Naidu of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The article elaborates on two exceptionally bright galaxies, the first thought to have formed 350 million years after the Big Bang and the other 450 million years after. Naidu said more observations are needed in the infrared by Webb before claiming a new distance record-holder. Although some researchers report having uncovered galaxies even closer to the creation of the universe 13.8 billion years ago, those candidates have yet to be verified, scientists stressed at a NASA news conference. Some of those could be later galaxies mimicking earlier ones, they noted. 
        
     This is a very dynamic time, said Garth Illingworth of the University of California, Santa Cruz, a co-author of the article published Thursday. There have been lots of preliminary announcements of even earlier galaxies, and were still trying to sort out as a community which ones of those are likely to be real. Tommaso Treu of the University of California, Los Angeles, a chief scientist for Webbs early release science program, said the evidence presented so far is as solid as it gets for the galaxy believed to have formed 350 million after the Big Bang.  If the findings are verified and more early galaxies are out there, Naidu and his team wrote that Webb will prove highly successful in pushing the cosmic frontier all the way to the brink of the Big Bang.  When and how the first galaxies formed remains one of the most intriguing questions, they said in their paper. NASAs Jane Rigby, a project scientist with Webb, noted that these galaxies were hiding just under the limits of what Hubble could do. They were right there waiting for us, she told reporters. So thats a happy surprise that there are lots of these galaxies to study. The $10 billion observatory  the worlds largest and most powerful telescope ever sent into space  is in a solar orbit thats 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth. Full science operations began over the summer, and NASA has since released a series of dazzling snapshots of the universe. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

How cooking food and gathering for feasts made us human,"NEW YORK (AP)  If youre cooking a meal for Thanksgiving or just showing up to feast, youre part of a long human history  one thats older than our own species. Some scientists estimate our early human cousins may have been using fire to cook their food almost 2 million years ago, long before Homo sapiens showed up.  And a recent study found what could be the earliest known evidence of this rudimentary cooking: the leftovers of a roasted carp dinner from 780,000 years ago. Cooking food marked more than just a lifestyle change for our ancestors. It helped fuel our evolution, give us bigger brains  and later down the line, would become the centerpiece of the feasting rituals that brought communities together. The story of human evolution has appeared to be the story of what we eat, said Matt Sponheimer, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who has studied the diets of early human ancestors. The new study, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, is based on material from Gesher Benot Yaaqov in Israel  a watery site on the shores of an ancient lake.  Artifacts from the area suggest it was home to a community of Homo erectus, an extinct species of early humans that walked upright, explained lead author Irit Zohar of Tel Aviv University.  Over years of digging in mud at the site, researchers examined a curious catch of fish remains, especially teeth, said Naama Goren-Inbar, an archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who led the excavations. 
        
     Many were from a couple of species of big carp, and they were clustered around certain spots at the site  places where researchers also found signs of fire. Testing revealed the teeth had been exposed to temperatures that were hot, but not super-hot. This suggests the fish were cooked low and slow, rather than tossed right onto a fire, Zohar explained. With all of this evidence together, the authors concluded that these human cousins had harnessed fire for cooking more than three quarters of a million years ago. Thats much earlier than the next oldest evidence for cooking, which showed Stone Age humans ate charred roots in South Africa. The researchers  like many of their colleagues  believe cooking started long before this, though physical evidence has been hard to come by.  I am sure that in the near future an earlier case will be reported, study author Israel Hershkovitz of Tel Aviv University said in an email. Thats in part because harnessing fire for food was a key step for human evolution. Cooking food makes it easier for the body to digest and get nutrients, explained David Braun, an archaeologist at George Washington University who was not involved with the study. So, when early humans figured out how to cook, they got access to more energy, which they could use to fuel bigger brains. Based on how human ancestors brains and bodies developed, scientists estimate that cooking skills would have had to emerge nearly 2 million years ago.  If were out there eating raw items, it is very difficult to make it as a large-bodied primate, Braun said. Those first cooked meals were a far cry from todays turkey dinners. And in the many, many years in between, humans started not just eating for fuel, but for community.  In a 2010 study, researchers described the earliest evidence of a feast  a specially prepared meal that brought people together for an occasion 12,000 years ago in a cave in Israel. The cave, which served as a burial site, included the remains of one special woman who seemed to be a shaman for her community, said Natalie Munro, a University of Connecticut anthropologist who led the study.  It seems her people held a feast to honor her death. Munro and her team found large numbers of animal remains at the site  including enough tortoises and wild cattle to create a hearty spread. This first feast came from another important transition point in human history, right as hunter-gatherers were starting to settle into more permanent living situations, Munro said. Gathering for special meals may have been a way to build community and smooth tensions now that people were more or less stuck with each other, she said. And while the typical feast may no longer involve munching on tortoise meat in burial caves, Munro said she still sees a lot of the same roles  exchanging information, making connections, vying for status  happening at our modern gatherings. This is something thats just quintessentially human, Munro said. And to see the first evidence of it is exciting. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASA capsule buzzes moon, last big step before lunar orbit","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Orion capsule reached the moon Monday, whipping around the far side and buzzing the lunar surface on its way to a record-breaking orbit with test dummies sitting in for astronauts.  Its the first time a capsule has visited the moon since NASAs Apollo program 50 years ago, and represents a huge milestone in the $4.1 billion test flight that began last Wednesday. Video of the looming moon and our pale blue planet more than 230,000 miles (370,000 kilometers) in the distance left workers giddy at Houstons Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, according to flight director Judd Frieling. Even the flight controllers themselves were absolutely astounded. Just smiles across the board, said Orion program manager Howard Hu.  The close approach of 81 miles (130 kilometers) occurred as the crew capsule and its three wired-up dummies were on the far side of the moon. Because of a half-hour communication blackout, flight controllers in Houston did not know if the critical engine firing went well until the capsule emerged from behind the moon. The capsules cameras sent back a picture of the Earth  a tiny blue dot surrounded by blackness. The capsule accelerated well beyond 5,000 mph (8,000 kph) as it regained radio contact, NASA said. Less than an hour later, Orion soared above Tranquility Base, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on July 20, 1969. There were no photos of the site because the pass was in darkness, but managers promised to try for pictures on the return flyby in two weeks.  Orion needed to slingshot around the moon to pick up enough speed to enter the sweeping, lopsided lunar orbit. Another engine firing will place the capsule in that orbit Friday. 
        
     This coming weekend, Orion will shatter NASAs distance record for a spacecraft designed for astronauts  nearly 250,000 miles (400,000 kilometers) from Earth, set by Apollo 13 in 1970. And it will keep going, reaching a maximum distance from Earth next Monday at nearly 270,000 miles (433,000 kilometers). The capsule will spend close to a week in lunar orbit, before heading home. A Pacific splashdown is planned for Dec. 11. Orion has no lunar lander; a touchdown wont come until NASA astronauts attempt a lunar landing in 2025 with SpaceXs Starship. Before then, astronauts will strap into Orion for a ride around the moon as early as 2024. Mission manager Mike Sarafin was delighted with the progress of the mission, giving it a cautiously optimistic A-plus so far.  The Space Launch System rocket  the most powerful ever built by NASA  performed exceedingly well in its debut, Sarafin told reporters. He said teams are dealing with two issues that require workarounds  one involving the navigational star trackers, the other the power system,  The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket caused more damage than expected, however, at the Kennedy Space Center launch pad. The force from the 8.8 million pounds (4 million kilograms) of liftoff thrust was so great that it tore off the blast doors of the elevator, leaving it unusable. Sarafin said the pad damage will be repaired in plenty of time before the next launch.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASAs Orion capsule enters far-flung orbit around moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Orion capsule entered an orbit stretching tens of thousands of miles around the moon Friday, as it neared the halfway mark of its test flight.  The capsule and its three test dummies entered lunar orbit more than a week after launching on the $4 billion demo thats meant to pave the way for astronauts. It will remain in this broad but stable orbit for nearly a week, completing just half a lap before heading home.  As of Fridays engine firing, the capsule was 238,000 miles (380,000 kilometers) from Earth. Its expected to reach a maximum distance of almost 270,000 miles (432,000 kilometers) in a few days. That will set a new distance record for a capsule designed to carry people one day. It is a statistic, but its symbolic for what it represents, Jim Geffre, an Orion manager, said in a NASA interview earlier in the week. Its about challenging ourselves to go farther, stay longer and push beyond the limits of what weve previously explored.  
        
     NASA considers this a dress rehearsal for the next moon flyby in 2024, with astronauts. A lunar landing by astronauts could follow as soon as 2025. Astronauts last visited the moon 50 years ago during Apollo 17. Earlier in the week, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with the capsule for nearly an hour. At the time, controllers were adjusting the communication link between Orion and the Deep Space Network. Officials said the spacecraft remained healthy. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASA capsule flies over Apollo landing sites, heads home","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Orion capsule and its test dummies swooped one last time around the moon Monday, flying over a couple Apollo landing sites before heading home.  Orion will aim for a Pacific splashdown Sunday off San Diego, setting the stage for astronauts on the next flight in a couple years. The capsule passed within 80 miles (130 kilometers) of the far side of the moon, using the lunar gravity as a slingshot for the 237,000-mile (380,000-kilometer) ride back to Earth. It spent a week in a wide, sweeping lunar orbit. Once emerging from behind the moon and regaining communication with flight controllers in Houston, Orion beamed back photos of a close-up moon and a crescent Earth  Earthrise  in the distance.   Orion now has its sights set on home, said Mission Control commentator Sandra Jones. The capsule also passed over the landing sites of Apollo 12 and 14. But at 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) up, it was too high to make out the descent stages of the lunar landers or anything else left behind by astronauts more than a half-century ago. During a similar flyover two weeks ago, it was too dark for pictures. This time, it was daylight. Deputy chief flight director Zebulon Scoville said nearby craters and other geologic features would be visible in any pictures, but little else. It will be more of a tip of the hat and a historical nod to the past, Scoville told reporters last week. 
        
     The three-week test flight has exceeded expectations so far, according to officials. But the biggest challenge still lies ahead: hitting the atmosphere at more than 30 times the speed of sound and surviving the fiery reentry. Orion blasted off Nov. 16 on the debut flight of NASAs most powerful rocket ever, the Space Launch System or SLS.  The next flight  as early as 2024  will attempt to carry four astronauts around the moon. The third mission, targeted for 2025, will feature the first lunar landing by astronauts since the Apollo moon program ended 50 years ago this month. Apollo 17 rocketed away Dec. 7, 1972, from NASAs Kennedy Space Center, carrying Eugene Cernan, Harrison Schmitt and Ron Evans. Cernan and Schmitt spent three days on the lunar surface, the longest stay of the Apollo era, while Evans orbited the moon. Only Schmitt is still alive. ___ This story has been updated to show that NASA now estimates the flyover of Apollo sites was 1,200 miles above the moon, not 6,000 miles. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science and Educational Media Group.

"Tonga volcano blast was unusual, could even warm the Earth","NEW YORK (AP)  When an undersea volcano erupted in Tonga in January, its watery blast was huge and unusual  and scientists are still trying to understand its impacts. The volcano, known as Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai, shot millions of tons of water vapor high up into the atmosphere, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.  The researchers estimate the eruption raised the amount of water in the stratosphere  the second layer of the atmosphere, above the range where humans live and breathe  by around 5%.  Now, scientists are trying to figure out how all that water could affect the atmosphere, and whether it might warm Earths surface over the next few years.  This was a once-in-a-lifetime event, said lead author Holger Voemel, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. Big eruptions usually cool the planet. Most volcanoes send up large amounts of sulfur, which blocks the suns rays, explained Matthew Toohey, a climate researcher at the University of Saskatchewan who was not involved in the study.  The Tongan blast was much soggier: The eruption started under the ocean, so it shot up a plume with much more water than usual. And since water vapor acts as a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, the eruption will probably raise temperatures instead of lowering them, Toohey said. Its unclear just how much warming could be in store. 
        
     Karen Rosenlof, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who was not involved with the study, said she expects the effects to be minimal and temporary.  This amount of increase might warm the surface a small amount for a short amount of time, Rosenlof said in an email. The water vapor will stick around the upper atmosphere for a few years before making its way into the lower atmosphere, Toohey said. In the meantime, the extra water might also speed up ozone loss in the atmosphere, Rosenlof added. But its hard for scientists to say for sure, because theyve never seen an eruption like this one. The stratosphere stretches from around 7.5 miles to 31 miles (12 km to 50 km) above Earth and is usually very dry, Voemel explained.  Voemels team estimated the volcanos plume using a network of instruments suspended from weather balloons. Usually, these tools cant even measure water levels in the stratosphere because the amounts are so low, Voemel said. Another research group monitored the blast using an instrument on a NASA satellite. In their study, published earlier this summer, they estimated the eruption to be even bigger, adding around 150 million metric tons of water vapor to the stratosphere  three times as much as Voemels study found.  Voemel acknowledged that the satellite imaging might have observed parts of the plume that the balloon instruments couldnt catch, making its estimate higher.  Either way, he said, the Tongan blast was unlike anything seen in recent history, and studying its aftermath may hold new insights into our atmosphere. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Why is a NASA spacecraft crashing into an asteroid?,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  In the first-of-its kind, save-the-world experiment, NASA is about to clobber a small, harmless asteroid millions of miles away. A spacecraft named Dart will zero in on the asteroid Monday, intent on slamming it head-on at 14,000 mph (22,500 kph). The impact should be just enough to nudge the asteroid into a slightly tighter orbit around its companion space rock  demonstrating that if a killer asteroid ever heads our way, wed stand a fighting chance of diverting it. This is stuff of science-fiction books and really corny episodes of StarTrek from when I was a kid, and now its real, NASA program scientist Tom Statler said Thursday. Cameras and telescopes will watch the crash, but it will take days or even weeks to find out if it actually changed the orbit. The $325 million planetary defense test began with Darts launch last fall. ASTEROID TARGET  The asteroid with the bulls-eye on it is Dimorphos, about 7 million miles (9.6 million kilometers) from Earth. It is actually the puny sidekick of a 2,500-foot (780-meter) asteroid named Didymos, Greek for twin. Discovered in 1996, Didymos is spinning so fast that scientists believe it flung off material that eventually formed a moonlet. Dimorphos  roughly 525 feet (160 meters) across  orbits its parent body at a distance of less than a mile (1.2 kilometers).  This really is about asteroid deflection, not disruption, said Nancy Chabot, a planetary scientist and mission team leader at Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory, which is managing the effort. This isnt going to blow up the asteroid. It isnt going to put it into lots of pieces. Rather, the impact will dig out a crater tens of yards (meters) in size and hurl some 2 million pounds (1 million kilograms) of rocks and dirt into space. 
        
     NASA insists theres a zero chance either asteroid will threaten Earth  now or in the future. Thats why the pair was picked. DART, THE IMPACTOR  The Johns Hopkins lab took a minimalist approach in developing Dart  short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test  given that its essentially a battering ram and faces sure destruction. It has a single instrument: a camera used for navigating, targeting and chronicling the final action. Believed to be essentially a rubble pile, Dimorphos will emerge as a point of light an hour before impact, looming larger and larger in the camera images beamed back to Earth. Managers are confident Dart wont smash into the larger Didymos by mistake. The spacecrafts navigation is designed to distinguish between the two asteroids and, in the final 50 minutes, target the smaller one. The size of a small vending machine at 1,260 pounds (570 kilograms), the spacecraft will slam into roughly 11 billion pounds (5 billion kilograms) of asteroid. Sometimes we describe it as running a golf cart into a Great Pyramid, said Chabot. Unless Dart misses  NASA puts the odds of that happening at less than 10%  it will be the end of the road for Dart. If it goes screaming past both space rocks, it will encounter them again in a couple years for Take 2. SAVING EARTH Little Dimorphos completes a lap around big Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. The impact by Dart should shave about 10 minutes off that. Although the strike itself should be immediately apparent, it could take a few weeks or more to verify the moonlets tweaked orbit. Cameras on Dart and a mini tagalong satellite will capture the collision up close. Telescopes on all seven continents, along with the Hubble and Webb space telescopes and NASAs asteroid-hunting Lucy spacecraft, may see a bright flash as Dart smacks Dimorphos and sends streams of rock and dirt cascading into space. The observatories will track the pair of asteroids as they circle the sun, to see if Dart altered Dimorphos orbit. In 2024, a European spacecraft named Hera will retrace Darts journey to measure the impact results. Although the intended nudge should change the moonlets position only slightly, that will add up to a major shift over time, according to Chabot. So if you were going to do this for planetary defense, you would do it five, 10, 15, 20 years in advance in order for this technique to work, she said. Even if Dart misses, the experiment still will provide valuable insight, said NASA program executive Andrea Riley. This is why we test. We want to do it now rather than when theres an actual need, she said.  ASTEROID MISSIONS GALORE Planet Earth is on an asteroid-chasing roll. NASA has close to a pound (450 grams) of rubble collected from asteroid Bennu headed to Earth. The stash should arrive next September. Japan was the first to retrieve asteroid samples, accomplishing the feat twice. China hopes to follow suit with a mission launching in 2025. NASAs Lucy spacecraft, meanwhile, is headed to asteroids near Jupiter, after launching last year. Another spacecraft, Near-Earth Asteroid Scout, is loaded into NASAs new moon rocket awaiting liftoff; it will use a solar sail to fly past a space rock thats less than 60 feet (18 meters) next year. In the next few years, NASA also plans to launch a census-taking telescope to identify hard-to-find asteroids that could pose risks. One asteroid mission is grounded while an independent review board weighs its future. NASAs Psyche spacecraft should have launched this year to a metal-rich asteroid between Mars and Jupiter, but the team couldnt test the flight software in time.  HOLLYWOODS TAKE Hollywood has churned out dozens of killer-space-rock movies over the decades, including 1998s Armageddon which brought Bruce Willis to Cape Canaveral for filming, and last years Dont Look Up with Leonardo DiCaprio leading an all-star cast. NASAs planetary defense officer, Lindley Johnson, figures hes seen them all since 1979s Meteor, his personal favorite since Sean Connery played me. While some of the sci-fi films are more accurate than others, he noted, entertainment always wins out. The good news is that the coast seems clear for the next century, with no known threats. Otherwise, it would be like the movies, right? said NASAs science mission chief Thomas Zurbuchen. Whats worrisome, though, are the unknown threats. Fewer than half of the 460-foot (140-meter) objects have been confirmed, with millions of smaller but still-dangerous objects zooming around. These threats are real, and what makes this time special, is we can do something about it, Zurbuchen said. Not by blowing up an asteroid as Willis character did  that would be a last, last-minute resort  or by begging government leaders to take action as DiCaprios character did in vain. If time allows, the best tactic could be to nudge the menacing asteroid out of our way, like Dart.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Approaching storm may delay launch try for NASA moon rocket,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An approaching storm threatens to delay NASAs next launch attempt for its new moon rocket, already grounded for weeks by fuel leaks. A tropical depression in the southern Caribbean is moving toward Florida and could become a major hurricane.  Managers on Friday declared that the rocket is now ready to blast off on its first test flight, after overcoming more hydrogen leaks during a fueling test earlier in the week. It will be the first time a crew capsule orbits the moon in 50 years; the spacecraft will carry mannequins but no astronauts. Teams will keep monitoring the forecast and decide no later than Saturday whether to not only delay the test flight, but haul the rocket off the pad and back to the hangar. Its unclear when the next launch attempt would be  whether October or even November  if the rocket must seek shelter indoors. The preference is to remain at the launch pad and try for a Tuesday liftoff, but there are still some uncertainties in the forecast, said NASAs Tom Whitmeyer, deputy associate administrator for exploration systems. It takes three days of preparations to get the rocket back into Kennedy Space Centers mammoth Vehicle Assembly Building, a 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) trip lasting several hours. I dont think were cutting it close, Whitmeyer told reporters. Were just taking it a step at a time. The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket can withstand gusts of 85 mph (137 kph) at the pad, but only 46 mph (74 kph) once its on the move. 
        
     This would be the third launch attempt for the Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful ever built by NASA. Fuel leaks and other technical problems scrapped the first two tries, in late August and early September. Although hydrogen fuel seeped past newly installed seals during Wednesdays dress rehearsal, the launch team got the leakage down to acceptable levels by slowing the flow and reducing the pressure in the lines. That gave the launch team the confidence to proceed with a Tuesday launch attempt, officials said. Managers said that the 30-year space shuttle program also saw plenty of hydrogen fuel leaks and hurricane-related rollbacks. The moon rockets main engines are actually upgraded versions of what flew on shuttles. Also, the Space Force has extended the certification of on-board batteries that are part of the flight safety system  at least through the beginning of October. NASA has just two chances to launch the rocket  Tuesday and Oct. 2  before a two-week blackout period begins. The next launch period would open Oct. 17. Astronauts would climb aboard for the second test flight around the moon in 2024. The third mission, targeted for 2025, would see a pair of astronauts landing on the moon. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA delays moon rocket launch due to potential hurricane,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is skipping next weeks launch attempt of its new moon rocket because of a tropical storm thats expected to become a major hurricane.  Its the third delay in the past month for the lunar-orbiting test flight featuring mannequins but no astronauts, a follow-up to NASAs Apollo moon-landing program of a half-century ago. Hydrogen fuel leaks and other technical issues caused the previous scrubs. Currently churning in the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Ian is expected to become a hurricane by Monday and slam into Floridas Gulf coast by Thursday. The entire state, however, is in the cone showing the probable path of the storms center  including NASAs Kennedy Space Center. Given the forecast uncertainties, NASA decided Saturday to forgo Tuesdays planned launch attempt and instead prepare the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket for a possible return to its hangar. Managers will decide Sunday whether to haul it off the launch pad. If the rocket remains at the pad, NASA could try for an Oct. 2 launch attempt, the last opportunity before a two-week blackout period. But a rollback late Sunday or early Monday likely would mean a lengthy delay for the test flight, possibly pushing it into November. The Space Launch System rocket is the most powerful ever built by NASA. Assuming its first test flight goes well, astronauts would climb aboard for the next mission in 2024, leading to a two-person moon landing in 2025. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Hurricane forces NASA moon rocket to shelter; launch on hold,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Hurricane Ian is prompting NASA to move its moon rocket off the launch pad and into shelter, adding weeks of delay to the lunar-orbiting test flight. Mission managers decided Monday to return the rocket to its Kennedy Space Center hangar. The four-mile trip will begin late Monday night and could take as long as 12 hours.  The space center remained on the fringes of the hurricanes cone of uncertainty. With the latest forecast showing no improvement, managers decided to play it safe. NASA already had delayed this weeks planned launch attempt because of the approaching storm. NASA isnt speculating when the next launch attempt might be, but it could be off until November. Managers will assess their options once the 322-foot (98-meter) Space Launch System rocket is safely back in the hangar.  A pair of launch attempts were thwarted by hydrogen fuel leaks and other technical trouble. The $4.1 billion test flight will kick off NASAs return to the moon since the Apollo moonshots of the 1960s and 1970s. No one will be inside the crew capsule for the debut launch. Astronauts will strap in for the second mission in 2024, leading to a two-person moon landing in 2025. Meanwhile, NASA and SpaceX are still targeting an Oct. 3 launch of a crew from the U.S., Russia and Japan to the International Space Station. But managers acknowledged that the flight could be delayed as Kennedy braces for the hurricane and its aftermath.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Bam! NASA spacecraft crashes into asteroid in defense test,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft rammed an asteroid at blistering speed Monday in an unprecedented dress rehearsal for the day a killer rock menaces Earth. The galactic slam occurred at a harmless asteroid 7 million miles (11.3 million kilometers) away, with the spacecraft named Dart plowing into the space rock at 14,000 mph (22,500 kph). Scientists expected the impact to carve out a crater, hurl streams of rocks and dirt into space and, most importantly, alter the asteroids orbit. We have impact! Mission Controls Elena Adams announced, jumping up and down and thrusting her arms skyward. Telescopes around the world and in space aimed at the same point in the sky to capture the spectacle. Though the impact was immediately obvious  Darts radio signal abruptly ceased  it will take as long as a couple of months to determine how much the asteroids path was changed. The $325 million mission was the first attempt to shift the position of an asteroid or any other natural object in space.  As far as we can tell, our first planetary defense test was a success, Adams later told a news conference, the room filling with applause. I think Earthlings should sleep better. Definitely, I will. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson reminded people earlier in the day via Twitter that, No, this is not a movie plot. He added in a prerecorded video: Weve all seen it on movies like Armageddon, but the real-life stakes are high. 
        
     Mondays target: a 525-foot (160-meter) asteroid named Dimorphos. Its a moonlet of Didymos, Greek for twin, a fast-spinning asteroid five times bigger that flung off the material that formed the junior partner. The pair have been orbiting the sun for eons without threatening Earth, making them ideal save-the-world test candidates. Launched last November, the vending machine-size Dart  short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test  navigated to its target using new technology developed by Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory, the spacecraft builder and mission manager.  Darts on-board camera, a key part of this smart navigation system, caught sight of Dimorphos barely an hour before impact. Woo hoo! exclaimed Adams, a mission systems engineer at Johns Hopkins. With an image beaming back to Earth every second, Adams and other ground controllers in Laurel, Maryland, watched with growing excitement as Dimorphos loomed larger and larger in the field of view alongside its bigger companion. Within minutes, Dimorphos was alone in the pictures; it looked like a giant gray lemon, but with boulders and rubble on the surface. The last image froze on the screen as the radio transmission ended. Flight controllers cheered, hugged one another and exchanged high fives. Their mission complete, the Dart team went straight into celebration mode. There was little sorrow over the spacecrafts demise. Normally, losing signal from a spacecraft is a very bad thing. But in this case, it was the ideal outcome, said NASA program scientist Tom Statler.  Johns Hopkins scientist Carolyn Ernst said the spacecraft was definitely kaput, with remnants possibly in the fresh crater or cascading into space with the asteroids ejected material.  Scientists insisted Dart would not shatter Dimorphos. The spacecraft packed a scant 1,260 pounds (570 kilograms), compared with the asteroids 11 billion pounds (5 billion kilograms). But that should be plenty to shrink its 11-hour, 55-minute orbit around Didymos. The impact should pare 10 minutes off that. The anticipated orbital shift of 1% might not sound like much, scientists noted. But they stressed it would amount to a significant change over years. Now is when the science starts, said NASAs Lori Glaze, planetary science division director. Now were going to see for real how effective we were. Planetary defense experts prefer nudging a threatening asteroid or comet out of the way, given enough lead time, rather than blowing it up and creating multiple pieces that could rain down on Earth. Multiple impactors might be needed for big space rocks or a combination of impactors and so-called gravity tractors, not-yet-invented devices that would use their own gravity to pull an asteroid into a safer orbit. The dinosaurs didnt have a space program to help them know what was coming, but we do, NASAs senior climate adviser Katherine Calvin said, referring to the mass extinction 66 million years ago believed to have been caused by a major asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions or both. The non-profit B612 Foundation, dedicated to protecting Earth from asteroid strikes, has been pushing for impact tests like Dart since its founding by astronauts and physicists 20 years ago. Mondays feat aside, the world must do a better job of identifying the countless space rocks lurking out there, warned the foundations executive director, Ed Lu, a former astronaut.  Significantly less than half of the estimated 25,000 near-Earth objects in the deadly 460-foot (140-meter) range have been discovered, according to NASA. And fewer than 1% of the millions of smaller asteroids, capable of widespread injuries, are known. The Vera Rubin Observatory, nearing completion in Chile by the National Science Foundation and U.S. Energy Department, promises to revolutionize the field of asteroid discovery, Lu noted.  Finding and tracking asteroids, Thats still the name of the game here. Thats the thing that has to happen in order to protect the Earth, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASA moon rocket back in hangar, launch unlikely until Nov.","NASAs moon rocket returned to the safety of its hangar Tuesday as Hurricane Ian approached Florida, its launch now unlikely before mid-November.  Instead of trying to send it on its first test flight, the launch team moved the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket off the pad at Kennedy Space Center. The four-mile (6.4-kilometer) trip took all night. NASA official Jim Free said it would be difficult to upgrade the rocket and get it back to the pad for an October launch attempt. Putting in fresh batteries is particularly challenging, Free noted, making it doubtful a launch could be attempted before the mid-to-late October launch period closes. The next two-week window would open Nov. 12. The Space Launch System rocket should have blasted off a month ago, but was delayed twice by fuel leaks and engine issues.  Once in space, the crew capsule atop the rocket will aim for lunar orbit with three test dummies, a crucial dress rehearsal before astronauts climb aboard in 2024. The last time a capsule flew to the moon was during NASAs Apollo 17 lunar landing in 1972. SpaceXs next astronaut flight to the International Space Station for NASA, meanwhile, has been delayed at least one day by the hurricane.

Fish fossil catch from China includes oldest teeth ever,"NEW YORK (AP)  A big catch of fish fossils in southern China includes the oldest teeth ever found  and may help scientists learn how our aquatic ancestors got their bite.  The finds offer new clues about a key period of evolution thats been hard to flesh out because until now scientists havent found many fossils from that era. In a series of four studies, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, researchers detail some of their finds, from ancient teeth to never-before-seen species. The fossils date back to the Silurian period, an important era for life on earth from 443 million years ago to 419 million years ago. Scientists believe our backboned ancestors, who were still swimming around on a watery planet, may have started evolving teeth and jaws around this time.  This let the fish hunt for prey instead of grubbing around as bottom feeders, filtering out food from the muck. It also sparked a series of other changes in their anatomy, including different kinds of fins, said Philip Donoghue, a University of Bristol paleontologist and an author on one of the studies. Its just at this interface between the Old World and the New World, Donoghue said. But in the past, scientists havent found many fossils to show this shift, said Matt Friedman, a University of Michigan paleontologist who was not involved in the research. Theyve been relying on fragments from the time  a chunk of spine here, a bit of scale there. 
        
     The fossils from China are expected to fill in some of those gaps as researchers around the world pore over them. A field team discovered the fossil trove in 2019, Min Zhu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the research, said in an email. On a rainy day, after a frustrating trip that hadnt revealed any fossils, researchers explored a pile of rocks near a roadside cliff. When they split one rock open, they found fossilized fish heads looking back at them. After hauling more rocks back to the lab for examination, the research team wound up with a huge range of fossils that were in great condition for their age. The most common species in the bunch is a little boomerang-shaped fish that likely used its jaws to scoop up worms, said Per Erik Ahlberg of Swedens Uppsala University, an author on one of the studies. Another fossil shows a sharklike creature with bony armor on its front  an unusual combination. A well-preserved jawless fish offers clues to how ancient fins evolved into arms and legs. While fossil heads for these fish are commonly found, this fossil included the whole body, Donoghue said.  And then there are the teeth. The researchers found bones called tooth whorls with multiple teeth growing on them. The fossils are 14 million years older than any other teeth found from any species  and provide the earliest solid evidence of jaws to date, Zhu said.  Alice Clement, an evolutionary biologist at Australias Flinders University who was not involved with the research, said the fossil find is remarkable and could rewrite our understanding of this period. The wide range of fossils suggests there were plenty of toothy creatures swimming around at this time, Clement said in an email, even though its the next evolutionary era that is considered the Age of Fishes.

"Scientists honored for COVID-19 tracker, prenatal test","NEW YORK (AP)  A Johns Hopkins University scientist who created a website to track COVID-19 cases worldwide is the recipient of this years Lasker award for public service. The $250,000 awards, announced Wednesday by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, recognize achievements in medical research. The public service award went to Lauren Gardner, an engineer who studies the spread of diseases. She worked with her lab team to develop the COVID-19 tracker as the coronavirus began spreading worldwide in January 2020. The dashboard became a key resource and now tracks global cases, deaths, vaccines and more. Through it all, the team has made the tracker freely available to the public. The dashboard set a new standard for public health data science and helped inform both personal decisions and policy, the Lasker Foundation said in a release.  The prize for medical research was awarded to Yuk Ming Dennis Lo, a molecular biologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, for creating a prenatal blood test that can check for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. Lo found that DNA from the fetus was in the mothers bloodstream, allowing genetic screening to be done with a blood test rather than a more invasive procedure. The basic research award was shared by three scientists: Richard O. Hynes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Erkki Ruoslahti of Californias Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute and Timothy A. Springer of Harvard Medical School. They were recognized for their research on key immune proteins called integrins, which help cells attach to other nearby cells and molecules. Their work helped launch the field of integrin research, which has since led to new strategies for treating disease.

"NASA spacecraft buzzes Jupiter moon Europa, closest in years","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Juno spacecraft has made the closest approach to Jupiters tantalizing, icy moon Europa in more than 20 years.  Juno on Thursday zipped within approximately 219 miles (352 kilometers) of Europa, thought to have an ocean flowing beneath its thick frozen crust, raising the possibility of underwater life. Scientists hailed the flyby as a success, with four pictures beamed down and released within several hours. Scientists had hoped to observe possible water plumes shooting from the surface of Europa, close in size to Earths moon. But none were immediately visible in the initial look. We have to be at the right place at just the right time, Junos chief scientist, Scott Bolton of Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a statement.  John Bordi, deputy mission manager at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, expected the spacecraft to go screaming by pretty fast, with a relative velocity of almost 15 miles per second (23.6 kilometers per second).  The first photo from the flyby is a closeup of Europas equatorial region, crisscrossed by ridges, troughs and possibly an impact crater. The latest observations will help NASA plan for its Europa Clipper mission, due to launch in 2024 and arrive at the Jovian system in 2030. The European Space Agency also plans close encounters with its Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, lifting off next year.

Baltic Sea pipeline leak damages marine life and climate,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Methane escaping from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines that run between Russia and Europe is likely to result in the biggest known gas leak to take place over a short period of time and highlights the problem of large methane escapes elsewhere around the world, scientists say.  From what I have seen this is an unprecedented loss to the atmosphere of fossil methane in a very short time from a concentrated source, said President of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Marcia McNutt. She oversaw American government efforts to assess the breadth of the 2010 BP oil spill the gulf of Mexico.  Methane acts quickly to heat the Earth. The fact that it disappears faster from the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, is probably small consolation to the citizens of Florida and other places who are already being hit by more frequent and more deadly tropical storms, supercharged by an ocean superheated by greenhouse gas releases to the atmosphere, McNutt said in an email.  There is still uncertainty in estimating total damage, but researchers say vast plumes of this potent greenhouse gas will have significant detrimental impacts on the climate. Immediate harm to marine life and fisheries in the Baltic Sea and to human health will also result because benzene and other trace chemicals are typically present in natural gas, researchers say. This will probably be the biggest gas leak ever, in terms of its rate, said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.  
        
     The velocity of the gas erupting from four documented leaks in the pipelines  which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has attributed to sabotage  is part of what makes the impacts severe. When methane leaks naturally leaks from vents on the ocean floor, the quantities are usually small and the gas is mostly absorbed by seawater. But this is not a normal situation for gas release, said Jackson. Were not talking about methane bubbling up to the surface like seltzer water, but a plume of rushing gas, he said.  Jackson and other scientists estimate that between 50% and nearly 100% of total methane emitted from the pipeline will reach the atmosphere.  The Danish government issued a worst case scenario that assumed all the gas reached the air, and German officials Thursday issued a somewhat lower one.  In the meantime, its nearly impossible for anyone to approach the highly flammable plume to attempt to curb the release of gas, which energy experts estimate may continue until Sunday. Methane is very flammable  if you go in there, youd have a good chance of it being a funeral pyre, said Ira Leifer, an atmospheric scientist. If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.  Methane isnt the only risk. Natural gas isnt refined to be super clean  there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene, a carcinogen, said Leifer.  The amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now  this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish, he said.  David Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.  The gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the suns heat and warming the Earth, over the short term. Climate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that theyve reduced their emissions. Scientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.  Many of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.

Space telescopes capture asteroid slam with striking clarity,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The world now has stunning new photos of this weeks asteroid strike, the first planetary defense test of its kind.  NASA on Thursday released pictures of the dramatic event taken by the Hubble and Webb space telescopes. A few hours later, SpaceX joined NASA in announcing that theyre studying the feasibility of sending a private mission to Hubble, potentially led by a billionaire, to raise the aging telescopes orbit and extend its life. Telescopes on all seven continents watched as NASAs Dart spacecraft slammed Monday into the harmless space rock, 7 million miles (11 million kilometers) from Earth, in hopes of altering its orbit.  Scientists wont know the precise change until November; the demo results are expected to instill confidence in using the technique if a killer asteroid heads our way one day. This is an unprecedented view of an unprecedented event, Johns Hopkins University planetary astronomer and mission leader Andy Rivkin said in a statement.  All these pictures will help scientists learn more about the little asteroid Dimorphos, which took the punch and ended up with a sizable crater. The impact sent streams of rock and dirt hurtling into space, appearing as bright emanating rays in the latest photos. The brightness of this double asteroid system  the 525-foot (160-meter) Dimorphos is actually the moonlet around a bigger asteroid  tripled after the impact as seen in the Hubble images, according to NASA. 
        
     Hubble and Webb will keep observing Dimorphos and its large companion Didymos over the next several weeks. The $325 million Dart mission was launched last year. The spacecraft was built and managed by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. As for Hubble, NASA officials stressed Thursday that the observatory launched 32 years ago is in good shape and might have another decade of life left.  Hubbles orbit constantly is decaying, but the telescope could have even more years ahead if it were boosted from its current 335 miles (540 kilometers) above Earth to 375 miles (600 kilometers) or more. The six-month technical feasibility study also will consider whether any parts could be replaced, presumably by a crew.  Jared Isaacman, a Pennsylvania tech entrepreneur who bankrolled his own SpaceX flight last year with contest winners, said a Hubble mission, if approved, would fit nicely into his planned series of spaceflights. But he stopped short of saying whether he was volunteering. Were working on crazy ideas all the time, NASAs science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, told reporters. Frankly, thats what were supposed to do. ______ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Smacked asteroids debris trail more than 6,000 miles long","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The asteroid that got smacked by a NASA spacecraft is now being trailed by thousands of miles of debris from the impact.  Astronomers captured the scene millions of miles away with a telescope in Chile. Their remarkable observation two days after last months planetary defense test was recently released a National Science Foundation lab in Arizona.  The image shows an expanding, comet-like tail more than 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) long, consisting of dust and other material spewed from the impact crater.  This plume is accelerating away from the harmless asteroid, in large part, because of pressure on it from solar radiation, said Matthew Knight of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, who made the observation along with Lowell Observatorys Teddy Kareta using the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope. Scientists expect the tail to get even longer and disperse even more, becoming so tenuous at one point that its undetectable. At that point, the material will be like any other dust floating around the solar system, Knight said in an email Tuesday. More observations are planned to determine how much and what kind of material was hurled from the 525-foot (160-meter) Dimorphos, a moonlet of a larger asteroid. Launched nearly a year ago, NASAs Dart spacecraft was destroyed in the head-on collision. The $325 million mission to deflect an asteroids orbit was intended as a dress rehearsal for the day a killer rock heads our way. Dimorphos and its companion rock never posed a threat to Earth and still do not, according to NASA.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Youre a winner: Listening in on the call for Nobel Prize,"This is what its like to get the call  the Swedish Academy of Sciences ringing you up to say you won the Nobel Prize. Its usually a dream-of-a-lifetime call that only the special few get in private. But for American physicist John Clauser, who was awarded the Nobel for his work on quantum mechanics, it rang a little different. Thanks to a three-hour delay from a phone busy with congratulations and reporters queries, the call finally got through to him while he was on a live Zoom interview with The Associated Press. And he shared his side of the notification and celebration. Oh hang on. Theyre on the phone right now, he said. OK. Hang on just a second. Can I talk to the guys from the Swedish Nobel Committee? Over the next nine minutes, Clauser recounted to the Swedish Academy the difficult road that eventually led to a Nobel-awarding phone call  albeit a few hours late. While studying at Columbia in the 1960s, Clauser became interested in designing practical experiments to put quantum mechanics to the test. But his ideas werent always well-received in the field, he said. Leading physicist Richard Feynman, who won his own physics Nobel in 1965, kind of threw me out of his office, Clauser said. He was very offended that I should even be considering the possibility that quantum mechanics might not give the correct predictions. But Clauser said he was having fun working on these experiments and thought they were important  even though everybody told me I was crazy and was going to ruin my career by doing it. 
        
     While continuing his work at University of California Berkeley, he and the late physicist Stuart Freedman had to build everything from scratch. There was very little money so I was basically cobbling together junk or scrap from the UC physics department, he told the Academy. Theres a lot of stuff unused in storerooms, Clauser said. I would rummage around and say, Oh, hey, I can use this. Some of the great physicists of the past scavenged the same way, he pointed out. And those experiments, with all their backlash and scraped-together budgets, were the very reason he was on the phone with the Swedish Academy decades later. As the call wrapped up, there was the matter of logistics. Clauser asked the Academy about when he would get some dates and times on what Im expected to do. Of course, theres something you definitely have to say to the Academy when it calls: Thanks a lot.

3 physicists share Nobel Prize for work on quantum science,"Three scientists jointly won this years Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for proving that tiny particles could retain a connection with each other even when separated, a phenomenon once doubted but now being explored for potential real-world applications such as encrypting information. Frenchman Alain Aspect, American John F. Clauser and Austrian Anton Zeilinger were cited by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for experiments proving the totally crazy field of quantum entanglements to be all too real. They demonstrated that unseen particles, such as photons, can be linked, or entangled, with each other even when they are separated by large distances. It all goes back to a feature of the universe that even baffled Albert Einstein and connects matter and light in a tangled, chaotic way.  Bits of information or matter that used to be next to each other even though they are now separated have a connection or relationship  something that can conceivably help encrypt information or even teleport. A Chinese satellite now demonstrates this and potentially lightning fast quantum computers, still at the small and not quite useful stage, also rely on this entanglement. Others are even hoping to use it in superconducting material. Its so weird, Aspect said of entanglement in a telephone call with the Nobel committee. I am accepting in my mental images something which is totally crazy. Yet the trios experiments showed it happens in real life. 
        
     Why this happens I havent the foggiest, Clauser told The Associated Press during a Zoom interview in which he got the official call from the Swedish Academy several hours after friends and media informed him of his award. I have no understanding of how it works but entanglement appears to be very real.  His fellow winners also said they cant explain the how and why behind this effect. But each did ever more intricate experiments that prove it just is. Clauser, 79, was awarded his prize for a 1972 experiment, cobbled together with scavenged equipment, that helped settle a famous debate about quantum mechanics between Einstein and famed physicist Niels Bohr. Einstein described a spooky action at a distance that he thought would eventually be disproved. I was betting on Einstein, Clauser said. But unfortunately I was wrong and Einstein was wrong and Bohr was right. Aspect said Einstein may have been technically wrong, but deserves huge credit for raising the right question that led to experiments proving quantum entanglement. Most people would assume that nature is made out of stuff distributed throughout space and time, said Clauser, who while a high school student in the 1950s built a video game on a vacuum tube computer. And that appears not to be the case. What the work shows is parts of the universe  even those at great distances from each other  are connected, said Johns Hopkins physicist N. Peter Armitage. This is something so unintuitive and something so at odds with how we feel the world should be. This hard-to-understand field started with thought experiments. But what in one sense is philosophical musings about the universe also holds hope for more secure and faster computers all based on entangled photons and matter that still interact no matter how distant. With my first experiments I was sometimes asked by the press what they were good for, Zeilinger, 77, told reporters in Vienna. And I said with pride: Its good for nothing. Im doing this purely out of curiosity. In quantum entanglement, establishing common information between two photons not near each other allows us to do things like secret communication, in ways which werent possible to do before, said David Haviland, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics. Quantum information has broad and potential implications in areas such as secure information transfer, quantum computing and sensing technology, said Eva Olsson, a member of the Nobel committee. Its predictions have opened doors to another world, and it has also shaken the very foundations of how we interpret measurements. The kind of secure communication used by Chinas Micius satellite  as well as by some banks  is a success story of quantum entanglement, said Harun Siljak of Trinity College Dublin. By using one entangled particle to create an encryption key, it ensures that only the person with the other entangled particle can decode the message and the secret shared between these two sides is a proper secret, Siljak said. While quantum entanglement is incredibly cool security technologist Bruce Schneier, who teaches at Harvard, said it is fortifying an already secure part of information technology where other areas, including human factors and software are more of a problem. He likened it to installing a side door with 25 locks on an otherwise insecure house. At a news conference, Aspect said real-world applications like the satellite were fantastic. I think we have progress toward quantum computing. I would not say that we are close, the 75-year-old physicist said. I dont know if I will see it in my life. But I am an old man. Speaking by phone to a news conference after the announcement, the University of Vienna-based Zeilinger said he was still kind of shocked at hearing he had received the award. Clauser, Aspect and Zeilinger have figured in Nobel speculation for more than a decade. In 2010 they won the Wolf Prize in Israel, seen as a possible precursor to the Nobel. The Nobel committee said Clauser developed quantum theories first put forward in the 1960s into a practical experiment. Aspect was able to close a loophole in those theories, while Zeilinger demonstrated a phenomenon called quantum teleportation that effectively allows information to be transmitted over distances. Using entanglement you can transfer all the information which is carried by an object over to some other place where the object is, so to speak, reconstituted, Zeilinger said. He added that this only works for tiny particles. It is not like in the Star Trek films (where one is) transporting something, certainly not the person, over some distance, he said. A week of Nobel Prize announcements kicked off Monday with Swedish scientist Svante Paabo receiving the award in medicine Monday for unlocking secrets of Neanderthal DNA that provided key insights into our immune system. Chemistry is on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 10. The prizes carry a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (nearly $900,000) and will be handed out on Dec. 10. The money comes from a bequest left by the prizes creator, Swedish dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895. ___ Jordans reported from Berlin, Borenstein from Kensington, Maryland, and Burakoff from New York.

"Russian launches to space from US, 1st time in 20 years","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.. (AP)  For the first time in 20 years, a Russian cosmonaut rocketed from the U.S. on Wednesday, launching to the International Space Station alongside NASA and Japanese astronauts despite tensions over the war in Ukraine. Were so glad to do it together, said Anna Kikina, Russias lone female cosmonaut, offering thanks in both English and Russian. Spasibo! She was among the three newcomers on the flight, alongside Marine Col. Nicole Mann, the first Native American woman to orbit the world, and Navy Capt. Josh Cassada. They were joined by Japan Space Agencys Koichi Wakata, who is making his fifth spaceflight. Awesome! radioed Mann. That was a smooth ride uphill. Youve got three rookies who are pretty happy to be floating in space right now. Theyre due to arrive at the space station Thursday, 29 hours after departing from NASAs Kennedy Space Center, and wont be back on Earth until March. Theyre replacing a U.S.-Italian crew that arrived in April. Their SpaceX flight was delayed by Hurricane Ian, which devastated parts of the state last week. The weather was ideal as the Falcon rocket blasted into a brilliant noontime sky. I hope with this launch we will brighten up the skies over Florida a little bit for everyone, Wakata said before the flight. Kikina is the Russian Space Agencys exchange for NASAs Frank Rubio, who launched to the space station two weeks ago from Kazakhstan aboard a Soyuz rocket. He flew up with two cosmonauts.  
        
     The space agencies agreed over the summer to swap seats on their flights in order to ensure a continuous U.S. and Russian presence aboard the 260-mile-high (420-kilometer-high) outpost. The barter was authorized even as global hostilities mounted over Russias invasion of Ukraine in late February. The next crew exchange is in the spring.  NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the key reason for the seat exchange is safety  in case an emergency forces one capsules crew home, there would still be an American and Russian on board.  In the meantime, Russia remains committed to the space station through at least 2024, Russia space official Sergei Krikalev assured reporters after liftoff. Russia wants to build its own station in orbit later this decade, but he said that will take time and until its ready, it makes sense to keep working with NASA. Krikalev, a former cosmonaut who was the first to launch on a U.S. rocket, noted that the two countries are at a new phase of space cooperation that began with the Apollo-Soyuz orbital linkup in 1975. NASAs commander for that mission, Thomas Stafford, attended Wednesdays launch. I hope we will cooperate together the way it was started in 1975, said Krikalev, while acknowledging hes trying to quell any friction between the two space agencies. NASA started flying cosmonauts on its space shuttles in 1994, first to Russias Mir space station and then to the fledgling space station. The 2003 Columbia reentry disaster put an end to it. But U.S. astronauts continued to hitch rides on Russian rockets for tens of millions of dollars per seat. Kakina is only the fifth Russian woman to rocket off the planet. She said she was surprised to be selected for the seat swap after encountering many tests and obstacles during her decade of training. But I did it. Im lucky maybe. Im strong, she said. Mann, a member of the Wailacki of the Round Valley Indian Tribes in California, took along her mothers dream catcher, a small traditional webbed hoop believed to offer protection. Retired NASA astronaut John Herrington of the Chickasaw Nation became the first Native American in space in 2002. I am very proud to represent Native Americans and my heritage, Mann said before the flight, adding that everyone on her crew has a unique background. Its important to celebrate our diversity and also realize how important it is when we collaborate and unite, the incredible accomplishments that we can have. As for the war in Ukraine, Mann said all four have put politics and personal beliefs aside, and its really cool how the common mission of the space station just instantly unites us. Added Cassada: We have an opportunity to be an example for society on how to work together and live together and explore together. Elon Musks SpaceX has now launched eight crews since 2020: six for NASA and two private groups. Boeing, NASAs other contracted taxi service, plans to make its first astronaut flight early next yea r, after delays to fix software and other issues that cropped up on test flights. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA to launch 2 more choppers to Mars to help return rocks,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is launching two more mini helicopters to Mars in its effort to return Martian rocks and soil samples to Earth.  Under the plan announced Wednesday, NASAs Perseverance rover will do double duty and transport the cache to the rocket that will launch them off the red planet a decade from now.  Perseverance already has gathered 11 samples with more rock drilling planned. The most recent sample, a sedimentary rock, holds the greatest promise of containing possible evidence of ancient Martian life, said Arizona State Universitys Meenakshi Wadhwa, chief scientist for the retrieval effort. Theres a diversity of materials already in the bag, so to speak, and really excited about the potential for bringing these back, she said. If Perseverance breaks down, the two helicopters being built and launched later this decade would load the samples onto the rocket instead.  The helicopters will be modeled after NASAs successful Ingenuity, which has made 29 flights since arriving with Perseverance at Mars early last year. The chopper weighs just 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). The new versions would have wheels and grappling arms. NASA officials said Perseverances impressive performance at Mars prompted them to ditch their plan to launch a separate fetch rover.  Jeff Gramling, director of NASAs Mars sample return program, said the revised path forward is simpler. Each helicopter will be designed to lift one sample tube at a time, making multiple trips back and forth. 
        
     We have confidence that we can count on Perseverance to bring the samples back and weve added the helicopters as a backup means, Gramling said. NASA is collaborating with the European Space Agency on the retrieval mission. If all goes as planned, as many as 30 samples would blast off from Mars in 2031 and arrive at Earth in 2033. Lab analysis is needed to see whether any sample holds signs of microbial life that may have existed on Mars billions of years ago when water flowed on the planet. As for the grounded ExoMars rover, it cannot be refashioned to help retrieve these samples, said David Parker, director of human and robotic exploration for ESA. It was returned to storage after Russia and Europe cut ties with the project because of the war in Ukraine. Russia was supposed to provide the rocket ride. A decision on when the rover still can launch to Mars later this decade wont come until late fall, Parker said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"As species recover, some threaten others in more dire shape","GLEN ARBOR, Mich. (AP)  Concealed behind trees near Lake Michigan, two scientists remotely manipulated a robotic owl on the forest floor. As the intruder flapped its wings and hooted, a merlin guarding its nest in a nearby pine sounded distress calls. The small falcon dove toward the enemy  and into a net that Smithsonian interns Tim Baerwald and Zachary Bordner had stretched between steel poles. They disentangled the merlin, then attached a leg band and transmission unit to trace its movements. The mission will enhance knowledge of a species still recovering from a significant drop-off caused by pesticides including DDT, banned in 1972 after harming many birds of prey. Its also helping Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore managers protect the piping plover, an endangered shorebird that merlins eat. Merlins are a big threat to their recovery, said Nathan Cooper, research ecologist with Smithsonians National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. The situation is ironic: A troubled species rebounds thanks to restoration efforts, only to make things worse for others in peril by preying on them or outcompeting them for food and living space. Similar circumstances have turned up elsewhere, challenging wildlife experts who want them all to thrive in balanced, healthy environments. The iconic bald eagles comeback has pressured rare water birds. Resurgent peregrine falcons menace endangered California least terns and Western snowy plovers near San Diego. Off the California coast, attacks from protected white sharks hinder recovery of threatened sea otters. 
        
     Gray seals previously on the brink of extirpation in New England waters now occupy some Massachusetts beaches by the hundreds. The 800-pound mammals return has raised worries about vulnerable fish stocks. Such unintended consequences dont necessarily reveal flaws in the U.S. Endangered Species Act or conservation programs, experts say. Rather, they illustrate natures complexity and the importance of protecting biological communities, not just individual species. Clearly there are occasions when we get these conflicts between species that were trying to protect, said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University extinction specialist. But is it a major worry in conservation? No. Species recoveries can produce tradeoffs, as some animals are more adaptable than others to changes in the climate or landscape, said Bruce Stein, chief scientist with the National Wildlife Federation.  A lot of ecosystems where these things are occurring are a little out of whack to begin with because weve altered them in some way, Stein said. The Great Lakes region has an estimated 65 to 70 pairs of piping plovers. Theyre among three remaining North American populations, their decline caused primarily by habitat loss and predation. Meanwhile, merlin numbers in the region have jumped. Theyre suspected of killing at least 57 adult plovers, Cooper said. Data from the transmitters might help determine whether relocating them is worth trying, said Vince Cavalieri, a biologist with the national lakeshore. Recovery of Americas national bird, the bald eagle, is a triumph. But in one area of coastal Maine, it poses a problem for the only U.S. breeding population of great cormorants. When theyre disturbed by eagles, the adult cormorants will flush and leave their nests, said Don Lyons, a conservation scientist at the National Audubon Societys Seabird Institute. Gulls, ravens and crows gobble abandoned cormorant eggs and chicks. If this happens repeatedly, an entire colony can fail, said Lyons, whose team organizes volunteers to scare away eagles. In Southern California, least terns and snowy plovers are no match for attacking peregrine falcons, which like eagles bounced back after the DDT ban. Such pesticides cause large birds to produce eggs with thin shells, which females crush when trying to incubate them. The San Diego Zoo and Wildlife Alliance tries to protect the endangered birds by hiring a falconer to capture problem peregrines for release elsewhere, said Nacho Vilchis, a conservation ecologist. Hunting and bounties devastated New Englands gray seals. Legally protected since 1972, the population has rebounded to tens of thousands. Fishing groups contend the seals could threaten cod stocks that regulators are struggling to rebuild from overfishing. Gray seals are certainly this case where recovery has both been cause for celebration and cause for concern, said Kristina Cammen, a University of Maine marine mammal scientist who says theyre less of a hazard to fish populations than humans are. Some reviving species may be more a nuisance to people than a threat to other wildlife. Fish farmers in the South and anglers in the Great Lakes region and Pacific Northwest complain about the double-crested cormorant, a diving bird that gorges on catfish, perch, salmon and other prized species. Cormorants have done so well since the DDT ban that agencies have tried limiting them in some locations with egg oiling, nest destruction and even shooting. Wild turkeys, spread across North America before European settlement, had dwindled to tens of thousands by the 1930s, disappearing from many states. Now theyre hunted in 49 states and so common in New England they cause traffic tie-ups. Some hunters say hungry turkeys outcompete ruffed grouse, which are decreasing in parts of their range, including the Upper Midwest. Scientists blame habitat loss and climate change. The National Wild Turkey Federation is helping move turkeys from states with plenty  such as North Carolina, Maine and West Virginia  to Texas and others needing more, said Mark Hatfield, national director of conservation services. Conflicts between recovering species and ones still in trouble could reflect a return to how things were before humans got in the way, scientists say. When a population gets back to where its having the same interactions with other organisms as before it went down, thats nature at work, said John Fitzpatrick, emeritus director of Cornell Universitys Laboratory of Ornithology. The bald eagle is challenging our preconceived notions about whats normal for prey such as great cormorants in New England and common murres on the West Coast, which might have been less abundant before eagles declined, said Lyons of the Audubon Society. The eagles recovery complicates the conservation of certain other species, Lyons said. But their recovery is such a wonderful outcome ... thats a welcome complication. ___ Larson reported from Washington, D.C., and Whittle reported from Portland, Maine. ___ On Twitter follow Flesher: @JohnFlesher; Larson @LarsonChristina and Whittle: @pxwhittle",https://apnews.com/article/abridged-content-7f8d44821f84e0d0358b9e9b40db01ac,science
"South Korean spacecraft launched to the moon, countrys 1st","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  South Korea joined the stampede to the moon Thursday with the launch of a lunar orbiter that will scout out future landing spots. The satellite launched by SpaceX is taking a long, roundabout path to conserve fuel and will arrive in December. If successful, it will join spacecraft from the U.S. and India already operating around the moon, and a Chinese rover exploring the moons far side. India, Russia and Japan have new moon missions launching later this year or next, as do a slew of private companies in the U.S. and elsewhere. And NASA is next up with the debut of its mega moon rocket in late August. South Koreas $180 million mission  the countrys first step in lunar exploration  features a boxy, solar-powered satellite designed to skim just 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the lunar surface. Scientists expect to collect geologic and other data for at least a year from this low polar orbit. It is South Koreas second shot at space in six weeks. In June, South Korea successfully launched a package of satellites into orbit around Earth for the first time using its own rocket. The first try last fall fizzled, with the test satellite failing to reach orbit. And in May, South Korea joined a NASA-led coalition to explore the moon with astronauts in the coming years and decades. NASA is targeting the end of this month for the first launch in its Artemis program. The goal is to send an empty crew capsule around the moon and back to test the systems before a crew climbs aboard in two years.  
        
     Danuri  Korean for enjoy the moon  is carrying six science instruments, including a camera for NASA. Its designed to peer into the permanently shadowed, ice-filled craters at the lunar poles. NASA favors the lunar south pole for future astronaut outposts because of evidence of frozen water. South Korea plans to land its own spacecraft on the moon  a robotic probe  by 2030 or so.  Danuri is just the beginning, Sang-Ryool Lee, president of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, said in the SpaceX launch webcast. SpaceXs Falcon 9 rocket carrying Danuri took off from Cape Canaveral close to sunset. The first-stage booster  making its sixth flight  landed on an ocean platform several minutes later for further recycling. It was the third spaceshot of the day from the U.S. United Launch Alliance kicked things off at sunrise in Florida, launching an Atlas V rocket with an infrared missile-detection satellite for the U.S. Space Force. Then Jeff Bezos Blue Origin rocket company sent six passengers on a quick ride to space from West Texas.

"EXPLAINER: On China, US and climate, action, not talk is key","The last two agreements the world made to battle climate change came only after the United States and China, by far the two biggest carbon polluters, made deals with each other. Now the successful dynamic is in jeopardy with China cutting off climate talks with the U.S. because of House Speaker Nancy Pelosis trip to Taiwan. Just how much this will sidetrack momentum -- especially in the United States where theres congressional action to cut emissions of heat-trapping gas  depends on how long the rift extends, experts said. But they said theres hope that climate actions already set in motion in both countries will matter more than unspoken words. Chinas announcement that its suspending talks on climate change is not surprising, but it definitely stings, said Joanna Lewis, an expert on China, energy and climate at Georgetown University. I hope this is only a temporary pause.  The brief notice issued on Friday by Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave few details and was largely focused on ceasing military and strategic meetings. Halting climate talks between the U.S. and China imperils progress at a global climate summit in November, and specifically direct cooperation on thorny technical issues related to reducing methane emissions, said Lewis.  U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said Friday, Suspending cooperation doesnt punish the United States  it punishes the world, particularly the developing world. The human and financial cost will be catastrophic if countries cant set aside differences to address climate change. CLIMATE ACTION AT HOME 
        
     Just because the two nations arent talking to each other about climate doesnt mean they are not acting, experts say. What the U.S and China actually have to do to curb emissions is take strong actions domestically  and I dont believe the main impetus for either side right now is pressure from international negotiations, said Deborah Seligsohn, an expert on Chinas politics and energy at Villanova University and a former U.S. diplomat. Longtime climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the independent think tank E3G said theres a good possibility of the U.S. and, then in response, China taking big steps to try to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases  even if they arent talking one-on-one. The U.S. Congress is poised to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the deal struck by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.  Calling it the U.S.'s  most significant climate bill ever, Nigel Purvis, CEO of Climate Advisers, said that passage will be more meaningful than a breakdown in bilateral talks. China will need to respond to that new climate change bill coming out of Congress even if climate talks are suspended, he said. In particular, pledges of public investment in developing and commercializing advanced clean technologies will get Chinas attention, experts say. Thats because China hopes to dominate global clean energy markets.  Its significant that arguably the two biggest domestic actions the U.S. and China have taken on climate change have happened at a time of continually increasing rivalry between the two countries  perhaps theres a lesson in that, said Scott Moore, Director of China Programs and Strategic Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania.  While the U.S. is poised to pass its most significant climate legislation this year, Chinas leader Xi Jinping announced the countrys target to become carbon neutral by 2060 at a United Nations meeting in September 2020. And Xi pledged that China would stop building overseas coal-fired power plants at a U.N. meeting last year.  Given their different government systems, what matters most in China is top-level targets, while what matters in the U.S. is actually passing legislation, said Villanovas Seligsohn. GLOBAL CLIMATE TALKS Its not clear whether Chinas announcements cutting off talks applies only to top negotiators John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua, or to research and cooperation at all levels, which would be worse, said E3Gs Meyer.  But he said it would be a good sign if multilateral negotiations, such as the G-20 where the U.S. and China often co-lead talks, continue.  Historically, climate deals often go through Beijing and Washington. When the U.S. and China have found common ground, it has tended to provide a model for the rest of the world, Purvis said. A joint U.S.-China deal to fight climate change struck by Xi and then-President Barack Obama in 2014 really helped improve the mood and laid groundwork for the 2015 Paris agreement where nearly every nation pledged to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases, Meyer said. Then seven years later during U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, a U.S.-China deal helped smooth over bumps to another international climate deal. Until recently, climate diplomacy had stayed a rare area of dialogue and even collegiality as Bidens and Xis governments confronted one another on human rights, Chinas territorial claims, tariffs and other topics. Kerry and Xie, both senior leaders in government service, have spoken by telephone often and appeared side by side at global events.  Losing that avenue of cooperation is a strong signal from China, said University of Pennsylvanias Moore. Climate has been the one issue that, on both sides, there was an attempt to insulate and run on separate tracks, insulated from broader tensions in the relationship, he said. But that might not be possible anymore. - AP writers Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this article. ___ Follow APs climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears and Christina Larson at @larsonchristina.  ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Do spiders sleep? Study suggests they may snooze like humans,"NEW YORK (AP)  Its a question that keeps some scientists awake at night: Do spiders sleep? Daniela Roessler and her colleagues trained cameras on baby jumping spiders at night to find out. The footage showed patterns that looked a lot like sleep cycles: The spiders legs twitched and parts of their eyes flickered. The researchers described this pattern as a REM sleep-like state. In humans, REM, or rapid eye movement, is an active phase of sleep when parts of the brain light up with activity and is closely linked with dreaming.  Other animals, including some birds and mammals, have been shown to experience REM sleep. But creatures like the jumping spider havent gotten as much attention so it wasnt known if they got the same kind of sleep, said Roessler, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Konstanz in Germany. Their findings were published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Roessler and her team dug into the sleep question after she discovered the spiders hanging at night from threads of silk in their lab containers. She had recently scooped up some jumping spiders to study, a common species with a furry brown body and four pairs of big eyes. It was just the most unusual thing Ive ever seen, Roessler said of the suspended spiders. The research showed the spiders overnight movements looked a lot like REM in other species, she said  like dogs or cats twitching in their sleep. And they happened in regular cycles, similar to sleep patterns in humans. 
        
     Many species similar to spiders actually dont have movable eyes, which makes it hard to compare their sleep cycles, explained study co-author Paul Shamble, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University. But these jumping spiders are predators that move their retinas around to change their gaze while they hunt, Shamble said. Plus, the young spiders have a see-through outer layer that gives a clear window into their bodies. Sometimes as a biologist, you just get really, really lucky, Shamble said. The researchers still have to figure out if the spiders are technically sleeping while theyre in these resting states, Roessler said. That includes testing whether they respond more slowly  or not at all  to triggers that would normally set them off. Critters like the jumping spider are very far from humans on the evolutionary tree. Jerry Siegel, a sleep researcher who was not involved with the study, said hes doubtful that the spiders can really experience REM sleep. There may be animals that have activity in quiet states, said Siegel, of the UCLA Center for Sleep Research. But are they REM sleep? Its hard to imagine that they could be the same thing. But Barrett Klein, an entomologist at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse who was also not involved with the study, said it was exciting to find REM-like signs in such a distant relative. Many questions remain about how widespread REM sleep is and what purpose it might serve for species, he said. REM sleep is still very much a black box, Klein said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Major test of first possible Lyme vaccine in 20 years begins,"DUNCANSVILLE, Pa. (AP)  Researchers are seeking thousands of volunteers in the U.S. and Europe to test the first potential vaccine against Lyme disease in 20 years -- in hopes of better fighting the tick-borne threat. Lyme is a growing problem, with cases rising and warming weather helping ticks expand their habitat. While a vaccine for dogs has long been available, the only Lyme vaccine for humans was pulled off the U.S. market in 2002 from lack of demand, leaving people to rely on bug spray and tick checks. Now Pfizer and French biotech Valneva are aiming to avoid previous pitfalls in developing a new vaccine to protect both adults and kids as young as 5 from the most common Lyme strains on two continents. There wasnt such a recognition, I think, of the severity of Lyme disease and how many people it affects the last time around, Pfizer vaccine chief Annaliesa Anderson told The Associated Press. Robert Terwilliger, an avid hunter and hiker, was first in line Friday when the study opened in central Pennsylvania. Hes seen lots of friends get Lyme and is tired of wondering if his next tick bite will make him sick. Its always a worry, you know? Especially when youre sitting in a tree stand hunting and you feel something crawling on you, said Terwilliger, 60, of Williamsburg, Pennsylvania. Youve got to be very, very cautious.  Exactly how often Lyme disease strikes isnt clear. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites insurance records suggesting 476,000 people are treated for Lyme in the U.S. each year. Pfizers Anderson put Europes yearly infections at about 130,000. 
        
     Black-legged ticks, also called deer ticks, carry Lyme-causing bacteria. The infection initially causes fatigue, fever and joint pain. Often -- but not always -- the first sign is a red, round bulls-eye rash.  Early antibiotic treatment is crucial, but it can be hard for people to tell if they were bitten by ticks, some as small as a pin. Untreated Lyme can cause severe arthritis and damage the heart and nervous system. Some people have lingering symptoms even after treatment.  Most vaccines against other diseases work after people are exposed to a germ. The Lyme vaccine offers a different strategy  working a step earlier to block a tick bite from transmitting the infection, said Dr. Gary Wormser, a Lyme expert at New York Medical College who isnt involved with the new research. How? It targets an outer surface protein of the Lyme bacterium called OspA thats present in the ticks gut. Its estimated a tick must feed on someone for about 36 hours before the bacteria spreads to its victim. That delay gives time for antibodies the tick ingests from a vaccinated persons blood to attack the germs right at the source. In small, early-stage studies, Pfizer and Valneva reported no safety problems and a good immune response. The newest study will test if the vaccine, called VLA15, really protects and is safe. The companies aim to recruit at least 6,000 people in Lyme-prone areas including the Northeast U.S. plus Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.  Theyll receive three shots, either the vaccine or a placebo, between now and next springs tick season. A year later, theyll get a single booster dose. Were really looking at something thats a seasonal vaccine, Anderson said, so people have high antibody levels during the months when ticks are most active. Volunteers can be as young as 5 and should be at high risk because they spend a lot of time in tick-infested areas, such as hikers, campers and hunters, said Dr. Alan Kivitz who heads one of the study sites at Altoona Center for Clinical Research in Duncansville, Pennsylvania.  In his own practice, not a single day goes by that someone either has a concern about Lyme disease, could possibly have Lyme disease, Kivitz said. This new candidate is different from a previous Lyme vaccine that GlaxoSmithKline pulled off the market in 2002 amid controversy and low sales. With about 75% effectiveness, that old Lyme shot got a lukewarm endorsement from vaccine experts, wasnt tested in children and drew unsubstantiated reports of joint-related side effects. While the new Pfizer-Valneva vaccine also targets the OspA protein, its engineered somewhat differently than its predecessor and also targets six Lyme strains in the U.S. and Europe instead of just one. The Pfizer study will span two tick seasons to get answers  but its not the only research into new ways to prevent Lyme. University of Massachusetts scientists are working on a vaccine alternative, shots of pre-made Lyme-fighting antibodies. And Yale University researchers are in early stages of designing a vaccine that recognizes a ticks saliva  which in animal testing sparked a skin reaction that made it harder for ticks to hang on and feed.  Since different tick species carry many diseases other than Lyme, ultimately were all hoping for a tick-bite prevention vaccine, Wormser said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Were back, baby': New bill boosts US climate credibility","WASHINGTON (AP)  After a moment when hopes dimmed that the United States could become an international leader on climate change, legislation that Congress is poised to approve could rejuvenate the countrys reputation and bolster its efforts to push other nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more quickly.  The head-snapping turn of events, which has generated a joyful case of whiplash among Democrats and environmentalists, is a reminder of how domestic politics is intertwined with worldwide diplomacy. Advocates feared that last months breakdown in negotiations in Congress had undermined efforts to limit the catastrophic effects of global warming. Now theyre energized by the opportunity to tout an unprecedented U.S. success. This says, Were back, baby, said Jennifer Turner, who works on international climate issues as director of the Woodrow Wilson Centers China Environment Forum in Washington. The legislation, which also has provisions on taxes and prescription drugs, includes about $375 billion over the next decade for clean energy development and financial incentives for buying electric cars, installing solar panels and weaning the power grid off fossil fuels. Although the proposals were downsized during difficult negotiations, its the single biggest investment in climate change in U.S. history, and a significant shift from years of inaction that limited Washingtons clout overseas.  The Senate passed the legislation on Sunday, and the House is expected to approve it on Friday. Then it goes to President Joe Biden for his signature.  
        
     Poor nations remain concerned that rich countries like the United States have not fulfilled financial commitments to help them cope with global warming and transition to clean energy, something the legislation does not address. But Biden can still point to it as evidence that the U.S. political system can address the worlds most pressing problems. Our ability to have credibility on the global stage depends on our ability to deliver at home, said Ali Zaidi, the White House deputy national climate adviser. We are the pace car. That helps other people go faster and faster. After President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord, Biden entered office pledging to rejoin the fight against global warming. He set an ambitious new target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030  and began proposing policies to put the country on track. The legislation that Biden is expected to sign is estimated to reduce emissions between 31% to 44%, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Further regulatory steps by the administration could close the rest of the gap.  Its good that finally the U.S. is trying to catch up after years of dragging its feet on climate change and this investment will go a long way to undoing some of the harm caused by the administration of President Trump, said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank based in Nairobi, Kenya.  The movement on the bill comes just three months before the next U.N. conference on climate change, which is known as COP27 and will take place in Egypt.  Lets hope this legislation is the start of more international cooperation in the lead up to the COP27 summit, where the most vulnerable get the support they need, Adow said. Although the U.S. will still face entrenched skepticism, the progress in Washington may also give John Kerry, the White Houses special envoy on climate, more momentum going into the conference in November.  It puts wind in his sail, it gives him a real credibility boost, Turner said. This will change the whole dynamic. Several experts said the U.S. will be empowered to put more pressure on China, India and other nations that have high emissions but have been unwilling to cut back for economic reasons.  This restores some diplomatic legitimacy to the U.S. as an influential player in international climate negotiations, said Scott Moore, director of China Programs and Strategic Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania. Shayak Sengupta, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation America, a Washington-based affiliate of a think tank in India, was less enthusiastic.  Considering that this bill is long over due after years of U.S. climate inaction, many countries may view this as the bare minimum of the U.S.s historical and moral responsibility for climate, he said. Sengupta emphasized that poor nations are still looking for rich countries to fulfill their $100 billion commitment for financial assistance to address global warming, an issue thats been a sore spot during international negotiations.  There will be no shortage of other challenges, too. If Republicans retake Congress or the White House, they could unravel Bidens progress. Supply chains could struggle to accommodate increased demand for equipment like solar panels and batteries. Chinas foreign ministry on Friday announced the country is cutting off direct climate talks with the U.S. in response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosis trip to Taiwan, severing a rare point of longstanding, if sometimes tumultuous, cooperation between the two countries.  However, experts said China will still take notice if the U.S. succeeds in becoming a clean energy powerhouse.  For a while now, China has been leading in clean energy investment globally, said Xizhou Zhou, an expert in climate and sustainability at S&P Global, a global research firm. They will probably see this legislation as a competitive move. Deborah Seligsohn, an expert on Chinas politics and energy at Villanova University and a former U.S. diplomat in Beijing, said the result could be lower prices globally.  To the extent the U.S. starts really investing in things that compete with key Chinese businesses  in solar, wind, electric vehicles, batteries  I think youre going to see Chinese businesses interested in ramping up their competitiveness in these industries, by making better products and bringing prices down, she said.  That could have a ripple effect around the world.  Developing countries may see prices for renewable energy going down, and adoption going up, Seligsohn said.  Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist focused on India, said U.S. investment in clean energy research could pay dividends in poorer nations that dont have the same resources to develop new technologies.  The U.S. can share the technology know-how with other countries, especially the Global South, she said. Aditya Ramji, from the Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California, Davis, said that cooperation  along with financial help  will be critical.  At some point there will have to be discussions on how they can provide intellectual property access or lower costs to countries like India and others to leverage electric vehicle technology, he said. Climate activists said the U.S. legislation is just one step on a larger path towards climate action. More progress is needed to put the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a target that some scientists believe is slipping out of reach.  We need to fight for political commitments in other countries, said climate activist Luisa Neubauer, a leading figure in the Fridays for Future activist movement. Thats the only way we will manage to turn this from a year of fossil fuel backlash to a year of climate justice, she said. ___ Associated Press writers Frank Jordans in Berlin and Sibi Arasu in Bangalore, India, contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

"Scientists use tiny trackers, plane to follow moths on move","NEW YORK (AP)  Trillions of insects migrate across the globe each year, yet little is known about their journeys. So to look for clues, scientists in Germany took to the skies, placing tiny trackers on the backs of giant moths and following them by plane. To the researchers surprise, the moths seemed to have a strong sense of where they were going. Even when the winds changed, the insects stayed on a straight course, the scientists reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Science. Their flight paths suggest these deaths-head hawk moths have some complex navigation skills, the authors said, challenging earlier ideas that insects are just wanderers. For many, many years, it was thought that insect migration was mostly just dictated by winds, and they were blowing around, said lead author Myles Menz, now a zoologist at James Cook University in Australia. Its been tough for scientists to get a close look at how insects travel, in part because of their small size, Menz said. The kinds of radio tags used to follow birds can be too heavy for smaller fliers. But transmitters have gotten tinier. And it helps that the deaths-head hawk moth is huge compared to other insects, with a wingspan up to 5 inches (127 millimeters).  The iconic species  dark colored with yellow underwings and skull-like markings  was able to fly well with the tiny tracker glued to its back, said Martin Wikelski, a study co-author and migration researcher at Germanys Max Planck Institute for Animal Behavior. 
        
     The moths are thought to migrate thousands of miles between Europe and Africa in the autumn, flying by night. For the study, researchers released tagged moths in Germany in the hopes theyd start flying on their migration path toward the Alps. Wikelski, the studys pilot, took off in his plane, circling the area and waiting for any moths on the move. If he did pick up a signal from a tiny traveler, he would follow its radio blips for hours at a time.  The little moth is guiding you, he said.  The researchers followed the flight paths of 14 moths, with their longest track around 56 miles (90 kilometers).  Not only did the moths fly in straight lines, but they also seemed to work around wind conditions, Menz said, flying low to the ground when the winds were against them, or rising up to catch a helpful tail wind. Though the number of moths tracked was fairly small, getting any close-up look at insect migration is significant, said Ryan Norris, an insect and bird migration researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, who was not involved in the study. I was surprised at how far they could track them, Norris said. And it certainly is surprising that individual moths stay on this straight trajectory. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASAs moon rocket moved to launch pad for 1st test flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new moon rocket arrived at the launch pad Wednesday ahead of its debut flight in less than two weeks.  The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket emerged from its mammoth hangar late Tuesday night, drawing crowds of Kennedy Space Center workers, many of whom were not yet born when NASA sent astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. It took nearly 10 hours for the rocket to make the four-mile trip to the pad, pulling up at sunrise.  NASA is aiming for an Aug. 29 liftoff for the lunar test flight. No one will be inside the crew capsule atop the rocket, just three mannequins swarming with sensors to measure radiation and vibration.  The capsule will fly around the moon in a distant orbit for a couple weeks, before heading back for a splashdown in the Pacific. The entire flight should last six weeks. The flight is the first moonshot in NASAs Artemis program. The space agency is aiming for a lunar-orbiting flight with astronauts in two years and a lunar landing by a human crew as early as 2025. Thats much later than NASA anticipated when it established the program more than a decade ago, as the space shuttle fleet retired. The years of delays have added billions of dollars to the cost. Now for the first time since 1972, were going to be launching a rocket thats designed for deep space, NASAs rocket program manager, John Honeycutt, said recently. NASAs new SLS moon rocket, short for Space Launch System, is 41 feet (12 meters) shorter than the Saturn V rockets used during Apollo a half-century ago. But its more powerful, using a core stage and twin strap-on boosters, similar to the ones used for the space shuttles. 
        
     When you look at the rocket, it almost looks retro. It looks like were looking back toward the Saturn V, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told reporters earlier this month. But its a totally different, new, highly sophisticated, more sophisticated rocket and spacecraft. Twenty-four astronauts flew to the moon during Apollo, with 12 of them landing on it from 1969 through 1972. The space agency wants a more diverse team and more sustained effort under Artemis, named after Apollos mythological twin sister. I want to underscore that this is a test flight, Nelson said. Its just the beginning. This was the rockets third trip to the pad. A countdown test in April was marred by fuel leaks and other equipment trouble, forcing NASA to return the rocket to the hangar for repairs. The dress rehearsal was repeated at the pad in June, with improved results. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Russian spacewalk cut short by bad battery in cosmonaut suit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A Russian spacewalker had to rush back inside the International Space Station on Wednesday when the battery voltage in his spacesuit suddenly dropped. Russian Mission Control ordered Oleg Artemyev, the station commander, to quickly return to the airlock so he could hook his suit to station power. The hatch remained open as his spacewalking partner, Denis Matveev, tidied up outside. NASA said neither man was ever in any danger. Matveev, in fact, remained outside for another hour or so, before he, too, was ordered to wrap it up. Matveevs suit was fine, but Russian Mission Control cut the spacewalk short since flight rules insist on the buddy system. The cosmonauts managed to install cameras on the European Space Agencys new robot arm before the trouble cropped up, barely two hours into a planned 6 1/2-hour spacewalk. You know, the start was so excellent, Matveev said as he made his way back inside, with some of the robot arm installation work left undone. The 36-foot (11-meter) robot arm arrived at the space station last summer aboard a Russian lab. NASA spacewalks, meanwhile, have been on hold for months. In March, water seeped into a German spacewalkers helmet. It was not nearly as much leakage as occurred in 2013 when an Italian astronaut almost drowned, but still posed a safety concern. In the earlier case, the water originated from the cooling system in the suits undergarments.

"Giant sharks once roamed the seas, feasting on huge meals","NEW YORK (AP)  Todays sharks have nothing on their ancient cousins. A giant shark that roamed the oceans millions of years ago could have devoured a creature the size of a killer whale in just five bites, new research suggests.  For their study published Wednesday, researchers used fossil evidence to create a 3D model of the megalodon  one of the biggest predatory fish of all time  and find clues about its life. At around 50 feet (16 meters) from nose to tail, the megalodon was bigger than a school bus, according to the study in the journal Science Advances. Thats about two to three times the size of todays great white shark. The megalodons gaping jaw allowed it to feed on other big creatures. Once it filled its massive stomach, it could roam the oceans for months at a time, the researchers suggest. The megalodon was a strong swimmer, too: Its average cruising speed was faster than sharks today and it could have migrated across multiple oceans with ease, they calculated. It would be a superpredator just dominating its ecosystem, said co-author John Hutchinson, who studies the evolution of animal movement at Englands Royal Veterinary College. There is nothing really matching it. Its been tough for scientists to get a clear picture of the megalodon, said study author Catalina Pimiento, a paleobiologist with the University of Zurich and Swansea University in Wales. 
        
     The skeleton is made of soft cartilage that doesnt fossilize well, Pimiento said. So the scientists used what few fossils are available, including a rare collection of vertebrae thats been at a Belgium museum since the 1860s.  Researchers also brought in a jaws worth of megalodon teeth, each as big as a human fist, Hutchinson said. Scans of modern great white sharks helped flesh out the rest. Based on their digital creation, researchers calculated that the megalodon would have weighed around 70 tons, or as much as 10 elephants.  Even other high-level predators may have been lunch meat for the megalodon, which could open its jaw to almost 6 feet (2 meters) wide, Pimiento said. Megalodons lived an estimated 23 million to 2.6 million years ago. Since megalodon fossils are rare, these kinds of models require a leap of imagination, said Michael Gottfried, a paleontologist at Michigan State University who was not involved in the study. But he said the studys findings are reasonable based on what is known about the giant shark. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"New space telescope shows Jupiters auroras, tiny moons","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The worlds newest and biggest space telescope is showing Jupiter as never before, auroras and all.  Scientists released the shots Monday of the solar systems biggest planet. The James Webb Space Telescope took the photos in July, capturing unprecedented views of Jupiters northern and southern lights, and swirling polar haze. Jupiters Great Red Spot, a storm big enough to swallow Earth, stands out brightly alongside countless smaller storms. One wide-field picture is particularly dramatic, showing the faint rings around the planet, as well as two tiny moons against a glittering background of galaxies. Weve never seen Jupiter like this. Its all quite incredible, said planetary astronomer Imke de Pater, of the University of California, Berkeley, who helped lead the observations.  We hadnt really expected it to be this good, to be honest, she added in a statement. The infrared images were artificially colored in blue, white, green, yellow and orange, according to the U.S.-French research team, to make the features stand out.  NASA and the European Space Agencys $10 billion successor to the Hubble Space Telescope rocketed away at the end of last year and has been observing the cosmos in the infrared since summer. Scientists hope to behold the dawn of the universe with Webb, peering all the way back to when the first stars and galaxies were forming 13.7 billion years ago. The observatory is positioned 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Our first steps? Fossil may boost case for earliest ancestor,"NEW YORK (AP)  Twenty years ago, scientists discovered a 7-million-year-old skull that they concluded belonged to a creature who walked upright and was our earliest known ancestor. Not everyone was convinced. Now, the researchers are back with more evidence they say strengthens their case. Their new study published Wednesday analyzed arm and leg fossils found near the skull in Africa, looking for signs of walking on two feet instead of on all fours. When early humans started walking upright, it marked a key moment in our split away from apes  In the paper in the journal Nature, researchers again place the creature just on the human side of that evolutionary divide. The fossil species, named Sahelanthropus tchadensis, walked upright while still being able to climb around in trees, they reported. The species has been dated to around 7 million years ago, which makes it the oldest known human ancestor, by a long shot. Thats about a million years older than other early known hominins. But its been a source of fierce debate since the fossils were first unearthed in Chad in 2001. Researchers  also led by scientists at the University of Poitiers in France  initially looked at the fossil creatures skull, teeth and jaw. They argued that the creature must have walked on two feet and held its head upright, based on the location of the hole in the skull where the spinal cord connects to the brain. Other experts werent swayed by the early evidence. 
        
     The latest work includes a thighbone that was not linked to S. tchadensis at first and went unstudied for years. Other researchers at the French university found the bone in the labs collection and realized it probably belonged to the fossil species. Compared to bones from other species, the thighbone matched up better with upright-walking humans than knuckle-walking apes, according to the study. There is not one feature. There is just a total pattern of features, co-author Franck Guy said of their analysis at a press briefing. Still, the debate over the species is likely to continue.  Ashley Hammond, a scientist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York said more research is needed to find the creatures place on the evolutionary tree. Im not fully convinced yet, Hammond said. This could still also be a fossil ape.  Another researcher at the French university, Roberto Macchiarelli, had previously examined the thighbone and determined the species was probably an ape. Looking at the new study, Macchiarelli said he still doesnt believe the species was a hominin, though it might have walked on two legs at times. Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonians Human Origins Program, said the thighbone puts the species on better footing as a possible early human ancestor. But the real confirmation comes down to a common saying in the field: Show me more fossils.

"EXPLAINER: NASA tests new moon rocket, 50 years after Apollo","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Years late and billions over budget, NASAs new moon rocket makes its debut next week in a high-stakes test flight before astronauts get on top. The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket will attempt to send an empty crew capsule into a far-flung lunar orbit, 50 years after NASAs famed Apollo moonshots.  If all goes well, astronauts could strap in as soon as 2024 for a lap around the moon, with NASA aiming to land two people on the lunar surface by the end of 2025.  Liftoff is set for Monday morning from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. The six-week test flight is risky and could be cut short if something fails, NASA officials warn. Were going to stress it and test it. Were going make it do things that we would never do with a crew on it in order to try to make it as safe as possible, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The retired founder of George Washington Universitys space policy institute said a lot is riding on this trial run. Spiraling costs and long gaps between missions will make for a tough comeback if things go south, he noted. It is supposed to be the first step in a sustained program of human exploration of the moon, Mars, and beyond, said John Logsdon. Will the United States have the will to push forward in the face of a major malfunction? The price tag for this single mission: more than $4 billion. Add everything up since the programs inception a decade ago until a 2025 lunar landing, and theres even more sticker shock: $93 billion. 
        
     Heres a rundown of the first flight of the Artemis program, named after Apollos mythological twin sister. ROCKET POWER The new rocket is shorter and slimmer than the Saturn V rockets that hurled 24 Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. But its mightier, packing 8.8 million pounds (4 million kilograms) of thrust. Its called the Space Launch System rocket, SLS for short, but a less clunky name is under discussion, according to Nelson. Unlike the streamlined Saturn V, the new rocket has a pair of strap-on boosters refashioned from NASAs space shuttles. The boosters will peel away after two minutes, just like the shuttle boosters did, but wont be fished from the Atlantic for reuse. The core stage will keep firing before separating and crashing into the Pacific in pieces. Two hours after liftoff, an upper stage will send the capsule, Orion, racing toward the moon.  MOONSHIP NASAs high-tech, automated Orion capsule is named after the constellation, among the night skys brightest. At 11 feet (3 meters) tall, its roomier than Apollos capsule, seating four astronauts instead of three. For this test flight, a full-size dummy in an orange flight suit will occupy the commanders seat, rigged with vibration and acceleration sensors. Two other mannequins made of material simulating human tissue  heads and female torsos, but no limbs  will measure cosmic radiation, one of the biggest risks of spaceflight. One torso is testing a protective vest from Israel. Unlike the rocket, Orion has launched before, making two laps around Earth in 2014. This time, the European Space Agencys service module will be attached for propulsion and solar power via four wings. FLIGHT PLAN Orions flight is supposed to last six weeks from its Florida liftoff to Pacific splashdown, twice as long as astronaut trips in order to tax the systems. It will take nearly a week to reach the moon, 240,000 miles (386,000 kilometers) away. After whipping closely around the moon, the capsule will enter a distant orbit with a far point of 38,000 miles (61,000 kilometers). That will put Orion 280,000 miles (450,000 kilometers) from Earth, farther than Apollo. The big test comes at missions end, as Orion hits the atmosphere at 25,000 mph (40,000 kph) on its way to a splashdown in the Pacific. The heat shield uses the same material as the Apollo capsules to withstand reentry temperatures of 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,750 degrees Celsius). But the advanced design anticipates the faster, hotter returns by future Mars crews. HITCHHIKERS Besides three test dummies, the flight has a slew of stowaways for deep space research. Ten shoebox-size satellites will pop off once Orion is hurtling toward the moon. The problem is these so-called CubeSats were installed in the rocket a year ago, and the batteries for half of them couldnt be recharged as the launch kept getting delayed. NASA expects some to fail, given the low-cost, high-risk nature of these mini satellites. The radiation-measuring CubeSats should be OK. Also in the clear: a solar sail demo targeting an asteroid. In a back-to-the-future salute, Orion will carry a few slivers of moon rocks collected by Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969, and a bolt from one of their rocket engines, salvaged from the sea a decade ago. Aldrin isnt attending the launch, according to NASA, but three of his former colleagues will be there: Apollo 7s Walter Cunningham, Apollo 10s Tom Stafford and Apollo 17s Harrison Schmitt, the next-to-last man to walk on the moon.  APOLLO VS. ARTEMIS More than 50 years later, Apollo still stands as NASAs greatest achievement. Using 1960s technology, NASA took just eight years to go from launching its first astronaut, Alan Shepard, and landing Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon. By contrast, Artemis already has dragged on for more than a decade, despite building on the short-lived moon exploration program Constellation. Twelve Apollo astronauts walked on the moon from 1969 through 1972, staying no longer than three days at a time. For Artemis, NASA will be drawing from a diverse astronaut pool currently numbering 42 and is extending the time crews will spend on the moon to at least a week. The goal is to create a long-term lunar presence that will grease the skids for sending people to Mars. NASAs Nelson, promises to announce the first Artemis moon crews once Orion is back on Earth. WHATS NEXT Theres a lot more to be done before astronauts step on the moon again. A second test flight will send four astronauts around the moon and back, perhaps as early as 2024. A year or so later, NASA aims to send another four up, with two of them touching down at the lunar south pole. Orion doesnt come with its own lunar lander like the Apollo spacecraft did, so NASA has hired Elon Musks SpaceX to provide its Starship spacecraft for the first Artemis moon landing. Two other private companies are developing moonwalking suits. The sci-fi-looking Starship would link up with Orion at the moon and take a pair of astronauts to the surface and back to the capsule for the ride home. So far, Starship has only soared six miles (10 kilometers). Musk wants to launch Starship around Earth on SpaceXs Super Heavy Booster before attempting a moon landing without a crew. One hitch: Starship will need a fill-up at an Earth-orbiting fuel depot, before heading to the moon. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Boeing astronaut flight off until next year for more fixes,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeings first spaceflight with astronauts has been delayed until next year because of repairs that need to be made to the capsule following its last test flight.  Liftoff of the Starliner capsule with a pair of NASA test pilots is now scheduled for February, officials announced Thursday. They had hoped to launch it by years end. Boeing has launched Starliner twice without a crew, most recently in May. The capsule managed to dock with the International Space Station on the second go-around, despite thruster and other problems. Boeing program manager Mark Nappi said these issues need to be fixed before two NASA astronauts climb aboard, as early as February. Some of the thruster trouble is believed to have been caused by debris. Because that part of the capsule was ditched before touchdown, we will never know exactly what was the issue, Nappi told reporters. Boeing already was trailing SpaceX, NASAs other contracted taxi service, by the time the Starliner made its debut in 2019. The capsules initial test flight with a mannequin was cut short by a string of software problems, prompting this years do-over. SpaceX is gearing up for its sixth crew flight for NASA. Liftoff has been bumped to the beginning of October because of all the traffic at the space station. NASAs space station program manager, Joel Montalbano, said Boeing will have priority in February. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA scrubs launch of new moon rocket after engine problem,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA called off the launch of its mighty new moon rocket on its debut flight with three test dummies aboard Monday after a last-minute cascade of problems culminating in unexplained trouble related to an engine. The next launch attempt will not take place until Friday at the earliest and could be delayed until mid-September or later. The mission will be the first flight in NASAs Artemis project, a quest to put astronauts back on the moon for the first time since the Apollo program ended 50 years ago. As precious minutes ticked away Monday morning, NASA repeatedly stopped and started the fueling of the Space Launch System rocket because of a leak of highly explosive hydrogen, eventually succeeding in reducing the seepage. The leak happened in the same place that saw seepage during a dress rehearsal in the spring.  The fueling already was running nearly an hour late because of thunderstorms off Floridas Kennedy Space Center. Then, NASA ran into new trouble when it was unable to properly chill one of the rockets four main engines, officials said. Engineers struggled to pinpoint the source of the problem well after the launch postponement was announced.  Mission manager Mike Sarafin said the fault did not appear to be with the engine itself but with the plumbing leading to it. Complicating matters, as engineers were trying to troubleshoot that problem on the launch pad, yet another hydrogen leak developed, this one involving a vent valve higher up on the rocket, Sarafin said. 
        
     This is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work, and you dont want to light the candle until its ready to go, said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. Referring to launch delays, he said: Its just part of the space business and its part of, particularly, a test flight. The rocket was set to lift off on a flight to propel a crew capsule into orbit around the moon. The six-week mission was scheduled to end with the capsule returning to Earth in a splashdown in the Pacific in October. The 322-foot (98-meter) spaceship is the most powerful rocket ever built by NASA, out-muscling even the Saturn V that took the Apollo astronauts to the moon. The dummies inside the Orion capsule were fitted with sensors to measure vibration, cosmic radiation and other conditions during the shakedown flight, meant to stress-test the spacecraft and push it to its limits in ways that would never be attempted if humans were aboard. Asked about the possibility of another launch attempt on Friday, Sarafin said, We really need time to look at all the information, all the data. Were going to play all nine innings here. Even though no one was on board, thousands of people jammed the coast to see the rocket soar. Vice President Kamala Harris and Apollo 10 astronaut Tom Stafford were among the VIPs who arrived. Assuming the shakedown flight goes well, astronauts will climb aboard for the second Artemis mission and fly around the moon and back as soon as 2024. A two-person lunar landing could follow by the end of 2025.  The problems seen Monday were reminiscent of NASAs space shuttle era, when hydrogen fuel leaks disrupted countdowns and delayed a string of launches back in 1990. Later in the morning, NASA also officials spotted what they feared was a crack or some other defect on the core stage  the big orange fuel tank with four main engines on it  but they later said it appeared to be just a buildup of frost in a crevice of the insulating foam. Launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson and her team also had to deal with sluggish communication between the Orion capsule and launch control. The problem required what turned out to be a simple fix. Even if there had been no technical snags, thunderstorms ultimately would have prevented a liftoff, NASA said. Dark clouds and rain gathered over the launch site as soon as the countdown was halted, and thunder echoed across the coast. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA moon rocket on track for launch despite lightning hits,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new moon rocket remained on track to blast off on a crucial test flight Monday, despite a series of lightning strikes at the launch pad.  The 322-foot (98-meter) Space Launch System rocket is the most powerful ever built by NASA. Its poised to send an empty crew capsule into lunar orbit, a half-century after NASAs Apollo program, which landed 12 astronauts on the moon.  Astronauts could return to the moon in a few years, if this six-week test flight goes well. NASA officials caution, however, that the risks are high and the flight could be cut short. In lieu of astronauts, three test dummies are strapped into the Orion capsule to measure vibration, acceleration and radiation, one of the biggest hazards to humans in deep space. The capsule alone has more than 1,000 sensors. Officials said Sunday that neither the rocket nor capsule suffered any damage during Saturdays thunderstorm; ground equipment also was unaffected. Five strikes were confirmed, hitting the 600-foot (183-meter) lightning-protection towers surrounding the rocket at NASAs Kennedy Space Center. The strikes werent strong enough to warrant major retesting. Clearly, the system worked as designed, said Jeff Spaulding, NASAs senior test director. More storms were expected. Although forecasters gave 80% odds of acceptable weather Monday morning, conditions were expected to deteriorate during the two-hour launch window. 
        
     On the technical side, Spaulding said the team did its best over the past several months to eliminate any lingering fuel leaks. A pair of countdown tests earlier this year prompted repairs to leaking valves and other faulty equipment; engineers wont know if all the fixes are good until just a few hours before the planned liftoff. If Monday doesnt pan out, the next launch attempt would be Friday. After so many years of delays and setbacks, the launch team was thrilled to finally be so close to the inaugural flight of the Artemis moon-exploration program, named after Apollos twin sister in Greek mythology.  Were within 24 hours of launch right now, which is pretty amazing for where weve been on this journey, Spaulding told reporters. The follow-on Artemis flight, as early as 2024, would see four astronauts flying around the moon. A landing could follow in 2025. NASA is targeting the moons unexplored south pole, where permanently shadowed craters are believed to hold ice that could be used by future crews.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX launches 3 visitors to space station for $55M each,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched three rich businessmen and their astronaut escort to the International Space Station on Friday for more than a weeks stay, as NASA joins Russia in hosting guests at the worlds most expensive tourist destination. Its SpaceXs first private charter flight to the orbiting lab after two years of carrying astronauts there for NASA. Arriving at the space station Saturday are an American, a Canadian and an Israeli who run investment, real estate and other companies. Theyre paying $55 million apiece for the rocket ride and accommodations, all meals included. Russia has been hosting tourists at the space station  and before that the Mir station  for decades. Just last fall, a Russian movie crew flew up, followed by a Japanese fashion tycoon and his assistant. NASA is finally getting into the act, after years of opposing space station visitors. It was a hell of a ride and were looking forward to the next 10 days, said former NASA astronaut and chaperone Michael Lopez-Alegria on reaching orbit. The visitors tickets include access to all but the Russian portion of the space station  theyll need permission from the three cosmonauts on board. Three Americans and a German also live up there. Lopez-Alegria plans to avoid talking about politics and the war in Ukraine while hes at the space station. I honestly think that it wont be awkward. I mean maybe a tiny bit, he said. He expects the spirit of collaboration will shine through. 
        
     The private Axiom Space company arranged the visit with NASA for its three paying customers: Larry Connor of Dayton, Ohio, who runs the Connor Group; Mark Pathy, founder and CEO of Montreals Mavrik Corp.; and Israels Eytan Stibbe, a former fighter pilot and founding partner of Vital Capital. Before the flight, their enthusiasm was obvious. Stibbe did a little dance when he arrived at the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. SpaceX and NASA have been upfront with them about the risks of spaceflight, said Lopez-Alegria, who spent seven months at the space station 15 years ago.  Theres no fuzz, I think, on what the dangers are or what the bad days could look like, Lopez-Alegria told The Associated Press before the flight. NASAs Kathy Lueders, head of space operations, said theres a lot to learn from this first wholly private station visit. But man, was this launch a great start, she told reporters. Each visitor has a full slate of experiments to conduct during their stay, one reason they dont like to be called space tourists. Theyre not up there to paste their nose on the window, said Axioms co-founder and president, Michael Suffredini, a former NASA space station program manager. The three businessmen are the latest to take advantage of the opening of space to those with deep pockets. Jeff Bezos rocket company Blue Origin is taking customers on 10-minute rides to the edge of space, while Virgin Galactic expects to start flying customers on its rocket ship later this year. Fridays flight is the second private charter for Elon Musks SpaceX, which took a billionaire and his guests  on a three-day orbit ride last year. SpaceXs fifth flight of NASA astronauts to the station is coming up in just a couple weeks. Axiom is targeting next year for its second private flight to the space station. More customer trips will follow, with Axiom adding its own rooms to the orbiting complex beginning in 2024. After about five years, the company plans to detach its compartments to form a self-sustaining station  one of several commercial outposts intended to replace the space station once its retired and NASA shifts to the moon. At an adjacent pad during Fridays launch: NASAs new moon rocket, which is awaiting completion of a dress rehearsal for a summertime test flight. As a gift for their seven station hosts, the four visitors are taking up paella and other Spanish cuisine prepared by celebrity chef Jos Andrs. The rest of their time at the station, NASAs freeze-dried chow will have to do. The automated SpaceX capsule and its four passengers are due back April 19 with a splashdown off the Florida coast. Connor is honoring Ohios air and space legacy, is bringing along a fabric swatch from the Wright brothers 1903 Kitty Hawk flyer and gold foil from the Apollo 11 command module from the Neil Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta. Only the second Israeli in space, Stibbe will continue a thunderstorm experiment begun by the first  Ilan Ramon, who died aboard shuttle Columbia in 2003. They were in the same fighter pilot squadron. Stibbe is carrying copies of recovered pages of Ramons space diary, as well as a song composed by Ramons musician son and a painting of pages falling from the sky by his daughter. To be a part of this unique crew is a proof for me that theres no dream beyond reach, he said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Fuel leak thwarts NASAs dress rehearsal for moon rocket,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs latest attempt to fuel its huge moon rocket for a countdown test was thwarted Thursday by a hazardous hydrogen leak, the latest in a series of vexing equipment trouble. The launch team had just begun loading fuel into the core stage of the rocket when the leak cropped up. This was NASAs third shot at a dress rehearsal, a required step ahead of a test flight to the moon. This time, the launch team managed to load some super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen into the core stage of the 30-story Space Launch System rocket, but fell far short of the full amount. Liquid hydrogen is extremely hazardous, with officials noting that the systems had been checked for leaks prior to the test. Technicians deliberately left the smaller upper stage empty, after discovering a bad valve last week. The helium valve inside the upper stage cannot be replaced until the rocket is back in its hangar at Kennedy Space Center. Two previous countdown attempts were marred by balky fans and a large hand-operated valve that workers mistakenly left closed at the pad last week.  Officials said via Twitter that theyre assessing their next steps. NASA had been targeting June for the launch debut of the 322-foot (98-meter) SLS rocket. The empty Orion capsule on top will be sent on a four- to six-week mission around the moon and back. Astronauts will strap in for the second test flight around the moon, planned for 2024. That would be followed as early as 2025 with the first lunar landing by astronauts since 1972.

NASA moon rocket faces more flight delays as repairs mount,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The flight debut of NASAs mega moon rocket faces additional delays following a string of failed fueling tests. Officials said Monday it will be challenging to meet a launch window in early to mid-June. The next opportunity to send an empty capsule to the moon on a test flight would be at the end of June or July.  The 30-story Space Launch System rocket has been on the pad at Kennedy Space Center for the past month. It will return to the hangar next week for valve and fuel leak repairs. The problems cropped up earlier this month, preventing NASA from filling the rockets fuel tanks for a critical dress rehearsal. The rocket will likely spend weeks in the hangar before heading back to the pad for a testing redo, said launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson.  Managers are considering various options for getting back on track. Its just a matter of whats the right time, whats the right way to do that, said Tom Whitmeyer, a NASA deputy associate administrator.  NASA wants this test flight under its belt before putting astronauts on board for the second launch, a lunar flyaround targeted for 2024.

Program helps Congo families protect endangered gorillas,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Decades of conservation efforts have stabilized the population of endangered mountain gorillas in eastern Africa. But the number of Grauers gorillas  a less furry, lower elevation-dwelling animal  has declined, largely due to habitat loss and hunting.  On Friday, the nonprofit Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund announced that more land in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where Grauers gorillas live will fall under a community-protection initiative.  The critically endangered species has lost an estimated 60% of its population in the past two decades, and an estimated 3,800 to 6,800 individuals remain.  Most Grauers gorillas now live outside national parks, and protecting them will be difficult in a region facing sustained human conflicts. Their rainforest homes are being cleared for agriculture and mining, and the gorillas are sometimes hunted for food or trapped by snares intended to catch other animals.  A 2016 law allows communities in Congo to apply for rights to manage their traditional lands. The Fossey Fund has helped communities in eastern Congo complete that paperwork and entered into agreements with families to provide assistance and training for the sustainable management of their lands.  On Friday, it announced that 307 square miles (796 square kilometers) had been added to the program. The addition means 919 square miles (2,379 square kilometers) are now being watched over by about 20 families. 
        
     The community can decide what activities should be allowed on their lands, and to try to enforce those choices. The Fossey Fund provides education and funding.  Community members are trained and then hired to conduct the science needed to monitor the biodiversity of the forest  biological inventories, gorilla tracking, plant biomass for estimating carbon capture, said Urbain Ngobobo, director of the nonprofits Congo programs. This model differs from the approach used to protect the mountain gorillas. They live almost exclusively within the boundaries of national parks in Rwanda, Uganda and Congo, allowing researchers to cooperate with park managers to protect the species.  Most Grauers gorillas dont live inside national parks  and its not feasible to expand the parks to fully cover their habitats. Grauers gorillas exist exclusively in a country that has suffered really extreme degrees of instability for decades, said Richard Bergl, a primatologist and director of conservation at the North Carolina Zoo.  When there is violence happening, its very challenging to maintain the infrastructure of a national park, he said. But the communities will be there regardless of political instability. If you have their support, you have a chance. Community interests vary, but in general there is an incentive to protect their lands from being pillaged by outsiders, whether theyre illegal mining operators or commercial hunters, said Dirck Byler, vice chair of the great apes specialist group for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the scientific body that designates species as endangered.  Most of these communities want to maintain their forests as theyve been in the past, used for subsistence hunting and plant harvesting, said Byler, who has worked extensively in Congo. Community-based conservation schemes have been effective in slowing or reversing the decline of endangered species in other regions, such as the Nigerian mountains where cross river gorillas live and the savannah of northwestern Namibia where endangered rhinos live, Bergl said.  The wildlife there would be gone if it werent for community involvement and management, he said. If were going to be successful, its going to be because of efforts to support the communities to manage their forests. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Rich trio back on Earth after charter trip to space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Three rich businessmen returned from the International Space Station with their astronaut escort Monday, wrapping up a pricey trip  that marked NASAs debut as a B&B host. Flying back in a SpaceX capsule, they splashed down in the Atlantic off the Florida coast to close out a 17-day tour that cost them $55 million apiece. The trip was supposed to last a little over a week, but dicey weather kept the visitors in orbit almost twice as long as intended. Welcome back to planet Earth, radioed SpaceX Mission Control from Southern California. We hope you enjoyed the extra few days in space. Amazing mission, said real estate tycoon Larry Connor.  Before departing the space station Sunday night, the group thanked their seven hosts, including three NASA astronauts whose own mission is nearing an end.  It was the first time NASA opened its space hatches to tourists after shunning the practice perfected over the decades by Russia. Last fall, a Russian film crew flew up, followed by a Japanese fashion mogul and his assistant. In each case, an active-duty cosmonaut traveled with them.  The latest guests were accompanied by a former NASA astronaut now working for Axiom Space, the Houston company in charge of the flight, making it the first fully private trip to the space station. After hosting longer than expected, NASA was itching to make room for the next crew. SpaceX will attempt to launch three NASA astronauts and one Italian to the space station as soon as Wednesday. Theyll replace the three Americans and a German up there since November who will head back to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule. 
        
     The pace is blazingly fast by NASA standards. SpaceXs Benji Reed said the company launched its first passengers  a pair of NASA test pilots  two years ago and just completed its first private flight to the space station using the same capsule. Axiom handled the logistics for the trip for its three paying customers: Connor from Dayton, Ohio; Canadian private equity CEO Mark Pathy; and Israeli investor Eytan Stibbe of Tel Aviv. Their chaperone was Michael Lopez-Alegria, an Axiom vice president who flew to space four times while a NASA astronaut. It was an amazing adventure that weve had, even longer and more exciting than we thought, Lopez-Alegria said after departing the space station.  Axiom teamed up with SpaceX for the journey that began with an April 8 liftoff from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. It was SpaceXs second private flight, coming just months after a billionaires orbital jaunt with contest winners. While in space, the visitors did experiments and peered back at Earth.  Its been eye-opening in so many ways, Pathy said, that I think will have such a lasting impact on my life. The experience was especially personal for Stibbe. He served as a fighter pilot under Ilan Ramon, Israels first astronaut who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003. Stibbe flew copies of the surviving pages of Ramons space diary, as well as artwork and music created by Ramons children. He celebrated Passover with matzah bread he took up and gefilte fish offered by the stations Russians.  Axioms second flight is set for next spring as the company looks ahead to having its own space station by 2030.  There were a lot of eyes on this mission just to see if it was practical, Derek Hassmann, Axioms operations director, said after the splashdown. Everybody understood it was possible, but wondered if amateurs could pull this off with abbreviated training, without disturbing the space station crew.  I think we proved we could do that, Hassmann said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

One-fifth of reptiles worldwide face risk of extinction,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Even the king cobra is vulnerable. More than 1 in 5 species of reptiles worldwide are threatened with extinction, according to a comprehensive new assessment of thousands of species published Wednesday in the journal Nature. Of 10,196 reptile species analyzed, 21% percent were classified as endangered, critically endangered or vulnerable to extinction  including the iconic hooded snakes of South and Southeast Asia.  This work is a very significant achievement  it adds to our knowledge of where threatened species are, and where we must work to protect them, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the study. Similar prior assessments had been conducted for mammals, birds and amphibians, informing government decisions about how to draw boundaries of national parks and allocate environmental funds.  Work on the reptile study  which involved nearly 1,000 scientists and 52 co-authors  started in 2005. The project was slowed by challenges in fundraising, said co-author Bruce Young, a zoologist at the nonprofit science organization NatureServe.  Theres a lot more focus on furrier, feathery species of vertebrates for conservation, Young said, lamenting the perceived charisma gap. But reptiles are also fascinating and essential to ecosystems, he said.  The Galapagos marine iguana, the worlds only lizard adapted to marine life, is classified as vulnerable to extinction, said co-author Blair Hedges, a biologist at Temple University. It took 5 million years for the lizard to adapt to foraging in the sea, he said, lamenting how much evolutionary history can be lost if this single species goes extinct.  
        
     Six of the worlds species of sea turtles are threatened. The seventh is likely also in trouble, but scientists lack data to make a classification.  Worldwide, the greatest threat to reptile life is habitat destruction. Hunting, invasive species and climate change also pose threats, said co-author Neil Cox, a manager at the International Union for the Conservation of Natures biodiversity assessment unit.  Reptiles that live in forest areas, such as the king cobra, are more likely to be threatened with extinction than desert-dwellers, in part because forests face greater human disruptions, the study found. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX launches 4 astronauts for NASA after private flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched four astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA on Wednesday, less than two days after completing a flight chartered by millionaires. Its the first NASA crew comprised equally of men and women, including the first Black woman making a long-term spaceflight, Jessica Watkins. This is one of the most diversified, I think, crews that weve had in a really, really long time, said NASAs space operations mission chief Kathy Lueders. The astronauts arrived at the space station Wednesday night, just 16 hours after a predawn liftoff from Kennedy Space Center that thrilled spectators. Anyone who saw it realized what a beautiful launch it was, Lueders told reporters. After an express flight comparable to traveling from New York to Singapore, the crew will move in for a five-month stay. SpaceX has now launched five crews for NASA and two private trips in just under two years. Elon Musks company is having an especially busy few weeks: It just finished taking three businessmen to and from the space station as NASAs first private guests. A week after the new crew arrives, the three Americans and German theyre replacing will return to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule. Three Russians also live at the space station. Both SpaceX and NASA officials stressed theyre taking it one step at a time to ensure safety. The private mission that concluded Monday encountered no major problems, they said, although high wind delayed the splashdown for a week. 
        
     SpaceX Launch Control wished the astronauts good luck and Godspeed moments before the Falcon rocket blasted off with the capsule, named Freedom by its crew. Our heartfelt thank you to every one of you that made this possible. Now let Falcon roar and Freedom ring, radioed NASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren, the commander. Minutes later, their recycled booster had landed on an ocean platform and their capsule was safely orbiting Earth. It was a great ride, he said. The SpaceX capsules are fully automated  which opens the space gates to a broader clientele  and theyre designed to accommodate a wider range of body sizes. At the same time, NASA and the European Space Agency have been pushing for more female astronauts. While two Black women visited the space station during the shuttle era, neither moved in for a lengthy stay. Watkins, a geologist who is on NASAs short list for a moon-landing mission in the years ahead, sees her mission as an important milestone, I think, both for the agency and for the country. She credits supportive family and mentors  including Mae Jemison, the first Black woman in space in 1992  for ultimately being able to live my dream. Also cheering Watkins on was another geologist: Apollo 17s Harrison Schmitt, who walked on the moon in 1972. She invited the retired astronaut to the launch, along with his wife. We sort of consider ourselves the Jessica team, he said, chuckling. Those of us who rode the Saturn V into space are a little bit jaded about the smaller rockets, Schmitt said after the SpaceX liftoff. But still, it really was something and on board was a geologist ... I hope it will stand her in good stead for being part of one of the Artemis crews that go to the moon. Like Watkins, NASA astronaut and test pilot Bob Hines is making his first spaceflight. Its the second visit for Lindgren, a physician, and the European Space Agencys lone female astronaut, Samantha Cristoforetti, a former Italian Air Force fighter pilot. Cristoforetti turned 45 on Tuesday, so she really celebrates and is very happy with a big smile in the capsule, said the European Space Agencys director general, Josef Aschbacher. Shes really a role model and shes doing an enormously fabulous job on doing exactly that. The just-completed private flight was NASAs first dip into space tourism after years of opposition. The space agency said the three people who paid $55 million each to visit the space station blended in while doing experiments and educational outreach. They were accompanied by a former NASA astronaut employed by Houston-based Axiom Space, which arranged the flight. The International Space Station is not a vacation spot. Its not an amusement park. It is an international laboratory, and they absolutely understood and respected that purpose, said NASA flight director Zeb Scoville. NASA also hired Boeing to ferry astronauts after retiring the shuttles. The company will take another shot next month at getting an empty crew capsule to the space station, after software and other problems fouled a 2019 test flight and prevented a redo last summer. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Your dogs personality may have little to do with its breed,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Research confirms what dog lovers know  every pup is truly an individual. Many of the popular stereotypes about the behavior of golden retrievers, poodles or schnauzers, for example, arent supported by science, according to a new study. There is a huge amount of behavioral variation in every breed, and at the end of the day, every dog really is an individual, said study co-author and University of Massachusetts geneticist Elinor Karlsson. She said pet owners love to talk about their dogs personality, as illustrated by some owners at a New York dog park. Elizabeth Kelly said her English springer spaniel was friendly, but shes also kind of the queen bee. Suly Ortiz described her yellow Lab as really calm, lazy and shy. And Rachel Kims mixed-breed dog is a lot of different dogs, personality wise  super independent, really affectionate with me and my husband, but pretty, pretty suspicious of other people, other dogs. That kind of enthusiasm from pet owners inspired Karlssons latest scientific inquiry. She wanted to know to what extent are behavioral patterns inherited  and how much are dog breeds associated with distinctive and predictable behaviors? The answer: While physical traits such as a greyhounds long legs or a Dalmatians spots are clearly inherited, breed is not a strong predictor of any individual dogs personality.  
        
     The researchers work, published Thursday in the journal Science, marshals a massive dataset to reach these conclusions  the most ever compiled, said Adam Boyko, a geneticist at Cornell University, who was not involved in the study. Dogs became humanitys best friend more than 14,000 years ago, as the only animal domesticated before the advent of agriculture.  But the concept of dog breeds is much more recent. Around 160 years ago, people began to selectively breed dogs to have certain consistent physical traits, like coat texture and color and ear shape. The researchers surveyed more than 18,000 dog owners and analyzed the genomes of about 2,150 of their dogs to look for patterns. They found that some behaviors  such as howling, pointing and showing friendliness to human strangers do have at least some genetic basis. But that inheritance isnt strictly passed down along breed lines. For example, they found golden retrievers that dont retrieve, said co-author Kathryn Lord, who studies animal behavior with Karlsson. Some breeds, such as huskies and beagles, may show a greater tendency to howl. But many of these dogs dont, as both the owner survey and genetic data showed. The researchers could find no genetic basis for aggressive behaviors nor a link to specific breeds.  The correlation between dog behavior and dog breed is much lower than most expected, said Jeff Kidd, a geneticist at the University of Michigan, who had no role in the research. ___ AP reporter Emma H.

Nearly 1 million COVID-19 deaths: A look at the US numbers,"Doug Lambrecht was among the first of the nearly 1 million Americans to die from COVID-19. His demographic profile  an older white male with chronic health problems  mirrors the faces of many who would be lost over the next two years. The 71-year-old retired physician was recovering from a fall at a nursing home near Seattle when the new coronavirus swept through in early 2020. He died March 1, an early victim in a devastating outbreak that gave a first glimpse of the price older Americans would pay. The pandemic has generated gigabytes of data that make clear which U.S. groups have been hit the hardest. More than 700,000 people 65 and older died. Men died at higher rates than women. White people made up most of the deaths overall, yet an unequal burden fell on Black, Hispanic and Native American people considering the younger average age of minority communities. Racial gaps narrowed between surges then widened again with each new wave. With 1 million deaths in sight, Dougs son Nathan Lambrecht reflected on the toll. Im afraid that as the numbers get bigger, people are going to care less and less, he said. I just hope people who didnt know them and didnt have the same sort of loss in their lives due to COVID, I just hope that they dont forget and they remember to care.   
        
     ELDERS HIT HARD Three out of every four deaths were people 65 and older, according to U.S. data analyzed by The Associated Press. 
        
     About 255,000 people 85 and older died; 257,000 were 75 to 84 years old; and about 229,000 were 65 to 74. A million things went wrong and most of them were preventable, said elder care expert Charlene Harrington of the University of California, San Francisco. Harrington, 80, hopes the lessons of the pandemic lead U.S. health officials to adopt minimum staffing requirements for nursing homes, then maybe I can retire.   
        
     SPOUSES LEFT BEHIND In nearly every 10-year age group, more men have died from COVID-19 than women. Men have shorter life expectancies than women, so its not surprising that the only age group where deaths in women outpaced those in men is the oldest: 85 and older. For some families who lost breadwinners, economic hardships have added to their grief, said Rima Samman, who coordinates a COVID-19 memorial project that began as a tribute to her brother, Rami, who died in May 2020 at age 40. A widow is losing her home, or shes losing the car she drove the kids to school with, because her husband died, Samman said. Little by little, youre getting pulled down from middle class to lower class.   
        
     RACE, ETHNICITY AND AGE White people made up 65% of the total deaths, the largest proportion of any race by far. This isnt that surprising because there are more white people in the U.S. than any other race. American Indians, Pacific Islanders and Black people had higher death rates when looking at COVID-19 deaths per capita.    
        
     Death rates per capita still leave out a characteristic that is crucial to understanding which groups were disproportionately affected  COVID-19 is more deadly for the elderly. In the U.S. there are many more elderly white people than elderly people of other races. To evaluate which race has been disproportionately affected, its necessary to adjust the per-capita death rate, calculating the rates as if each race had the same age breakdown.   
        
     After the share of COVID-19 deaths are age-adjusted in this way, we can compare that with the races share of the total population. If the age-adjusted share of COVID-19 deaths is higher than the share of the U.S. population, that race has been disproportionately affected. When considering age, its apparent that Black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander and Native American people suffered disproportionately more from COVID-19 deaths than other groups in the U.S.   
        
     Looking at deaths per capita, Mississippi had the highest rate of any state. Weve lost so many people to COVID, said Joyee Washington, a community health educator in Hattiesburg. The hard thing in Mississippi was having to grieve with no time to heal. Youre facing trauma after trauma after trauma. ... Normal is gone as far as Im concerned. Communities pulled together. Churches set up testing sites, school buses took meals to students when classrooms were closed, her citys mayor used social media to provide reliable information. Even in the midst of turmoil you can still find joy, you can still find light, she said. The possibilities are there if you look for them.   
        
     Native Americans experienced higher death rates than all other groups during two waves of the pandemic. For Mary Francis, a 41-year-old Navajo woman from Page, Arizona, the deaths reinforce a long-held value of self-sufficiency. It goes back to the teachings of our elders, said Francis, who helps get vaccines and care packages to Navajo and Hopi families. Try to be self-sufficient, how to take care of ourselves and how to not rely so much on the government (and) other sources that may or may not have our interests at heart.   
        
     RURAL VS URBAN The surge that began in late 2020 was particularly rough for rural America. Americans living in rural areas have been less likely to get vaccinated than city dwellers, more likely to be infected and more likely to die. Ive had multiple people in my ambulance, in their 80s and dying, said paramedic Mark Kennedy in Nauvoo, Illinois. Some did die, and when you ask if theyve been vaccinated, they say, I dont trust it.  Surges swamped the thin resources of rural hospitals. During the delta surge, Kennedy transferred patients to hospitals in Springfield, which is 130 miles away, and Chicago, 270 miles away. Every day you had multiple transfers three and four hours away in full protective gear, Kennedy said. The recent omicron wave felt even harder to David Schreiner, CEO of Katherine Shaw Bethea Hospital in Dixon, Illinois. In the first wave, there were signs throughout the community about our health care heroes. ... People loved us the first time around, Schreiner said. But by this past winter, people had COVID-19 fatigue. Our people have been through so much. And then we would get a patient or a family member who would come to the hospital and refuse to put a mask on, Schreiner said.

"SpaceX brings 4 astronauts home, then launches 53 satellites","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX brought four astronauts home with a midnight splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, capping the busiest stretch yet for Elon Musks taxi service. The three U.S. astronauts and one German in the capsule were bobbing off the Florida coast, near Tampa, less than 24 hours after leaving the International Space Station. NASA expected to have them back in Houston later in the morning. That was a great ride, said Raja Chari, the capsule commander. As for the reintroduction to gravity, he noted: Only one complaint. These water bottles are super heavy. NASAs Chari, Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron, and the European Space Agencys Matthias Maurer, were out of the capsule within an hour of splashdown, waving and giving thumbs-up as they were hustled away on rolling chaises for medical checks. Their departure from the space station Thursday was bittersweet, as they embraced the seven astronauts remaining there. Its the end of a six-month mission, but I think the space dream lives on, Maurer said. SpaceX brought up their U.S. and Italian replacements last week, after completing a charter trip to the station for a trio of businessmen earlier in April. That amounts to two crew launches and two splashdowns in barely a month. Musks company has now launched 26 people into orbit in less than two years, since it started ferrying astronauts for NASA. Eight of those 26 were space tourists. 
        
     SpaceXs William Gerstenmaier, a vice president, acknowledges its a pretty exciting time.  Barely five hours after splashdown, the company founded by Musk in 2002 launched a fresh batch of its own internet satellites known as Starlinks from Cape Canaveral. There were 53 of the mini flat-panel satellites in this predawn load. Satellites are nice, but flying people are a little special and a little bit different, and the team here sure understands that, he told reporters. Theres a sense of relief and and a sense of accomplishment that you know youve done something good. NASA is more impressed than ever, given SpaceXs unprecedented pace. The only problem of note in the latest flight was a mechanical nut that wiggled loose and floated away from the SpaceX capsule following Thursdays undocking. Officials assured everyone it would not pose a danger to the space station. Look at all this work in the last month, said Kathy Lueders, NASAs space operations mission chief. I really want to personally thank SpaceX for just, wow, just performing such seamless operations on all those missions.  The astronauts said their mission was highlighted by the three visitors and their ex-astronaut escort who dropped by in April, opening up NASAs side of the station to paying guests after decades of resistance. On the down side, they had to contend with a dangerous spike in space junk after Russia blew up a satellite in a missile test in mid-November. More than 1,500 pieces of shrapnel spread across Earths orbit for years to come. While the war in Ukraine has caused tensions between the U.S. and Russia, the astronauts have stood by their Russian crewmates, and vice versa. Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow also continued to cooperate as always, according to NASA officials. As he relinquished command of the space station earlier this week, Marshburn called it a place of peace and said international cooperation would likely be its lasting legacy. Russian Oleg Artemyev, the new commander, also emphasized the peace between our countries, our friendship in orbit and described his crewmates as brothers and sisters. Up there now are three Russians, three Americans and one Italian. It was Marshburns third spaceflight, and the first for the three returning with him. Chari and Barrons next stop could be the moon; they are among 18 U.S. astronauts picked for NASAs Artemis moon-landing program. Two others in that elite group are now at the space station. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Space telescope in home stretch of tests; early pics impress,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new space telescope is in the home stretch of testing, with science observations expected to begin in July, astronomers said Monday. The James Webb Space Telescope beamed back the latest test pictures of a neighboring satellite galaxy, and the results are stunning when compared with images taken by NASAs previous infrared observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope.  Each of the 18 mirror segments on the new telescope is bigger than the single one on Spitzer.  Its not until you actually see the kind of image that it delivers that you really internalize and go wow! said University of Arizonas Marcia Rieke, chief scientist for Webbs near-infrared camera. Just think of what were going to learn. Launched last December, the $10 billion Webb is the largest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever sent into space. It will seek light emitted by the first stars and galaxies close to 14 billion years ago, and keep a sharp lookout for possible signs of life. Scientists are keeping the identity of Webbs first official target a secret.  Positioned 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth, Webb is considered the successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Ukrainian scientists see working amid war as act of defiance,"Anton Vlaschenko often hears shelling outside his office in Ukraines second-largest city of Kharkiv, not far from the front lines of the war. He sometimes even sees smoke rising from Russian tanks hit by missiles. But the 40-year-old zoologist continues his work, dissecting and labeling bat tissue, as he probes the disease ecology of the flying mammals. When news of the war overwhelms him, he says, it helps to have something familiar to do with his hands. He also sees it as an act of defiance. Our staying in Ukraine, our continuing to work  its some kind of resistance of Russian invasion, Vlaschenko said via Zoom, a barrage of shelling audible in the background. The people together in Ukraine are ready to fight, not only with guns. We dont want to lose our country. His resolve isnt unique. Like other Ukrainians whose labors arent essential to the war effort, the scientists and academics want to continue their important work where they can. A common refrain is that they want to stay connected to their scholarly community, which provides a shard of normalcy amid the chaos and violence, and keep the light of Ukrainian science and humanities alive, said Yevheniia Polishchuk, who teaches at Kyiv National Economic University. As vice chair of the Young Scientists Council at Ukraines Ministry of Education and Science, Polishchuk organized an online survey of academics to assess their situation and needs after the Feb. 24 invasion. An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 scholars had left Ukraine by early April  mostly women with families  but about 100,000 stayed.  
        
     Most who went abroad wound up in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, getting temporary positions at European institutions. Some scientists have received grants from the Polish Academy of Sciences, U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and other organizations. Polishchuk, now in Krakow with her children and husband, is a visiting professor at a university for May and June but says she hopes to return to Kyiv when fighting stops. We dont want the war to result in a brain drain from Ukraine, she said.  While Ukrainian scholars are appealing to international scientific bodies for assistance  including remote work opportunities and access to journals, datasets, archives and other materials  there is also a will to prevent the war from permanently sapping talent and momentum from the countrys academic and professional ranks, which will be needed to rebuild after fighting stops.  Most of our scholars do not want to move abroad permanently; they want to stay in Ukraine, Polishchuk said.  Shortly after the war began, Ivan Slyusarev, a 34-year-old astronomer, helped the director of Kharkiv National Universitys observatory move computers, monitors and other materials into the basement, which had sheltered equipment and historical artifacts when Nazi forces occupied the city during World War II. The observatorys main telescope is located in a field in Russia-occupied territory, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Kharkiv on the road to Donetsk. Slyusarev said he doesnt know its condition, but thinks Ukrainian forces blew up a nearby bridge to stop the Russian advance. He is relying on scientists outside Ukraine to continue his work. Astronomers in the Czech Republic have sent him observational data from their telescope so he can keep analyzing the properties of metallic asteroids. He also can see data from a small robotic telescope in Spains Canary Islands. He operates mostly from a home office on the outskirts of Kharkiv.  Slyusarev, who says he became an astronomer because of romantic ideas about the stars, finds refuge in scientific discovery. Astronomy produces only positive news and is a welcome respite from daily life, he said. Its very important in wartime, he added. After the war started, theoretical physicist and astronomer Oleksiy Golubov left Kharkiv to join his parents in Batkiv, a village in western Ukraine.  Although the buildings of the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology were bombed and shelled and virtually destroyed, Golubov said, the school continues to offer some remote classes. He has been keeping in touch with students online  in Kharkiv, in western Ukraine and in Poland and Germany. The 36-year-old scientist is also a coordinator and trainer for the Ukrainian students preparing to compete in the International Physicists Tournament, a competition for tackling unsolved physics problems that is being held in Colombia this month. The students, who had been training online, met this week in Lviv for the first time  following train journeys delayed by the war. We still want to take part and prove that even inconveniences like war cant stop us from doing good science and having a good education, he said. Golubov, who was turned down from joining the military because of a paralyzed hand, submitted a paper in March to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics and wrote in the acknowledgements, We are grateful to Ukrainians who are fighting to stop the war so that we can safely finish the revision of this article. Some scholars, like Ivan Patrilyak, dean of the history department at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, have enlisted. Eighteen months ago, he was hosting a speaker series on the legacy of World War II and lecturing about the Holocaust. Now, hes with a territorial defense unit in Kyiv.  Igor Lyman, a historian at the State Pedagogical University in Berdyansk, had to flee when Russian forces occupied the port city early in the war. Before leaving, he had seen the troops break into dormitories to interrogate students and order administrators to teach in Russian, rather than Ukrainian, and use a Moscow-approved curriculum. He said the directors refused and resigned. He later settled in a camp for internally displaced persons at Chernivtsi National University, living in a dormitory with academics from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kherson and other cities. Each of these families has its own terrible story of war, he wrote in an email. And everyone, like me, dreams of our victory and coming back home. He said the Russian forces are doing everything they can to impose their propaganda. Vlaschenko, the Kharkiv zoologist, wanted to protect 20 bats in his care from the shelling, so he carried them to his home, a walk of about an hour. It also helped to preserve his valuable research, which couldnt be easily replaced, even if buildings and labs can be rebuilt after the war. All the people who decided to stay in Kharkiv agreed to play this dangerous and potentially deadly lottery, he said, because you never know in what areas a new rocket or new shell would hit. As he scrambles to record data and safeguard his rare samples, he sees it as part of his mission  not only for us, but also for science in general. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina  and APs coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Moon goes blood red this weekend: Eclipse for the Americas,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A total lunar eclipse will grace the night skies this weekend, providing longer than usual thrills for stargazers across North and South America. The celestial action unfolds Sunday night into early Monday morning, with the moon bathed in the reflected red and orange hues of Earths sunsets and sunrises for about 1 1/2 hours, one of the longest totalities of the decade. It will be the first so-called blood moon in a year. Observers in the eastern half of North America and all of Central and South America will have prime seats for the whole show, weather permitting. Partial stages of the eclipse will be visible across Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Left out: Alaska, Asia and Australia. This is really an eclipse for the Americas, said NASAs Noah Petro, a planetary geologist who specializes in the moon. Its going to be a treat.  All you need, he noted, are patience and eyeballs.  A total eclipse occurs when Earth passes directly between the moon and the sun, and casts a shadow on our constant, cosmic companion. The moon will be 225,000 miles (362,000 kilometers) away at the peak of the eclipse  around midnight on the U.S. East Coast. This is this gradual, slow, wonderful event that as long as its clear where you are, you get to see it, Petro said. If not, NASA will provide a livestream of the eclipse from various locations; so will the Slooh network of observatories. 
        
     Therell be another lengthy total lunar eclipse in November, with Africa and Europe lucking out again, but not the Americas. Then the next one isnt until 2025. Launched last fall, NASAs asteroid-seeking Lucy spacecraft will photograph this weekends event from 64 million miles (103 million kilometers) away, as ground controllers continue their effort to fix a loose solar panel.  NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins, a geologist, plans to set her alarm clock early aboard the International Space Station. Hopefully, we can be up in time and be at the right place at the right time to catch a good glimpse, she told The Associated Press earlier this week. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Scientists grow plants in lunar dirt, next stop moon","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  For the first time, scientists have grown plants in soil from the moon collected by NASAs Apollo astronauts. Researchers had no idea if anything would sprout in the harsh moon dirt and wanted to see if it could be used to grow food by the next generation of lunar explorers. The results stunned them. Holy cow. Plants actually grow in lunar stuff. Are you kidding me? said Robert Ferl of the University of Floridas Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.  Ferl and his colleagues planted thale cress in moon soil returned by Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and other moonwalkers. The good news: All of the seeds sprouted.  The downside was that after the first week, the coarseness and other properties of the lunar soil stressed the small, flowering weeds so much that they grew more slowly than seedlings planted in fake moon dirt from Earth. Most of the moon plants ended up stunted. Results were published Thursday in Communications Biology. The longer the soil was exposed to punishing cosmic radiation and solar wind on the moon, the worse the plants seemed to do. The Apollo 11 samples  exposed a couple billion years longer to the elements because of the Sea of Tranquilitys older surface  were the least conducive for growth, according to scientists.  This is a big step forward to know that you can grow plants, said Simon Gilroy, a space plant biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who had no role in the study. The real next step is to go and do it on the surface of the moon. 
        
     Moon dirt is full of tiny, glass fragments from micrometeorite impacts that got everywhere in the Apollo lunar landers and wore down the moonwalkers spacesuits.  One solution might be to use younger geologic spots on the moon, like lava flows, for digging up planting soil. The environment also could be tweaked, altering the nutrient mixture or adjusting the artificial lighting,  Only 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of moon rocks and soil were brought back by six Apollo crews. Some of the earliest moon dust was sprinkled on plants under quarantine with the Apollo astronauts in Houston after returning from the moon.  Most of the lunar stash remained locked away, forcing researchers to experiment with simulated soil made of volcanic ash on Earth. NASA finally doled out 12 grams to the University of Florida researchers early last year, and the long-awaited planting took place last May in a lab.  NASA said the timing for such an experiment was finally right, with the space agency looking to put astronauts back on the moon in a few years. The ideal situation would be for future astronauts to tap into the endless supply of available local dirt for indoor planting versus setting up a hydroponic, or all-water, system, scientists said. The fact that anything grew means that we have a really good starting point, and now the question is how do we optimize and improve, said Sharmila Bhattacharya, NASAs program scientist for space biology, The Florida scientists hope to recycle their lunar soil later this year, planting more thale cress before possibly moving on to other vegetation. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Dusty demise for NASA Mars lander in July; power dwindling,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft on Mars is headed for a dusty demise.  The Insight lander is losing power because of all the dust on its solar panels. NASA said Tuesday it will keep using the spacecrafts seismometer to register marsquakes until the power peters out, likely in July. Then flight controllers will monitor InSight until the end of this year, before calling everything off. There really hasnt been too much doom and gloom on the team. Were really still focused on operating the spacecraft, said Jet Propulsion Laboratorys Bruce Banerdt, the principal scientist. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes; the biggest one, a magnitude 5, occurred two weeks ago. It will be NASAs second Mars lander lost to dust: A global dust storm took out Opportunity in 2018. In InSights case, its been a gradual gathering of dust, especially over the past year.  NASAs two other functioning spacecraft on the Martian surface  rovers Curiosity and Perseverance  are still going strong thanks to nuclear power. The space agency may rethink solar power in the future for Mars, said planetary science director Lori Glaze, or at least experiment with new panel-clearing tech or aim for the less-stormy seasons. InSight currently is generating one-tenth of the power from the sun that it did upon arrival. Deputy project manager Kathya Zamora Garcia said the lander initially had enough power to run an electric oven for one hour and 40 minutes; now its down to 10 minutes max. 
        
     The InSight team anticipated this much dust buildup, but hoped a gust wind of wind or dust devil might clean off the solar panels. That has yet to happen, despite several thousand whirlwinds coming close. None of them have quite hit us dead-on yet enough to blow the dust off the panels, Banerdt told reporters. Another science instrument, dubbed the mole, was supposed to burrow 16 feet (5 meters) underground to measure the internal temperature of Mars. But the German digger never got deeper than a couple feet (a half-meter) because of the unexpected composition of the red dirt, and it finally was declared dead at the beginning of last year. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Boeing crew capsule launches to space station on test redo,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeings crew capsule rocketed into orbit Thursday on a repeat test flight without astronauts, after years of being grounded by flaws that could have doomed the spacecraft. Only a test dummy was aboard. If the capsule reaches the International Space Station on Friday and everything else goes well, two or three NASA test pilots could strap in by the end of this year or early next for the companys first crew flight.  Its Boeings third shot at the high-stakes flight demo.  At least this time, Starliner made it to the proper orbit, quickly giving chase to the space station despite the failure of a pair of thrusters. But the all-important rendezvous and docking loomed. Thats another big day for us, said Mark Nappi, vice president and manager of Boeings commercial crew program. So there might be a couple of sleepless nights ahead of us still to get through the rest of the mission, but today feels really good. Starliners first test flight in 2019 was stricken by software errors so severe that the capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and had to skip the space station. The spacecraft came close to being destroyed as ground controllers hastily cut short the mission. After dozens of safety fixes, Boeing returned a different capsule to the launch pad last summer. Corroded valves halted the countdown, resulting in another round of repairs. 
        
     The drawn-out test flight program has cost Boeing approximately $600 million. Were not going to fly (crews) unless we feel like weve bought down the risk, stressed NASA space operations chief Kathy Lueders.  Boeing is seeking redemption as it attempts to catch up with SpaceX, NASAs other contracted taxi service. Elon Musks company has been flying astronauts to and from the space station for two years and delivering cargo for a full decade. Eager to reduce its high-priced dependency on Russia for crew transport, NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to launch astronauts to the space station after the shuttle program ended in 2011. Thats why its so important for Boeings Starliner to succeed, said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. We always, in this case, want to have a backup, Nelson told The Associated Press hours before liftoff. Different in looks but similar in function to SpaceXs Dragon capsule, Boeings fully automated capsule will attempt to dock at the space station on its own. Station astronauts will be ready to steer the capsule by remote control, if necessary. The capsule still has 10 good thrusters for major moves, including dropping out of orbit at flights end, officials said. The two failed ones actually fired briefly before shutting down prematurely one after the other; a backup kicked in to get the spacecraft into the right orbit. Were doing this one step at a time, and we right now need to get this spacecraft through its paces and learn some things, Lueders told reporters following liftoff. Starliner will spend about five days at the space station before aiming for a touchdown in the New Mexico desert next Wednesday. NASA has yet to finalize which astronauts will be on the first Starliner crew. The program is so far behind that the original three have stepped aside. The leading candidates gathered at Cape Canaveral for the evening launch of Starliner atop United Launch Alliances Atlas V rocket.  Were thrilled for this because the next one is us, said astronaut Butch Wilmore. Besides Rosie the Rocketeer  a space-age version of World War IIs Rosie the Riveter  the capsule is carrying groceries and spacewalking gear for the seven station residents. U.S. spacewalks have been on hold since an astronauts helmet took on water in March. NASA is sending up extra absorbent pads for use in helmets, in case an emergency spacewalk is required as the investigation continues. Boeing also is flying mementos from historically black colleges and universities and tree seeds similar to those Apollo astronauts took to the moon that became so-called moon trees here on Earth. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Boeing docks crew capsule to space station in test do-over,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  With only a test dummy aboard, Boeings astronaut capsule pulled up and parked at the International Space Station for the first time Friday, a huge achievement for the company after years of false starts. With Starliners arrival, NASA finally realizes its longtime effort to have crew capsules from competing U.S. companies flying to the space station.  SpaceX already has a running start. Elon Musks company pulled off the same test three years ago and has since launched 18 astronauts to the space station, as well as tourists. Today marks a great milestone, NASA astronaut Bob Hines radioed from the orbiting complex. Starliner is looking beautiful on the front of the station, he added. The only other time Boeings Starliner flew in space, it never got anywhere near the station, ending up in the wrong orbit.  This time, the overhauled spacecraft made it to the right spot following Thursdays launch and docked at the station 25 hours later. The automated rendezvous went off without a major hitch, despite the failure of a handful of thrusters. If the rest of Starliners mission goes well, Boeing could be ready to launch its first crew by the end of this year. The astronauts likely to serve on the first Starliner crew joined Boeing and NASA flight controllers in Houston as the action unfolded nearly 270 miles (435 kilometers) up. NASA wants redundancy when it comes to the Florida-based astronaut taxi service. Administrator Bill Nelson said Boeings long road with Starliner underscores the importance of having two types of crew capsules. U.S. astronauts were stuck riding Russian rockets once the shuttle program ended, until SpaceXs first crew flight in 2020. 
        
     Boeings first Starliner test flight in 2019 was plagued by software errors that cut the mission short and could have doomed the spacecraft. Those were corrected, but when the new capsule awaited liftoff last summer, corroded valves halted the countdown. More repairs followed, as Boeing chalked up nearly $600 million in do-over costs. Before letting Starliner get close to the space station Friday, Boeing ground controllers practiced maneuvering the capsule and tested its robotic vision system. Everything checked out well, Boeing said, except for a cooling loop and four failed thrusters. The capsule held a steady temperature, however, and had plenty of other thrusters for steering.  Once Starliner was within 10 miles (15 kilometers) of the space station, Boeing flight controllers in Houston could see the space station through the capsules cameras. Were waving. Can you see us? joked Hines.  There was only silence from Starliner. The commanders seat was occupied once again by the mannequin dubbed Rosie the Rocketeer, a space-age version of World War IIs Rosie the Riveter. The gleaming white-with-blue-trim capsule hovered 33 feet (10 meters) from the station for close to two hours  considerably longer than planned  as flight controllers adjusted its docking ring and ensured everything else was in order. When the green light finally came, Starliner closed the gap in four minutes, eliciting cheers in Boeings control center. Applause erupted once the latches were tightly secured. These last 48 hours have just been a barnstorm, so its going to be very good to sleep tonight, said Mark Nappi, vice president and director of Boeings commercial crew program. It was a double celebration for NASAs commercial crew program director Steve Stich, who turned 57 Friday. What an incredible birthday it was, he told reporters. The space stations seven astronauts will unload groceries and gear from Starliner and pack it up with experiments. Unlike SpaceXs Dragon capsule that splashes down off the Florida coast, Starliner will aim for a landing in New Mexico next Wednesday. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Hubble telescopes bigger, more powerful successor to soar","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Hubble Space Telescopes successor is a time-traveling wonder capable of peering back to within a hairs breadth of the dawn of the universe. And its finally on the brink of flight. It will be the biggest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever to leave the planet, elaborate in its design and ambitious in its scope. At a budget-busting $10 billion, it is the most expensive and also the trickiest, by far, to pull off. Set to soar after years of delay, the James Webb Space Telescope will seek out the faint, twinkling light from the first stars and galaxies, providing a glimpse into cosmic creation. Its infrared eyes will also stare down black holes and hunt for alien worlds, scouring the atmospheres of planets for water and other possible hints of life. Thats why its worth taking risks. Thats why its worth the agony and the sleepless nights, NASAs science mission chief Thomas Zurbuchen said in an interview with The Associated Press. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said hes more nervous now than when he launched on space shuttle Columbia in 1986. There are over 300 things, any one of which goes wrong, it is not a good day, Nelson told the AP. So the whole thing has got to work perfectly. Liftoff from the coast of French Guiana in South America was set for Friday but has been postponed for at least a day, until Christmas at the earliest, because of high wind.  
        
     The Webb telescope is so big that it had to be folded origami-style to fit into the nose cone of the European Ariane rocket. Its light-collecting mirror is the size of several parking spots and its sunshade the size of a tennis court. Everything needs to be unfolded once the spacecraft is speeding toward its perch 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away. Weve been waiting a long time for this, said the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys planet hunter Sara Seager. Webb will move our search for life forward, but to find signs of life we have to be incredibly lucky. Named after the man who led NASA during the space-trailblazing 1960s, the 7-ton James Webb Space Telescope is 100 times more powerful than Hubble. The 31-year-old Hubble  increasingly creaky but still churning out celestial glamour shots  focuses on visible and ultraviolet light, with just a smattering of infrared light. As an infrared or heat-sensing telescope, Webb will see things Hubble cant, providing an entirely new perspective on the universe that will be just as awe-inspiring, said Nikole Lewis, deputy director of Cornell Universitys Carl Sagan Institute. Webb will attempt to look back in time 13.7 billion years, a mere 100 million years after the universe-forming Big Bang as the original stars were taking shape. Scientists are eager to see how closely, if at all, these initial galaxies resemble our modern day Milky Way. To out hustle Hubble, Webb requires a considerably bigger mirror spanning 21 feet (6.5 meters). It also needs a canopy large enough to keep sunshine and even reflections from the Earth and moon off the mirror and science instruments. The shiny, five-layered thin shade stretches 70 feet by 46 feet (21 meters by 14 meters), essential for keeping all four instruments in a constant subzero state  around minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 240 degrees Celsius). The most daunting part of the mission: Unfolding Webbs mirror and sunshield following launch, and locking them into perfect position. The gold-plated mirror consists of 18 motor-driven segments, each of which must be meticulously aligned so they can focus as one. NASA has never attempted such a complicated series of steps remotely. Many of the mechanisms have no backup, so the failure of any of 344 such parts could doom the mission. Hubble had its own debacle following liftoff in 1990. A mirror defect wasnt detected until the first blurry pictures trickled down from orbit. The blunder prompted a series of risky repairs by shuttle astronauts who restored Hubbles sight and transformed the machine into the worlds most accomplished  and beloved  observatory. Webb will be too far away for a rescue mission by NASA and its European and Canadian partners. To avoid a repeat of the Hubble fiasco, Zurbuchen ordered an overhaul of Webb after joining NASA in 2016, 20 years into development. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor. The sunshield ripped during a practice unfurling. Tension cables for the shade had too much slack. Dozens of fasteners fell off in a vibration test. All this and more led to more investigations, more delays and more costs. The problems continued even after Webbs arrival at the South American launch site in October. A clamp came loose and jolted the telescope. A communication relay between the telescope and rocket malfunctioned. Once launched, it will take Webb a full month to reach its intended parking spot, four times beyond the moon. From this gravity-balanced, fuel-efficient location, the telescope will keep pace with Earth while orbiting the sun, continuously positioned on Earths nightside.  It will take another five months for chilling and checking of Webbs infrared instruments before it can get to work by the end of June. The  Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore operates Hubble and will also oversee Webb. At least five to 10 years of observing are planned. Personally, I think that even with all of the hype, the Webb will still exceed expectations, said the institutes Ori Fox, who will use Webb to study supernovae, or exploded stars. Many of what are considered Hubbles most inspiring discoveries were not part of the original plan. His colleague, Christine Chen, who will focus on budding solar systems, finds serendipity perhaps the most exciting aspect of Webb.

EXPLAINER: Veteran Hubble vs. new Webb space telescope,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Dont ask astronomers to choose between the Hubble Space Telescope and the new kid on the cosmic block, the James Webb Space Telescope. Comparing Hubble and Webb is like asking if you will love your second child as much as your first, said Susan Mullally, Webbs deputy project scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. Hubble will always be loved for its awe-inspiring images of our universe and will continue to collect important data for astronomers. Webb gives us new and unique eyes of places that we have never been able to reach. With NASA and the European Space Agencys Hubble pushing 32 years in orbit, the bigger, 100 times more powerful Webb is widely viewed as its successor even though the two are vastly different. Its liftoff is slated for Saturday morning from the coast of South America.  The lowdown on Hubble versus Webb: ROCKET RIDES Hubble caught a lift to orbit tucked inside NASAs space shuttle Discovery in 1990. It quickly ran into trouble: one of the telescopes solar wings jammed as it was unfurling. Astronauts suited up for an emergency spacewalk, but commands from Earth freed the panel. Within weeks, Hubbles blurry vision was detected. Spacewalking astronauts fixed it three years later. Soaring from South America on a European Ariane rocket, Webb wont be reachable by astronauts at its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away. Bigger and more intricate than Hubble, Webb will be a goner if its foldout mirror and sunshield snarl.  LET THERE BE LIGHT 
        
     Webb is expected to behold light from the universes first stars and galaxies, beyond Hubbles range. This light will reveal how the original stars looked 13.7 billion years ago. Hubble has stared as far back as 13.4 billion years, disclosing a clumpy runt of a galaxy that is currently the oldest and farthest object ever observed. Astronomers are eager to close the 300 million year gap with Webb and draw ever closer in time to the Big Bang, the moment the universe formed 13.8 billion years ago. Its like looking at the picture book of my kids and missing the first two years, right? Trying to figure out where they come from, said NASA science chief Thomas Zurbuchen. INFRARED VISION Hubble sees what we see  visible light  with a little ultraviolet and infrared thrown in. Webb has infrared vision, allowing it to pierce cosmic clouds of dust. The shorter visible and ultraviolet wavelengths emitted by the first stars and galaxies have been stretched as the universe expands, so Webb will see them in their elongated, heat-emitting infrared form. Thats why Webbs detectors need to run at minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 240 degrees Celsius). To stay chilled, Webb carries a parasol the size of a tennis court. Between each of the sunshields five layers is a gap so heat can escape out the sides. Multiple layers also better protect against micrometeorite hits. SIZE MATTERS To discern the universes first, faint stars, Webb requires the largest mirror ever launched for astronomy. The mirror spans more than 21 feet (6.5 meters), yet is lighter than Hubbles, which is 8 feet (2.4 meters) across. Thats because Webbs mirror is made of beryllium, a strong but lightweight metal. Its also segmented, allowing it to fold like a drop-leaf table for launch. Each of the 18 hexagonal segments are the size of a coffee table and coated with ultra-thin gold, an ideal reflector of infrared light.  LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION Hubble circles 330 miles (530 kilometers) overhead. The altitude was dictated by the capabilities of NASAs space shuttles, which delivered Hubble to orbit and then made five service calls. Webb is bound for more a more distant spot  1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away at whats called the second Lagrange point. This is where the gravitational forces of the Earth and sun balance, requiring minimal fuel for a spacecraft to stay put. Webb will constantly face the nightside of Earth as the spacecraft and planet swoop around the sun in unison. GROWING PAINS Hubble was years late and millions over budget by the time it rocketed into orbit in 1990. Webb also is years late with huge cost overruns. NASAs tab for Hubble from its 1970s development until now: $16 billion, adjusted for inflation. That doesnt include all the shuttle flights for launch and repairs. Webbs price tag is an estimated $10 billion; that includes the first five years of operation. The European Space Agency is picking up the launch costs, with a French-built Ariane rocket providing Webbs lift from French Guiana. HUBBLE AND WEBB NAMESAKES: Astronomer Edwin Hubble confirmed a century ago that countless galaxies exist beyond our Milky Way and the universe is constantly expanding. James Webb led NASA from 1961 to 1968, presiding over Projects Mercury and Gemini, and the early phase of Apollos moon-landing program. In 2002, a decade after Webbs death, NASA chose his name for the new telescope. But now some scientists and others want a new name, given Webbs State Department and NASA leadership during the Truman administration, when government workers were fired for being gay. NASAs historian conducted an archival search of Webb this year, but found no evidence warranting a name change, said Administrator Bill Nelson. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Space telescope launched on daring quest to behold 1st stars,"The worlds largest and most powerful space telescope rocketed away Saturday on a high-stakes quest to behold light from the first stars and galaxies and scour the universe for hints of life. NASAs James Webb Space Telescope soared from French Guiana on South Americas northeastern coast, riding a European Ariane rocket into the Christmas morning sky. What an amazing Christmas present, said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASAs science mission chief. The $10 billion observatory hurtled toward its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, or more than four times beyond the moon. It will take a month to get there and another five months before its infrared eyes are ready to start scanning the cosmos. First, the telescopes enormous mirror and sunshield need to unfurl; they were folded origami-style to fit into the rockets nose cone. Otherwise, the observatory wont be able to peer back in time 13.7 billion years as anticipated, within a mere 100 million years of the universe-forming Big Bang. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson called Webb a time machine that will provide a better understanding of our universe and our place in it: who we are, what we are, the search thats eternal. We are going to discover incredible things that we never imagined, Nelson said following liftoff, speaking from Floridas Kennedy Space Center. But he cautioned: There are still innumerable things that have to work and they have to work perfectly ... we know that in great reward there is great risk. 
        
     Intended as a successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope, the long-delayed James Webb is named after NASAs administrator during the 1960s. NASA partnered with the European and Canadian space agencies to build and launch the new 7-ton telescope, with thousands of people from 29 countries working on it since the 1990s. With the launch falling on Christmas and a global surge in COVID-19 cases, there were fewer spectators at the French Guiana launch site than expected. Nelson bowed out along with a congressional delegation and many contractors who worked on the telescope. Around the world, astronomers and countless others tuned in, anxious to see Webb finally taking flight after years of setbacks. Last-minute technical snags bumped the launch nearly a week, then gusty wind pushed it to Christmas. A few of the launch controllers wore Santa caps in celebration. We have delivered a Christmas gift today for humanity, said European Space Agency director general Josef Aschbacher. He described it as a special moment, but added: Its very nerve-racking. I couldnt do launches every single day. This would not be good for my life expectancy. Cheers and applause erupted in and outside Launch Control following Webbs flawless launch, with jubilant scientists embracing one another amid shouts of Go Webb! and signs that read: Bon Voyage Webb.  Cameras on the rockets upper stage provided one last glimpse of the shimmering telescope against a backdrop of Earth, before it sped away. That picture will be burned into my mind forever, Zurbuchen told journalists. The telescopes showpiece: a gold-plated mirror more than 21 feet (6.5 meters) across.  Protecting the observatory is a wispy, five-layered sunshield, vital for keeping the light-gathering mirror and heat-sensing infrared detectors at subzero temperatures. At 70 feet by 46 feet (21 meters by 14 meters), its the size of a tennis court. If all goes well, the sunshield will be opened three days after liftoff, taking at least five days to unfold and lock into place. Next, the mirror segments should open up like the leaves of a drop-leaf table, 12 days or so into the flight.  In all, hundreds of release mechanisms need to work  perfectly  in order for the telescope to succeed. Such a complex series of actions is unprecedented  like nothing weve done before, noted NASA program director Greg Robinson.  Now its our job to start from here and keep going, said Massimo Stiavelli, an astronomer who heads the Webb mission office at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. The institute serves as the control hub for Hubble and, now, Webb. The Hubble Space Telescope will be a tough act to follow, according to Stiavelli and retired astronaut-astronomer Steven Hawley, even though Webb is 100 times more powerful. Hawley, in fact, is more stressed over Webb than he was for Hubble, which he released into orbit from space shuttle Discovery in 1990. Thats because Webb will be too far away for rescuing, as was necessary when Hubble turned out to have blurry vision from a defective mirror. Spacewalking repairs by astronauts transformed Hubble into a beloved marvel that has revolutionized humanitys understanding of the universe, casting its eyes as far back as 13.4 billion years. Its now up to Webb to draw even closer to the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, its infrared vision keener and more far-reaching than Hubbles is in the shorter visible and ultraviolet wavelengths. NASA is shooting for 10 years of operational life from Webb. Engineers deliberately left the fuel tank accessible for a top-off by visiting spacecraft, if and when such technology becomes available. Hubble is like the perfect story. It starts badly, then the cavalry fixes it, then its a major success. Its almost a Christmas movie in a way, Stiavelli said following Webbs liftoff. Its a high bar, but hopefully the science contributions of Webb will be up there. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASAs new space telescope hunky-dory after problems fixed,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new space telescope is on the verge of completing the riskiest part of its mission  unfolding and tightening a huge sunshade  after ground controllers fixed a pair of problems, officials said Monday.  The tennis court-size sunshield on the James Webb Space Telescope is now fully open and in the process of being stretched tight. The operation should be complete by Wednesday. The $10 billion telescope  the largest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever launched  rocketed away Christmas Day from French Guiana. Its sunshield and primary mirror had to be folded to fit into the European Ariane rocket. The sunshield is vital for keeping Webbs infrared-sensing instruments at subzero temperatures, as they scan the universe for the first stars and galaxies, and examine the atmospheres of alien worlds for possible signs of life. Getting the sunshield extended last Friday was really a huge achievement for us, said project manager Bill Ochs. All 107 release pins opened properly. But there have been a few obstacles. Flight controllers in Maryland had to reset Webbs solar panel to draw more power. The observatory  considered the successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope  was never in any danger, with a constant power flow, said Amy Lo, a lead engineer for the telescopes prime contractor, Northrop Grumman. They also repointed the telescope to limit sunlight on six overheating motors. The motors cooled enough to begin securing the sunshield, a three-day process that can be halted if the problem crops up again, officials said. 
        
     Everything is hunky-dory and doing well now, Lo said.  Ochs expects the tightening of the sunshield to be drama-free.  The best thing for operations is boring, and thats what we anticipate over the next three days, is to be boring, he told reporters in a teleconference. If that holds true, the telescopes gold-plated mirror  more than 21 feet (6.5 meters) across  could unfold as soon as this weekend. Webb should reach its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away by the end of January. As of Monday, the telescope was more than halfway there. The infrared telescope should begin observing the cosmos by the end of June, ultimately unveiling the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe 13.7 billion years ago. Thats a mere 100 million years after the universe-creating Big Bang. Launched in 1990, Hubble, which sees primarily visible light, has peered as far back as 13.4 billion years ago. Astronomers hope to close the gap with Webb, which is 100 times more powerful. In another bit of good news Monday, officials said they expect Webb to last well beyond the originally anticipated 10 years based on its fuel efficiency. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA nails trickiest job on newly launched space telescope,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA aced the most complicated, critical job on its newly launched space telescope Tuesday: unrolling and stretching a sunshade the size of a tennis court.  Ground controllers cheered and bumped fists once the fifth and final layer of the sunshield was tightly secured. It took just 1 1/2 days to tighten the ultra-thin layers using motor-driven cables, half the expected time. The 7-ton James Webb Space Telescope is so big that the sunshield and the primary gold-plated mirror had to be folded for launch. The sunshield is especially unwieldly  it spans 70 feet by 46 feet (21 meters by 14 meters) to keep all the infrared, heat-sensing science instruments in constant subzero shadow.  The mirrors are next up for release this weekend.  The $10 billion telescope is more than halfway toward its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, following its Christmas Day send-off. It is the biggest and most powerful observatory ever launched  100 times more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope  enabling it to peer back to almost the beginning of time.  Considered Hubbles successor, Webb will attempt to hunt down light from the universes first stars and galaxies, created 13.7 billion years ago.  This is a really big moment, project manager Bill Ochs told the control team in Baltimore. Weve still got a lot of work to do, but getting the sunshield out and deployed is really, really big. 
        
     Engineers spent years redoing and tweaking the shade. At one point, dozens of fasteners fell off during a vibration test. That made Tuesdays success all the sweeter, since nothing like this had ever been attempted before in space. First time and we nailed it, engineer Alphonso Stewart told reporters. ___ This story was first published on Jan. 4. It was updated on Jan. 5 to correct date of first stars and galaxies to 13.7 billion years ago, not 3.7 billion.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Space telescopes golden eye opens, last major hurdle","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new space telescope opened its huge, gold-plated, flower-shaped mirror Saturday, the final step in the observatorys dramatic unfurling.  The last portion of the 21-foot (6.5-meter) mirror swung into place at flight controllers command, completing the unfolding of the James Webb Space Telescope. Im emotional about it. What an amazing milestone. We see that beautiful pattern out there in the sky now, said Thomas Zurbuchen, chief of NASAs science missions. More powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, the $10 billion Webb will scan the cosmos for light streaming from the first stars and galaxies formed 13.7 billion years ago. To accomplish this, NASA had to outfit Webb with the largest and most sensitive mirror ever launched  its golden eye, as scientists call it.  Webb is so big that it had to be folded orgami-style to fit in the rocket that soared from South America two weeks ago. The riskiest operation occurred earlier in the week, when the tennis court-size sunshield unfurled, providing subzero shade for the mirror and infrared detectors.  Flight controllers in Baltimore began opening the primary mirror Friday, unfolding the left side like a drop-leaf table. The mood was even more upbeat Saturday, with peppy music filling the control room as the right side snapped into place. After applauding, the controllers immediately got back to work, latching everything down. They jumped to their feet, exchanged high-fives and cheered from behind masks when the operation was finally complete 2 1/2 hours later, doing their best to remain socially distant because of the global surge in COVID-19 cases. We have a deployed telescope on orbit, a magnificent telescope the likes of which the world has never seen, Zurbuchen said, congratulating the team. So how does it feel to make history, everybody? You just did it. 
        
     His counterpart at the European Space Agency, astronomer Antonella Nota, noted that after years of preparation, the team made everything look so amazingly easy. This is the moment we have been waiting for, for so long, she said. Webbs main mirror is made of beryllium, a lightweight yet sturdy and cold-resistant metal. Each of its 18 segments is coated with an ultra thin layer of gold, highly reflective of infrared light. The hexagonal, coffee table-size segments must be adjusted in the weeks ahead so they can focus as one on stars, galaxies and alien worlds that might hold atmospheric signs of life. Its like we have 18 mirrors that are right now little prima donnas all doing their own thing, singing their own tune in whatever key theyre in, and we have to make them work like a chorus and that is a methodical, laborious process, operations project scientist Jane Rigby told reporters.  Webb should reach its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away in another two weeks; its already more than 667,000 miles (1 million kilometers) from Earth since its Christmas Day launch. If all continues to go well, science observations will begin this summer. Astronomers hope to peer back to within 100 million years of the universe-forming Big Bang, closer than Hubble has achieved. Project manager Bill Ochs stressed the team isnt letting its guard down, despite the unprecedented successes of the past two weeks.  Its not downhill from here. Its all kind of a level playing field, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Rare snowy owl soars over Washington, thrills crowds","WASHINGTON (AP)  A snowy owl apparently touring iconic buildings of the nations capital is captivating birdwatchers who manage to get a glimpse of the rare, resplendent visitor from the Arctic.  Far from its summer breeding grounds in Canada, the snowy owl was first seen on Jan. 3, the day a winter storm dumped eight inches of snow on the city. Since then, its been spotted in the evenings flying around Washingtons Capitol Hill neighborhood, landing on Union Station, the National Postal Museum, various Senate buildings, and Capitol Police headquarters. Late last week about three dozen people in thick coats trained their binoculars on the football-sized bird with bright yellow eyes as it perched on the stone head of Archimedes, a famous ancient Greek mathematician, carved above the train station entrance.  The nocturnal hunter appears to be targeting the citys plentiful downtown rat population. Snowy owls are coming from a part of the world where they see almost nothing human, from completely treeless open Arctic tundra, said Scott Weidensaul, a researcher at nonprofit Project SNOWStorm, which tracks snowy owl movements.  Some owls migrate south out of the Arctic every winter, but the number fluctuates, he said. About every three to five years, a spike in the population of lemmings, their chief food source, results in a larger number of surviving owl chicks. In those irruption years, more birds migrate and migrate farther. 
        
     Most winters, North American snowy owls dont go much below the Great Lakes or Cape Cod area, Weidensaul said. However, in irruption years, they tend to go farther south than they usually would, he said. A lot of the snowy owls were seeing now in the East and Upper Midwest are young birds, on their first migration. On eBird, a nonprofit platform used by birdwatchers, snowy owls have been reported this winter in Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, North Carolina and Maryland.  Since it was first seen, the Capitol Hill owl has attracted a few dozen birdwatchers each night hoping to spot the same owl species that delivers messages to Harry Potter.  The onlookers have included new birdwatchers and those who have been doing it for decades, like Swiss ambassador to the U.S., Jacques Pitteloud, many hoping for a lifer  the first time a birdwatcher has seen a particular bird.  Last Thursday, the owl perched on a bronze eagle atop a flagpole. Then it soared, its 5-foot white wingspan silhouetted against the inky night sky, to land on a large stone orb held by carved birds, part of an ornate fountain. Ambassador Pitteloud picked up his camera tripod and ran through the grass to get a better view. When he later posted on Facebook, the 50-year veteran birdwatcher wrote, The Superstar of Union Station! Snowy owl, a lifer for me in a very, very unlikely setting! Kerry Snyder, who lives in Washington, has been avidly birdwatching during the pandemic. Its been a great way to connect with people outdoors, when thats been the safest place to be, she said.  She reminded other onlookers not to use flash photography, or approach the owl too closely, lest the bird feel startled or threatened  good practices for viewers observing any bird of prey. Scientists consider snowy owls to be  vulnerable  to extinction and estimate the total global population to be less than 30,000 birds. Weidensaul said that threats to snowy owls include urban hazards  in particular, vehicle collisions and poisons used to kill prey animals like rats, which can also kill raptors  as well as climate change.  The climate is changing more dramatically in the Arctic than anywhere else on Earth, he said, and that may make sightings like this one even rarer. In some parts of the Arctic, thinning ice is already reducing the number of boom years for lemmings.  After decades studying snowy owls, Weidensaul still feels awe: This is a piece of the Arctic in downtown DC  youre not going to see a polar bear walking in front of the White House. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Study nixes Mars life in meteorite found in Antarctica,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A 4 billion-year-old meteorite from Mars that caused a splash here on Earth decades ago contains no evidence of ancient, primitive Martian life after all, scientists reported Thursday.  In 1996, a NASA-led team announced that organic compounds in the rock appeared to have been left by living creatures. Other scientists were skeptical and researchers chipped away at that premise over the decades, most recently by a team led by the Carnegie Institution for Sciences Andrew Steele.  Tiny samples from the meteorite show the carbon-rich compounds are actually the result of water  most likely salty, or briny, water  flowing over the rock for a prolonged period, Steele said. The findings appear in the journal Science. During Mars wet and early past, at least two impacts occurred near the rock, heating the planets surrounding surface, before a third impact bounced it off the red planet and into space millions of years ago. The 4-pound (2-kilogram) rock was found in Antarctica in 1984. Groundwater moving through the cracks in the rock, while it was still on Mars, formed the tiny globs of carbon that are present, according to the researchers. The same thing can happen on Earth and could help explain the presence of methane in Mars atmosphere, they said. But two scientists who took part in the original study took issue with these latest findings, calling them disappointing. In a shared email, they said they stand by their 1996 observations. 
        
     While the data presented incrementally adds to our knowledge of (the meteorite), the interpretation is hardly novel, nor is it supported by the research, wrote Kathie Thomas-Keprta and Simon Clemett, astromaterial researchers at NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston.  Unsupported speculation does nothing to resolve the conundrum surrounding the origin of organic matter in the meteorite, they added. According to Steele, advances in technology made his teams new findings possible. He commended the measurements by the original researchers and noted that their life-claiming hypothesis was a reasonable interpretation at the time. He said he and his team  which includes NASA, German and British scientists  took care to present their results for what they are, which is a very exciting discovery about Mars and not a study to disprove the original premise. This finding is huge for our understanding of how life started on this planet and helps refine the techniques we need to find life elsewhere on Mars, or Enceladus and Europa, Steele said in an email, referring to Saturn and Jupiters moons with subsurface oceans. The only way to prove whether Mars ever had or still has microbial life, according to Steele, is to bring samples to Earth for analysis. NASAs Perseverance Mars rover already has collected six samples for return to Earth in a decade or so; three dozen samples are desired. Millions of years after drifting through space, the meteorite landed on an icefield in Antarctica thousands of years ago. The small gray-green fragment got its name  Allan Hills 84001  from the hills where it was found. Just this week, a piece of this meteorite was used in a first-of-its-kind experiment aboard the International Space Station. A mini scanning electron microscope examined the sample; Thomas-Keprta operated it remotely from Houston. Researchers hope to use the microscope to analyze geologic samples in space  on the moon one day, for example  and debris that could ruin station equipment or endanger astronauts. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

New space telescope reaches final stop million miles out,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The worlds biggest, most powerful space telescope arrived at its observation post 1 million miles from Earth on Monday, a month after it lifted off on a quest to behold the dawn of the universe.  On command, the James Webb Space Telescope fired its rocket thrusters for nearly five minutes to go into orbit around the sun at its designated location, and NASA confirmed the operation went as planned.  The mirrors on the $10 billion observatory still must be meticulously aligned, the infrared detectors sufficiently chilled and the scientific instruments calibrated before observations can begin in June.  But flight controllers in Baltimore were euphoric after chalking up another success. Were one step closer to uncovering the mysteries of the universe. And I cant wait to see Webbs first new views of the universe this summer! NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. The telescope will enable astronomers to peer back further in time than ever before, all the way back to when the first stars and galaxies were forming 13.7 billion years ago. Thats a mere 100 million years from the Big Bang, when the universe was created.  Besides making stellar observations, Webb will scan the atmospheres of alien worlds for possible signs of life. Webb is officially on station, said Keith Parrish, a manager on the project. This is just capping off just a remarkable 30 days. 
        
     The telescope was launched from French Guiana on Christmas. A week and a half later, a sunshield as big as a tennis court stretched open on the telescope. The instruments gold-coated primary mirror  21 feet (6.5 meters) across  unfolded a few days later.  The primary mirror has 18 hexagonal segments, each the size of a coffee table, that will have to be painstakingly aligned so that they see as one  a task that will take three months. Were a month in and the baby hasnt even opened its eyes yet, Jane Rigby, the operations project scientist, said of the telescopes infrared instruments. But thats the science that were looking forward to. Mondays thruster firing put the telescope in orbit around the sun at the so-called second Lagrange point, where the gravitational forces of the sun and Earth balance each other. The 7-ton spacecraft will loop-de-loop around that point while also circling the sun. It will always face Earths night side to keep its infrared detectors as frigid as possible. At 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, Webb is more than four times as distant as the moon. The Webb is expected to operate for well over a decade, maybe two. Considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits 330 miles (530 kilometers) up, Webb is too far away for emergency repairs. That makes the milestones over the past month  and the ones ahead  all the more critical. Spacewalking astronauts performed surgery five times on Hubble. The first operation, in 1993, corrected the telescopes blurry vision, a flaw introduced during the mirrors construction on the ground. Whether chasing optical and ultraviolet light like Hubble or infrared light like Webb, telescopes can see farther and more clearly when operating above Earths distorting atmosphere. Thats why NASA teamed up with the European and Canadian space agencies to get Webb and its mirror  the largest ever launched  into the cosmos.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

He won a trip to space. Then he gave it away to a friend,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  He told his family and a few friends. He dropped hints to a couple of colleagues. So hardly anyone knew that the airline pilot could have  should have  been on board when SpaceX launched its first tourists into orbit last year. Meet Kyle Hippchen, the real winner of a first-of-its-kind sweepstakes, who gave his seat to his college roommate. Though Hippchens secret is finally out, that doesnt make it any easier knowing he missed his chance to orbit Earth because he exceeded the weight limit. He still hasnt watched the Netflix series on the three-day flight purchased by a tech entrepreneur for himself and three guests last September. It hurts too much, he said. Im insanely disappointed. But it is what it is. Hippchen, 43, a Florida-based captain for Deltas regional carrier Endeavor Air, recently shared his story with The Associated Press during his first visit to NASAs Kennedy Space Center since his lost rocket ride. He opened up about his out-of-the-blue, dream-come-true windfall, the letdown when he realized he topped SpaceXs weight restrictions of 250 pounds (113 kilograms) and his offer to the one person he knew would treasure the flight as much as himself. Four months later, he figures probably fewer than 50 people know he was the actual winner. It was their show, and I didnt want to be distracting too much from what they were doing, said Hippchen, who watched the launch from a VIP balcony. 
        
     His seat went to Chris Sembroski, 42, a data engineer in Everett, Washington. The pair roomed together starting in the late 1990s while attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Theyd pile into cars with other student space geeks and make the hourlong drive south for NASAs shuttles launches. They also belonged to a space advocacy group, going to Washington to push commercial space travel. Despite living on opposite coasts, Hippchen and Sembroski continued to swap space news and champion the cause. Neither could resist when Shift4 Payments founder and CEO Jared Isaacman raffled off a seat on the flight he purchased from SpaceXs Elon Musk. The beneficiary was St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. Hippchen snapped up $600 worth of entries. Sembroski, about to start a new job at Lockheed Martin, shelled out $50. With 72,000 entries in the random drawing last February, neither figured hed win and didnt bother telling the other. By early March, Hippchen started receiving vague emails seeking details about himself. Thats when he read the contests small print: The winner had to be under 6-foot-6 and 250 pounds (2 meters and 113 kilograms).  Hippchen was 5-foot-10 and 330 pounds (1.8 meters and 150 kilograms). He told organizers he was pulling out, figuring he was only one of many finalists. In the flurry of emails and calls that followed, Hippchen was stunned to learn hed won. With a September launch planned, the timeline was tight. Still new at flying people, SpaceX needed to start measuring its first private passengers for their custom-fitted flight suits and capsule seats. As an aerospace engineer and pilot, Hippchen knew the weight limit was a safety issue involving the seats, and could not be exceeded. I was trying to figure how I could drop 80 pounds in six months, which, I mean, its possible, but its not the most healthy thing in the world to do, Hippchen said. Isaacman, the spaceflights sponsor, allowed Hippchen to pick a stand-in. Kyles willingness to gift his seat to Chris was an incredible act of generosity, he said in an email this week.  Isaacman introduced his passengers at the end of March: a St. Jude physician assistant who beat cancer there as a child; a community college educator who was Shift4 Payments winning business client; and Sembroski. Hippchen joined them in April to watch SpaceX launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA, the companys last crew flight before their own.  In gratitude, Sembroski offered to take personal items into space for Hippchen. He gathered his high school and college rings, airline captain epaulets, a great-uncles World War I Purple Heart and odds and ends from his best friends from high school, warning, Dont ask any details. By launch day on Sept. 15, word had gotten around. As friends and families gathered for the liftoff, Hippchen said the conversation went like this: My names Kyle. Are you The Kyle? Yeah, Im The Kyle. Before climbing into SpaceXs Dragon capsule, Sembroski followed tradition and used the phone atop the launch tower to make his one allotted call. He called Hippchen and thanked him one more time. Im forever grateful, Sembroski said. And while Hippchen didnt get to see Earth from orbit, he did get to experience about 10 minutes of weightlessness. During Sembroskis flight, he joined friends and family of the crew on a special zero-gravity plane. It was a blast.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Fake poop helps evicted owls settle into new neighborhood,"Settling into a new home can be tough for anyone. So scientists have come up with some tricks to make transplanted burrowing owls feel like they are not alone in their new digs, playing owl sounds and scattering fake poop. The owls grassland homes are often prime real estate, and theyve been losing ground to development in fast-growing regions like Silicon Valley and Southern California. Biologists have tried moving the owls to protected grasslands but the challenge has been getting the owls to accept their new homes.  Just dropping off the owls in prime habitat wasnt enough, prior attempts showed. In a pilot program, scientists took pains to create the impression that owls already lived there so theyd stick around. And it worked. They like to be in a neighborhood, to live near other owls, said Colleen Wisinski, a conservation biologist at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, which launched the experiment with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The scientists played recordings of owl calls before and after the new arrivals were released at four locations in Southern California. Wisinski used a syringe to squirt around fake owl poop  in reality, white paint. Their results were published Thursday in the journal Animal Conservation. Burrowing owls are the rare extroverts of the raptor world. These long-legged owls with slightly cross expressions actually love company. They nest in underground burrows with many owls nearby. 
        
     Such colonies provide protection from predators, such as coyotes or hawks, that may try to snack on the robin-sized, yellow-eyed birds. When one owl sounds an alarm, the others fly away.  Federal law prohibits the killing of the birds but their habitat is not protected. Typically, they are flushed from their burrows before properties are built.  If after eviction theres nowhere for these guys to go, its basically a death sentence, said Lynne Trulio, an ecologist at San Jose State University who has studied burrowing owls for three decades. She was not part of the study. The population of western burrowing owls  the subspecies that lives in California  has declined by one-third since 1965. It is considered a species of special concern in the state. For their experiment, the scientists transplanted 47 burrowing owls during 2017-2018. Twenty were outfitted with GPS devices to track their movements, and the scientists also returned to the sites to check on them. Most successfully settled into their new homes and established breeding colonies. At the primary site, Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve in southwestern San Diego County, there were about 50 owl chicks in 2020. The researchers also monitored owls that were left on their own to find new homes. Those owls didnt fare as well. These scientists are leading the pack in advancing our understanding of how to relocate burrowing owls, said David H. Johnson, director of the Global Owl Project, who was not involved in the paper.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX, NASA looking into sluggish chutes on last 2 flights","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX and NASA are investigating a parachute issue that occurred on the last two capsule flights.  One of the four main parachutes was slow to inflate during the return of four astronauts to Earth last November. The same thing happened last week as a Dragon cargo capsule was bringing back science experiments from the International Space Station. In both cases, the sluggish parachute eventually opened and inflated  although more than a minute late  and the capsules splashed down safely off the Florida coast.  Officials for SpaceX and NASA said Friday they want to better understand whats happening, especially before launching another crew in a month or two. Theyre looking at photographs and inspecting the parachutes for clues, taking extra caution with this very critical system, said Steve Stich, manager of NASAs commercial crew program. Were not taking anything for granted, SpaceXs William Gerstenmaier, a former NASA official, told reporters. SpaceXs first private flight to the space station, with three ticket-buying businessmen and their retired astronaut escort, is set to blast off from NASAs Kennedy Space Center on March 30. NASAs next astronaut ferry flight would follow on April 15. Officials said the lagging parachutes also occurred during development and in previous cargo missions, and could just be a natural feature of the multiple-chute design. Despite the slow opening of one of the four large chutes, the capsules still descended at a safe rate, they noted. The descent data was near normal, Gerstenmaier said.  
        
     Only three of four parachutes are needed for a safe splashdown off the Florida coast, according to officials. Similar parachutes are used on Boeings Starliner crew capsule and NASAs Orion moon capsule, neither of which has launched astronauts yet. These, too, sometimes lag when inflating, Stich said, and so the results of the SpaceX investigation will be shared. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX satellites falling out of orbit after solar storm,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs newest fleet of satellites is tumbling out of orbit after being struck by a solar storm. Up to 40 of the 49 small satellites launched last week have either reentered the atmosphere and burned up, or are on the verge of doing so, the company said in an online update Tuesday night.  SpaceX said a geomagnetic storm last Friday made the atmosphere denser, which increased the drag on the Starlink satellites, effectively dooming them.  Ground controllers tried to save the compact, flat-panel satellites by putting them into a type of hibernation and flying them in a way to minimize drag. But the atmospheric pull was too great, and the satellites failed to awaken and climb to a higher, more stable orbit, according to the company. SpaceX still has close to 2,000 Starlink satellites orbiting Earth and providing internet service to remote corners of the world. They circle the globe more than 340 miles up (550 kilometers).  The satellites hit by the solar storm were in a temporary position. SpaceX deliberately launches them into this unusually low orbit so that any duds can quickly reenter the atmosphere and pose no threat to other spacecraft.  There is no danger from these newly falling satellites, either in orbit or on the ground, according to the company. Each satellite weighs less than 575 pounds (260 kilograms). SpaceX described the lost satellites as a unique situation. Such geomagnetic storms are caused by intense solar activity like flares, which can send streams of plasma from the suns corona hurtling out into space and toward Earth. 
        
     Since launching the first Starlink satellites in 2019, Elon Musk envisions a constellation of thousands more satellites to increase internet service. SpaceX is trying to help restore internet service to Tonga through this network following the devastating volcanic eruption and tsunami. London-based OneWeb has its own internet satellites up there.

Rocket startups Florida launch debut ends in ocean crash,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A rocket startups big Florida launch debut ended with all four mini satellites destroyed Thursday.  California-based Astra sent its rocket soaring from Cape Canaveral after multiple delays, including a last-second engine shutdown Monday. The 43-foot (13-meter) rocket arced through a clear afternoon sky out over the Atlantic, carrying small research satellites sponsored by NASA.  But shortly after the first-stage booster dropped away, onboard cameras showed the second stage igniting and appearing to tumble. The video cameras went dark less than four minutes into the flight and the airwaves grew silent.  A launch commentator finally confirmed that the payloads failed to reach orbit. Three of the CubeSats were built by universities in Alabama, New Mexico and California, while the fourth was from NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston. All ended up crashing into the ocean. Astra CEO and founder Chris Kemp apologized for the loss in a tweet: Im with the team looking at data, and we will provide more info as soon as we can. NASA mission manager Hamilton Fernandez reiterated the space agencys support following the accident.  Missions like these are critical for developing new launch vehicles in this growing commercial sector, Fernandez said in a statement. Astra was among three companies picked by NASA in 2020 to launch small satellites. The company received $3.9 million. 
        
     Astra was attempting its first launch from Cape Canaveral, following its first successful orbital launch last November from Alaskas Kodiak Island. That test flight  contracted by the U.S. Space Force  featured a dummy payload on the second stage. The company was founded in 2016 in Alameda, California. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceXs Elon Musk: 1st orbital Starship flight maybe March,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs Elon Musk said Thursday that the first orbital flight of his towering Starship  the worlds most powerful rocket ever built  could come in another month or two.  While he anticipates failures, hes confident Starship will reach orbit by the end of this year.  Musk provided his first major Starship update in more than two years while standing alongside the 390-foot (119-meter) rocket at SpaceXs Texas spaceport. He urged the nighttime crowd, Lets make this real!  This is really some wild stuff here, he said. In fact, hard to believe its real. NASA plans to use the fully reusable Starship to land astronauts on the moon as early as 2025. Musk, meanwhile, hopes to deploy a fleet of Starships to create a city on Mars, hauling equipment and people there. For now, the initial flights would carry Musks internet satellites, called Starlinks, into orbit. There will probably be a few bumps in the road, but we want to iron those out with satellite missions and test missions before putting people on board, he said. SpaceXs Super Heavy first-stage booster has yet to blast off. But the futuristic, bullet-shaped, steel Starship  perched on top and serving as the upper stage  successfully launched and landed on its own last May, following a series of spectacular explosions. The rocketship soared more than 6 miles (10 kilometers).  SpaceX is awaiting approval from the Federal Aviation Administration before proceeding with Starships next phase: going into orbit. Musk said he expects the go-ahead in March and that the rocket should be ready to fly by then as well. That would put the launch in the next couple of months, he added. 
        
     If the FAA demands more information about potential environmental impacts or lawsuits emerge, Musk said Starship launches could move to NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Florida. But that would delay the first orbital launch by more than half a year, he noted. The full-size Starships are massive  taller than NASAs past and present moon rockets, with approximately double the liftoff thrust. Besides Floridas Cape Canaveral and the southern tip of Texas near Boca Chica, Starships could ultimately launch from floating ocean platforms anywhere in the world, Musk said. He envisions Starships launching three times a day  rapid reusability  with refilling stations in space for the longer destinations like Mars. The first refilling test could happen by the end of next year, he said. Musk estimates a Starship launch could wind up costing less than $10 million  maybe even just a few million dollars with a high flight rate, which would bring down prices. He called it crazy low and ridiculously good by current space standards. Starship already has one private customer: a Japanese entrepreneur who has bought a flight around the moon and plans to take a dozen artists with him. Musk hinted there are others interested in buying trips, saying future announcements would be forthcoming. Until now, SpaceX has relied on its much smaller Falcon rockets to launch satellites, as well as astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station for NASA. Its first private flight, purchased by a billionaire, was last September. Another is coming up at the end of March, this one to the space station with three businessmen who are paying $55 million apiece. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASAs new space telescope sees 1st starlight, takes selfie","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new space telescope has captured its first starlight and even taken a selfie of its giant, gold mirror.  All 18 segments of the primary mirror on the James Webb Space Telescope seem to be working properly 1 1/2 months into the mission, officials said Friday.  The telescopes first target was a bright star 258 light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major.  That was just a real wow moment, said Marshall Perrin of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.  Over the next few months, the hexagonal mirror segments  each the size of a coffee table  will be aligned and focused as one, allowing science observations to begin by the end of June. The $10 billion infrared observatory  considered the successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope  will seek light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe nearly 14 billion years ago. It will also examine the atmospheres of alien worlds for any possible signs of life. NASA did not detect the crippling flaw in Hubbles mirror until after its 1990 launch; more than three years passed before spacewalking astronauts were able to correct the telescopes blurry vision.  While everything is looking good so far with Webb, engineers should be able to rule out any major mirror flaws by next month, Feinberg said.  Webbs 21-foot (6.5-meter), gold-plated mirror is the largest ever launched into space. An infrared camera on the telescope snapped a picture of the mirror as one segment gazed upon the targeted star.  
        
     Pretty much the reaction was Holy Cow!, Feinberg said.  NASA released the selfie, along with a mosaic of starlight from each of the mirror segments. The 18 points of starlight resemble bright fireflies flitting against a black night sky.  After 20 years with the project, it is just unbelievably satisfying to see everything working so well so far, said the University of Arizonas Marcia Rieke, principal scientist for the infrared camera. Webb blasted off from South America in December and reached its designated perch 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away last month. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX launch delayed due to astronaut minor medical issue,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A medical issue has sidelined one of four astronauts assigned to SpaceXs upcoming flight to the International Space Station and delayed the launch, officials said Monday.  NASA said the launch is now off until Saturday night at the earliest. Liftoff had been scheduled for this past Sunday, but bad weather offshore bumped it to Wednesday. Its the first time in decades that a U.S. flight has been delayed by a crew members health. Officials would not say which astronaut is affected. They described it as a minor medical issue and said it is unrelated to COVID-19. The one German and three U.S. astronauts  who range in age from 34 to 61  have been quarantined for two weeks as usual before a spaceflight. Once on their way, Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron and the European Space Agencys Matthias Maurer will move into the space station for six months, replacing four astronauts who have been living up there since April. NASA prefers launching the new crew before bringing back the old one so they can have a face-to-face handover, but is considering all options in light of the latest delay. In 1990, a shuttle launch was delayed when the flights commander came down with a cold. And in 1970, an astronaut was yanked from Apollo 13 shortly before launch after being exposed to German measles. He never came down with measles, and later joined the herculean effort in Houston to save his colleagues from their aborted moon mission.  More recently, two Russian cosmonauts were replaced a couple months before their 2020 launch to the space station, after one of them suffered an eye injury. 
        
     Earlier Monday afternoon, Maurer tweeted a photo of himself on the beach at Kennedy Space Center, holding a large garbage bag. Ive been relaxing during my quarantine by collecting rubbish on the beach, he wrote. Sadly, this is not the only bag I filled. We really need to think about our environmental impact on Earth and in space. Clean oceans, clean space!

Ordinary people suffer most': China farms face climate woes,"JIAOZUO, China (AP)  Wang Yuetangs sneakers sink into the mud of what was once his thriving corn and peanut farm as he surveys the damage done by an unstable climate.  Three months after torrential rains flooded much of central Chinas Henan province, stretches of the countrys flat agricultural heartland are still submerged in several inches of water. Its one of the many calamities around the world that are giving urgency to the U.N. climate summit underway in Glasgow, Scotland. There is nothing this year. Its all gone, Wang said. Farmers on the lowland basically have no harvest, nothing. He lost his summer crop to floods, and in late October the ground was still too wet to plant the next seasons crop, winter wheat.  On other nearby farms, shriveled beanstalks and rotted cabbage heads bob in the dank water, buzzing with flies. Some of the corn ears can be salvaged, but because the husks are moldy, they can be sold only as animal feed, bringing lower prices.  The flooding disaster is the worst that farmers in Henan like Wang can remember in 40 years  but it is also a preview of the kind of extreme conditions the country is likely to face as the planet warms and the weather patterns growers depend upon are increasingly destabilized. As the atmosphere warms up, air can hold more moisture, so when storms occur, they can rain out more extreme precipitation, said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at Columbia University. Chances are extremely likely that human-induced climate change caused the extreme flooding you saw this summer in places like China and Europe. 
        
     China, the most populous country in the world, with 1.4 billion people, is now the planets largest contributor to climate change, responsible for around 28% of carbon dioxide emissions that warm the Earth, though the United States is the biggest polluter historically. As world leaders take part this week in the climate summit, China is being criticized for not setting a more ambitious timeline for phasing out fossil fuels. President Xi Jinping, who has not left China since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and will not be attending the summit but sent a veteran negotiator, has said the countrys carbon emissions will level off before 2030. Critics say thats  not soon enough. Chinese government projections paint a worrying vision of the future: rising sea levels threatening major coastal cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and melting glaciers and permafrost imperiling western Chinas water supply and grand infrastructure projects such as the  railroads across the Tibetan plateau. Top government scientists also predict an increase in droughts, heat waves and extreme rainfall across China that could threaten harvests and endanger reservoirs and dams, including Three Gorges Dam. Meanwhile, Chinas people are already suffering the brunt of climate change. And in a common pattern around the world, those who have contributed least to the warming and have the fewest resources to adapt often feel the pain most acutely. In late July, Chinese news broadcasts carried startling footage of torrential rains swamping Henans provincial capital, Zhengzhou  at one point, 8 inches (20 centimeters) fell in a single hour  with cars swept away, subways flooded and people struggling through waist-deep water. More than 300 people died  as the megacity turned into an accidental Venice, its highways transformed into muddy canals. Even after the most dramatic storms ceased, the water continued to pool in much of the surrounding countryside, a flat and fertile region. Here the economy depends on corn, wheat and vegetables, and other regions of China depend on Henan for food. The local government reported that nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of farmland were flooded  an area about the size of Connecticut  with damage totaling $18 billion. All I could do at the time was to watch the heavens cry, cry and cry every day, said Wang, the peanut farmer. A limited number of rudimentary pumps were shared among farmers in Henan. Soft plastic tubes were stretched across fields to drain water, but they periodically burst, sending farmers running to patch holes. A 58-year-old farmer who gave only her last name, Song, said everything she owned was submerged by the floods  her home, furniture, fields, farming equipment. Nothing was harvested. This year, the common people have been suffering all year long, she said. Ordinary people suffer most. We have been working so hard, breaking our backs  without even a penny back, my heart aches, said Hou Beibei, a farmer whose simple vegetable greenhouses  plastic tarps covering plots of eggplant, garlic and celery  remain flooded, her hard work washed away.  She is worried about her two young children. The tuition fees of the children and the living expenses of the whole family rely on this land, she said.  The summer also saw another climate-linked natural disaster in China. In July, the hottest month on Earth in 142 years of record-keeping, according to U.S. weather experts, a vast and toxic blue-green algae bloom spanning 675 square miles (1,748 square kilometers) engulfed coastal waters off the prosperous city of Qingdao, threatening navigation, fishing and tourism. State broadcasts carried footage of people using dump trucks to remove the mounds of algae. Another threat to Chinas coastal provinces is sea level rise. Government records show that coastal water levels have already risen around 4.8 inches (122 millimeters) between 1980 and 2017 and project that within the next 30 years, waters could rise an additional 2.8 to 6.3 inches (70 to 160 millimeters). Because Chinas coastal areas are largely flat, a slight rise in the sea level will aggravate the flooding of a large area of land, erasing expensive waterfront properties and critical habitats, a government report projects.  I think these impacts are triggering a national awakening. I think people are increasingly asking, Why have extreme weather events like this happened? What are the root causes? said Li Shuo, a climate policy expert at Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing.  I think this is bringing the Chinese policymakers and the general public to a realization that we are indeed in a climate emergency.  ___ AP researcher Chen Si contributed research from Shanghai.  ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Search for life on other worlds tops astronomy to-do list,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A U.S. survey of astronomers puts the search for extraterrestrial life at the top of their to-do list for the next 10 years. In a report issued Thursday by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, astronomers stressed the need to continue the hunt for potentially habitable planets circling other stars, building on the extraordinary progress already made. The ultimate goal, they noted, is to capture pictures of any Earth-like worlds that might be out there. Life on Earth may be the result of a common process, or it may require such an unusual set of circumstances that we are the only living beings within our part of the galaxy, or even in the universe. Either answer is profound, the report stated.  The coming decades will set humanity down a path to determine whether we are alone. Also ranked high: exploring the origins and evolution of black holes, neutron stars, galaxies and the entire universe.  At the same time, the 614-page report stressed the need for greater diversity among astronomys ranks  still predominantly male  and suggested that NASA consider a science teams diversity when doling out money for research or projects. The survey is done every 10 years and draws input from scores of mostly U.S.-based scientists. The latest report recommends that NASA create a new office to oversee space observatories and overlapping missions in the coming decades. First up should be a telescope thats significantly bigger than the Hubble Space Telescope that would be capable of spotting planets that are 10 billion times fainter than their stars, the report stated. Once the necessary technologies are ready, this telescope could be ready to launch in the 2040s for around $11 billion, followed by other mega observatories in the billions of dollars. 
        
     But the report emphasized the need for smaller, more modest missions as well. Launching one spacecraft per decade with a cost cap of $1.5 billion, it stated, balances science with timeliness. The report noted the threat in years past of cost overruns and delays in major projects. Due to finally blast off next month, the NASA-led James Webb Space Telescope  designed to scan the early universe and explore the atmospheres of other worlds  is a prime example of that. Yet its launch promises to be a momentous occasion that will shape the course of astronomy and astrophysics in the coming decades, the report noted. The report  sponsored by NASA, National Science Foundation, Energy Department and Air Force  noted that the survey was conducted during a health crisis. While the pandemic has underscored the importance of science, the ultimate economic and social impacts of the pandemic remain unclear, adding to the uncertainty of the future landscape. The report urged NASA, the National Science Foundation and Energy Department to treat harassment and discrimination as forms of scientific misconduct, add more diversity to its upper levels, and consider diversity when funding a project. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX crew launch bumped to next week; astronaut on mend,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs next crew flight is off until at least next week, as NASA debates whether to bring astronauts back from the International Space Station before launching their replacements.  Flight surgeons, meanwhile, are continuing to monitor the minor medical issue affecting one of four astronauts awaiting liftoff at NASAs Kennedy Space Center.  NASA said Thursday that the astronaut  whom theyre not identifying  should be fine before a possible launch attempt on Monday. But NASA may opt to first bring home the four astronauts living at the space station since April. The soonest they would return in their SpaceX capsule is Sunday; that would further postpone the next crew launch.  The weather in November can be especially challenging, so our goal is to move forward on the plan with the highest probability of mission assurance and crew safety, NASAs commercial crew program manager, Steve Stich, said in a statement. The U.S.-German crew should have rocketed to the space station last weekend, but poor weather along the flight path pushed the flight to Wednesday. But then one of the astronauts was sidelined for undisclosed medical reasons, and the launch was bumped to this weekend. But with more bad weather anticipated, SpaceX and NASA called it quits until next week.  NASA said managers will make a final decision soon on whether to prioritize the launch or splashdown, based on weather. Theyre also reviewing how many days would be needed between the two events. 
        
     Also factoring into the equation is the amount of time a SpaceX capsule can remain in orbit before its systems are degraded. The companys Dragon capsules are designed to spend 210 days aloft; the one up there now logged day 195 on Thursday. Additional analysis could extend the acceptable amount of time, according to NASA. If the four astronauts come home first, the station will remain occupied by an American and two Russians. ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"No toilet for returning SpaceX crew, stuck using diapers","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The astronauts who will depart the International Space Station on Sunday will be stuck using diapers on the way home because of their capsules broken toilet. NASA astronaut Megan McArthur described the situation Friday as suboptimal but manageable. She and her three crewmates will spend 20 hours in their SpaceX capsule, from the time the hatches are closed until Monday mornings planned splashdown.  Spaceflight is full of lots of little challenges, she said during a news conference from orbit. This is just one more that well encounter and take care of in our mission. So were not too worried about it.  After a series of meetings Friday, mission managers decided to bring McArthur and the rest of her crew home before launching their replacements. That SpaceX launch already had been delayed more than a week by bad weather and an undisclosed medical issue involving one of the crew.  SpaceX is now targeting liftoff for Wednesday night at the earliest. French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who will return with McArthur, told reporters that the past six months have been intense up there. The astronauts conducted a series of spacewalks to upgrade the stations power grid, endured inadvertent thruster firings by docked Russian vehicles that sent the station into brief spins, and hosted a private Russian film crew  a space station first.  They also had to deal with the toilet leak, pulling up panels in their SpaceX capsule and discovering pools of urine. The problem was first noted during SpaceXs private flight in September, when a tube came unglued and spilled urine beneath the floorboards. SpaceX fixed the toilet on the capsule awaiting liftoff, but deemed the one in orbit unusable.  
        
     Engineers determined that the capsule had not been structurally compromised by the urine and was safe for the ride back. The astronauts will have to rely on what NASA describes as absorbent undergarments. On the culinary side, the astronauts grew the first chile peppers in space  a nice moral boost, according to McArthur. They got to sample their harvest in the past week, adding pieces of the green and red peppers to tacos. They have a nice spiciness to them, a little bit of a lingering burn, she said. Some found that more troublesome than others.  Also returning with McArthur and Pesquet: NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide. SpaceX launched them to the space station on April 23. Their capsule is certified for a maximum 210 days in space, and with Friday marking their 196th day aloft, NASA is eager to get them back as soon as possible. One American and two Russians will remain on the space station following their departure. While it would be better if their replacements arrived first  in order to share tips on living in space  Kimbrough said the remaining NASA astronaut will fill in the newcomers. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Restoring Mexicos mangroves can shield shores, store carbon","PROGRESO, Mexico (AP)  When a rotten egg smell rises from the mangrove swamps of southeast Mexico, something is going well. It means that this key coastal habitat for blunting hurricane impacts has recovered and is capturing carbon dioxide  the main ingredient of global warming. While world leaders seek ways to stop the climate crisis at a United Nations conference in Scotland this month, one front in the battle to save the planets mangroves is thousands of miles (kilometers) away on Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula. Decades ago, mangroves lined these shores, but today there are only thin green bands of trees beside the sea, interrupted by urbanized areas and reddish segments killed by too much salt and by dead branches poking from the water.  A few dozen fishermen and women villagers have made building on whats left of the mangroves part of their lives. Their work is supported by academics and donations to environmental groups, and government funds help train villagers to organize their efforts. The first time they came to the swamp for seasonal restoration work was more than a decade ago with Jorge Alfredo Herrera, a researcher at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the Mexican Polytechnic Institute in Yucatan. He told them the mangroves needed a network of interlaced canals where fresh and salt water would mingle.  To dig them was a hard work and paid only $4 a day. Men from Chelem, a fishing village of Progreso, turned down the job but a group of women took it on, believing they could accomplish a lot with little money. 
        
     Recently, after an intense rainy season, the women worked to finish the second part of the restoration process: planting young mangroves in a swamp near this port city. Under the sun, they chuckled, remembering the time they encountered a crocodile and barely managed to run away.  Then they placed 20-inch mangrove seedlings into mounds of mud held together by mesh, creating tiny islands about a yard (meter) square. The happiest day is when our plants take, said 41-year-old Keila Vzquez, leader of the women who now are paid $15 a day and take pride in putting their grain of sand into the planets well-being. They are like our children. 
        
     GLOBAL THREAT TO MANGROVES This mangrove restoration effort is similar to others around the globe, as scientists and community groups increasingly recognize the need to protect and bring back the forests to store carbon and buffer coastlines from climate-driven extreme weather, including more intense hurricanes and storm surges. Other restorations are underway in Indonesia, which contains the worlds largest tracts of mangrove habitat, Colombia and elsewhere.  Mangroves represent a very important ecosystem to fight climate change, said Octavio Aburto, a marine biologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California.  While the tropical trees only grow on less than 1% of the Earths land, he said, on a per-hectare basis, mangroves are the ecosystem that sequesters the most carbon ... They can bury around five times more carbon in the sediment than a tropical rain forest. Yet around the globe, mangroves are threatened. From 1980 to 2005, 20% to 35% of the worlds mangrove forests were  lost, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.  From 2000 to 2016, the rate of loss declined as governments and environmental groups spotlighted the problem, but destruction continued  and about 2% of the worlds remaining mangrove forests disappeared, according to NASA satellite imagery.  In Mexico, as in much of the world, the largest threat to mangroves is development. The region near Cancun lost most of its historic mangroves to highways and hotels starting in the 1980s. Tracts of mangroves on the countrys southern Pacific coast also have been cleared to make room for shrimp farming, while oil exploration and drilling in shallow waters off the Gulf of Mexico threatens mangroves there, said Aburto.  Mexico began to protect some of its mangroves only after the excessive tourism development of the 1980s. And although Mexico took steps to establish a climate action plan in 1998 and was one of the first developing countries to make voluntary commitments under the Paris Climate Accord, its commitment to the environment began to backslide in 2015, said Julia Carabias, a professor on the science faculty at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.  In the past six years, Mexico has cut resources for environmental conservation by 60%, according to Carabias.  And that, combined with increasing government support of fossil fuel energy and ongoing infrastructure and tourist projects in the region, is sounding alarms. Despite the countrys monitoring system, local researchers say that for every hectare (2.5 acres) of mangrove restored in southeast Mexico, 10 hectares are degraded or lost. EFFORTS TO SAVE SWAMPS The halting efforts in Mexico to protect and restore mangroves, even as more are lost, mirror situations elsewhere. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Agency estimated in 2007 that 40% of Indonesias mangroves had been cut down for aquaculture projects and coastal development in the previous three decades.  But there have been restoration efforts as well. In 2020, the Indonesia government set an ambitious target of planting mangroves on 600,000 hectares (1.5 million acres) of degrading coastline by 2024. Key ministries are involved in restoration efforts that include community outreach and education.  Yet there have been some setbacks. Precise mapping and data on mangroves is hard to come by, making it difficult for agencies to know where to concentrate. Newly planted mangroves have been swept out to sea by strong tides and waves. Community outreach and education have been slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Mexico, successes exist, even if they are slow in coming. Manuel Gonzlez, a 57-year-old fisherman known as Bech, proudly shows off recovering mangroves in the seaside community of Dzilam de Bravo, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Progreso. He walks through mud, avoiding the interlaced mangrove roots that burrow into it. Some trees are already 30 feet (9 meters) tall.  In 2002, Hurricane Isidoro devastated this area, but after a decade of work, 120 hectares (297 acres) have been restored. The fisherman says that now storms dont hit the community as hard. And the fish, migratory birds, deer, crocodiles and even jaguars have returned. But the mangroves face a new risk, as stumps scattered among the trees attest.  In 10 years, you have a very nice mangrove for someone with a chainsaw to come and take it, Gonzlez said. Thats something that hurts me a lot.  Cutting mangroves has been a crime since 2005, but Gonzlez says authorities shut down and fine projects, only to have them later reopen.  The Yucatan state government said it is aware of complaints of illegal logging yet the harvest has only grown. While more funds are needed for protection and restoration, some communities prefer to think about how to make conservation a profitable activity. Jos Ins Lora, head of operations at San Crisanto, an old salt harvesting community of about 500 between Progreso and Dzilam, thinks the way to make the local mangrove part of the communitys business model is using the new financial tools such as blue carbon credits. Those instruments, already in use in Colombia and other countries, allow polluting businesses to compensate for emissions by paying others to store or sequester greenhouse gases.  Some in Mexico say credits are still not well regulated in the country and could invite fraud and scams. But Loria defends them. If conservation doesnt mean improving the quality of life of a community, it doesnt work.  ___ Larson reported from Washington, D.C.; Milko reported from Jakarta. ___ On Twitter follow Maria Verza: @verzamex; Christina Larson: @larsonchristina, and Victoria Milko: @thevmilko ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

High wind delays SpaceX crew homecoming after 6 months aloft,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  High wind off the Florida coast has prompted SpaceX to delay the return of four space station astronauts in orbit since spring.  The U.S., French and Japanese astronauts were supposed to leave the International Space Station on Sunday, with their capsule splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico on Monday morning. But with gusts exceeding safety limits, SpaceX bumped the departure to Monday afternoon, with a nighttime return to conclude their six-month mission. The good news is that their trip home will now last eight hours, less than half as long as before. The toilet in their capsule is broken, and so the four will need to rely on diapers while flying home. SpaceX still is aiming for a Wednesday night launch, at the earliest, of their replacements. This flight also has been delayed by bad weather, as well as an astronauts undisclosed medical issue. The issue, described as minor, should be resolved by launch time, officials said. Last week, SpaceX and NASA flipped the order of the launch and landing because of the deteriorating weather and the looming deadline to get the capsule back from the space station. SpaceX capsules are certified for a maximum 210 days in orbit, and the one up there now is approaching 200 days. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX returns 4 astronauts to Earth, ending 200-day flight","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four astronauts returned to Earth on Monday, riding home with SpaceX to end a 200-day space station mission that began last spring. Their capsule streaked through the late night sky like a dazzling meteor before parachuting into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida. Recovery boats quickly moved in with spotlights. On behalf of SpaceX, welcome home to Planet Earth, SpaceX Mission Control radioed from Southern California. Within an hour, all four astronauts were out of the capsule, exchanging fist bumps with the team on the recovery ship. Their homecoming  coming just eight hours after leaving the International Space Station  paved the way for SpaceXs launch of their four replacements as early as Wednesday night.  The newcomers were scheduled to launch first, but NASA switched the order because of bad weather and an astronauts undisclosed medical condition. The welcoming duties will now fall to the lone American and two Russians left behind at the space station. Before Monday afternoons undocking, German astronaut Matthias Maurer, whos waiting to launch at NASAs Kennedy Space Center, tweeted it was a shame the two crews wouldnt overlap at the space station but we trust youll leave everything nice and tidy. His will be SpaceXs fourth crew flight for NASA in just 1 1/2 years. NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japans Akihiko Hoshide and Frances Thomas Pesquet should have been back Monday morning, but high wind in the recovery zone delayed their return.  
        
     One more night with this magical view. Who could complain? Ill miss our spaceship! Pesquet tweeted Sunday alongside a brief video showing the space station illuminated against the blackness of space and the twinkling city lights on the nighttime side of Earth. From the space station, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei -- midway through a one-year flight -- bid farewell to each of his departing friends, telling McArthur Ill miss hearing your laughter in adjacent modules. Before leaving the neighborhood, the four took a spin around the space station, taking pictures. This was a first for SpaceX; NASAs shuttles used to do it all the time before their retirement a decade ago. The last Russian capsule fly-around was three years ago. It wasnt the most comfortable ride back. The toilet in their capsule was broken, and so the astronauts needed to rely on diapers for the eight-hour trip home. They shrugged it off late last week as just one more challenge in their mission. The first issue arose shortly after their April liftoff; Mission Control warned a piece of space junk was threatening to collide with their capsule. It turned out to be a false alarm. Then in July, thrusters on a newly arrived Russian lab inadvertently fired and sent the station into a spin. The four astronauts took shelter in their docked SpaceX capsule, ready to make a hasty departure if necessary. Among the upbeat milestones: four spacewalks to enhance the stations solar power, a movie-making visit by a Russian film crew and the first-ever space harvest of chile peppers. The next crew will also spend six months up there, welcoming back-to-back groups of tourists. A Japanese tycoon and his personal assistant will get a lift from the Russian Space Agency in December, followed by three businessmen arriving via SpaceX in February. SpaceXs first privately chartered flight, in September, bypassed the space station. NASAs Kathy Lueders, head of space operations, said engineers would evaluate the lagging inflation of one of the four main parachutes, something seen in testing when the lines bunch together. Overall, though, the return looked spotless. I cant tell you how excited I am to see all four of the crew members back on Earth, she added, and Im looking forward to launching another set of four this week. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA bumps astronaut moon landing to 2025 at earliest,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA on Tuesday delayed putting astronauts back on the moon until 2025 at the earliest, missing the deadline set by the Trump administration.  The space agency had been aiming for 2024 for the first moon landing by astronauts in a half-century. In announcing the delay, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Congress did not provide enough money to develop a landing system for its Artemis moon program and more money is needed for its Orion capsule. In addition, a legal challenge by Jeff Bezos rocket company, Blue Origin, stalled work for months on the Starship lunar landing system under development by Elon Musks SpaceX.  Officials said technology for new spacesuits also needs to ramp up, before astronauts can return to the moon. NASA is still targeting next February for the first test flight of its moon rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS, with an Orion capsule. No one will be on board. Instead, astronauts will strap in for the second Artemis flight, flying beyond the moon but not landing in 2024, a year later than planned. That would bump the moon landing to at least 2025, according to Nelson. The human landing system is a crucial part of our work to get the first woman and the first person of color to the lunar surface, and we are getting geared up to go, Nelson told reporters. NASA is committed to help restore Americas standing in the world. Nelson made note of Chinas ambitious and aggressive space program, and warned it could overtake the U.S. in lunar exploration. 
        
     NASAs last moon landing by astronauts occurred during Apollo 17 in 1972. Altogether, 12 men explored the lunar surface. During a National Space Council meeting in 2019, Vice President Mike Pence called for landing astronauts on the moon within five years by any means necessary. NASA had been shooting for a lunar landing in 2028, and pushing it up by four years was considered at the time exceedingly ambitious, if not improbable.  Congress will need to increase funding, beginning with the 2023 budget, in order for NASA to have private companies competing for the planned 10 or more moon landings by astronauts, Nelson said.  The space agency also is requesting a bigger budget for its Orion capsules, from $6.7 billion to $9.3 billion, citing delays during the coronavirus pandemic and storm damage to NASAs Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, the main manufacturing site for SLS and Orion. Development costs for the rocket through the first Artemis flight next year stand at $11 billion. Vice President Kamala Harris will convene her first National Space Council meeting, as its chair, on Dec. 1. Nelson said he updated her on the latest schedule and costs during their visit to Marylands Goddard Space Flight Center on Friday. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

AP analysis: Exposure to extreme heat has tripled since 1983,"World leaders have committed to limiting Earths rising temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.  But what does that feel like?     
        
     Its difficult to convey, because you may not notice changes in average temperature. But, depending on where you live, you might notice when its extremely hot. To better understand the issue, Columbia Universitys climate school recently published a global dataset with estimates of both population and temperature. The Associated Press analyzed the data  spanning 1983 to 2016  and found that exposure to extreme heat has tripled and now affects about a quarter of the worlds population. HOW HEAT IS MEASURED As the global average temperature rises, so do the hottest daily temperatures. And, in some places, the hottest days can be dangerous to human health, causing heat stress.  Heat stress can create a host of health problems, including rashes, cramps and heat stroke. Hot air is not the only risk factor for it. Other factors include humidity, wind speed and the amount of shade. You may be familiar with the heat index, which takes into consideration temperature and humidity to suggest what it feels like in the shade on a hot day. But even the heat index doesnt tell you what its like to be working in the full sun on an extremely hot windless day. Increasingly, climate scientists and meteorologists are advocating for the use of a different metric for understanding extreme heat. Its called wet-bulb globe temperature  and it takes into account temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover. 
        
     The new dataset uses estimates of both population and wet-bulb globe temperature to better understand how many people are affected by dangerously hot temperatures and where they live.  When the wet-bulb globe temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), people are advised to start taking rests if theyre working outdoors. HEAT EXPOSURE IS RISING To match heat measures with population estimates, the researchers averaged temperature data over 13,115 urban centers identified in a dataset produced by the European Union. Out of those urban centers around the world, nearly half experienced an increasing trend in heat exposure. In 2016, just under 1.7 billion people lived in those areas, with the majority in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The most affected region, by far, was southern Asia, where India alone accounted for 37% of the population living in areas with an increasing extreme heat trend. With population growth from 1983 to 2016 for each city and estimates for the year-to-year increase in annual counts of dangerously hot days, the AP was able to identify the cities in the world where exposure to extreme heat is increasing most. NOTABLE HEAT EXPOSURE INCREASES In Dhaka, Bangladesh, the population more than tripled from about 7.7 million in 1983 to 24 million in 2016. While the city grew by more than 16 million people, the number of extreme heat days also increased by 1.5 days a year, until Dhaka experienced about 50 more dangerously hot days a year than it did in 1983.  This large population growth, along with the warming trend for the area, reveals that Dhaka had the biggest increase in heat exposure in the world. Population growth and increasing temperature both contribute to exposure trends. In some cases, these have an equal effect. That was the case in Kolkata, India, where the population grew by 6 million people and the number of hot days grew by 1.76 each year. Both of these increases contributed to a steep exposure trend. Meanwhile, New Delhi added nearly 14 million people. While the city added 1.12 additional hot days each year, the population increase is what made Delhis exposure trend the steepest in India. INDONESIAS CAPITAL This dataset focuses on the past, but could help world leaders make more informed decisions in the future. Indonesia is planning to move the countrys capital from Jakarta  a city that is sinking below sea level  to Kalimantan. The development site is in an area of jungle between two cities, Samarinda and Balikpapan. Both cities have increasing heat exposure trends. People in Balikpapan, located at the mouth of the Bakpapan Bay, could expect 10 more days of extreme heat in 2016 compared with 1983. Samarinda, situated on the humid Mahakam River delta, could expect 19 more days. Jakarta, although sinking, did not register a significant increasing exposure trend in the dataset.  AFRICAS GROWING CITIES Many cities that already experience extreme heat are growing rapidly. Douala, Cameroon, grew from roughly 760,000 people in 1983 to nearly 3 million in 2016. United Nations population projections suggest that count will double by 2035. Doualas citizens endured 76 days of extreme heat in 2016. Douala is representative of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. According to the 2019 U.N. World Population Prospects, most of the worlds population growth will come from this region in the coming years, and its growing rapidly at a time when warming trends are increasing in cities across the area. Whether world leaders are able to limit the rise in the global average temperature, people in this part of the world will likely feel the difference in the resulting heat exposure most.  Dim Coumou, a climate professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said the combination of growth in African cities and climate change presents a serious risk.  As the population increases in these megacities, you have more buildings, more concrete and an increased heat-island effect, making the heat waves worse, Coumou said. I think its a dangerous combination. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX crew launch marks 600 space travelers in 60 years,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX rocket carried four astronauts into orbit Wednesday night, including the 600th person to reach space in 60 years.  The repeatedly delayed flight occurred just two days after SpaceX brought four other astronauts home from the International Space Station. They should have been up there to welcome the newcomers, but NASA and SpaceX decided to switch the order based on Mondays ideal recovery weather in the Gulf of Mexico and pulled it off. It was a great ride, better than we imagined, mission commander Raja Chari said shortly after the spacecraft reached orbit.  The launch was just as riveting for spectators at NASAs Kennedy Space Center, as well as along the East Coast, as the Falcon rocket thundered through clouds on its way to space, turning night into day. Germanys Matthias Maurer claimed the No. 600 position, according to NASA, based on his mission assignment. He and his three NASA crewmates should arrive at the space station in under 24 hours, well over a week late. One of the astronauts  NASA isnt saying which one  was sidelined last week by an undisclosed medical issue. The crew member is fully recovered, according to NASA. Officials wont say whether it was an illness or injury, but noted it wasnt COVID-19. Bad weather also contributed to their flight delays. Chari said trying to launch on Halloween left them with a trick instead of a treat. It was also drizzling Wednesday night when the four astronauts said goodbye to their families for six months  with everyone huddling under umbrellas  but it cleared up by launch time. 
        
     Enjoy your holidays among the stars. Well be waving as you fly by, SpaceX launch director Mark Soltys radioed to the crew. The list of 600 travelers ranges from those who have barely scratched space  like actor William Shatner last month  to U.S. and Russian astronauts who have spent a year or more in orbit. This years surge in space tourists helped push the tally over the 600 mark. That averages out to 10 people per year since Yuri Gagarins pioneering flight in 1961, Maurer noted. But I think in a very few years, we will see an exponential rise of that one because now were entering the era of commercial spaceflight, he said after arriving at Kennedy Space Center two weeks ago. The crew launch marked SpaceXs fourth for NASA and the companys fifth passenger flight overall  including a September charter flight for four that skipped the space station. The Dragon capsules toilet leaked during their three days in orbit, necessitating a quick redesign of the flushing system in the newest capsule, named Endurance by its crew. A balky parachute during Mondays descent had SpaceX engineers poring over the data, before giving the go-ahead for Wednesdays launch. One of the four chutes opened more than a minute late, a problem seen in testing and well within safety limits, but still being examined, officials said. As of Wednesday, Elon Musks company has launched 18 people in 18 months. Human spaceflight was the reason we were founded, so its incredibly meaningful for the whole team, said Sarah Walker, a SpaceX manager. The European Space Agencys Mauer is one of three newbies on the crew. The 51-year-old was a finalist when he first applied to be an astronaut. Encouraged, he left his research job at a medical company and joined the space agency as an engineer, and made the astronaut cut in 2015. Chari, 44, is an Air Force colonel and the first space rookie in decades to lead a mission to orbit for NASA. A test pilot from Cedar Falls, Iowa, Chari accumulated more than 2,500 hours in fighter jets, including combat missions in Iraq. Also on board:  Dr. Thomas Marshburn, 61, will be the oldest person to live aboard the space station and perform a spacewalk. Born in Statesville, North Carolina, he pursued a career in emergency medicine, then joined NASA in 1994 as a flight surgeon. This is his third trip to the space station.  Kayla Barron, 34, a Navy lieutenant commander from Richland, Washington. She was among the first women to serve as submarine warfare officers. Added to the flight in May, shes No. 601 in space. During their station stay, they will welcome two groups of tourists. A Russian film crew recently spent two weeks at the station, making a movie. The new crew will be joining three station residents  two Russians and NASAs Mark Vande Hei, who celebrated his 55th birthday on Wednesday. NASA and @SpaceX are lighting a big candle in the sky for you tonight, NASA tweeted before the launch. That candle  the first-stage booster  landed upright on an ocean barge. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX delivers new crew of 4 to station, glorious sight","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts pulled up Thursday at the International Space Station, their new home until spring.  It took 21 hours for the flight from NASAs Kennedy Space Center to the glittering outpost. The one German and three U.S. astronauts said it was an emotional moment when they first spotted the space station 20 miles (30 kilometers) distant  a pretty glorious sight, according to Raja Chari, commander of the Dragon capsule. Floating in space and shining like a diamond, noted German astronaut Matthias Maurer. Were all very thrilled, very excited. The Dragons entire flight was automated, with Chari and pilot Tom Marshburn monitoring the capsule systems, ready to take control if necessary. At one point, they reported what looked like a gnarled knob or possibly a small mechanical nut floating past their cameras field of view, but SpaceX Mission Control said it posed no concern. The docking occurred 263 miles (423 kilometers) above the eastern Caribbean. The stations welcoming committee consisted of three astronauts instead of the originally planned seven. Thats because SpaceX returned four of the station residents on Monday, after the new arrivals launch kept getting delayed. I cant tell you how happy I am to see these smiling faces, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei said after embracing each of the newcomers. Every one of us, all seven of us, are friends, and were going to become even better friends as time goes on. 
        
     Vande Hei and one of the two Russians on board are midway through a one-year mission that wont end until March. While Chari, Marshburn, Maurer and NASA astronaut Kayla Barron were adapting to weightlessness  all but Marshburn are space rookies  the previous crew was adjusting to life back on Earth. Gravity sucks, but getting used to it slowly, Japanese astronaut Akihoki Hoshide tweeted. The new crew will spend the next six months at the space station and, during that time, host two groups of visiting tourists. Russia will launch the first bunch in December and SpaceX the second in February. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Russian test blamed for space junk threatening space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A Russian weapons test created more than 1,500 pieces of space junk now threatening the seven astronauts aboard the International Space Station, according to U.S. officials who called the strike reckless and irresponsible. The State Department confirmed Monday that the debris was from an old Russian satellite destroyed by the missile. Needless to say, Im outraged. This is unconscionable, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told The Associated Press. Its unbelievable that the Russian government would do this test and threaten not only international astronauts, but their own cosmonauts that are on board the station as well as the three people on Chinas space station. Nelson said the astronauts now face four times greater risk than normal. And thats based on debris big enough to track, with hundreds of thousands of smaller pieces going undetected  any one of which can do enormous damage if it hits in the right place. In condemning Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said satellites were also now in jeopardy.  The test clearly demonstrates that Russia despite its claims of opposing the weaponization of outer space, is willing to ... imperil the exploration and use of outer space by all nations through its reckless and irresponsible behavior, Blinken said in a statement. There was no immediate comment late Monday from Russia about the missile strike.  
        
     Once the threat became clear early Monday morning, the four Americans, one German and two Russians on board were ordered to immediately seek shelter in their docked capsules. They spent two hours in the two capsules, finally emerging only to have to close and reopen hatches to the stations individuals labs on every orbit, or 1 1/2 hours, as they passed near or through the debris.  By the end of the day, only the hatches to the central core of the station remained open, as the crew slept, according to Nelson. Even a fleck of paint can do major damage when orbiting at 17,500 mph (28,000 kph). Something big, upon impact, could be catastrophic. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. has repeatedly raised concerns with Russia about doing a satellite test. We are going to continue to make very clear that we wont tolerate this kind of activity, he told reporters. NASA Mission Control said the heightened threat could continue to interrupt the astronauts science research and other work. Four of the seven crew members arrived at the orbiting outpost Thursday night. NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, whos midway through a yearlong mission, called it a crazy but well-coordinated day as he bid Mission Control good night. It was certainly a great way to bond as a crew, starting off with our very first work day in space, he said. A similar weapons test by China in 2007 also resulted in countless debris. One of those pieces threatened to come dangerously close to the space station last week. While it later was dismissed as a risk, NASA had the station move anyway. Anti-satellite missile tests by the U.S. in 2008 and India in 2019 were conducted at much lower altitudes, well below the space station at about 260 miles (420 kilometers.) The defunct Russian satellite Cosmos 1408 was orbiting about 40 miles (65 kilometers) higher.  Until Monday, the U.S. Space Command already was tracking some 20,000 pieces of space junk, including old and broken satellites from around the world.  Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said it will take days if not weeks and months to catalogue the latest wreckage and confirm their orbits. The fragments will begin to spread out over time, due to atmospheric drag and other forces, he said in an email. The space station is at especially high risk because the test occurred near its orbit, McDowell said. But all objects in low-Earth orbit  including Chinas space station and even the Hubble Space Telescope  will be at somewhat enhanced risk over the next few years, he noted. Earlier in the day, the Russian Space Agency said via Twitter that the astronauts were ordered into their docked capsules, in case they had to make a quick getaway. The agency said the crew was back doing routine operations, and the space stations commander, Russian Anton Shkaplerov, tweeted: Friends, everything is regular with us! But the cloud of debris posed a threat on each passing orbit  or every 1 1/2 hours  and all robotic activity on the U.S. side was put on hold. German astronaut Matthias Maurer also had to find a safer place to sleep than the European lab. NASAs Nelson noted that the Russians and Americans have had a space partnership for a half-century  going back to the joint Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975.  I dont want it to be threatened, he told the AP, noting both countries are needed for the space station. Youve got to operate it together. __ AP reporters Matthew Lee and Robert Burns in Washington contributed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

EXPLAINER: Why India has repeated air pollution problems,"WASHINGTON (AP)  New Delhi struggles with pollution year-round, but the problem becomes acute during fall and winter months. On Wednesday, the concentration of tiny pollution particles was nearly 30 times above the level deemed safe over a 24-hour period by the World Health Organization. Around the world, researchers closely track levels of airborne particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter  known as PM 2.5  because it can lodge in the lungs and other organs, causing long-term health damage. In 2020, 13 of the 15 cities with the most polluted air were in India.  In northern India, the autumn spike in air pollution relates in part to the annual burning of crop residue in fields, said Deborah Seligsohn, an Asia air pollution expert at Villanova University. Other sources of air pollution include vehicle emissions, trash burning, electricity production and heavy industry, including steelmaking and brick kilns.  It remains unclear how much of an impact a proposed  pollution lockdown "" will have on New Delhis air pollution, she said.  While the New Delhi government has already closed city schools and shown willingness to impose a broader emergency weekend lockdown  similar to the one implemented during the pandemic  it doesnt have the power to shut down traffic and industry regionally.  This lockdown would be in New Delhi, but a significant portion of Delhis air pollution doesnt come from the city itself  its a regional air shed, said Seligsohn.  
        
     Prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to increased rates of respiratory illness, cardiovascular diseases, premature births and other health concerns, said Jessica Seddon, an air pollution expert at the World Resources Institute.  While greater awareness of air pollution in India in recent years in has led to more government attention, it remains a difficult problem to solve, she said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceXs Musk: 1st Starship test flight to orbit in January,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Wednesday that his company will attempt to launch its futuristic, bullet-shaped Starship to orbit in January, but hes not betting on success for that first test flight. Theres a lot of risk associated with this first launch, so I would not say that it is likely to be successful, but well make a lot of progress, he said during a virtual meeting organized by the National Academy of Sciences.  Musk said hes confident Starship  launching for the first time atop a mega booster  will successfully reach orbit sometime in 2022. After a dozen or so orbital test flights next year, SpaceX then would start launching valuable satellites and other payloads to orbit on Starships in 2023, he said. NASA has contracted with SpaceX to use Starship for delivering astronauts to the lunar surface as early as 2025. Musk plans to use the reusable ships to eventually land people on Mars. The shiny, stainless steel Starship and its first-stage booster  called the Super Heavy  will be the biggest rocket ever to fly, towering 394 feet (120 meters). Liftoff thrust, Musk noted, will be more than double that of NASAs Saturn V rockets that carried astronauts to the moon a half-century ago.  The Super Heavy has yet to soar. But a full-scale Starship model in May flew to an altitude of more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) before successfully landing back at the SpaceX complex near Texas southernmost tip. 
        
     The Starship and Super Heavy for the first orbital test flight have both been completed, according to Musk. By the end of November, the company hopes to be finished with the launch pad and tower, with testing in December. The Federal Aviation Administration should be done by the end of the year with its review, leading to a launch in January or February at the latest, Musk noted. To date, about 90% of Starships development costs have been covered by SpaceX, according to Musk, with NASA covering the rest with its lunar lander contract. He did not say how much had been spent so far. Musk plans to build multiple Starships in the near term. He envisions needing 1,000 of them to make life truly multiplanetary, his ultimate goal.  He said something natural or manmade will eventually bring about the end of civilization  a pandemic worse than COVID-19, continually decreasing birth rates, nuclear Armageddon or perhaps a direct hit by a killer comet.

NASA: Space station remains at risk from weapons test debris,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station remains at increased risk from orbiting debris following this weeks Russian weapons test, NASA said Thursday.  On Monday, Russia launched a missile to destroy a satellite orbiting just above the space station.  NASA said late Wednesday that the highest threat to the station and its seven residents was in the first 24 hours. Hatches between many of the station compartments were closed as a precaution, but they were reopened Wednesday.  The U.S. Space Command is tracking more than 1,500 satellite fragments, but hundreds of thousands of pieces are too small to see. NASA and the State Department have condemned the missile strike, saying it also puts satellites and Chinas space station at risk. NASA said its reviewing an upcoming spacewalk and other station operations, to assess the risks before proceeding. The spacewalk to replace a bad antenna is targeted for Nov. 30. The space agency also plans continued inspections for potential damage. The space station currently is home to four Americans, two Russians and one German. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Space junk forces spacewalk delay, too risky for astronauts","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA called off a spacewalk Tuesday because of menacing space junk that could puncture an astronauts suit or damage the International Space Station. Two U.S. astronauts were set to replace a bad antenna outside of the space station. But late Monday night, Mission Control learned that a piece of orbiting debris might come dangerously close. There wasnt enough time to assess the threat so station managers delayed the spacewalk until Thursday. Its the first time a spacewalk has been canceled because of threat from space junk. The space station and its crew of seven have been at increased risk from space junk since Russia destroyed a satellite in a missile test two weeks ago. It wasnt immediately clear whether the object of concern was part of the Russian satellite wreckage. During a news conference Monday, NASA officials said the Nov. 15 missile test resulted in at least 1,700 satellite pieces big enough to track, and thousands more too small to be observed from the ground but still able to pierce a spacewalkers suit. NASA officials said astronauts Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron faced a 7 percent greater risk of a spacewalk puncture because of the Russian-generated debris. But they said it was still within acceptable limits based on previous experience. Marshburn and Barron arrived at the space station earlier this month. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Blue Origin launches artwork, moon-landing test into space","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Blue Origin launched artwork painted on a capsule and a moon-landing navigation experiment into space Thursday, a month after sending founder Jeff Bezos on the companys first passenger flight.  No one was aboard for Thursdays 10-minute flight, which included other experiments from NASA and others.  The paintings by Ghana artist Amoako Boafo were on three parachute panels on the outside of the capsule at the very top. Boafo painted a self-portrait as well as portraits of his mother and a friends mother, explaining a mothers love comes from a place that is out of this world, said Blue Origin launch commentator Kiah Erlich, a company official. Schoolchildren from Ghana tuned into the launch webcast, according to Blue Origin. The Utah-based Uplift Aerospace Inc. commissioned Boafos work, Suborbital Triptych, as part of its new art-in-space program. The New Shepard rocket blasted off from West Texas on Blue Origins 17th trip to space. The booster landed upright several minutes after liftoff. The fully automated capsule continued to an altitude of 66 miles (105 kilometers) before parachuting down nearby. The paintings were on triangular-shaped panels a few feet in size and detached from the capsule when the parachutes were deployed. A company spokeswoman said they would be recovered from the desert floor. On July 20, Blue Origin used another rocket and capsule to launch Amazon founder Bezos, his brother and two others who, at ages 82 and 18, set records for the oldest and youngest in space. 
        
     Blue Origin offered no specific date Thursday for the next passenger flight, but reported nearly $100 million in ticket sales to date. The company  which is not divulging ticket prices  plans to alternate between tourist and research flights, sometimes with the scientists aboard. It was the second New Shepard flight for the lunar-landing experiment, which was mounted near the top of the booster and tested lasers and other sensors meant to ensure a pinpoint moon landing for astronauts. Also flying was equipment for turning astronauts space trash into gas for recycling into fuel or dumping overboard. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX launches ants, avocados, robot to space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX shipment of ants, avocados and a human-sized robotic arm rocketed toward the International Space Station on Sunday. The delivery  due to arrive Monday  is the companys 23rd for NASA in just under a decade. A recycled Falcon rocket blasted into the predawn sky from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. After hoisting the Dragon capsule, the first-stage booster landed upright on SpaceXs newest ocean platform, named A Shortfall of Gravitas. SpaceX founder Elon Musk continued his tradition of naming the booster-recovery vessels in tribute to the late science fiction writer Iain Banks and his Culture series. The Dragon is carrying more than 4,800 pounds (2,170 kilograms) of supplies and experiments, and fresh food including avocados, lemons and even ice cream for the space stations seven astronauts. The Girl Scouts are sending up ants, brine shrimp and plants as test subjects, while University of Wisconsin-Madison scientists are flying up seeds from mouse-ear cress, a small flowering weed used in genetic research. Samples of concrete, solar cells and other materials also will be subjected to weightlessness. A Japanese start-up companys experimental robotic arm, meanwhile, will attempt to screw items together in its orbital debut and perform other mundane chores normally done by astronauts. The first tests will be done inside the space station. Future models of Gitai Inc.'s robot will venture out into the vacuum of space to practice satellite and other repair jobs, said chief technology officer Toyotaka Kozuki. As early as 2025, a squad of these arms could help build lunar bases and mine the moon for precious resources, he added. 
        
     SpaceX had to leave some experiments behind because of delays resulting from COVID-19. It was the second launch attempt; Saturdays try was foiled by stormy weather.

Astronaut gets special ice cream delivery for 50th birthday,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A space station astronaut is celebrating her 50th birthday with the coolest present ever  a supply ship bearing ice cream and other treats. SpaceXs latest cargo delivery showed up Monday at the International Space Station after a day in transit. Overseeing the automated docking was NASA astronaut Megan McArthur. No ones ever sent me a spaceship for my birthday before. I appreciate it, she radioed after the capsule arrived. Launched Sunday from NASAs Kennedy Space Center, the capsule contains lemons, cherry tomatoes, avocados and ice cream for McArthur and her six crewmates, along with a couple tons of research and other gear. The shipment arrived just a few days ahead of the first of three spacewalks. Starting Friday, the two Russians on board will perform back-to-back spacewalks to outfit a new laboratory that arrived in July.  Then a Japanese-French spacewalking duo will venture out Sept. 12 to install a bracket for new solar panels due to arrive next year. That NASA-directed spacewalk should have occurred last week, but was postponed after U.S. spacewalker, Mark Vande Hei, suffered a pinched nerve in his neck. Station managers opted to replace him with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Birds of prey face global decline from habitat loss, poisons","WASHINGTON (AP)  Despite a few high-profile conservation success stories  like the dramatic comeback of bald eagle populations in North America  birds of prey are in decline worldwide.  A new analysis of data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and BirdLife International found that 30% of 557 raptor species worldwide are considered near threatened, vulnerable or endangered or critically endangered. Eighteen species are critically endangered, including the Philippine eagle,  the hooded vulture and the Annobon scops owl, the researchers found. Other species are in danger of becoming locally extinct in specific regions, meaning they may no longer play critical roles as top predators in those ecosystems, said Gerardo Ceballos, a bird scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and co-author of the study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The golden eagle is the national bird of Mexico, but we have very few golden eagles left in Mexico, he said. A 2016 census estimated only about 100 breeding pairs remain in the country.   Harpy eagles were once widespread throughout southern Mexico and Central and South America, but tree cutting and burning has dramatically shrunk their range. Of threatened birds of prey that are active mostly during the day  including most hawks, eagles and vultures  54% were falling in population, the study found. The same was true for 47% of threatened nocturnal raptors, such as owls. 
        
     That means the factors causing the decline have not been remedied and those species need immediate attention, said Jeff Johnson, a biologist at the University of North Texas, who was not involved in the study.  Globally, the biggest threats to these birds are habitat loss, climate change and toxic substances, said Evan Buechley, a research associate at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center and a scientist at nonprofit HawkWatch International who was not involved in the study. The insecticide DDT thinned egg shells and decimated bald eagle populations in North America, leading to its ban in the U.S. in 1972. But Buechley said other threats remain, including rodent pesticides and the lead in hunters bullets and shot pellets. Many raptors feed on rodents and dead animals. The Andean condor  is declining due to exposure to pesticides, lead and other toxic substances, said Sergio Lambertucci, a biologist at the National University of Comahue in Argentina. Widespread use of an anti-inflammatory drug in livestock led to the rapid decline of vultures in South Asia. The birds died after eating carcasses, shrinking the population of some species by 95%  in recent decades. In East Asia, many raptor species are long-distance migrants: They breed in northern China, Mongolia or Russia and travel down the eastern coast of China to spend summers in Southeast Asia or India.  Certain areas of the coast will see 30 to 40 species during peak migration, said Yang Liu, an ecologist at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, who was not involved in the study.  But eastern China is also the most populous and urban part of the country, with steep development pressures. Sites that are bottlenecks for migration, with thousands of birds passing through, are important to protect, he said. Of 4,200 sites identified by conservation groups as critical for raptor species globally, most are unprotected or only partly covered by protected areas, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International in the United Kingdom. A 2018 study in the journal Biological Conservation found that 52% of all raptor species worldwide are decreasing in population. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Once green, prehistoric Arabia drew early humans from Africa","WASHINGTON (AP)  Huw Groucutt passes rolling sand dunes as far as his eye can see when traveling to archaeological sites in the northern Arabian Peninsula. But the same desert regions were once intermittently lush and green, attracting early humans and large animals such as hippopotamuses migrating out of Africa to linger at ancient lakes, new evidence suggests. Until a decade ago, the Arabian Peninsula was a blank spot on the map for scientists trying to reconstruct the story of early human evolution and movements out of Africa. Much more is known about early human settlements in the Levant region  modern-day Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and parts of Syria  where extensive archaeological research has been carried out for more than a century.  But the Arabian Peninsula may have also played an important role as a bridge between Africa and Eurasia, a study published Wednesday in the journal  Nature  suggests.  Arabia has not been part of the story of early human migration because so little work was done there before, said co-author Michael Petraglia, a paleolithic archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. The research team included scientists from Germany, Saudi Arabia, Australia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  The impetus to look closely for archeological remains in the region came from satellite imagery that revealed traces of prehistoric lakes in now-arid regions. We noticed color patterns made by ancient lakes  sand dunes are kind of orange-colored, while ancient lakes are tinted white or gray, said Groucutt, who is also based at the Max Planck Institute.  
        
     Extensive excavations over a decade revealed stone tools from multiple periods of prehistoric settlement by early human groups, the oldest 400,000 years ago. Analysis of sediment samples from the ancient lakes and remains from hippos and other animals revealed that during several periods in the distant past, the peninsula hosted year-round lakes and grasslands.  During these windows of hospitable climate, early humans and animals moved from northeast Africa into the Arabian Peninsula, the researchers say.  Flowing rivers and lakes, surrounded by grasslands and savannah, would have attracted animals and then the early humans that were in pursuit of them, said Petraglia. Hippos require year-round water bodies several yards (meters) deep to live. Remains of other animals, including ostriches and antelopes, indicate a strong biological connection to northeast Africa, he said. What this research group has done is really exquisitely combine archaeology and climate records going back 400,000 years to show that early humans moved across this landscape when the climate changed, said paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, who directs the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. The episodic presence and absence of populations in the Arabian Peninsula was in tune with climate oscillations, said Potts, who was not involved in the new study. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

FAA bans Virgin Galactic launches while probing Branson trip,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that Virgin Galactic cannot launch anyone into space again until an investigation is complete into a mishap that occurred during Julys flight with founder Richard Branson.  The ban came as Virgin Galactic announced plans to launch three Italian researchers to the edge of space in a few weeks. The FAA said the rocketship carrying Branson and five Virgin Galactic employees veered off course during its descent back to its runway in the New Mexico desert on July 11. The deviation put the ship outside the air traffic control clearance area. The FAA is overseeing the probe; its responsible for protecting the public during commercial launches and reentries. Crew safety, on the other hand, is outside its jurisdiction. Virgin Galactic insisted Thursday that Branson and everyone else on board were never in any added danger.  Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety, the FAA said in a statement. Virgin Galactic acknowledged the space plane dropped below the protected airspace for one minute and 41 seconds. The spacecrafts free-flying portion of the up-and-down flight lasted about 15 minutes and reached an altitude of 53.5 miles (86 kilometers). 
        
     Virgin Galactic said high-altitude wind caused the change in flight path and insisted the two pilots responded appropriately. In a statement, the company said the flight was a safe and successful test flight that adhered to our flight procedures and training protocols. In another statement Thursday, Virgin Galactic added that at no time did the ship travel above any population centers or cause a hazard to the public. Virgin Galactic operates out of Spaceport America in the southern New Mexico desert. We take this seriously and are currently addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions, the company said. Branson ended up beating fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos  founder of Amazon as well as rocket company Blue Origin  into space by nine days. Bezos launched July 20 with three others from West Texas. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are vying to sell seats to tourists, scientists and anyone else looking to experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Virgin Galactics rocketship is launched from an airplane, while Blue Origins capsule is hoisted by a reusable New Shepard rocket.  Virgin Galactic is aiming for late September or early October for its next flight, with two Italian Air Force officers, an engineer for the National Research Council of Italy, Virgin Galactics chief astronaut instructor and the rocketships two pilots. It will be the companys first launch where researchers accompany their own experiments. The company plans to start flying ticket holders next year. Blue Origin has yet to announce a date for its next passenger flight, other than to say it will be soon. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA Mars rover may have snagged 1st rock sample for return,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs newest Mars rover may have successfully collected its first rock sample for return to Earth, after last months attempt came up empty. The Perseverance rovers chief engineer, Adam Steltzner, called it a perfect core sample.  Ive never been more happy to see a hole in a rock, he tweeted Thursday. But NASA later said it was awaiting more photos before declaring success although the team is confident that the sample is in the tube. A month ago, Perseverance drilled into much softer rock, and the sample crumbled and didnt get in the titanium tube. The rover drove a half-mile to a better spot to try again.  Initial photos taken Wednesday show a sample in the tube but later images were inconclusive because of poor lighting, NASA said in a news release. The rock sample  about the thickness of a pencil  could have slipped down deeper into the tube during a series of planned vibrations, it said. More photos are planned. Perseverance arrived in February at Mars Jezero Crater  believed to be the home of a lush lakebed and river delta billions of years ago  in search of rocks that might hold evidence of ancient life. NASA plans to launch more spacecraft to retrieve the samples collected by Perseverance; engineers are hoping to return as many as three dozen samples in about a decade. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Global biodiversity conference opens in southern France,"MARSEILLE, France (AP)  French President Emmanuel Macron opened a global summit on biodiversity on Friday, saying the world needs to act promptly and decisively to safeguard the Earths natural resources. There is no vaccine for a sick planet, he warned. In remarks at the World Conservation Congress in the southern city of Marseille, on Frances Mediterranean coast, Macron also promised an EU-wide initiative to curb pesticide overuse, which damages ecosystems. He called for better protection of the high seas, which largely dont fall under any national jurisdiction but are threatened by overfishing and other human activities. Macron urged world leaders and institutions to safeguard biodiversity as they work to curb climate change and support human welfare. We must reinvent our trade policies so that they are coherent with our climate and biodiversity policies, he said. The conference, held every four years, focuses on urgent action needed to protect wildlife. Thousands of people are set to attend the event, both in person and virtually, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Several recent studies have shown that many of the planets ecosystems are severely strained by global warming, deforestation, habitat degradation, pollution and other threats.  Oceanic shark  populations have dropped by 71% since 1970. More than half of all bird of prey  species worldwide are declining  in population  and 18 species are critically endangered. Warming temperatures and melting ice are projected to imperil 70% of Emperor penguin colonies by 2050, and 98% by 2100. 
        
     Speaking to reporters, Macron announced the creation of a new global event meant to protect the high seas  which cover about half the planets surface. The One Ocean Summit will be organized in France in coming months in coordination with the United Nations, he said. When we talk about oceans, 60% of these areas do not fall under a (national) jurisdiction, Macron stressed. The summit will aim at creating an international ocean law, he said. Because otherwise, some nations do whatever they want in the high seas and may destroy biodiversity and at the same time may also make choices which, from a geopolitical point of view, are bad. On Friday morning, Macron and other conference participants, including European Council President Charles Michel, took a boat to Calanques National Park, a marine reserve near Marseille known for its blue waters topped by high white cliffs. Macron said he wants to extend the French parts of the Mediterranean Sea under very high protection, which implies a ban on fishing. They now represent a very small area. We see that when we protect well, we succeed in regenerating species, regenerating biodiversity, Macron said after his boat trip to the Calanques reserve, which is home to dolphins, fin whales, turtles and a variety of fish. Its coastal area also includes 1,600 plant species and 25 protected bird species.  Nature does a lot for us. But if we destroy nature, we will destroy the many ways it enhances human life, said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at Duke University. The conference is hosted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, made up of 1,400 private and government entities.  Macron wants to follow the path started at the One Planet Summit in January, which led 70 countries to commit to protecting at least 30% of the worlds land and oceans over the next decade to halt species extinction and combat climate change.  The conference runs until Sept. 11. Topics include links between climate change and biodiversity loss, and the ethics of genetic enhancement to increase species chances of survival. With changing temperatures, we are seeing kelp move, sea otters move, seals move, said Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.  U.S. weather officials recently reported that July 2021 was the hottest  month in 142 years of record-keeping. A U.N. report  released in June examined ways in which climate change was exacerbating the loss of biodiversity.  Talks at the Marseille conference are also meant to inform the U.N.s global climate summit, the COP26, scheduled in November in Glasgow, Scotland.  ____ Corbet reported from Saulieu, France.

EXPLAINER: 4 will circle Earth on 1st SpaceX private flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  For the first time in 60 years of human spaceflight, a rocket is poised to blast into orbit with no professional astronauts on board, only four tourists. SpaceXs first private flight will be led by a 38-year-old entrepreneur whos bankrolling the entire trip. Hes taking two sweepstakes winners with him on the three-day, round-the-world trip, along with a health care worker who survived childhood cancer. Theyll ride alone in a fully automated Dragon capsule, the same kind that SpaceX uses to send astronauts to and from the International Space Station for NASA. But the chartered flight wont be going there.  Set to launch Wednesday night from Kennedy Space Center, the two men and two women will soar 100 miles (160 kilometers) higher than the space station, aiming for an altitude of 357 miles (575 kilometers), just above the current position of the Hubble Space Telescope. By contrast, Virgin Galactics Richard Branson and Blue Origins Jeff Bezos briefly skimmed space during their short rides in July  Branson reached 53 miles (86 kilometers) while Bezos hit 66 miles up (106 kilometers). As the private flights benefactor, Jared Isaacman, sees it: This is the first step toward a world where everyday people can go and venture among the stars. A look at the spaceflight, dubbed Inspiration4:  BILLIONAIRES QUEST Isaacmans idea of fun is flying fighter jets and keeping up with the Air Force Thunderbirds. He quit high school and started his own payment-processing company, Shift4 Payments in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He segued into aviation, founding Draken International for tactical aircraft training. While he wont divulge what hes paying for the flight, Isaacman acknowledges the worthwhile debates over whether the wealthy should spend their fortunes fixing problems on Earth, versus sightseeing in space. But he contends investing in space now will lower costs in the future. Because its so expensive, space has been the exclusive domain of world superpowers and the elite that they select, he told The Associated Press last week. It just shouldnt stay that way. When he announced the flight in February, he pledged $100 million to St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital and aims to raise another $100 million in donations. 
        
     LUCK OF THE DRAW Isaacman offered one of the four capsule seats to St. Jude, which offered it to physician assistant Hayley Arceneaux, a former patient who now works at the Memphis, Tennessee, hospital. Now 29, Arceneaux was 10 when diagnosed with bone cancer, and had much of her left thigh bone replaced with a titanium rod. Shell be the first person in space with a prosthesis, proud to pave the way for those who arent physically perfect. Shell also be the youngest American in space, beating the late Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space in 1983 at age 32. Contest winners claimed the final two seats. Sian Proctor, 51, a community college educator in Tempe, Arizona, and former geology instructor, beat out 200 other Shift4 Payments clients with her space-themed artwork business. Also a pilot, she was a NASA astronaut finalist more than a decade ago. Chris Sembroski, 42, a data engineer and former Air Force missileman from Everett, Washington, entered an open lottery by donating to St. Jude. He didnt win, but a friend from his college days did and gave him the slot. TRAINING LIKE ASTRONAUTS Its been a whirlwind since all four came together in March. They hiked up Washingtons Mount Rainier in the snow, sampled brief bursts of weightlessness aboard modified aircraft and took intense, rapid spins in fighter jets and centrifuges. I know that my prosthesis can now handle 8 Gs of force, Arceneaux told the AP. Her only compromise: SpaceX had to adjust her capsule seat to relieve pain in that knee. Although the capsule is fully automated, the four spent time in the SpaceX capsule simulator rehearsing launch, reentry and other critical operations. We definitely had some Apollo 13-like simulation rides home where virtually everything was broken, and everybody made it back. So I think we passed all the tests, Isaacson said. While acknowledging the risks, the four are impressed with SpaceXs focus on safety and reusability. But Sembroski said his wife, a schoolteacher, will hold off celebrating until splashdown.  PRIVATE VS NASA MISSION This is SpaceXs first private flight and the company is running the show -- NASA isnt involved. So SpaceX is providing its own facilities for private passengers to sleep, eat and hang out before launch, and to get into their white-with-black-trim flight suits. The leased launch pad used by SpaceX is the same one used by Apollo moonwalkers, shuttle astronauts and all three previous NASA crews. And at missions end, theyll splash down off the Florida coast just like their predecessors. The pandemic is again limiting spectators: St. Jude is scaling back its launch delegation, with actor Marlo Thomas, whose father Danny Thomas, founded St. Jude, canceling her trip to Florida with husband, talk show host Phil Donahue.  THREE DAYS ALOFT Isaacman and SpaceX settled on three days as the sweet spot for orbiting the Earth. It gives him and his fellow passengers plenty of time to take in the views through a custom bubble-shaped window, take blood samples and conduct other medical research, and drum up interest for auction items to benefit the hospital. While roomy for a capsule, the Dragon offers virtually no privacy; only a curtain shields the toilet. Unlike the space station and NASAs old shuttles, there is no galley or sleeping compartments, or even separate work areas. As for food, theyll chow down on cold pizza following liftoff. Theyre also packing ready-to-eat, astronaut-style fare.  SPACE TOURISM ON THE RISE Space tourism has never been hotter. Branson and Bezos rode their companies rockets into space to fulfill lifelong dreams but also advance ticket sales. Too busy to launch himself, SpaceX founder Elon Musk has two tourist flights to the space station coming up in the next year  the first as early as January  and also a private moonshot in the works. The businessmen shelling out $55 million apiece to fly SpaceX to the space station wont be the first to pay their own way there. Seven wealthy clients of Virginia-based Space Adventures rode Russian rockets to the space station from 2000 to 2009. Isaacman traveled to Kazakhstan in 2008 to watch one of them soar: Richard Garriott, the video game-developing son of the late NASA astronaut Owen Garriott. While once opposed to space tourism, NASA is rooting for these newcomers. I cant wait for them to fly and fly safely and fly often, said NASAs commercial spaceflight director, Phil McAlister.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Theyll circle Earth for three days at an unusually high altitude  on their own without a professional escort  before splashing down off the Florida coast. Meet the crew thats taking space tourism to new heights following Wednesday nights launch from NASAs Kennedy Space Center: JARED ISAACMAN, SPONSOR Isaacman struck it rich with the payment-processing business he started in his parents basement after quitting high school. He later went to an aeronautical university, took to the skies in fighter jets and started Draken International to provide military-style training in tactical aircraft. Space beckoned, and the Easton, Pennsylvania, entrepreneur purchased an entire flight from SpaceX to circle the Earth. The 38-year-old considers flying in air shows, his other hobby, as way more dangerous. I dont consider myself like a risk-taker or a thrill-seeker, says Isaacman, whose daughters are 7 and 5. I try to seek out what I think are interesting challenges in life and, when I can, I tether it with a very worthwhile cause. This time its St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. Isaacman has pledged $100 million to St. Jude and is seeking another $100 million in public donations. To drive home the message that space is for just everyday people, Isaacman offered one of the four capsule seats to St. Jude and held sweepstakes for the other two. HAYLEY ARCENEAUX, ST. JUDES REP Now a physician assistant at St. Jude, Arceneaux was a bone cancer patient at the Memphis, Tennessee, hospital at age 10. To save her left leg, St. Jude replaced her knee and part of her thigh bone, implanting a titanium rod. Shes the first person with a prosthesis in space and, at age 29, the youngest American. She was St. Judes runaway choice in January as the hospitals representative in space. Arceneaux kept up with her fellow passengers in training, even while trudging up Washingtons Mount Rainier in the snow. Her only compromise: SpaceX adjusted her capsule seat to relieve knee pain. Im so excited about opening space travel up to so many, so many different kinds of people and those that arent physically perfect, Arceneaux says. Shell chat with St. Jude patients from orbit, reminding them that their dreams, too, can come true. Shes taken along her late fathers St. Jude tie, a prized possession. I am so thankful for my journey with cancer because it gave me a love for life, just a zest for life and the confidence to say yes to opportunities, she says. This is the biggest honor of my life. 
        
     CHRIS SEMBROSKI, RAFFLE WINNER Sembroski, an Air Force veteran and data engineer for Lockheed Martin in Everett, Washington, always saw himself as the space booster behind the scenes, helping to educate the public. He shot off model rockets in college and worked as a Space Camp counselor. So he considered it a crazy fantasy when he saw the Super Bowl ad in February announcing the space seat raffle and made a donation to enter. He didnt win but a college friend did, and he offered Sembroski his spot on the flight. Sembroski says he was more subdued than others when he found out: Just no words were coming out. Since then, Ive gotten a lot more enthusiastic. After six months of training, Sembroski, 42, has no worries, no concerns, maybe a little bit of stage fright about singing and playing a ukulele in orbit that will be auctioned off to support St. Jude. His schoolteacher wife, Erin, is more than anxious about it for the two of us. They have two daughters, ages 3 and 9. Sembroski says hell reflect on the historic nature of the flight  and his role in it  once hes back on Earth. SIAN PROCTOR, BUSINESS WINNER Proctor applied to NASA three times to become an astronaut. The 51-year-old geologist and community college professor from Tempe, Arizona, actually made it to the finals more than a decade ago. After striking out with NASA, she set her sights on private spaceflight. But as 2021 loomed, she thought shed aged out  until she learned of Isaacmans space sweepstakes for his clients. Shed begun creating space-themed artwork when the coronavirus pandemic struck and turned to Isaacmans Shift4 company to sell her paintings. When asked on the eve of launch if she was nervous, she said her only worry was that this moment would never come in my life. As only the fourth Black woman in space after three NASA astronauts, Proctor hopes to inspire other minority women. As we move to the moon and Mars and beyond, were writing the narrative of human spaceflight right now by focusing on diversity, Proctor says. Were on Starship Earth and we want to bring everybody along with us. She caught the space bug early: Her late father worked at NASAs tracking station in Guam during the Apollo moon landings. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX launches 4 amateurs on private Earth-circling trip,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs first private flight streaked into orbit Wednesday night with two contest winners, a health care worker and their rich sponsor, the most ambitious leap yet in space tourism. It was the first time a spacecraft circled Earth with an all-amateur crew and no professional astronauts. Punch it, SpaceX! the flights billionaire leader, Jared Isaacman, urged moments before liftoff. The Dragon capsules two men and two women are looking to spend three days going round and round the planet from an unusually high orbit  100 miles (160 kilometers) higher than the International Space Station  before splashing down off the Florida coast this weekend. Its SpaceX founder Elon Musks first entry in the competition for space tourism dollars.  Isaacman is the third billionaire to launch this summer, following the brief space-skimming flights by Virgin Galactics Richard Branson and Blue Origins Jeff Bezos in July. Only 38, Isaacman made his fortune from a payment-processing company he started in his teens. Joining Isaacman on the trip dubbed Inspiration4 is Hayley Arceneaux, 29, a childhood bone cancer survivor who works as a physician assistant where she was treated  St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Isaacman has pledged $100 million out of his own pocket to the hospital and is seeking another $100 million in donations. Arceneaux became the youngest American in space and the first person in space with a prosthesis, a titanium rod in her left leg. 
        
     Also along for the ride: sweepstakes winners Chris Sembroski, 42, a data engineer in Everett, Washington, and Sian Proctor, 51, a community college educator in Tempe, Arizona. Once opposed to space tourism, NASA is now a supporter. Low-Earth orbit is now more accessible for more people to experience the wonders of space, tweeted NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, a congressman when he hitched a ride on a space shuttle decades ago. The recycled Falcon rocket soared from the same Kennedy Space Center pad used by the companys three previous astronaut flights for NASA. But this time, the Dragon capsule aimed for an altitude of 357 miles (575 kilometers), just beyond the Hubble Space Telescope. Across the country, SpaceX employees at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, cheered wildly at every flight milestone, including when the spent first-stage booster landed upright on an ocean platform. French astronaut Thomas Pesquet rooted from the space station on Twitter: No matter if youre a professional or not, when you get strapped to a rocket and launch into space, we have something in common. All the very best from, well, space.  Isaacman noted upon reaching orbit that few people have been to space  fewer than 600 over 60 years. But he added, Many are about to follow. The doors opening now and its pretty incredible.  Their capsule has already been to orbit: It was used for SpaceXs second astronaut flight for NASA to the space station. The only significant change is the large domed window at the top in place of the usual space station docking mechanisms. An accomplished pilot, Isaacman persuaded SpaceX to take the fully automated Dragon capsule higher than its ever been. Initially reluctant because of the increased radiation exposure and other risks, SpaceX agreed after a safety review.  Now I just wish we pushed them to go higher, Isaacman told reporters on the eve of the flight. If were going to go to the moon again and were going to go to Mars and beyond, then weve got to get a little outside of our comfort zone and take the next step in that direction. Isaacman, whose Shift4 Payments company is based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is picking up the entire tab for the flight, but wont say how many millions he paid. He and others contend those big price tags will eventually lower the cost. Yes, today you must have and be willing to part with a large amount of cash to buy yourself a trip to space, said Explorers Club President Richard Garriott, a NASA astronauts son who paid the Russians for a space station trip more than a decade ago. But this is the only way we can get the price down and expand access, just as it has been with other industries before it. Though the capsule is automated, the four Dragon riders spent six months training for the flight to cope with any emergency. That training included centrifuge and fighter jet flights, launch and reentry practice in SpaceXs capsule simulator and a grueling trek up Washingtons Mount Rainier in the snow. Four hours before liftoff, the four met with Musk before emerging from SpaceXs huge rocket hangar, waving and blowing kisses to their families and company employees, before they were driven off to get into their sleek white flight suits. Once at the launch pad, they posed for pictures and bumped gloved fists, before taking the elevator up. Proctor danced as she made her way to the hatch. Unlike NASA missions, the public wont be able to listen in or watch events unfold in real time. Arceneaux hopes to link up with St. Jude patients, but the conversation wont be broadcast live.  SpaceXs next private trip, early next year, will see a retired NASA astronaut escorting three wealthy businessmen to the space station for a weeklong visit. The Russians are launching an actress, film director and a Japanese tycoon to the space station in the next few months. Someday NASA astronauts will be the exception, not the rule, said Cornell Universitys Mason Peck, an engineering professor who served as NASAs chief technologist nearly a decade ago. But theyll likely continue to be the trailblazers the rest of us will follow. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Tom Cruise gets sneak preview from SpaceXs 1st private crew,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Tom Cruise got a sneak preview of what its like to circle Earth in a SpaceX capsule.  Representatives for SpaceXs first privately chartered flight revealed Friday that the actor took part in a call with the four space tourists orbiting more than 360 miles up. Thursdays conversation, like the entire three-day flight, was private and so no details were released. Maverick, you can be our wingman anytime, came the announcement from the flights Twitter feed. Cruise starred as Navy pilot Pete Maverick Mitchell in the 1986 film Top Gun. A sequel comes out next year. Last year, NASA confirmed it was in talks with Cruise about visiting the International Space Station for filming. SpaceX would provide the lift, as it does for NASA astronauts, and like it did Wednesday night for the billionaire up there now with his two contest winners and a hospital worker.  Their flight is due to end Saturday night with a splashdown in the Atlantic off the Florida coast. The four showed off their capsule in a live broadcast Friday. Theyre flying exceedingly high in the automated capsule, even by NASA standards. SpaceX got them into a 363-mile (585-kilometer) orbit following Wednesday nights launch from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. Thats 100 miles (160 kilometers) higher than the International Space Station. Its so high that theyre completing 15 orbits of Earth daily, compared with 16 for station astronauts. 
        
     Until this all-amateur crew, relatively few NASA astronauts had soared that high. The most recent were the shuttle astronauts who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope over multiple flights in the 1990s and 2000s. To enhance the views, SpaceX outfitted the Dragon capsule with a custom, bubble-shaped dome. Photos of them looking out this large window were posted online, otherwise little else had been publicly released of their first day in space. Besides talking space with Cruise, the four capsule passengers chatted Thursday with young cancer patients. Hayley Arceneaux, a childhood cancer survivor, led the conversation from orbit with patients from the hospital that saved her life almost 20 years ago: St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. A 6-year-old-boy wanted to know if there are cows on the moon  like in the nursery rhyme.  I hope there will be one day. Right now, no, there arent, replied another passenger, Sian Proctor. Were going to go back to the moon soon and were going to investigate all kinds of things about it. The video linkup was not broadcast live, but shared by St. Jude on Friday. Seeing the Earth from so high is so beautiful, Arceneaux told them. Now a physician assistant at St. Jude, Arceneaux is the youngest American in space at age 29. Pennsylvania entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, 38, purchased the entire flight for an undisclosed amount. Hes seeking to raise $200 million for St. Jude through the flight hes named Inspiration4, half of that coming from his own pocket. The two other Dragon riders won their seats through a pair of contests sponsored by Isaacman: Chris Sembroski, 42, a data engineer, and Proctor, 51, a community college educator. During the broadcast Friday afternoon, Sembroski played a ukulele that will be auctioned off for St. Jude. You can turn your volume down if you wish, but Ill give it a shot, he said.  Proctor, who is an artist, showed off a drawing in her sketchbook of a Dragon capsule being carried by a mythological dragon away from Earth. All four share SpaceX founder Elon Musks quest to open space to everyone. Missions like Inspiration4 help advance spaceflight to enable ultimately anyone to go to orbit & beyond, Musk tweeted Thursday after chatting with his orbiting pioneers. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Trailblazing tourist trip to orbit ends with splashdown,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Four space tourists safely ended their trailblazing trip to orbit Saturday with a splashdown in the Atlantic off the Florida coast.  Their SpaceX capsule parachuted into the ocean just before sunset, not far from where their chartered flight began three days earlier. The all-amateur crew was the first to circle the world without a professional astronaut. The billionaire who paid undisclosed millions for the trip and his three guests wanted to show that ordinary people could blast into orbit by themselves, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk took them on as the companys first rocket-riding tourists. Your mission has shown the world that space is for all of us, SpaceX Mission Control radioed.  It was a heck of a ride for us ... just getting started, replied trip sponsor Jared Isaacman, referring to the growing number of private flights on the horizon. SpaceXs fully automated Dragon capsule reached an unusually high altitude of 363 miles (585 kilometers) after Wednesday nights liftoff. Surpassing the International Space Station by 100 miles (160 kilometers), the passengers savored views of Earth through a big bubble-shaped window added to the top of the capsule. The four streaked back through the atmosphere early Saturday evening, the first space travelers to end their flight in the Atlantic since Apollo 9 in 1969. SpaceXs two previous crew splashdowns  carrying astronauts for NASA  were in the Gulf of Mexico.  
        
     Within a few minutes, a pair of SpaceX boats pulled up alongside the bobbing capsule. When the capsules hatch was opened on the recovery ship, health care worker Hayley Arceneaux was the first one out, flashing a big smile and thumbs up.  All appeared well and happy. Their families were waiting near the scene of Wednesday nights launch from NASAs Kennedy Space Center.  This time, NASA was little more than an encouraging bystander, its only tie being the Kennedy launch pad once used for the Apollo moonshots and shuttle crews, but now leased by SpaceX. Isaacman, 38, an entrepreneur and accomplished pilot, aimed to raise $200 million for St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. Donating $100 million himself, he held a lottery for one of the four seats. Late Saturday, Musk tweeted he was donating $50 million, putting them over the top.  For the last seat, Isaacman held a competition for clients of his Allentown, Pennsylvania payment-processing business, Shift4 Payments.  Joining him on the flight were Arceneaux, 29, a St. Jude physician assistant who was treated at the Memphis, Tennessee hospital nearly two decades ago for bone cancer, and contest winners Chris Sembroski, 42, a data engineer in Everett, Washington, and Sian Proctor, 51, a community college educator, scientist and artist from Tempe, Arizona. Best ride of my life! Proctor tweeted a few hours after splashdown. Strangers until March, the four spent six months training and preparing for potential emergencies during the flight  but there was no need to step in, officials said after their return. During the trip dubbed Inspiration4, they had time to chat with St. Jude patients, conduct medical tests on themselves, ring the closing bell for the New York Stock Exchange and do some drawing and ukulele playing.  Arceneaux, the youngest American in space and the first with a prosthesis, assured her patients, I was a little girl going through cancer treatment just like a lot of you, and if I can do this, you can do this. They also took calls from Tom Cruise, interested in his own SpaceX flight to the space station for filming, and the rock band U2s Bono. Even their space menu wasnt typical: Cold pizza and sandwiches, but also pasta Bolognese and Mediterranean lamb. Before beginning descent, Sembroski was so calm that he was seen in the capsule watching the 1987 Mel Brooks film Spaceballs on his tablet. What an amazing adventure! he tweeted later. Congratulations streamed in, including from the Association of Space Explorers to its four newest members.  Aside from trouble with a toilet fan and a bad temperature sensor in an engine, the flight went exceedingly well, officials said. Some of the four passengers experienced motion sickness when they reached orbit  just as some astronauts do.  It was a very clean mission from start to finish, said Benji Reed, a SpaceX senior director. Reed anticipates as many as six private flights a year for SpaceX, sandwiched between astronaut launches for NASA. Four SpaceX flights are already booked to carry paying customers to the space station, accompanied by former NASA astronauts. The first is targeted for early next year with three businessmen paying $55 million apiece. Russia also plans to take up an actor and film director for filming next month and a Japanese tycoon in December. Customers interested in quick space trips are turning to Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos Blue Origin. The two rode their own rockets to the fringes of space in July to spur ticket sales; their flights lasted 10 to 15 minutes.  The 60-year scorecard now stands at 591 people who have reached space or its edges  and is expected to skyrocket as space tourism heats up. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"China, US unveil separate big steps to fight climate change","The two biggest economies and largest carbon polluters in the world announced separate financial attacks on climate change Tuesday. Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country will no longer fund coal-fired power plants abroad, surprising the world on climate for the second straight year at the U.N. General Assembly. That came hours after U.S. President Joe Biden announced a plan to double financial aid to poorer nations to $11.4 billion by 2024 so those countries could switch to cleaner energy and cope with global warmings worsening impacts. That puts rich nations close to within reach of its long-promised but not realized goal of $100 billion a year in climate help for developing nations. This is an absolutely seminal moment, said Xinyue Ma, an expert on energy development finance at Boston Universitys Global Development Policy Center.  This could provide some momentum going into major climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, in less than six weeks, experts said. Running up to the historic 2015 Paris climate deal, a joint U.S.-China agreement kickstarted successful negotiations. This time, with China-U.S. relations dicey, the two nations made their announcements separately, hours and thousands of miles apart. Today was a really good day for the world, United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the upcoming climate negotiations, told Vice President Kamala Harris. 
        
     United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has made a frenetic push this week for bigger efforts to curb climate change called the two announcements welcome news, but said we still have a long way to go to make the Glasgow meeting successful. Depending on when Chinas new coal policy goes into effect, it could shutter 47 planned power plants in 20 developing countries that use the fuel that emits the most heat-trapping gases, about the same amount of coal power as from Germany, according to the European climate think-tank E3G. Its a big deal. China was the only significant funder of overseas coal left. This announcement essentially ends all public support for coal globally, said Joanna Lewis, an expert on China, energy and climate at Georgetown University. This is the announcement many have been waiting for. From 2013 to 2019, data showed that China was financing 13% of coal-fired power capacity built outside China  far and away the largest public financier, said Kevin Gallagher, who directs the Boston University center. Japan and South Korea announced earlier this year that they were getting out of the coal-financing business. With all three countries pulling out of financing coal abroad that sends a signal to the global economy. This is a sector thats fast becoming a stranded asset, Gallagher said. While this is a big step it is not quite a death knell for coal, said Byford Tsang, a policy analyst for E3G. Thats because China last year added as much new coal power domestically as was just potentially cancelled abroad, he said. Tsang cautioned that the one-sentence line in Xis speech that mentioned this new policy lacked details like effective dates and whether it applied to private funding as well as public funding. What also matters is when China stops building new coal plants at home and shutters old ones, Tsang said. That will be part of a push in the G-20 meetings in Italy next month, he said. The Chinese are going to respond to international pressure, rather than just American bilateral pressure right now, said Deborah Seligsohn, an expert on Chinas politics and energy at Villanova University. A coal-free energy mix is still decades in the future because coal power plants typically operate for 50 years or more, said Stanford University environment director Chris Field. Many nations that are trying to build their economies  including top polluters China and India  have long argued they needed to industrialize with fossil fuels, like developed nations had already done. Starting in 2009 and then with a grand bargain in 2015 in Paris, richer nations promised $100 billion a year in financial help to poorer nations to make the switch from dirty to clean fuel, World Resources Institute climate finance expert Joe Thwaites said.  But as of 2019, the richer nations were only providing $80 billion a year, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. So when rich nations like the United States asked poorer ones to do more it gives any other country a very easy retort, Thwaites said: You took out commitments and you havent delivered on those either."""" In April, Biden announced he would double the Obama era financial aid pledge of $2.85 billion a year to $5.7 billion. On Tuesday he announced that he hopes to double that to $11.4 billion a year starting in 2024, but he does need passage from Congress. The European Union has been doling out $24.5 billion a year with the European Commission recently upping that to more than $4.7 billion over seven years. The Europeans are doing a lot more and the Americans are lagging behind, Thwaites said.  He said several studies calculate that based on the U.S. economy, population and carbon pollution, it should be contributing 40% to 47% of the $100 billion fund to be doing its fair share.  But Congressional Republicans arent convinced. We shouldnt be contributing to a fund that picks winners and losers and further subsidizes China in the process, said Rep. Garret Graves, R-Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the House Climate Committee.  The time for global grandstanding is over, said Princeton University climate science and international affairs professor Michael Oppenheimer said. Its whats happening on the ground that matters. Accelerating the global phase out of coal is the single most important step to keeping the Paris agreements key warming limit within reach, said U.N. chief Guterres. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Oldest human footprints in North America found in New Mexico,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Fossilized footprints discovered in New Mexico indicate that early humans were walking across North America around 23,000 years ago, researchers reported Thursday. The first footprints were found in a dry lake bed in White Sands National Park in 2009. Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey recently analyzed seeds stuck in the footprints to determine their approximate age, ranging from around 22,800 and 21,130 years ago. The findings may shed light on a mystery that has long intrigued scientists: When did people first arrive in the Americas, after dispersing from Africa and Asia? Most scientists believe ancient migration came by way of a now-submerged land bridge that connected Asia to Alaska. Based on various evidence  including stone tools, fossil bones and genetic analysis  other researchers have offered a range of possible dates for human arrival in the Americas, from 13,000 to 26,000 years ago or more.  The current study provides a more solid baseline for when humans definitely were in North America, although they could have arrived even earlier, the authors say. Fossil footprints are more indisputable and direct evidence than cultural artifacts, modified bones, or other more conventional fossils, they wrote in the journal Science, which published the study Thursday. What we present here is evidence of a firm time and location, they said. 
        
     Based on the size of the footprints, researchers believe that at least some were made by children and teenagers who lived during the last ice age.  David Bustos, the parks resource program manager, spotted the first footprints in ancient wetlands in 2009. He and others found more in the park over the years.  We knew they were old, but we had no way to date the prints before we discovered some with (seeds) on top, he said Thursday. Made of fine silt and clay, the footprints are fragile, so the researchers had to work quickly to gather samples, Bustos said.  The only way we can save them is to record them  to take a lot of photos and make 3D models, he said.  Earlier excavations in White Sands National Park have uncovered fossilized tracks left by a saber-toothed cat, dire wolf, Columbian mammoth and other ice age animals. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Scientists decipher Marie Antoinettes redacted love notes,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Not without you. My dear friend. You that I love.  Marie Antoinette sent these expressions of affection  or more?  in letters to her close friend and rumored lover Axel von Fersen. Someone later used dark ink to scribble over the words, apparently to dampen the effusive, perhaps amorous, language.  Scientists in France devised a new method to uncover the original writing, separating out the chemical composition of different inks used on historical documents. They tested their method by analyzing the private letters between the French queen and the Swedish count, which are housed in the French national archives.  That allowed them to read the original words and even identify the person who scratched them out  Fersen himself. Its always exciting when you discover that you can know more about the past than you thought you could, said historian Rebecca L. Spang, who studies the French Revolution at Indiana University, and was not involved in the study.  The letters were exchanged between June 1791 and August 1792  a period when the French royal family was kept under close surveillance in Paris, after having attempted to flee the country. Soon the French monarchy would be abolished, and the next year both Marie Antoinette and her husband, Louis XVI, would be beheaded.  In this time, people used a lot of flowery language  but here, its really strong, really intimate language. We know with this text, there is love relationship, said Anne Michelin, a material analyst at the Sorbonnes Research Center for Conservation and co-author of the research published Friday in the journal Science Advances.  
        
     The wide-ranging letters, penned on thick cotton paper, discuss political events and personal feelings. The redacted phrases, such as madly and beloved, dont change the overall meaning, but tone of the relationship between the sender and receiver.  Marie Antoinette and Fersen met in France when they were both 18. They kept in touch until her death.  In 18th century western Europe, theres a kind of cult of the letter as a form of writing that gives you access to a persons character like no other, said Deidre Lynch, a historian who studies the periods literary culture at Harvard and was not involved in the study.  Like a metaphorical state of undress, theyve let their hair down and show are who they really are, she said. But savvy writers were also aware that their letters may be read by multiple audiences. Some correspondents in 18th century Europe famously employed secret codes and so-called invisible ink to hide their full meaning from certain eyes. The letters exchanged between Marie Antoinette and Fersen, who never married, were altered after the fact. Certain portions of text were scribbled out in dark ink. His family kept the correspondence until 1982, when the letters were purchased by the French national archives.  In eight of the 15 letters the researchers analyzed, there were sufficient differences in the chemical composition of the inks  the proportion of iron, copper and other elements  that they could map out each layer separately, and thus recover the original text.  This is amazing, said Ronald Schechter, a historian who studies Marie Antoinettes library at William & Mary and was not involved in the study. He said that the technique could also help historians decipher redacted or censored phrases and passages in diplomatic correspondence, sensitive political correspondence, and other texts that have eluded historical analysis due to redactions.  Michelin said the most surprising finding was that her team could also identify the person who censored the letters. It was Fersen, who used the same inks to write and redact some of the letters.  His motivations, however, remain a matter of speculation.  I bet he was trying to protect her virtue, said Harvards Lynch. To throw out her letters would be like throwing out a lock of her hair. He wants two incompatible things: He wants to keep the letters, but he also wants to change them. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

California spill came 52 years after historic oil disaster,"The weekend  oil leak along the Southern California coast happened not far from the site of the catastrophe more than a generation ago that helped give rise to the modern environmental movement itself: the  1969 Santa Barbara spill. That still ranks in the  top tier of human-caused disasters in the United States and is the nations third-largest oil spill, behind only the 2010 Deepwater Horizon and 1989 Exxon Valdez calamities. During a 10-day period in early 1969, between about 3.5 million and 4.2 million gallons of crude spilled into the Santa Barbara Channel after a blowout six miles offshore on a Union Oil drilling platform. The disaster area was about 115 miles from the site of the 126,000-gallon spill over the weekend that fouled Huntington Beach, a celebrated surfing spot. The Union Oil rig had been controversial since its inception, but local California communities hadnt been given any voice in decisions about drilling in federal waters. And corners were cut during the construction process: Regulations called for protective steel casing to extend at least 300 feet below the ocean floor, but the company obtained a waiver allowing it to install only 239 feet of casing.  In the aftermath of the spill, thousands of oil-coated birds perished and photos of the carnage on beaches were widely circulated in newspapers and magazines.  President Richard Nixon visited the site in March 1969 and told reporters, It is sad that it was necessary that Santa Barbara should be the example that had to bring it to the attention of the American people.  
        
     That example  of communities left out of crucial decisions and corners cut to save time or money for large companies  garnered national attention and caused outrage. It added momentum to the movement to organize the first Earth Day the next year.  Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord Nelson, an early environmentalist, visited the Santa Barbara oil spill site and later said it inspired him to organize a nationwide teach-in on the environment.  The oil spill was not the only U.S. environmental crisis in the 1960s. The links between rampant overuse of the pesticide DDT and damaged ecosystems  including the dwindling population of  bald eagles  were the subject of Rachel Carsons seminal 1962 book,  Silent Spring. A raft of far-reaching federal environmental legislation was enacted in the early 1970s, including the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (1970) and the passage of the  Clean Air Act (1970) and Clean Water Act (1972). Its frustrating that spills like this keep happening, said Damon Nagami, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, as he walked along cordoned-off areas of Huntington Beach. I grew up near here, so this feels really personal.  These are entirely preventable catastrophes, he said, though he added that managing offshore drilling is complex because there are lots of regulatory bodies with overlapping responsibilities, depending on whether the activity is happening in federal waters, state waters or international waters. Oil spills damage coastal ecosystems, marine life and, if the oil-laden water moves into storm drainage systems, local communities. Once the oil gets into an ecosystem, its hard to get out, Nagami said. The impacts are felt for years, for decades. Don Anair, a research and deputy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said oil spills are a very visible image of our reliance on fossil fuels. We should be doing all we can to make sure the infrastructure is as safe as possible, but even that wont fully eliminate the risk of oil spills, he said. The longer-term solution here has to be transitioning to using other sources of energy to power our vehicles.   According to the EPA, the transportation sector is the countrys largest primary contributor to climate change, responsible for around 29% of greenhouse gas emissions.  ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"120,000-year-old fossils in Israel link to human family tree","WASHINGTON (AP)  Bones found in an Israeli quarry are from a branch of the human evolutionary tree and are 120,000 to 140,000 years old, scientists reported Thursday. A team of anthropologists spent years analyzing the fragments of a skull, lower jaw bone and tooth that were uncovered in Nesher Ramla in 2010, comparing them to hundreds of fossils around the world from different eras.  The researchers determined that the fossils likely came from a hominin group closely related to Neanderthals and sharing many of their features, such as the shape of the lower jaw. The scientists also believe that there are enough similarities to link this group to other populations found in prior cave excavations in Israel dating to around 400,000 years ago. The teeth have some unique features that enable us to draw a line between these populations, said Tel Aviv University dental anthropologist Rachel Sarig, a co-author of the paper published Thursday in the journal Science.  This group probably inhabited the region from around 400,000 to 100,000 years ago, said Tel Aviv University physical anthropologist Israel Hershkovitz, another co-author. He said the remains found at Nesher Ramla are likely from some of the last survivors of a once very dominant group in the Middle East. Prior research has shown that homo sapiens  modern humans  also lived in the region at the same time.  
        
     Many scientists believe that the arrival of homo sapiens in Europe presaged the decline of Neanderthals there, but the story may have been different in the Levant region  the crossroads between North Africa and Eurasia.  The new findings add to research showing that homo sapiens and Neanderthal-like groups overlapped in the Middle East over a significant amount of time, probably tens of thousands of years.  There were likely cultural and genetic exchanges between the groups, the paper authors suggest. The Neanderthal story can no longer be told as a European story only. Its a much more complicated story, said Hershkovitz. Sheela Athreya, a Texas A&M University paleoanthropologist who was not involved in the study, said the new research gives us a lot to think about in terms of the history of population groups in this region, and how they may have interacted with populations in other regions, in Europe and North Africa.  The Nesher Ramla fossils look like something on a lineage heading toward Neanderthal, said Eric Delson, a paleoanthropologist at Lehman College in New York who was not involved in the study. He characterized the findings as fossils of what appears to be an intermediate variety  this group may be predecessors to Neanderthals in this area. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Virgin Galactic gets FAAs OK to launch customers to space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Virgin Galactic finally has the federal governments approval to start launching customers into space from New Mexico. Richard Bransons rocketship company announced the Federal Aviation Administrations updated license on Friday.  Its the final hurdle in Virgin Galactics yearslong effort to send paying passengers on short space hops.  The company is working toward three more space test flights this summer and early fall, before opening the rocketships doors to paying customers. The original plans called for company engineers to launch next to evaluate equipment, followed by a flight with Branson and then a science mission by Italian Air Force officers. In the meantime, Blue Origins Jeff Bezos earlier this month announced plans to ride his own rocket into space July 20 from Texas. Virgin Galactic officials acknowledged the growing chatter over whether Branson will try to beat Bezos into space. Clearly, Sir Richard Bransons flight date has been subject to speculation for some time. At this time we do not have any further details on the upcoming flight dates, company spokeswoman Aleanna Crane wrote in an email. Unlike Blue Origins and SpaceXs fully automated capsules launched from the ground by reusable rockets, Virgin Galactic uses a winged spacecraft that launches from the belly of an airplane and requires a pair of pilots. Its reached space three times since 2018. The second trip carried a third company employee. 
        
     A review of the companys third flight to space in May  which reached an altitude of 55 miles (89 kilometers)  showed everything went well and paved the way for the necessary FAA permission.  Todays approval by the FAA of our full commercial launch license, in conjunction with the success of our May 22 test flight, give us confidence as we proceed toward our first fully crewed test flight this summer, chief executive officer Michael Colglazier said in a statement. More than 600 people already have reserved a ride to space. Tickets initially cost $250,000, but the price is expected to go up once Virgin Galactic starts accepting reservations again. Blue Origin has yet to sell tickets to the public or say what it will cost. Bezos is taking his brother and two others along for the ride on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the first human moon landing. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Astronauts complete solar panel work in 3rd spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronauts finished unfurling a new pair of solar panels outside the International Space Station on Friday, making their third spacewalk in just over a week. NASAs Shane Kimbrough and Frances Thomas Pesquet successfully installed the second in a series of powerful solar wings that should keep the space station running the rest of this decade, as space tourism ramps up with visitors beginning in the fall. We have a lot of happy faces down here, Mission Control radioed as power surged through the panel. It should have been a two-spacewalk job, but spacesuit and other problems hampered the astronauts work on June 16. As a result, the first solar wing wasnt extended to its full length of 63 feet (19 meters) until Sunday. NASA added a third spacewalk for Friday to attach and unfold the second wing  this time everything went smoothly 255 miles (410 kilometers) up. Once Pesquet released the final bolt, the newest solar wing unrolled like a giant stretch of wallpaper, high above the Bering Sea. It took 10 minutes for the slow but steady extension. Well done out there, buddy, Kimbrough called out. Most of the action during the 6 1/2-hour spacewalk took place on the nighttime side of Earth, a safety precaution. NASA did not want any solar panels soaking up sunlight and generating power, while the astronauts had their hands on the power grid.  
        
     The two solar panels delivered by SpaceX earlier this month arent nearly as big as the stations original wings. But they produce more electricity because of new technology. NASA plans to send up four more panels over the coming year; Boeing is supplying them. This first pair will supplement the space stations oldest solar wings, degraded after 20 years of continuous operation. Kimbrough and Pesquet are two months into a six-month mission. Two other Americans are aboard the space station, along with one Japanese and two Russians. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Study nixes life in clouds of Venus, but maybe in Jupiters?","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A new study is throwing cold water on the possibility of life in the clouds of Venus.  Scientists from Europe and the U.S. reported Monday there isnt nearly enough water vapor in the scorching planets clouds to support life as we know it.  The team looked into the matter following Septembers surprise announcement by others that strange, tiny organisms could be lurking in the thick, sulfuric acid-filled clouds of Venus. Through spacecraft observations, the latest research group found the water level is more than 100 times too low to support Earth-like life. Its almost at the bottom of the scale and an unbridgeable distance from what life requires to be active, said the lead author, John Hallsworth, a microbiologist at Queens University Belfast in Northern Ireland.  His team looked at the most dry-tolerant and also the most acid-tolerant microbes on Earth  and they wouldnt stand a chance in Venus. While the latest findings veto Venus at least for water-based organisms, they identify another planet  Jupiter  with enough water in the clouds and the right atmospheric temperatures to support life.  Now Im not suggesting theres life on Jupiter and Im not even suggesting life could be there because it would need the nutrients to be there and we cant be sure of that, Hallsworth stressed to reporters. But still its a profound and exciting finding and totally unexpected. 
        
     Further studies will be needed to ascertain whether microbial life might exist deep in the clouds of Jupiter, according to Hallsworth and NASA astrobiologist Chris McKay, a co-author on the research paper published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy. As for Venus, three new spacecraft will be headed there later this decade and early next  two by NASA and one by the European Space Agency. Hallsworth and and McKay dont expect their results to change regarding uninhabitable water activity at our solar systems hottest planet. Its unfortunate because Im very interested in searching for life on other worlds and I would love to think that Venus is habitable, McKay said.  The scientists behind the September study possibly hinting at life in the Vesuvian clouds based their findings on the presence of the toxic gas phosphine. On Earth, its associated with life. The researchers argued that Venus phosphine levels are too high to be geologic in origin. We are not trying to push Venus as a definitely habitable world. So far all conventional interpretations say Venus is inhabitable! said Massachusetts Institute of Technology astrophysicist Sara Seager, part of the September team.  Regarding the latest study, we are tremendously enthusiastic about leaving no stone unturned, in case there is life on Venus, she added in an email. Theres always the possibility that any life in Venus clouds  if it exists  could be totally unlike anything on Earth and adapted to the hothouse planets extremely hot and harsh conditions, according to scientists. If there is life in the clouds of Venus, then this life has to be Life as we do not know it, said astrobiologist Janusz Petkowski, a colleague of Seagers at MIT. The question is how different that life can be? ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Bransons Virgin Orbit launches 7 satellites from 747 plane,"Richard Bransons Virgin Orbit delivered satellites from three countries into space Wednesday, its second successful rocket launch from a plane. The companys modified 747 jet dubbed Cosmic Girl jet took off from Californias Mojave Desert, carrying the 70-foot (21-meter) rocket beneath its left wing. Once the plane was over the Pacific near the Channel Islands, the LauncherOne rocket peeled away, then fired its engine to head to space. The drop occurred at an altitude of about 37,000 feet (11,000 meters). Camera views showed the package of seven small satellites on the end of the second stage, against the curve of the blue Earth. The satellites are from the U.S. Defense Department, the Royal Netherlands Air Force and Polands SatRevolution company, which is working to set up an Earth-observing constellation. Virgin Orbit later declared success, saying the satellites were in the proper orbit. Branson  whose Virgin Galactic company is close to launching paying customers to the edge of space  planted a kiss on the cheek of Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart, once the satellites reached orbit. Its a pinch yourself moment, Branson said. Cheers! Well done, everybody.  In an interview later with The Associated Press, Branson declined to say whether he will be on Virgin Galactics next test flight to space  or the one after that as originally planned. The company plans three more test flights of its rocket ship this summer and fall before taking paying passengers next year. 
        
     All I can say is when the engineers tell me that I can go to space, Im ready, fit and healthy to go, Branson told the AP. So well see. Virgin Orbit sent its first batch of satellites into orbit in January; the 10 NASA-sponsored satellites were designed and built by universities. A flight demo last year was unsuccessful. Virgin Orbit said its air-launched system can put satellites into orbit on relatively short notice, compared with the more traditional way of launching rockets from the ground. Branson hopes to make satellite launches almost routine from the Mojave Air and Space Port. The companys next launch is planned for this fall, according to Hart. Branson named Wednesdays mission Tubular Bells after the music made famous in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist. It was the first album put out by Virgin Records. A few hours later, SpaceX launched a rocket from Cape Canaveral, carrying 88 mini satellites to a rare polar orbit. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Branson mum on when hell launch to space on Virgin Galactic,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Virgin Galactics Richard Branson wont say when hell ride his rocket ship to space or whether hes looking to become the first billionaire to launch aboard his own rocket. In an interview after Wednesdays satellite launch by his separate company Virgin Orbit, Branson told The Associated Press he has to be so circumspect in what he says about Virgin Galactic, a publicly traded company.  All I can say is when the engineers tell me that I can go to space, Im ready, fit and healthy to go, Branson said. So well see. Amazons Jeff Bezos is targeting July 20 for his rocket companys first launch with people. The Blue Origin flight from West Texas will include Bezos, his brother, a charity auction winner whos shelling out $28 million and a fourth unidentified person. Unlike Elon Musks SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are looking to send space tourists on brief up-and-down hops  not into orbit around the world.  Branson visited Virgin Galactics New Mexico base before flying to Californias Mojave Desert for Wednesdays plane-launched, multi-satellite mission.  Virgin Galactic plans three more test flights to the edge of space this summer and early fall, before launching customers. The company originally put Branson on the second upcoming flight, but has refused to say whether its moving him up to the next one.  Branson would not comment Wednesday on which flight hell be on  he wouldnt even say when the next flight might be. He did acknowledge its very important for potential customers to see him strap in for a ride, before opening the doors to the paying public. 
        
     The thrill-seeking adventurer, who turns 71 in a few weeks, said hes not apprehensive at all about launching into space.  Its a dream of a lifetime, he told the AP. Last week, Virgin Galactic got the Federal Aviation Administrations OK to start launching customers. More than 600 people already have reserved a ride to space. Tickets initially cost $250,000, but the price is expected to go up once the company starts accepting reservations again. Virgin Galactic made its third flight to space in May, with two pilots in the cockpit of the winged spaceship. Like Virgin Orbit, Virgin Galactic uses an aircraft to get off the ground and waits until it reaches high altitude before releasing and firing the rocket. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Richard Branson announces trip to space, ahead of Jeff Bezos","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Virgin Galactics Richard Branson is aiming to beat fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos into space by nine days.  Bransons company announced Thursday evening that its next test flight will be July 11 and that its founder will be among the six people on board. The winged rocket ship will soar from New Mexico  the first carrying a full crew of company employees. It will be only the fourth trip to space for Virgin Galactic. The news came just hours after Bezos Blue Origin said Bezos would be accompanied into space on July 20 by a female aerospace pioneer whos waited 60 years to rocket away. Bezos chose July 20 as his West Texas launch date  the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. He assigned himself to the flight just a month ago, the final stretch in a yearslong race to space between the two rich rocketeers. Amazons founder will be on Blue Origins debut launch with people on board, accompanied by his brother, the winner of a $28 million charity auction and Wally Funk, one of the last surviving members of the Mercury 13 who was chosen as his honored guest. The 13 female pilots passed the same tests as NASAs original Mercury 7 astronauts back in the early 1960s, but were barred from the corps  and spaceflight  because they were women. As late as Wednesday, Branson declined to say when he would ride into space because of restrictions placed on him by his publicly traded company. But he stressed he was fit and healthy to fly as soon as his engineers give him the go.  
        
     Ive always been a dreamer. My mum taught me to never give up and to reach for the stars. On July 11, its time to turn that dream into a reality aboard the next @VirginGalactic, he said via Twitter. Virgin Galactic launches its rocket ship from an aircraft, reaching an altitude of roughly 55 miles (88 kilometers). Blue Origin launches its New Shepard rocket from the ground, with its capsule soaring to about 66 miles (106 kilometers). Both those heights are considered the edge of space. By comparison, Elon Musks SpaceX launches its capsules  both crew and cargo  into orbit around Earth.  All three private space companies plan to take paying customers into space. SpaceX will be the first with a private flight coming up in September. Flights by Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin last about 10 minutes, with three or so minutes of weightlessness. But the returns are quite different: Virgin Galactics rocket plane glides to a landing on a runway, like NASAs old space shuttles did, with a pair of pilots in charge. Blue Origins automated capsules parachute to the desert floor, similar to how NASAs Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules made ocean splashdowns. Their spaceports are just 200 miles (320 kilometers) apart. Funk, at age 82, will become the oldest person to launch into space when Blue Origin takes its turn. Ill love every second of it. Whoooo! Ha-ha. I can hardly wait, Funk said in an Instagram video posted by Bezos. Nothing has ever gotten in my way, she added. They said, Well, youre a girl, you cant do that. I said, Guess what, doesnt matter what you are. You can still do it if you want to do it and I like to do things that nobody has ever done. Shell beat the late John Glenn, who set a record at age 77 when flying aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998. Glenn pooh-poohed the idea of women flying in space, shortly after he became the first American to orbit the world in 1962. No one has waited longer, Bezos said via Instagram. Its time. Welcome to the crew, Wally. Bezos is stepping down as Amazons CEO on Monday. Blue Origin has yet to announce ticket prices or when the public might strap into the spacious six-seat capsule. Its New Shepard rocket is named for Alan Shepard, the first American in space. Virgin Galactic has more than 600 reservations in the pipeline. These original tickets went for $250,000. The company will start accepting more following the upcoming flight with Branson. Keen to get to space, Funk reserved a seat years ago.  Virgin Galactic plans three more test flights before taking up customers, Branson was initially supposed to be on the second demo coming up, but moved it up in an apparent bid to outdo Bezos. He said Wednesday, after his other company Virgin Orbit launched a batch of satellites, that its important for his customers to see him ride his rocket ship first, before they climb on board. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Billionaire Blastoff: Rich riding own rockets into space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Two billionaires are putting everything on the line this month to ride their own rockets into space. Its intended to be a flashy confidence boost for customers seeking their own short joyrides. The lucrative, high-stakes chase for space tourists will unfold on the fringes of space  55 miles to 66 miles (88 kilometers to 106 kilometers) up, pitting Virgin Galactics Richard Branson against the worlds richest man, Blue Origins Jeff Bezos. Branson is due to take off Sunday from New Mexico, launching with two pilots and three other employees aboard a rocket plane carried aloft by a double-fuselage aircraft. Bezos departs nine days later from West Texas, blasting off in a fully automated capsule with three guests: his brother, an 82-year-old female aviation pioneer whos waited six decades for a shot at space and the winner of a $28 million charity auction. Bransons flight will be longer, but Bezos will be higher. Bransons craft has more windows, but Bezos windows are bigger. Bransons piloted plane has already flown to space three times. Bezos has five times as many test flights, though none with people on board.  Either way, theyre shooting for sky-high bragging rights as the first person to fly his own rocket to space and experience three to four minutes of weightlessness. Branson, who turns 71 in another week, considers it very important to try it out before allowing space tourists on board. He insists hes not apprehensive; this is the thrill-seeking adventurer whos kite-surfed across the English Channel and attempted to circle the world in a hot air balloon. 
        
     As a child, I wanted to go to space. When that did not look likely for my generation, I registered the name Virgin Galactic with the notion of creating a company that could make it happen, Branson wrote in a blog this week. Seventeen years after founding Virgin Galactic, hes on the cusp of experiencing space for himself.  Its amazing where an idea can lead you, no matter how far-fetched it may seem at first.  Bezos, 57, who stepped down Monday as Amazons CEO, announced in early June that hed be on his New Shepard rockets first passenger flight, choosing the 52nd anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrins moon landing. He too had childhood dreams of traveling to space, Bezos said via Instagram. On July 20th, I will take that journey with my brother. The greatest adventure, with my best friend. Branson was supposed to fly later this year on the second of three more test flights planned by Virgin Galactic before flying ticket holders next year. But late last week, he leapfrogged ahead.  He insists hes not trying to beat Bezos and that its not a race. Yet his announcement came just hours after Bezos revealed hed be joined in space by Wally Funk, one of the last surviving members of the so-called Mercury 13. The 13 female pilots never made it to space despite passing the same tests in the early 1960s as NASAs original, all-male Mercury 7 astronauts. Bezos hasnt commented publicly on Bransons upcoming flight.  But some at Blue Origin already are nitpicking the fact that their capsule surpasses the designated Karman line of space 62 miles (100 kilometers) up, while Virgin Galactics peak altitude is 55 miles (88 kilometers). International aeronautic and astronautic federations in Europe recognize the Karman line as the official boundary between the upper atmosphere and space, while NASA, the Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and some astrophysicists accept a minimum altitude of 50 miles (80 kilometers). Blue Origins flights last 10 minutes by the time the capsule parachutes onto the desert floor. Virgin Galactics last around 14 to 17 minutes from the time the space plane drops from the mothership and fires its rocket motor for a steep climb until it glides to a runway landing. SpaceXs Elon Musk doesnt do quick up-and-down hops to the edge of space. His capsules go all the way to orbit, and hes shooting for Mars.  There is a big difference between reaching space and reaching orbit, Musk said last week on Twitter. Musk already has carried 10 astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA, and his companys first private spaceflight is coming up in September for another billionaire whos purchased a three-day, globe-circling ride. Regardless of how high they fly, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin already are referring to their prospective clients as astronauts. More than 600 have reserved seats with Virgin Galactic at $250,000. Blue Origin expects to announce prices and open ticket sales once Bezos flies.  Phil McAlister, NASAs commercial spaceflight director, considers it a space renaissance, especially as the space station gets set to welcome a string of paying visitors, beginning with a Russian actress and movie producer in October, a pair of Japanese in December and a SpaceX-delivered crew of businessmen in January. The way I see it is the more, the better, right? McAlister said. More, better. This is precisely the future NASA wanted once the shuttles retired and private companies took over space station ferry flights. Atlantis blasted off on the last shuttle flight 10 years ago Thursday. NASAs final shuttle commander, Chris Ferguson, who now works for Boeing on its Starliner crew capsule, is impressed that Branson and Bezos are launching ahead of customers. Thats one surefire way to show confidence in your product is to get on it, Ferguson said at Thursdays 10th anniversary shuttle celebrations. Im sure that this was not a decision made lightly. I wish them both well. I think its great. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

EXPLAINER: How Richard Branson will ride own rocket to space,"Virgin Galactic will become the first rocket company to launch the boss when Richard Branson straps into one of his sleek, shiny space planes this weekend. The self-described tie-loathing adventurer and troublemaker will join five company employees for Sundays test flight from New Mexicos southern desert  the companys fourth trip to the edge of space.  Branson assigned himself to Virgin Galactics first full-scale crew, jumping ahead of Blue Origins Jeff Bezos, an even richer rocketeer looking to launch himself into space. Bezos liftoff is set for July 20 from West Texas. A brief look at Bransons ride and company: BOSS ON BOARD Just a week shy of turning 71, the London-born founder of the Virgin Group says hes not apprehensive at all and it is the dream of a lifetime to ride into space. The longtime fitness fanatic put in extra effort to prepare for the brief up-and-down flight. Im in my 70s now so you either let yourself go or you get fit and enjoy life. His wife, children and grandchildren will be there as he climbs aboard the rocket plane thats attached to a dual-fuselage aircraft for takeoff. During the three to four minutes of weightlessness, Ill be looking back at our beautiful Earth and taking it all in and realize that only 500 other people have done this. Closer to 600, actually, but still a relatively small number. Upon landing, hell celebrate with a great, great grin on my face. WHO ELSE IS FLYING Two pilots are needed to fly the rocket plane from the time its released from the mothership to shoot into space until it glides down to a runway. It will be the third trip to space for chief pilot David Mackay, a Scottish-born test pilot for the Royal Air Force who went on to fly for Bransons Virgin Atlantic, and the second for chief flight instructor Michael Masucci. Chief astronaut instructor Beth Moses, a former NASA engineer, is also launching for the second time. Joining Branson as space rookies are lead operations engineer Colin Bennett and Sirisha Bandla, a vice president. The six will grab a lift from mothership pilots C.J. Sturckow, a former NASA astronaut, and Kelly Latimer.  
        
     ROCKET PLANE Virgin Galactics space plane, Unity, will take off attached to a specially designed double aircraft nicknamed Eve after Bransons late mother. After reaching nearly 50,000 feet (15,000 meters), the plane will be released and drop for a moment or two before its rocket motor ignites to send the craft on a steep climb toward space, exceeding 3 Gs, or three times the force of Earths gravity. The motor will shut off once the craft reaches space  a maximum altitude of about 55 miles (88 kilometers) is anticipated  enveloping the ship in silence as everyone but the pilots unbuckle, float and gaze out the 17 windows at Earth and the black void of space. After a few minutes of weightlessness, the occupants will strap back in as the plane reorients itself for entry  folding up its wings, then folding them back down in unique technique known as feathering. The rocket plane will glide back, NASA space shuttle style, to conclude about 15 minutes of free flight.  TRACK RECORD Founded in 2004, Virgin Galactic got its start when Branson teamed up with aircraft designer Burt Rutan to provide the necessary spaceship technology. A 2007 rocket motor test in Californias Mojave Desert left three workers dead and three more injured. Then in 2014 the rocket plane Enterprise  named after the Star Trek ship  broke apart during a test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring the other. Unity, the replacement ship named by the late physicist Stephen Hawking, began flight tests in 2016. It made its first trip to the edge of space with two pilots in 2018 and the second in 2019, both times from Mojave. The operations moved to New Mexicos Spaceport America, with the plane soaring from there on May 22 to achieve the companys third spaceflight.  WHATS NEXT After Bransons launch, Virgin Galactic plans two more test flights this summer and fall before inviting paying customers on board. The next one will include more company employees, and the last will have Italian Air Force members conducting research. If all goes well, the first of the more than 600 confirmed ticket holders will climb aboard next year. The company plans to reopen reservations once Branson soars. Initial tickets went for $250,000; no word on whether that will change.

Billionaire Richard Branson reaches space in his own ship,"TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP)  Swashbuckling billionaire Richard Branson hurtled into space aboard his own winged rocket ship Sunday, bringing astro-tourism a step closer to reality and beating out his exceedingly richer rival Jeff Bezos. The nearly 71-year-old Branson and five crewmates from his Virgin Galactic space-tourism company reached an altitude of 53.5 miles (86 kilometers) over the New Mexico desert  enough to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and witness the curvature of the Earth  and then glided back home to a runway landing. The whole thing, it was just magical, a jubilant Branson said on his return aboard the gleaming white space plane, named Unity.  The brief, up-and-down flight  the space planes portion took only about 15 minutes, or about as long as Alan Shepards first U.S. spaceflight in 1961  was a splashy and unabashedly commercial plug for Virgin Galactic, which plans to start taking paying customers on joyrides next year. Branson became the first person to blast off in his own spaceship, beating Bezos, the richest person on the planet, by nine days. He also became the second septuagenarian to go into space. Astronaut John Glenn flew on the shuttle at age 77 in 1998. Bezos sent his congratulations, adding: Cant wait to join the club!  though he also took to Twitter a couple of days earlier to enumerate the ways in which be believes his companys tourist rides will be better. 
        
     With about 500 people watching, including Bransons family, Unity was carried aloft underneath a twin-fuselage aircraft. Then, at an altitude of about 8 1/2 miles (13 kilometers), Unity detached from the mother ship and fired its engine, reaching more than Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound, as it pierced the edge of space.  Spectators cheered, jumped into the air and embraced as the rocket plane touched down on Earth. Branson pumped his fists as he stepped out onto the runway and ran toward his family, bear-hugging his wife and children and scooping up his grandchildren in his arms. Mike Moses, a top executive at Virgin Galactic, said that apart from some problems with the transmission of video images from inside the cabin, the flight was perfect, and the ship looked pristine. That was an amazing accomplishment, former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, a one-time commander of the International Space Station, said from the sidelines. Im just so delighted at what this open door is going to lead to now. Its a great moment. Virgin Galactic conducted three previous test flights into space with crews of just two or three.  The flamboyant, London-born founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways wasnt supposed to fly until later this summer. But he assigned himself to an earlier flight after Bezos announced plans to ride his own rocket into space from Texas on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Branson denied he was trying to outdo Bezos. Bransons other chief rival in the space-tourism race among the worlds richest men, SpaceXs Elon Musk, came to New Mexico to watch and congratulated Branson for a beautiful flight. Bezos Blue Origin company intends to send tourists past the so-called Karman line 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth, which is recognized by international aviation and aerospace federations as the threshold of space. But NASA, the Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and some astrophysicists consider the boundary between the atmosphere and space to begin 50 miles (80 kilometers) up. The risks to Branson and his crew were underscored in 2007, when a rocket motor test in Californias Mojave Desert left three workers dead, and in 2014, when a Virgin Galactic rocket plane broke apart during a test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring the other. Ever the showman, Branson insisted on a global livestream of the Sunday morning flight and invited celebrities and former space station astronauts to the companys Spaceport America base in New Mexico. R&B singer Khalid performed his new single New Normal  a nod to the dawning of space tourism  while CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert served as master of ceremonies. Before climbing aboard, Branson, who has kite-surfed the English Channel and attempted to circle the world in a hot-air balloon, signed the astronaut log book and wisecracked: The names Branson. Sir Richard Branson. Astronaut Double-oh-one. License to thrill. But asked afterward whether he is planning any more adventures, Branson said he will definitely give it a rest for the time being because Im not sure it would be fair to put my family through another one. He said he thinks he holds the record for being pulled out of the sea five times by helicopter. Virgin Galactic already has more than 600 reservations from would-be space tourists, with tickets initially costing $250,000 apiece. And upon his return to Earth, Branson announced a sweepstakes drawing for two seats on a Virgin Galactic jaunt. Blue Origin is waiting for Bezos flight before announcing its ticket prices. Kerianne Flynn, who signed up in 2011 to fly with Virgin Galactic, had butterflies ahead of the launch Sunday. I think theres going to be nothing like going up there and looking back down on the Earth, which is what I think Im most excited about, she said. She added: Hopefully the next generations will be able to explore whats up there. Blue Origin and Musks SpaceX both fly Apollo-style, using capsules atop rockets, instead of an air-launched, reusable space plane. SpaceX, which is already launching astronauts to the space station for NASA and building moon and Mars ships, plans to take tourists on more than just brief, up-and-down trips. Customers will instead go into orbit around the Earth for days, with seats costing well into the millions. The companys first private flight is set for September. Musk himself has not committed to going into space anytime soon. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

18-year-old joining Blue Origins 1st passenger spaceflight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An 18-year-old is about to become the youngest person in space, rocketing away with an aviation pioneer who will become the oldest at age 82. Blue Origin announced Thursday that instead of a $28 million auction winner launching with founder Jeff Bezos on Tuesday, the Dutch son of another bidder will be on board. The company said Oliver Daemen will be the first paying customer, but did not disclose the price of his ticket. But a family spokesperson said it will be considerably less than the winning bid. Daemen snagged the fourth and last seat on the space capsule after the auction winner stepped aside because of a scheduling conflict. The offer came in a surprise phone call from Blue Origin last week, he said. This is so unbelievably cool! Daemen said in a statement. The flight to and into space only takes 10 minutes, but I already know that these will be the most special 10 minutes of my life. He added in a video posted by Dutch broadcaster RTL: I am super excited to experience zero-g and see the world from above. Also on Blue Origins first launch with passengers: Bezos brother and Wally Funk, one of 13 female pilots who went through the same tests in the early 1960s as NASAs Mercury 7 astronauts but never made it into space because only men were allowed. The four will blast off from West Texas atop a New Shepard rocket for a 10-minute flight. The Amazon founder will become the second person to ride his own rocket into space, following Virgin Galactics Richard Branson by nine days. 
        
     The teen tourist was going to be on the second launch for paying customers, according to Blue Origin. But once the auction winner dropped out, the company seized on the idea of flying the oldest and youngest people in space on the same flight, the family spokesperson noted. His undisclosed ticket cost will be donated to charity, just as most of the winning $28 million was distributed this week to a variety of space education and advocacy groups. This marks the beginning of commercial operations for New Shepard, and Oliver represents a new generation of people who will help us build a road to space, Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith said in a statement. Blue Origin has yet to open ticket sales to the public or disclose its anticipated prices. Thats expected following the upcoming flight. Daemen took a year off after graduating from high school last year to obtain his private pilots license. Hell attend the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands in September.  His father is Joes Daemen, founder and CEO of Somerset Capital Partners, a private equity firm in Oisterwijk, Netherlands. Both father and son were on their way to Texas on Thursday to prepare for the launch, according to their spokesperson..  The elder Daemen said he bid on the seat during the June 12 auction. But when the bids started to skyrocket during the auction, we dropped out, he said in a statement. Blue Origin said the unidentified auction winner will catch a future flight.  Daemen already has gotten some good space-traveling advice from Dutch astronaut and two-time space flier Andre Kuipers. According to the statement, Kuipers told him not to make the classic mistake of taking pictures in the short time he is up, but to fully enjoy the view of our beautiful planet. Soviet cosmonaut Ghermon Titov holds the record for the youngest to fly in space. He was 25 when he blasted into orbit four months after Yuri Gagarin, the first person in space. John Glenn was 77 when he launched aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998, 37 years after becoming the first American to orbit the world. ___ AP reporter Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Bezos Blue Origin gets OK to send him, 3 others to space","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Jeff Bezos rocket company has gotten government approval to launch people into space, himself included. The Amazon founder will climb atop his New Shepard rocket next Tuesday in West Texas, joined by his brother, an 82-year-old female aviation pioneer and a $28 million auction winner. It will be the first launch with passengers for Blue Origin, which like Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic plans to start flying paying customers in the months ahead.  The Federal Aviation Administration issued its OK on Monday. The license is good through August. On Sunday, Virgin Galactics billionaire founder Richard Branson rode his own rocket plane to space, accompanied by five company employees. A specially designed aircraft carried the winged ship aloft over New Mexico. The space plane dropped away, fired its rocket motor and soared to 53.5 miles (86 kilometers), before gliding to a runway touchdown. Blue Origins flight  featuring an automated capsule launched atop a reusable booster  should reach a maximum altitude of roughly 66 miles (106 kilometers) before parachuting into the desert. Joining Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic in the chase for space tourists is Elon Musks SpaceX. But SpaceX plans to send its customers into orbit, not on brief up-and-down hops. Musk has yet to commit to a launch himself. Bezos, 57, stepped down last week as Amazons CEO.

Hubble Space Telescope fixed after month of no science,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Hubble Space Telescope should be back in action soon, following a tricky, remote repair job by NASA.  The orbiting observatory went dark in mid-June, with all astronomical viewing halted.  NASA initially suspected a 1980s-era computer as the source of the problem. But after the backup payload computer also failed, flight controllers at Marylands Goddard Space Flight Center focused on the science instruments bigger and more encompassing command and data unit, installed by spacewalking astronauts in 2009.  Engineers successfully switched to the backup equipment Thursday, and the crucial payload computer kicked in. NASA said Friday that science observations should resume quickly, if everything goes well.  A similar switch took place in 2008 after part of the older system failed. Congrats to the team! NASAs science mission chief Thomas Zurbuchen tweeted. Launched in 1990, Hubble has made more than 1.5 million observations of the universe. NASA launched five repair missions to the telescope during the space shuttle program. The final tuneup was in 2009. NASA plans to launch Hubbles successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, by years end. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Just 7% of our DNA is unique to modern humans, study shows","WASHINGTON (AP)  What makes humans unique? Scientists have taken another step toward solving an enduring mystery with a new tool that may allow for more precise comparisons between the DNA of modern humans and that of our extinct ancestors. Just 7% of our genome is uniquely shared with other humans, and not shared by other early ancestors, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. Thats a pretty small percentage, said Nathan Schaefer, a University of California computational biologist and co-author of the new paper. This kind of finding is why scientists are turning away from thinking that we humans are so vastly different from Neanderthals. The research draws upon DNA extracted from fossil remains of now-extinct Neanderthals and Denisovans dating back to around 40,000 or 50,000 years ago, as well as from 279 modern people from around the world.  Scientists already know that modern people share some DNA with Neanderthals, but different people share different parts of the genome. One goal of the new research was to identify the genes that are exclusive to modern humans. Its a difficult statistical problem, and the researchers developed a valuable tool that takes account of missing data in the ancient genomes, said John Hawks, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who was not involved in the research.  
        
     The researchers also found that an even smaller fraction of our genome  just 1.5%  is both unique to our species and shared among all people alive today. Those slivers of DNA may hold the most significant clues as to what truly distinguishes modern human beings. We can tell those regions of the genome are highly enriched for genes that have to do with neural development and brain function, said University of California, Santa Cruz computational biologist Richard Green, a co-author of the paper.  In 2010, Green helped produce the first draft sequence of a Neanderthal genome. Four years later, geneticist Joshua Akey co-authored a paper showing that modern humans carry some remnants of Neanderthal DNA. Since then, scientists have continued to refine techniques to extract and analyze genetic material from fossils. Better tools allow us to ask increasingly more detailed questions about human history and evolution, said Akey, who is now at Princeton and was not involved in the new research. He praised the methodology of the new study.  However, Alan Templeton, a population geneticist at Washington University in St Louis, questioned the authors assumption that changes in the human genome are randomly distributed, rather than clustered around certain hotspots within the genome.  The findings underscore that were actually a very young species, said Akey. Not that long ago, we shared the planet with other human lineages. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

EXPLAINER: How Blue Origins Jeff Bezos will soar into space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  When Blue Origin launches people into space for the first time, founder Jeff Bezos will be on board. No test pilots or flight engineers for Tuesdays debut flight from West Texas, just Bezos, his brother, an 82-year-old aviation pioneer and a teenage tourist. The capsule is entirely automated, unlike Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic rocket plane that required two pilots to get him to space and back a week ago. Bransons advice? Just sit back, relax, look out of the window, just absorb the view outside, he said on CBS The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.  Differences in quirks and rockets aside, the billionaire rivals are gearing up to launch just about anybody willing to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for a brief up-and-down space hop. A brief look at what awaits Bezos and his passengers:  BEZOS ON BOARD Bezos created Blue Origin in 2000, a move that he said prompted his high school girlfriend to observe, Jeff started Amazon just to get enough money to do Blue Origin  and I cant prove her wrong. He has said he finances the rocket company by selling $1 billion in Amazon stock a year. Bezos caught the space bug at age 5 while watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrins moon landing on July, 20, 1969. He chose the 52nd anniversary for his own launch. Enamored by space history, Bezos named his New Shepard rocket after Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and his bigger, still-in-development New Glenn rocket after John Glenn, the first American in orbit. The 57-year-old Bezos  who also owns The Washington Post  stepped down as Amazons CEO earlier this month and last week donated $200 million to the Smithsonian Institution to renovate its National Air and Space Museum and launch an education center. To see the Earth from space, it changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity, he said. Its a thing Ive wanted to do all my life.  WHO ELSE IS FLYING 
        
     Bezos personally invited two of his fellow passengers  his 50-year-old brother Mark, an investor and volunteer firefighter, and female aviation pioneer Wally Funk. Joining them will be Oliver Daemen, a last-minute fill-in for the winner of a $28 million charity auction who had a scheduling conflict. At age 82, Funk will become the oldest person in space. She was among 13 female pilots  the so-called Mercury 13  who took the same tests in the early 1960s as NASAs Mercury 7 astronauts, but were barred because of their gender. Finally! Funk exclaimed when offered a seat alongside Bezos. As for the Dutch Daemen  who at 18 will become the youngest person in space  his financier father bid on the capsule seat in June, but dropped out when the price soared. Blue Origin came calling just over a week ago, after the unidentified auction winner switched to a later flight. The teenage space fanatic, who starts college this fall, is Blue Origins first paying customer; no word on what his ticket cost. ROCKET AND CAPSULE While Bezos wont be the first boss to ride to space on his own rocket, he can lay claim to strapping in for his companys first human launch. Hes also aiming higher, with an anticipated altitude of about 66 miles (106 kilometers) versus Bransons 53.5 miles (86 kilometers). Blue Origins 60-foot (18-meter) New Shepard rocket will accelerate toward space at three times the speed of sound, or Mach 3, before separating from the capsule and returning for an upright landing. The passengers will experience three to four minutes of weightlessness, before their capsule parachutes onto the desert just 10 minutes after liftoff. Thats five minutes less than Alan Shepards 1961 Mercury flight. Blue Origin, though, offers the biggest windows ever built for a spacecraft. Bezos purchased the desolate, parched land for launching and landing rockets. The closest town is Van Horn, population 1,832.  TRACK RECORD Blue Origin has completed 15 test flights to space since 2015, carrying up experiments, childrens postcards and Mannequin Skywalker, the companys passenger stand-in. Except for the booster crash-landing on the first trip, all the demos were successful. One rocket ended up flying seven times and another five. The capsules also were recycled. Blue Origin deliberately aborted a couple flights after liftoff to test the emergency escape system on the capsule. The pace seemed slow compared with the competition, and many wondered why Blue Origin  its motto Gradatim Ferociter, or step by step ferociously  was taking so long to launch people. Based in Kent, Washington, the company kept fairly mum on its launch plans. Bezos finally announced its time following the last test flight in April, a dress rehearsal that saw mock passengers briefly climb aboard before liftoff. The rocket and capsule that will be used Tuesday have flown twice before. WHATS NEXT Blue Origin is expected to open ticket sales soon after Bezos flies and has already lined up some of the other auction bidders. The company hasnt disclosed the cost of a ride. The fourth seat on the upcoming flight was auctioned off for $28 million. Nineteen space advocacy and education groups are getting $1 million each as a result, with the rest to be used by Blue Origins Club for the Future for its own education effort. While the diminutive New Shepard is meant to launch people on brief flights to the edge of space, the mega New Glenn will be capable of hauling cargo and eventually crew into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida, possibly beginning late next year. Blue Origin also has its eyes on the moon. Its proposed lunar lander, Blue Moon, lost to SpaceXs Starship in NASAs recent commercial competition to develop the technology for getting the next astronauts onto the moon. Blue Origin is challenging the contract award, as is , the other competitor.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Jeff Bezos blasts into space on own rocket: Best day ever!,"VAN HORN, Texas (AP)  Jeff Bezos blasted into space Tuesday on his rocket companys first flight with people on board, becoming the second billionaire in just over a week to ride his own spacecraft. The Amazon founder was accompanied by a hand-picked group: his brother, an 18-year-old from the Netherlands and an 82-year-old aviation pioneer from Texas  the youngest and oldest to ever fly in space. Best day ever! Bezos said when the capsule touched down on the desert floor in remote West Texas after the 10-minute flight. Named after Americas first astronaut, Blue Origins New Shepard rocket soared on the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, a date chosen by Bezos for its historical significance. He held fast to it, even as Virgin Galactics Richard Branson pushed up his own flight from New Mexico and beat him to space by nine days. The two private companies chasing space tourism dollars, though, have drawn criticism for catering to the rich while so many are struggling amid the pandemic. During Tuesdays flight, Blue Origins capsule reached an altitude of about 66 miles (106 kilometers), more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) higher than Bransons July 11 ride. The 60-foot (18-meter) booster accelerated to Mach 3 or three times the speed of sound to get the capsule high enough, before separating and landing upright.  Unlike Bransons piloted rocket plane, Bezos capsule was completely automated and required no official staff on board for the up-and-down flight. 
        
     During their several minutes of weightlessness, video from inside the capsule showed the four floating, doing somersaults, tossing Skittles candies and throwing balls, with lots of cheering, whooping and exclamations of Wow! The Bezos brothers also joined their palms to display a HI MOM greeting written on their hands. The capsule landed under parachutes, with Bezos and his guests briefly experiencing nearly six times the force of gravity, or 6 Gs, on the way back. Led by Bezos, they climbed out of the capsule after touchdown with wide grins, embracing parents, partners and children, then popped open bottles of sparkling wine, spraying one another. My expectations were high and they were dramatically exceeded, Bezos said later. Their flight lasted 10 minutes and 10 seconds  five minutes shy of Alan Shepards Freedom 7 flight in 1961. Shepards daughters, Laura and Julie, were introduced at a press event a few hours later. Sharing Bezos dream-come-true adventure was Wally Funk, from the Dallas area, one of 13 female pilots who went through the same tests as NASAs all-male astronaut corps in the early 1960s but never made it into space. Ive been waiting a long time to finally get it up there, Funk said. I want to go again  fast, she added. Joining them on the ultimate joyride was the companys first paying customer, Oliver Daemen, a last-minute fill-in for the mystery winner of a $28 million charity auction who opted for a later flight. The Dutch teens father took part in the auction, and agreed on a lower undisclosed price last week when Blue Origin offered his son the vacated seat. It was so amazing, Daemen said. Lets hope that many, many more people can do this. Four hours after their flight, Bezos drove his crew over to see the rocket that carried them safely to space.  Among the items brought on the flight: A pair of aviator Amelia Earharts goggles and a piece of fabric from the original Wright Flyer. I got goose bumps, said Angel Herrera of El Paso, who watched the launch from inside Van Horn High School, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) away. The hair on the back of my neck stood up, just witnessing history. No one is rushing to buy a ticket from this bleak and isolated town. This ride is only for the wealthy, pizza shop owner Jesus Ramirez said after watching the launch, adding that he hoped the venture would attract businesses to the town and provide opportunities for local companies. Blue Origin  founded by Bezos in 2000 in Kent, Washington, near Amazons Seattle headquarters  hasnt revealed its price for a ride to space but has lined up spots for other auction bidders. Ticket sales, including the auction, are approaching $100 million, Bezos said. Two more flights are planned by years end. The recycled rocket and capsule used Tuesday flew on the last two space demos, according to company officials. Virgin Galactic already has more than 600 reservations at $250,000 apiece. Founded by Branson in 2004, the company has sent crew into space four times and plans two more test flights from New Mexico before launching customers next year. Blue Origins approach was slower and more deliberate. After 15 successful unoccupied test flights to space since 2015, Bezos finally declared it was time to put people on board. The Federal Aviation Administration agreed last week, approving the commercial space license. Bezos, 57, who also owns The Washington Post, claimed the first seat. The next went to his 50-year-old brother, Mark Bezos, an investor and volunteer firefighter, then Funk and Daemen. They spent two days together in training. University of Chicago space historian Jordan Bimm said the passenger makeup is truly remarkable. Imagine if the head of NASA decided he wanted to launch in 1961 instead of Shepard on the first U.S. spaceflight, he said in an email. That would have been unthinkable! Bimm said. It shows just how much the idea of who and what space is for has changed in the last 60 years. Bezos stepped down this month as Amazons CEO and last week donated $200 million to renovate the National Air and Space Museum.  Fewer than 600 people have reached the edge of space or beyond. Until Tuesday, the youngest was 25-year-old Soviet cosmonaut Gherman Titov and the oldest at 77 was Mercury-turned-shuttle astronaut John Glenn. Both Bezos and Branson want to drastically increase those overall numbers, as does SpaceXs Elon Musk, whos skipping brief space hops and sending his private clients straight to orbit for tens of millions apiece, with the first flight coming up in September. Were going to build a road to space so our kids and their kids can build the future, Bezos said. We need to do that to solve the problems here on Earth. Despite appearances, Bezos and Branson insist they werent trying to outdo each other by strapping in themselves. Bezos noted this week that only one person can lay claim to being first in space: Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who rocketed into orbit on April 12, 1961. Branson sent a congratulatory tweet: Impressive! Very best to all the crew from me and all the team at Virgin Galactic. Blue Origin is working on a massive rocket, New Glenn, to put payloads and people into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The company also wants to put astronauts back on the moon with its proposed lunar lander Blue Moon; its challenging NASAs sole contract award to SpaceX. Included in the many people that Bezos thanked Tuesday was every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer. Because you guys paid for all this. Bezos has said he finances the rocket company by selling $1 billion in Amazon stock each year.  ___ AP reporters Sean Murphy in Van Horn and Candice Choi in New York contributed to this report.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

EXPLAINER: Whats making mid-Atlantic songbirds sick?,"WASHINGTON (AP)  A mysterious ailment has sickened and killed thousands of songbirds in several mid-Atlantic states since late spring. While scientists are still racing to confirm the cause, it seems juvenile birds may be most susceptible. The U.S. Geological Survey, which oversees responses to some natural hazards and risks, has recommended that people temporarily take down bird feeders and clean out bird baths to reduce places that birds could closely congregate and potentially spread disease.  WHICH BIRDS ARE AFFECTED? So far the majority of birds reported as ailing have been fledgling blue jays, American robins, European starlings and common grackles, but other songbirds are also affected.  The main visible symptoms are swollen eyes or crusty discharge around the eyes, as well as off-balance movements that may indicate neurological damage. WHERE ARE BIRDS GETTING SICK? Wildlife managers and veterinarians first received reports in late April and May of sick birds in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Washington, D.C. More recent reports have come from Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Ohio and Indiana. The outbreak may have peaked in June and be declining in some early hotspots, but its ongoing in other regions, according to Brian Evans, a bird ecologist at the Smithsonian National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute.  WHATS CAUSING THE SICKNESS? 
        
     Scientists at the USGS, the  Smithsonian and universities are still working to determine the causes. Through testing of sick and deceased birds, they have determined that this outbreak was not primarily caused by salmonella, chlamydia, avian influenza virus, West Nile virus or a few other viruses that commonly afflict birds. WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP? USGS is recommending that people remove backyard bird feeders, avoid handling sick birds and keep pets away from birds. The agency also recommends that people with bird baths disinfect them with a solution of 10% bleach and 90% water.  Because we dont know what it is, we have to be that much more vigilant. We still dont know if its caused by a virus or a bacteria or a toxic chemical in pesticides, said Jordan Rutter, director of public relations at the American Bird Conservancy, a nonprofit group.  However, removing bird feeders doesnt have to mean ignoring the needs of birds. Rutter suggested that people with yards could incorporate native plants that provide food, such as berries and nectar, while also attracting insects birds eat. HOW UNUSUAL IS THIS OUTBREAK? Birds are susceptible to several viruses and bacteria. When a contagious pathogen begins to spread among birds in an area, wildlife managers typically recommend that residents remove outdoor feeders. This spring an outbreak of salmonella among wild songbirds in several states caused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue such a  warning.  Whats different in this instance is that scientists do not know the cause of the ailment. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Crafty cockatoos master dumpster diving and teach each other,"WASHINGTON (AP)  A few years ago, a Sydney scientist noticed a sulfur-crested cockatoo opening his trash bin. Not every resident would be thrilled, but ornithologist Richard Major was impressed by the ingenuity.  Its quite a feat for a bird to grasp a bin lid with its beak, pry it open, then shuffle far enough along the bins edge that the lid falls backward  revealing edible trash treasures inside. Intrigued, Major teamed up with researchers in Germany to study how many cockatoos learned this trick. In early 2018, they found from a survey of residents that birds in three Sydney suburbs had mastered the novel foraging technique. By the end of 2019, birds were lifting bins in 44 suburbs.  From three suburbs to 44 in two years is a pretty rapid spread, said Major, who is based at the Australian Museum. The researchers next question was whether the cockatoos had each figured out how to do this alone  or whether they copied the strategy from experienced birds. And their research published Thursday in the journal Science concluded the birds mostly learned by watching their peers.  That spread wasnt just popping up randomly. It started in southern suburbs and radiated outwards, said Major. Basically, it caught on like a hot dance move. Scientists have documented other examples of social learning in birds. One classic case involves small birds called blue tits that learned to puncture foil lids of milk bottles in the United Kingdom starting in the 1920s  a crafty move, though less complex and physically demanding than opening trash bins. 
        
     But observing a new cultural trend spreading in the wild  or suburbs  in real time afforded the cockatoo researchers a special opportunity, said Lucy Aplin, a cognitive ecologist at Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavioral in Germany and co-author of the study. This is a scientists dream, she said. During summer of 2019, trash-collection day in suburban Sydney was the teams research day. As garbage trucks rolled down their routes and people shoved bins to the curb, Max Planck Institute behavioral ecologist Barbara Klump drove around and stopped to record cockatoos landing on bins. Not all cockatoos succeeded in opening them, but she took around 160 videos of victorious efforts.  Analyzing the footage, Klump realized the vast majority of birds opening bins were males, which tend to be larger than females. The birds that mastered the trick also tended to be dominant in social hierarchies. This suggests that if youre more socially connected, you have more opportunities to observe and acquire new behavior  and also to spread it, she said. Cockatoos are extremely gregarious birds that forage in small groups, roost in large ones, and are rarely seen alone in Sydney. While many animals have declined with the expansion of Australian cities, these bold and flamboyant birds generally have thrived.  In an unpredictable, rapidly changing environment with unpredictable food sources, opportunistic animals thrive, said Isabelle Laumer, a behavioral researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research. Over the past decade, research has shown that urban adaptability is correlated with traits like innovativeness, behavioral flexibility and exploration, said Max Planck Institutes Aplin. What the new research adds to that understanding is that critters that easily transmit knowledge and new skills socially also have an advantage.  Parrots  which include cockatoos  are known for being among the most clever birds. They have a brain just the size of a walnut, but the density of neurons packed into their forebrains gives many species cognitive abilities similar to great apes, said Irene Pepperberg, an animal cognition researcher at Harvard, who has studied African grey parrots and was not involved in the new paper. While African grey parrots are known for their ability to mimic and sometimes comprehend  human speech, cockatoos are famously adept at using and manipulating new tools, such as puzzle boxes in the lab or trash bin lids in the wild, she said. Everyone in Sydney has an opinion about cockatoos, said the Australian Museums Major. Whether you to love to watch these big flamboyant social birds, or think theyre a pest, you have to respect them. Theyve adapted so brilliantly to living with humans, to human domination of the environment. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX launches, lands Starship in 1st successful flight","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched and successfully landed its futuristic Starship on Wednesday, finally nailing a test flight of the rocketship that Elon Musk intends to use to land astronauts on the moon and send people to Mars. The previous four tests flights ended in fiery explosions before, during or soon after touchdown at the southeastern tip of Texas, near Brownsville. This latest upgraded version of SpaceXs full-scale, stainless steel, bullet-shaped rocketship soared more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) over the Gulf of Mexico before flipping and descending horizontally, and then going vertical again just in time for touchdown.  Starbase Flight Control has confirmed, as you can see on the live video, we are down. The Starship has landed! announced launch commentator John Insprucker. A fire at the base of the 160-foot (50-meter) rocket quickly was extinguished, and the rocket remained standing after the six-minute flight. Musk tweeted the landing was nominal  by the book, in other words. Success came on the 60th anniversary of the flight of first American in space, Alan Shepard. And it capped a stunning two weeks of achievements for SpaceX: the launch of four more astronauts to the space station for NASA, the nations first nighttime crew splashdown since the Apollo moonshots, and a pair of launches for its mini internet satellites. Less than a month ago, NASA chose SpaceXs Starship to deliver astronauts to the lunar surface in the next few years. The $3 billion contract was halted last week, however, after the losing companies  Jeff Bezos Blue Origin and Dynetics  protested the selection. 
        
     Musk said last month that the NASA money will help development of Starship, which is meant to eventually launch atop a Super Heavy booster. He said its been a pretty expensive project so far and mostly funded internally. The first high-altitude test was in December. As you can tell, if youve been watching the videos, weve blown up a few of them. So excitement guaranteed, one way or another, Musk told reporters after the private companys second crew flight on April 23. Long after Wednesdays touchdown, Starship was still standing tall. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"AP Interview: NASA chief big on climate, hedges on moon date","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new administrator is big on tackling climate and diversifying the agencys workforce, but hedging on whether the U.S. can put astronauts on the moon by 2024.  In his first interview since becoming NASAs top official this week, former Sen. Bill Nelson told The Associated Press on Friday that tracking climate change is a top issue. He also wants to diversify the space agencys workforce so it reflects America.  His underlying vision for NASA: to explore the heavens with humans and machines.  For landing astronauts on the moon, Nelson said the goal remains 2024, a deadline set by the Trump administration. But he said he needs more time to review the matter, especially with challenges to the contract for the astronauts lunar lander. That is the intended schedule, but I think we have to put a dose of sobering reality into our analysis, he said from NASA headquarters in Washington. The lunar expeditions will benefit the Martian crews, according to Nelson. Whether the 2030s is still feasible for human Mars missions, all of that is being discussed, he said. Nelson commended Elon Musks SpaceX for its achievements over the past year  flying astronauts to and from the International Space Station for NASA, and just this week successfully launching and landing a full-scale Starship prototype for the first time. Starship is what NASA intends to use to land astronauts on the moon; that $3 billion contract, however, is being protested by the two losing companies. 
        
     Hes also in support of all the private flights coming up, first by Jeff Bezos Blue Origin to the fringes of space in July and then by SpaceX all the way to orbit in September.  Might the 78-year-old Nelson  who flew on space shuttle Columbia in 1986  be interested in a commercial space ride?  I double-dare them to offer me the opportunity, he said, laughing. He quickly clarified, Its time for the young ones. But he noted: Im still doing my pushups and Im still doing my pullups and Im still jogging  so dont tempt me. Nelson said he did not seek the NASA administrator job, and had recommended three women. He said he told the Biden administration he would accept the nomination only if one of the women could serve as his deputy. Selected for the job: former space shuttle commander Pam Melroy. Nelson is NASAs 14th administrator, the third to fly in space. He was sworn in Monday by Vice President Kamala Harris, who will head the National Space Council. In a show of bipartisan space support, the two previous administrators took part in the ceremony, representing the Obama and Trump administrations. Nelson steps into NASAs top job after 44 years of public service, 42 of them in an elected public office. Nelson grew up near Cape Canaveral, graduating from high school a year before Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space 60 years ago this week.  His paternal grandparents were homesteaders on what is now Kennedy Space Center property. He has a copy of the deed signed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1917. The 160 acres were located at the north end of the runway used for shuttle landings. Nelson went to law school and served in the U.S. Army Reserve during the Vietnam War. After a few terms in the Florida legislature, Nelson, a Democrat, won election to Congress, first in the House and then the Senate, before a 2018 defeat ended his political career. It was while Nelson was a congressman that he rode on the shuttle  just two weeks before Challengers astronauts perished during liftoff. Following the shuttles retirement in 2011, NASA had to rely on Russia to ferry its astronauts to and from the space station  until the first SpaceX crew flight last year.  Despite the differences of the political governments, weve always had that space cooperation, Nelson said. And it is my fervent hope that that will continue. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA Mars helicopter heard humming through planets thin air,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  First came the amazing pictures, then the video. Now NASA is sharing sounds of its little helicopter humming through the thin Martian air.  NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California released this first-ever audio Friday, just before Ingenuity made its fifth test flight, a short one-way trip to a new airfield.  During the fourth flight a week earlier, the low hum from the helicopter blades spinning at more than 2,500 revolutions per minute is barely audible. It almost sounds like a low-pitched, faraway mosquito or other flying insect. Thats because the 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) helicopter was more than 260 feet (80 meters) from the microphone on the Perseverance rover. The rumbling wind gusts also obscured the choppers sound. Scientists isolated the sound of the whirring blades and magnified it, making it easier to hear.  Ingenuity  the first powered aircraft to fly at another planet  arrived at Mars on Feb. 18, clinging to Perseverances belly. Its first flight was April 19; NASA named the takeoff and landing area Wright Brothers Field in honor of Wilbur and Orrville, who made the worlds first airplane flights in 1903. A stamp-size piece of wing fabric from the original Wright Flyer is aboard Ingenuity.  The $85 million tech demo was supposed to end a few days ago, but NASA extended the mission by at least a month to get more flying time.  
        
     For Friday afternoons 108-second test flight, the helicopter traveled southward in the same direction the rover is heading. Once over its new airfield, the chopper soared to twice its previous altitude  33 feet (10 meters)  took pictures, then landed. The two airfields are 423 feet (129 meters) apart. With the helicopters first phase complete, the rover can now start hunting for rocks that might contain signs of past microscopic life. Core samples will be collected for eventual return to Earth. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA spacecraft begins 2-year trip home with asteroid rubble,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  With rubble from an asteroid tucked inside, a NASA spacecraft fired its engines and began the long journey back to Earth on Monday, leaving the ancient space rock in its rearview mirror. The trip home for the robotic prospector, Osiris-Rex, will take two years.  Osiris-Rex reached asteroid Bennu in 2018 and spent two years flying near and around it, before collecting rubble from the surface last fall.  The University of Arizonas Dante Lauretta, the principal scientist, estimates the spacecraft holds between a half pound and 1 pound (200 grams and 400 grams) of mostly bite-size chunks. Either way, it easily exceeds the target of at least 2 ounces (60 grams). It will be the biggest cosmic haul for the U.S. since the Apollo moon rocks. While NASA has returned comet dust and solar wind samples, this is the first time its gone after pieces of an asteroid. Japan has accomplished it twice, but in tiny amounts. Scientists described Mondays departure from Bennus neighborhood as bittersweet. Ive been working on getting a sample back from an asteroid since my daughter was in diapers and now shes graduating from high school, so its been a long journey, said NASA project scientist Jason Dworkin.  Added Lauretta: We have gotten used to being at Bennu and seeing new and exciting images and data coming back to us here on Earth. Osiris-Rex was already nearly 200 miles (300 kilometers) from the solar-orbiting Bennu when it fired its main engines Monday afternoon for a fast, clean get-away.  
        
     Colorado-based flight controllers for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin applauded when confirmation arrived of the spacecrafts departure: Were bringing the samples home! Scientists hope to uncover some of the solar systems secrets from the samples vacuumed last October from Bennus dark, rough, carbon-rich surface. The asteroid is an estimated 1,600 feet (490 meters) wide and 4.5 billion years old. Bennu  considered a broken chunk from a bigger asteroid  is believed to hold the preserved building blocks of the solar system. The returning pieces could shed light on how the planets formed and how life arose on Earth. They also could improve Earths odds against any incoming rocks. Although the asteroid is 178 million miles (287 million kilometers) away, Osiris-Rex will put another 1.4 billion miles (2.3 billion kilometers) on its odometer to catch up with Earth.  The SUV-size spacecraft will circle the sun twice before delivering its small sample capsule to Utahs desert floor on Sept. 24, 2023, to end the more than $800 million mission. It launched from Cape Canaveral in 2016. The precious samples will be housed at a new lab under construction at NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston, already home to hundreds of pounds of lunar material collected by the 12 Apollo moonwalkers from 1969 to 1972. Scientists initially thought the spacecraft stored 2 pounds (1 kilogram) of asteroid rubble, but more recently revised their estimate downward. They wont know for certain how much is on board until the capsule is opened after touchdown. Every bit of sample is valuable, Dworkin said. We have to be patient. NASA has lots more asteroid projects planned. Set to launch in October, a spacecraft named Lucy will fly past swarms of asteroids out near Jupiter, while a spacecraft known as Dart will blast off in November in an attempt to redirect an asteroid as part of a planetary protection test. Then in 2022, the Psyche spacecraft will take off for an odd, metallic asteroid bearing the same name. None of these missions, however, involve sample return. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Japanese tycoon planning space station visit, then moon trip","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Japanese fashion tycoon whos booked a SpaceX ride to the moon is going to try out the International Space Station first.  Going to the ISS before the Moon, Yusaku Maezawa announced  Thursday via Twitter. Maezawa has bought two seats on a Russian Soyuz capsule. Hell blast off in December on the 12-day mission with his production assistant and a professional cosmonaut.  Im so curious, Whats life like in space? So, I am planning to find out on my own and share with the world, Maezawa said in a statement. Hell be the first person to pay his own way to the space station in more than a decade, according to Virginia-based Space Adventures, which brokered the deal. A Space Adventures spokeswoman declined to divulge the cost. The company has sent seven other tourists to the space station, from 2001 to 2009.  Maezawas trip to the moon aboard Elon Musks Starship is tentatively scheduled for 2023. Hell fly around the moon  not land  with eight contest winners. Maezawa, 45, who founded an online retail clothing business, will be joined by photographer and assistant Yozo Hirano. They will be escorted by Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin, whos spent nearly a year aboard the space station on two separate missions. The launch is scheduled for Dec. 8 from Kazakhstan.  Thursdays announcement comes amid a flurry of private space initiatives. 
        
     The Russian Space Agency announced Thursday that a Russian actress and movie director will launch to the space station in October for filming. The movie is tentatively titled Challenge. In January, the first private mission to the space station from the U.S. will bring three businessmen  from the U.S., Canada and Israel  who are paying about $55 million apiece. They will launch aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule from Kennedy Space Center and will be accompanied by a former NASA astronaut who now works for Houston-based Axiom Space, which arranged the deal. The company plans about two private missions to the space station a year. Before the space station visits, SpaceX will launch its first private spaceflight with four people on board, including tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who purchased the mission. They will spend three days orbiting Earth in September. This truly is a renaissance in U.S. human spaceflight, NASAs director of commercial spaceflight, Phil McAlister, told reporters Monday.

Protected areas cover a sixth of Earths land and freshwater,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Roughly a sixth of the planets land and freshwater area now lies within protected or conservation areas, according to a United Nations report  released Wednesday.  Next comes the hard part. The world needs to ensure that those regions are actually effectively managed to stabilize the climate and to curb biodiversity loss while also increasing the total area of protected places, scientists say.  Protected and conserved areas play a crucial role in tackling biodiversity loss, said Neville Ash, director of the U.N. Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre, which produced the report. But simply drawing lines on a map isnt enough. Conservation areas need to be effectively managed and equitably governed, he said. The  Protected Planet  report also found that about 8% of coastal and ocean waters are within protected areas.  There has been a substantial increase in the protection of marine ecosystems in the past decade. But the protection of land areas hasnt increased as much in that time, said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at Duke University, who was not involved in the report.  What we really need to know about is the quality of the protected areas  not just the quantity of square miles, Pimm added.  It is nowhere near enough, said Charles Barber, senior biodiversity advisor for the World Resources Institute, who was not involved in the report. We need to conserve half of the Earth if we are going to maintain the basic biological operating system of the planet.  
        
     Several scientific and environmental groups are now calling for 30% or 50%  of the planet to be protected. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden set a goal of conserving at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.  Theres plenty of scientific evidence that protected areas are the cornerstone of biodiversity protection and climate stabilization, said Eric Dinerstein, a conservation biologist at RESOLVE, a nonprofit group.  Humanity is heading for an environmental cliff  so we have to do a U-turn, he said. We know that the creation of more protected areas is absolutely vital.

"Wolves scare deer and reduce auto collisions 24%, study says","WASHINGTON (AP)  Ecologist Rolf Peterson remembers driving remote stretches of road in Michigans Upper Peninsula and seeing areas strewn with deer carcasses. But that changed after gray wolves arrived in the region from Canada and Minnesota. When wolves moved in during the 1990s and 2000s, the deer-vehicle collisions went way down, said the Michigan Tech researcher. Recently, another team of scientists has gathered data about road collisions and wolf movements in Wisconsin to quantify how the arrival wolves there affected the frequency of deer-auto collisions. They found it created what scientists call a landscape of fear. In a pretty short period of time, once wolves colonize a county, deer vehicle collisions go down about 24%, said Dominic Parker, a natural resources economist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and co-author of their new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Both thinning of the deer population by wolves and behavior changes in fearful deer are factors in the drop-off, Parker said.  When you have a major predator around, it impacts how the prey behave, he said. Wolves use linear features of a landscape as travel corridors, like roads, pipelines and stream beds. Deer learn this and can adapt by staying away.  Gray wolves, among the first species protected under the Endangered Species Act in 1973, were  reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995. But in other regions of the U.S., gray wolves have dispersed naturally; the population in the lower 48 states now totals about 5,500. 
        
     The new study said that the presence of wolves, maligned by ranchers whose livestock suffers predation, also can save money by indirectly reducing deer-vehicle collisions. In 2008, a study for the U.S. Department of Transportation estimated those crashes cost more than $8 billion annually. Most economic studies of wolves have been negative, focusing on livestock losses, said Dave Mech, a senior research scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey in Minnesota, who was not involved in the new study and praised it. But wolves also reshape ecosystems in many ways, although thats hard to measure economically.  Some studies have looked at tourism revenue generated by wolf-watchers in Yellowstone, but that money doesnt flow directly to communities living alongside wolves, said Jennifer Raynor, a natural resources economist at Wesleyan University and a co-author of the new study.  We wanted to look at other ways the wolves impacted the region, Raynor said. These auto collisions are happening, or not happening, in rural areas, and so are livestock damages. Michigan Techs Peterson, who was not involved in the research, said, If anything, the researchers underestimated the value of the deer-vehicle crashes. The deeper dimension of these collision costs can include large medical bills and, sometimes, human fatalities. A 2016 study found that cougars decreased the number of deer-vehicle crashes in parts of the eastern U.S. by about 22%. The wolf study adds to growing awareness that scientists should consider both the costs and the benefits of having large carnivores on the landscape, said Adrian Treves, a University of Wisconsin conservation biologist not involved in the study. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Cosmic 2-for-1: Total lunar eclipse combines with supermoon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The first total lunar eclipse in more than two years coincides with a supermoon this week for quite a cosmic show. This super blood moon will be visible Wednesday across the Pacific  offering the best viewing  as well as the western half of North America, bottom of South America and eastern Asia.  Better look quick: The total eclipse will last about 15 minutes as Earth passes directly between the moon and the sun. But the entire show will last five hours, as Earths shadow gradually covers the moon, then starts to ebb. The reddish-orange color is the result of all the sunrises and sunsets in Earths atmosphere projected onto the surface of the eclipsed moon. Hawaii has the best seat in the house and then short of that will be California and the Pacific Northwest, said NASAs Noah Petro, project scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. New Zealand and Australia also will have prime viewing. Circling the moon for 12 years, the orbiter will measure temperatures changes on the lunar surface during the eclipse. Telescopes atop Hawaiis Mauna Kea also will monitor the moon, Petro said.  The moon will be setting and the sun rising along the U.S. East Coast, leaving skygazers  Petro in Virginia included  pretty much out of luck. Europe, Africa and western Asia will miss everything. There will be livestreams available.  Everyone everywhere, though, can still soak in the brighter than usual moon, weather permitting. 
        
     The moon will be more than 220,000 miles (357,460 kilometers) away at its fullest. Its this proximity, combined with a full moon, that qualifies it as a supermoon, making it appear slightly bigger and more brilliant in the sky.  Last months supermoon, by contrast, was 96 miles (155 kilometers) more distant. Unlike a solar eclipse, theres no harm in looking at an eclipsed moon. More lunar shows are on the horizon. For people who might feel like were missing out, set your calendars for Nov. 19 of this year, Petro said. This will be a nearly total eclipse where the moon dims but doesnt turn red. The next total lunar eclipse will be May 2022. The last one was January 2019. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Whos an astronaut as private spaceflight picks up speed?,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  As more companies start selling tickets to space, a question looms: Who gets to call themselves an astronaut? Its already a complicated issue and about to get more so as the wealthy snap up spacecraft seats and even entire flights for themselves and their entourages. Astronauts? Amateur astronauts? Space tourists? Space sightseers? Rocket riders? Or as the Russians have said for decades, spaceflight participants? NASAs new boss Bill Nelson doesnt consider himself an astronaut even though he spent six days orbiting Earth in 1986 aboard space shuttle Columbia  as a congressman. I reserve that term for my professional colleagues, Nelson recently told The Associated Press.  Computer game developer Richard Garriott  who paid his way to the International Space Station in 2008 with the Russians  hates the space tourist label. I am an astronaut, he declared in an email, explaining that he trained for two years for the mission. If you go to space, youre an astronaut, said Axiom Spaces Michael Lopez-Alegria, a former NASA astronaut who will accompany three businessmen to the space station in January, flying SpaceX. His $55 million-a-seat clients plan to conduct research up there, he stressed, and do not consider themselves space tourists. On Tuesday, Axiom Space announced a second flight for next year that will be led by the companys Peggy Whitson, a retired NASA astronaut whos spent 665 days in space, more than any other American. Her No. 2 will be businessman-turned-race car driver John Shoffner, of Knoxville, Tennessee, whos also paying around $55 million. Ive asked Peggy to throw the book at me in training. Make me an astronaut, he said. 
        
     Theres something enchanting about the word: Astronaut comes from the Greek words for star and sailor. And swashbuckling images of The Right Stuff and NASAs original Mercury 7 astronauts make for great marketing.  Jeff Bezos rocket company, Blue Origin, is already calling its future clients astronauts. Its auctioning off one seat on its first spaceflight with people on board, targeted for July. NASA even has a new acronym: PAM for Private Astronaut Mission. Retired NASA astronaut Mike Mullane didnt consider himself an astronaut until his first space shuttle flight in 1984, six years after his selection by NASA.  It doesnt matter if you buy a ride or youre assigned to a ride, said Mullane, whose 2006 autobiography is titled Riding Rockets. Until you strap into a rocket and reach a certain altitude, youre not an astronaut. It remains a coveted assignment. More than 12,000 applied for NASAs upcoming class of astronauts; a lucky dozen or so will be selected in December. But what about passengers who are along for the ride, like the Russian actress and movie director who will fly to the space station in October? Or Japans moonstruck billionaire who will follow them from Kazakhstan in December with his production assistant tagging along to document everything? In each case, a professional cosmonaut will be in charge of the Soyuz capsule. SpaceXs high tech capsules are completely automated, as are Blue Origins. So should rich riders and their guests be called astronauts even if they learn the ropes in case they need to intervene in an emergency? Perhaps even more important, where does space begin? The Federal Aviation Administration limits its commercial astronaut wings to flight crews. The minimum altitude is 50 miles (80 kilometers). Its awarded seven so far; recipients include the two pilots for Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic who made another test flight of the companys rocket ship Saturday.  Others define space as beginning at an even 100 kilometers, or 62 miles above sea level. Blue Origins capsules are designed to reach that threshold and provide a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to Earth, By contrast, it takes 1 1/2 hours to circle the world. The Association of Space Explorers requires at least one orbit of Earth  in a spacecraft  for membership. The Astronauts Memorial Foundation honors all those who sacrificed their lives for the U.S. space program even if they never reached space, like Challenger schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe and the test pilot killed in a 2014 Virgin Galactic crash. Also on the Space Mirror Memorial at NASAs Kennedy Space Center: X-15 and F-104 Air Force pilots who were part of a military space program that never got off the ground. The astronaut debate has been around since the 1960s, according to Garriott. His late father, Owen Garriott, was among the first so-called scientist-astronauts hired by NASA; the test pilots in the office resented sharing the job title.  It might be necessary to retire the term altogether once hundreds if not thousands reach space, noted Fordham University history professor Asif Siddiqi, the author of several space books. Are we going to call each and every one of them astronauts? Mullane, the three-time space shuttle flier, suggests using astronaut first class, second class, third class, depending on what your involvement is, whether you pull out a wallet and write a check. While a military-style pecking order might work, former NASA historian Roger Launius warned: This gets really complicated really quickly. In the end, Mullane noted, Astronaut is not a copyrighted word. So anybody who wants to call themselves an astronaut can call themselves an astronaut, whether theyve been in space or not.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"GMs newest vehicle: Off-road, self-driving rover for moon","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  General Motors is teaming up with Lockheed Martin to produce the ultimate off-road, self-driving, electric vehicles  for the moon.  The project announced Wednesday is still in the early stages and has yet to score any NASA money. But the goal is to design light yet rugged vehicles that will travel farther and faster than the lunar rovers that carried NASAs Apollo astronauts in the early 1970s, the companies said. Mobility is really going to open up the moon for us, said Kirk Shireman, a former NASA manager who is now Lockheed Martins vice president for lunar exploration. The rovers used by the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 moonwalkers ventured no more than 4 1/2 miles (7.6 kilometers) from their landers. GM also helped design those vehicles. NASA last year put out a call for industry ideas on lunar rovers. The space agency aims to return astronauts to the moon by 2024, a deadline set by the previous White House.  Their initial rovers will be designed to carry two astronauts at a time, according to company officials. A brief company video showed a large, open rover speeding over lunar slopes, with more headlights in the distance.  This is just a glimpse of how we see the opportunity playing out, said Jeff Ryder, a vice president for GM Defense.  By operating autonomously when needed, Shireman noted, the rovers can keep astronauts safely away from dangerous spots like the permanently shadowed craters at the moons South Pole. Frozen water gathered from these dark corners could be used for drinking, growing plants and creating rocket fuel. 
        
     Autonomy could also improve efficiency, with astronauts focused on collecting rocks as a rover follows behind like a puppy, he said. In a separate venture begun two years ago, Toyota partnered with the Japanese Space Agency to build a pressurized electric-powered lunar rover for astronauts. Theyre calling it the Lunar Cruiser. GM and Lockheed Martins vehicle will be unpressurized, meaning that riders will need to wear spacesuits at all times. Theres room for both models, according to Shireman.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Navigation error sends NASAs Mars helicopter on wild ride,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A navigation timing error sent NASAs little Mars helicopter on a wild, lurching ride, its first major problem since it took to the Martian skies last month. The experimental helicopter, named Ingenuity, managed to land safely, officials at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported Thursday. The trouble cropped up about a minute into the helicopters sixth test flight last Saturday at an altitude of 33 feet (10 meters). One of the numerous pictures taken by an on-board camera did not register in the navigation system, throwing the entire timing sequence off and confusing the craft about its location. Ingenuity began tilting back and forth as much as 20 degrees and suffered power consumption spikes, according to Havard Grip, the helicopters chief pilot.  A built-in system to provide extra margin for stability came to the rescue, he wrote in an online status update. The helicopter landed within 16 feet (5 meters) of its intended touchdown site. Ingenuity became the first aircraft to make a powered flight on another planet in April, two months after landing on Mars with NASAs rover Perseverance.  The 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) helicopter aced its first five flights, each one more challenging than before. NASA was so impressed by the $85 million tech demo that it extended its mission by at least a month. Saturdays troubled flight was the first for this bonus period. Engineers have spent the past several days addressing the problem. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA releases stunning new pic of Milky Ways downtown,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA has released a stunning new picture of our galaxys violent, super-energized downtown.  Its a composite of 370 observations over the past two decades by the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, depicting billions of stars and countless black holes in the center, or heart, of the Milky Way. A radio telescope in South Africa also contributed to the image, for contrast. Astronomer Daniel Wang of the University of Massachusetts Amherst said Friday he spent a year working on this while stuck at home during the pandemic.  What we see in the picture is a violent or energetic ecosystem in our galaxys downtown, Wang said in an email. There are a lot of supernova remnants, black holes, and neutron stars there. Each X-ray dot or feature represents an energetic source, most of which are in the center. This busy, high-energy galactic center is 26,000 light years away. His work appears in the June issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

NASA picks Venus as hot spot for two new robotic missions,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is returning to sizzling Venus, our closest yet perhaps most overlooked neighbor, after decades of exploring other worlds. The space agencys new administrator, Bill Nelson, announced two new robotic missions to the solar systems hottest planet, during his first major address to employees Wednesday. These two sister missions both aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world capable of melting lead at the surface, Nelson said.  One mission named DaVinci Plus will analyze the thick, cloudy Venusian atmosphere in an attempt to determine whether the inferno planet ever had an ocean and was possibly habitable. A small craft will plunge through the atmosphere to measure the gases.  It will be the first U.S.-led mission to the Venusian atmosphere since 1978.  The other mission, called Veritas, will seek a geologic history by mapping the rocky planets surface. It is astounding how little we know about Venus, but the new missions will give fresh views of the planets atmosphere, made up mostly of carbon dioxide, down to the core, NASA scientist Tom Wagner said in a statement. It will be as if we have rediscovered the planet. NASAs top science official, Thomas Zurbuchen, calls it a new decade of Venus. Each mission  launching sometime around 2028 to 2030  will receive $500 million for development under NASAs Discovery program.  
        
     The missions beat out two other proposed projects, to Jupiters moon Io and Neptunes icy moon Triton. The U.S. and the former Soviet Union sent multiple spacecraft to Venus in the early days of space exploration. NASAs Mariner 2 performed the first successful flyby in 1962, and the Soviets Venera 7 made the first successful landing in 1970.  In 1989, NASA used a space shuttle to send its Magellan spacecraft into orbit around Venus. The European Space Agency put a spacecraft around Venus in 2006. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX launches tiny critters, solar panels to space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched thousands of tiny sea creatures to the International Space Station on Thursday, along with a plaque-fighting toothpaste experiment and powerful solar panels. The 7,300-pound (3,300-kilogram) shipment  which also includes fresh lemons, onions, avocados and cherry tomatoes for the stations seven astronauts  should arrive Saturday. SpaceXs Falcon rocket blasted into the hazy afternoon sky from Kennedy Space Center. The first-stage booster was new for a change, landing on an offshore platform several minutes after liftoff so it can be recycled for a NASA astronaut flight this fall.  The Dragon cargo capsule  also brand new  is delivering the first of three sets of high-tech solar panels designed to bolster the space stations aging power grid. Astronauts will conduct two spacewalks later this month to help install the two roll-out panels alongside solar wings that have been in continuous operation for 20 years. More power will be needed to accommodate the growing number of ticket-buying visitors, NASAs space station program manager, Joel Montalbano, said Wednesday.  The cargo includes samples of saliva and oral bacteria from dental patients that will be treated with toothpaste and mouthwash in an experiment aimed at keeping astronauts teeth and gums healthy in space.  Theres no guarantee that the Earth methods will work in zero gravity, researcher Jeffrey Ebersole of the University of Nevada Las Vegas said in a statement.  
        
     Also headed to the orbiting lab: 20,000 tardigrades, better known as water bears, and 128 bobtail squid, as well as chile pepper plants and cotton seedlings.  Tardigrades can survive in drastic environments on Earth and even in the vacuum of space. Launched frozen, these microscopic extremophiles will be thawed and revived aboard the space station. By identifying the genes behind the animals adaptability, scientists hope to better understand the stresses on the human body during long space stays. The baby bobtail squid are part of a study investigating the relationship between beneficial bacteria and their animal hosts. This is SpaceXs 22nd station supply run for NASA. The space agency turned to private companies to transport cargo and astronauts following the shuttles retirement a decade ago. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Jeff Bezos will blast into space on rockets 1st crew flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Outdoing his fellow billionaires in daredevilry, Jeff Bezos will blast into space next month when his Blue Origin company makes its first flight with a crew. The 57-year-old Amazon founder and richest person in the world by Forbes estimate will become the first person to ride his own rocket to space. Bezos announced his intentions Monday and, in an even bolder show of confidence, said he will share the adventure with his younger brother and best friend, Mark, an investor and volunteer firefighter. He said that will make it more meaningful. Blue Origins debut flight with people aboard  after 15 successful test flights of its reusable New Shepard rockets  will take place on July 20, a date selected because it is the 52nd anniversary of the first moon landing by Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.  The Bezos brothers will launch from remote West Texas alongside the winner of an online charity auction. Theres no word yet on who else might fill the six-person capsule during the 10-minute flight that will take its passengers to an altitude of about 65 miles (105 kilometers), just beyond the edge of space, and then return to Earth without going into orbit. Bezos said he has dreamed of traveling to space since he was 5. To see the Earth from space, it changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity. Its one Earth, Bezos said in an Instagram post. I want to go on this flight because its a thing Ive wanted to do all my life. Its an adventure. Its a big deal for me. 
        
     Added his brother: I wasnt even expecting him to say that he was going to be on the first flight, and then when he asked me to go along, I was just awestruck.  Bezos will step down as Amazons CEO 15 days before liftoff. He announced months ago that he wants to spend more time on his rocket company as well as his newspaper, The Washington Post.  His stake in Amazon stands at $164 billion, which will make him by far the wealthiest person to fly to space. Until now, thrill-seeking billionaires have had to buy capsule seats from the Russian space program or, more recently, Elon Musks SpaceX, which plans its first private flight in September. These orbital trips, generally lasting several days, with visits to the International Space Station, have cost tens of millions of dollars per person. The flight by Blue Origins New Shepard capsule, named for Alan Shepard, the first American in space, will last five minutes less than Shepards history-marking suborbital ride aboard a Mercury capsule in 1961. But Blue Origins capsule is 10 times roomier with a huge window at every seat  the biggest windows ever built for a spacecraft, in fact. The company, based in Kent, Washington, is working to develop an orbital rocket named after John Glenn, the first American to circle the Earth. The Bezos flight will officially kick off the companys space tourism business. The company has yet to start selling seats to the public or even to announce a ticket price for the short trips, which provide about three minutes of weightlessness.  Blue Origins launch and landing site is 120 miles southeast of El Paso, close to the Mexican border. After the capsule separates, the rocket returns to Earth and lands upright, to be used again. The capsule, also reusable, descends under parachutes. Virgin Galactics Richard Branson  a tie-loathing, mountain-climbing, hot-air-ballooning daredevil  also plans to ride into space aboard his own airplane-launched rocketship later this year after one more test flight over New Mexico. Virgin Galactic completed its third test flight into space with a crew two weeks ago; the company doesnt want him climbing aboard until the craft is thoroughly proven. The 70-year-old Branson on Monday offered congratulations to Bezos, a tame, bookish Wall Streeter by comparison. Branson tweeted that their two companies are opening up access to space  how extraordinary! Like Blue Origin, Bransons company will send paying customers to the lower reaches of space on up-and-down flights, not Earth-orbiting rides. Musks SpaceX already has transported 10 astronauts to the space station for NASA and sold several seats on private flights. Musk himself has yet to commit to going into space, though he has repeatedly said he wants to die on Mars, just not on impact. Until recently, Blue Origin had been criticized by some for proceeding too slowly, especially when compared with SpaceX. Bezos adopted as the companys motto Gradatim ferociter, Latin for Step by step, ferociously, and had it emblazoned on the so-called lucky cowboy boots he wears to his companys space launches. Blue Origin, admirably, has gone about it carefully and has built a reliable and less ambitious vehicle and is likely to succeed, the director of Vanderbilt Universitys aerospace design lab, Amrutur Anilkumar, said in an email Monday. It is noteworthy that Bezos feels comfortable taking his brother for a ride; that is probably the best exclamation for safety and reliability. While Blue Origins and SpaceXs capsules are fully automated, Virgin Galactic has two pilots in the cockpit for every spaceflight. A 2014 accident left one pilot dead and the other seriously injured. As for the seat that is being auctioned off, Blue Origin opened online bidding on May 5, the 60th anniversary of Shepards flight. Its up to $2.8 million. The auction will conclude Saturday, with the winning amount donated to Club for the Future, Blue Origins education foundation, which encourages youngsters to pursue careers in science. Nearly 6,000 people from 143 countries have taken part in the auction. In an Instagram video posted by Bezos, Mark Bezos reaction when his brother invited him on the flight was: Are you serious? ... Seriously? My God! What a remarkable opportunity not only to have this adventure, but to be able to do it with my best friend, the younger brother said. ___ AP business writer MIchelle Chapman contributed to this story. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Spacecraft buzzes Jupiters mega moon, 1st close-up in years","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Juno spacecraft has provided the first close-ups of Jupiters largest moon in two decades.  Juno zoomed past icy Ganymede on Monday, passing within 645 miles (1,038 kilometers). The last time a spacecraft came that close was in 2000 when NASAs Galileo spacecraft swept past our solar systems biggest moon.  NASA released Junos first two pictures Tuesday, highlighting Ganymedes craters and long, narrow features possibly related to tectonic faults. One shows the moons far side, opposite the sun. This is the closest any spacecraft has come to this mammoth moon in a generation, said Junos lead scientist, Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. We are going to take our time before we draw any scientific conclusions, but until then we can simply marvel at this celestial wonder  the only moon in our solar system bigger than the planet Mercury.  Ganymede is one of 79 known moons around Jupiter, a gas giant. Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered Ganymede in 1610, along with Jupiters three next-biggest moons.

Scientists expect spring floods to be milder than last year,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Too often disasters come in threes. But the year of global pandemic and record wildfires in Australia will not also be a year of historic floods in the U.S., forecasters predict. Last year saw record floods in several regions of the country. But this year this annual spring flooding season will not be as severe or prolonged as in 2019, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. Major to moderate flooding is projected in 23 states, impacting 128 million people. The regions most likely to experience major flooding include parts of North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota.  The potential for major flooding is elevated along the Red River, the James River and parts of the Upper Mississippi River, said Edward Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center.  Thats in part due to heavier than normal rainfall over the last 90 days in those watershed areas.  In the southeastern U.S., the potential for heavy floods may be slightly dampened by the early arrival of spring  meaning that the sprouting plants and trees are absorbing moisture from the soil and air. Floods are more likely when rain falls on already water-saturated soils.  The National Phenology Network, which tracks the advent of green shoots and blooming flowers, found that spring has arrived around three weeks early in much of the eastern U.S.  Warmer temperatures are linked to climate change.  
        
     Last December to February saw above normal temperatures for nearly the entire continental U.S., said Jon Gottschalck, a scientist at NOAAs Climate Prediction Center.  ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Back in the game': SpaceX ship blasts off with 2 astronauts,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A rocket ship built by Elon Musks SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era in commercial space travel and putting the United States back in the business of launching astronauts into orbit from home soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASAs Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. Lets light this candle, Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the historic words used by Alan Shepard on Americas first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive Sunday at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, for a stay of up to four months, after which they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea, something the world hasnt witnessed since the 1970s. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the case of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police.  NASA officials and others expressed hope the flight would lift American spirits and show the world what the U.S. can do. 
        
     We are back in the game. Its very satisfying, said Doug Marshburn, of Deltona, Florida, who shouted, USA! USA! as he watched the 260-foot rocket climb skyward. SpaceX becomes the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. This is something that should really get people right in the heart of anyone who has any spirit of exploration, Musk, the visionary also behind the Tesla electric car company, said after liftoff, pounding his chest with his fist.  The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. Over the past few years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeings spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. NASA plans to rely in part on commercial partners as it pursues it next goals: sending astronauts back to the moon within a few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. At a post-liftoff rally held at NASAs massive 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, President Donald Trump commended Musk and proclaimed: Today we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil.  He vowed the U.S. will be the first to land on Mars, promising a future of American dominance in space. Vice President Mike Pence, who also witnessed the launch, said that as the nation deals with the coronavirus and racial strife, I believe with all my heart that millions of Americans today will find the same inspiration and unity of purpose that we found in those days in the 1960s during Apollo. The first attempt to launch the rocket, on Wednesday, was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather threatened another postponement for most of the day, but the skies began to clear just in the time. The astronauts set out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV after Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy? Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rockets first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. Thanks for the great ride to space, Hurley told SpaceX ground control. The two crewmates batted around a floating blue dinosaur plush toy doubling as a dragon, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine declared: This is everything that America has to offer in its purest form. Attendance inside Kennedy Space Center was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the crowd amounted to only a few thousand. By NASAs count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online.  Despite NASAs insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators flocked to beaches and roads, some of them not wearing masks or keeping 6 feet from others. Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York. With everything thats going on in this country right now, its important that we do things extraordinary in life, he said. Weve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each.  Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And the SpaceX controllers had masks and were seated far apart. In keeping with Musks penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. Once settled in orbit, Hurley disclosed that the capsule has been christened Endeavour, a storied name in the history of exploration, also given to one of the space shuttles. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012.  Under the new corporate-public model, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) Saturdays mission is technically considered a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. The first flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. And Boeings first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was nearly destroyed during a test flight in December. For SpaceX and the future of public-corporate space exploration, the stakes on Saturday were extraordinarily high. With the spaceship finally on its way, Musk got choked up talking about the weight of his responsibility for the astronauts lives and their families and noted that the return to Earth is more dangerous in some ways than ascent, so we dont want to declare victory yet. Still, Musk said he wasnt nervous about the launch on Saturday the way he was during the previous attempt.  Today, I dont know, it felt like just the fates were aligned, he said. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mike Schneider in Cape Canaveral, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASA call for astronauts draws 12,000 spaceflight hopefuls","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Who wants to be an astronaut? More than 12,000 people do, resulting in NASAs second-largest group of astronaut hopefuls.  NASA said Wednesday that Americans from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and four U.S. territories applied to be part of the space agencys next astronaut class. The monthlong application period ended Tuesday.  NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said this next class of astronauts will help explore the moon and pave the way to Mars. They also could find themselves at the International Space Station, using new commercial capsules to get there. We are thrilled to see so many incredible Americans apply to join us, Bridenstine said in a statement. NASAs previous call for astronauts, in 2017, attracted a record 18,300 applicants. Twelve ended up being selected. The space agency tightened its qualifications this time, requiring at least a masters degrees in science, technology, engineering or math.  The number of astronauts chosen next summer will depend on mission requirements and spaceflight rates, said NASA spokeswoman Brandi Dean. Recent astronaut classes have ranged from eight to 12.

NASAs next Mars rover honors medical teams fighting virus,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs next Mars rover is honoring all the medical workers on the front lines of the coronavirus battle around the world.  With just another month until liftoff, the space agency on Wednesday revealed a commemorative plate attached to the rover, aptly named Perseverance. The rover team calls it the COVID-19 Perseverance plate, designed in the last couple months. The black and white aluminum plate  3-by-5 inches (8-by-13 centimeters)  shows planet Earth atop a staff entwined with a serpent, a symbol of the medical community. The path of the spacecraft also is depicted, with its origin from Cape Canaveral. Health care workers were on front lines keeping us safe during launch preparations, said deputy project manager Matt Wallace of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. They really inspired us, I think, through this period, and we hope that this plate and we hope that this mission in some small way can inspire them in return, Wallace told reporters.  The rovers name, Perseverance, has taken on added meaning the last few months, according to NASA officials. Its hard enough preparing a spacecraft for Mars, but doing it in the middle of a pandemic made it even harder, Wallace said. Additional work shifts were added to reduce the number of people working on the rover at any one time and ensure social distancing. Others had to work from home. NASA is pressing ahead with a July 20 launch, even as the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Florida. This mission  to seek signs of past microbial life on Mars and collect rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth  is considered essential by the space agency.  
        
     If the rover isnt launched by mid-August, it would need to wait until 2022 when Earth and Mars are back in proper alignment. A two-year delay could add another $500 million to the nearly $3 billion mission.  Unlike for SpaceXs first astronaut launch late last month, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine isnt urging the public to stay home and watch online to avoid crowds. It appears they didnt listen to us, Bridenstine said. So were asking people to follow all of the necessary guidelines to keep themselves safe and were trusting that they will. Perseverance is one of three upcoming missions to Mars.

Fly without flapping? Andean condors surf air 99% of time,"WASHINGTON (AP)  A new study sheds light on just how efficiently the worlds largest soaring bird rides air currents to stay aloft for hours without flapping its wings.  The Andean condor has a wingspan stretching to 10 feet and weighs up to 33 pounds, making it the heaviest soaring bird alive today. For the first time, a team of scientists strapped recording equipment they called daily diaries to eight condors in Patagonia to record each wingbeat over more than 250 hours of flight time. Incredibly, the birds spent just 1% of their time aloft flapping their wings, mostly during take-off. One bird flew more than five hours, covering more than 100 miles (160 km), without flapping its wings. Condors are expert pilots  but we just hadnt expected they would be quite so expert, said Emily Shepard, a study co-author and biologist at Swansea University in Wales. The results were published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The finding that they basically almost never beat their wings and just soar is mind-blowing, said David Lentink, an expert in bird flight at Stanford University, who was not involved in the research.  To birds, the sky is not empty, but a landscape of invisible features  wind gusts, currents of warm rising air, and streams of air pushed upward by ground features such as mountains.  Learning to ride air currents allows some birds to travel long distances while minimizing the exertion of beating their wings.  
        
     Scientists who study flying animals generally consider two types of flight: flapping flight and soaring flight. The difference can be compared to peddling a bicycle uphill, versus coasting downhill, said Bret Tobalske, a bird flight expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the study. Past studies have shown that white storks and osprey flap for 17% and 25% of their overland migratory flights, respectively. The Andean condors extreme skill at soaring is essential for its scavenger lifestyle, which requires hours a day of circling high mountains looking for a meal of carrion, said Sergio Lambertucci, a study co-author and biologist at the National University of Comahue in Argentina. When you see condors circling, they are taking advantage of those thermal uplifts, or rising gusts of warm air, he said.  The recording devices were programmed to fall off the birds after about a week. Retrieving them wasnt so easy. Sometimes the devices dropped off into nests on huge cliffs in the middle of the Andes mountains, and we needed three days just to get there, said Lambertucci.

"Radish seeds, meats and cheeses launched to space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A space station cargo ship rocketed into orbit Friday carrying a 360-degree camera for spacewalking, radish seeds for growing and a smorgasbord of fancy meats and cheeses for feasting. Northrop Grumman launched its capsule to the International Space Station from the Virginia coast, providing a nighttime treat for observers from the Carolinas to New England, at least where skies were clear. It was a spectacular launch, said NASAs deputy space station program manager Kenny Todd. Creating the artificial dawn for a few minutes there, its just gorgeous. The 8,000-pound (3,600-kilogram) shipment should reach the space station Monday.  Stashed aboard the Cygnus capsule: pressurized air tanks to help offset a vexing leak at the space station, a new $23 million titanium toilet custom fit for women, and a virtual reality camera to provide cinematic views of spacewalks and other outdoor shots. Plus theres more fresh food than usual, given that the space station population will be expanding from six to seven with SpaceXs second astronaut launch on Oct. 31. Among the delicacies requested by the astronauts: proscuitto, Genoa salami, smoked Gouda and provolone, brie, cherry tomatoes, oranges, pecans and chocolate-covered cranberries in plenty of time for Thanksgiving. The astronauts also will get a chance to enjoy their own harvest. Researchers are hoping for 40 radishes from the seeds going up, within a month.  
        
     While growing radishes in orbit may sound trivial, it is actually a transition from basic plant biology in space to a production system that could benefit moon and Mars explorers, said Karl Hasenstein, a biology professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette who is leading the experiment. Larger plants like peppers and tomatoes should follow in a few years, adding to astronauts diet. NASAs new toilet, meanwhile, will be tested at the orbiting outpost before accompanying astronauts to the moon in a few years. It will join two larger, old-style, Russian-built commodes already up there. The new one is designed to better accommodate women, who are expected to have an increasing presence in space exploration. This particular capsule, in fact, the SS Kalpana Chawla, is named after the first India-born woman in space. Chawla was among the seven astronauts killed in the 2003 shuttle Columbia accident.  The delivery is running a little late. Bad weather at Wallops Island led to a two-day delay earlier in the week, then software issues forced a last-minute launch abort of Northrop Grummans Antares rocket on Thursday. Barely a half hour later Friday night, NASAs other shipper, SpaceX, tried to launch a GPS satellite from Cape Canaveral, Florida, for the new U.S. Space Force. But the countdown was halted around the two-second mark.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASAs new Mars rover hits dusty red road, 1st trip 21 feet","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs newest Mars rover hit the dusty red road this week, putting 21 feet on the odometer in its first test drive.  The Perseverance rover ventured from its landing position Thursday, two weeks after setting down on the red planet to seek signs of past life. The roundabout, back and forth drive lasted just 33 minutes and went so well that more driving was on tap Friday and Saturday for the the six-wheeled rover. This is really the start of our journey here, said Rich Rieber, the NASA engineer who plotted the route. This is going to be like the Odyssey, adventures along the way, hopefully no Cyclops, and Im sure there will be stories aplenty written about it. In its first drive, Perseverance went forward 13 feet (4 meters), took a 150-degree left turn, then backed up 8 feet (2.5 meters). During a news conference Friday, NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, shared photos of its tracks over and around small rocks.  I dont think Ive ever been happier to see wheel tracks and Ive seen a lot of them, said engineer Anais Zarifian. Flight controllers are still checking all of Perseverances systems. So far, everything is looking good. The rovers 7-foot (2-meter) robot arm, for instance, flexed its muscles for the first time Tuesday. Before the car-size rover can head for an ancient river delta to collect rocks for eventual return to Earth, it must drop its so-called protective belly pan and release an experimental helicopter named Ingenuity.  
        
     As it turns out, Perseverance landed right on the edge of a potential helicopter landing strip  a nice, flat spot, according to Rieber. So the plan is to drive out of this landing strip, ditch the pan, then return for Ingenuitys highly anticipated test flight. All this should be accomplished by late spring. Scientists are debating whether to take the smoother route to get to the nearby delta or a possibly tougher way with intriguing remnants from that once-watery time 3 billion to 4 billion years ago. Perseverance  NASAs biggest and most elaborate rover yet  became the ninth U.S. spacecraft to successfully land on Mars on Feb. 18. China hopes to land its smaller rover  currently orbiting the red planet  in another few months. NASA scientists, meanwhile, announced Friday that theyve named Perseverances touchdown site in honor of the late science fiction writer Octavia E. Butler, who grew up next door to JPL in Pasadena. She was one of the first African Americans to receive mainstream attention for science fiction. Her works included Bloodchild and Other Stories and Parable of the Sower. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA spacecraft leaves mess after grabbing asteroid samples,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft left a mess at an asteroid when it grabbed a load of rubble last year for return to Earth, new pictures revealed Thursday.  The Osiris-Rex spacecraft made one final flyby of asteroid Bennu on April 7 to take photos of the disturbance left by Octobers sample collection.  A depression is visible where Osiris-Rex penetrated the asteroids surface. Boulders were hurled by the pressurized nitrogen gas that was fired at the ground to churn up material for vacuuming, and by the spacecrafts getaway thruster. One 1-ton boulder was flung an estimated 40 feet (12 meters).  The Osiris-Rex team meticulously plotted the final flyover to ensure the best shots. The pictures were taken around noontime to avoid shadows and better see the changes on Bennus rocky surface. These observations were not in the original mission plan, so we were excited to go back and document what we did, the University of Arizonas Dathon Golish said in a statement.  Osiris-Rex will depart Bennus vicinity next month and head back toward Earth with its precious 2-pound (1-kilogram) sample load. Its due to arrive in 2023. The solar-orbiting, carbon-rich asteroid is 182 million miles (293 million kilometers) from Earth. By studying pieces of it, scientists hope to better understand how our solar systems planets formed and how people should react if an asteroid endangers Earth. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX picked for moonwalkers, on verge of 3rd crew launch","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA chose SpaceX on Friday to build the lunar lander that will eventually put the first woman and person of color on the moon. The announcement came a few hours after SpaceXs most international crew of astronauts yet arrived in Florida for a liftoff next week. Elon Musks Starship  the futuristic, shiny steel rocketship thats been launching and exploding in Texas  beat out landers proposed by Jeff Bezos Blue Origin and Dynetics, a subsidiary of Leidos. The contract is worth $2.89 billion. We wont stop at the moon, said NASAs acting administrator Steve Jurczyk. Mars is the ultimate goal, he told reporters.  NASA declined to provide a target launch date for the moon-landing Artemis mission, saying a review is underway. The Trump administration had set a 2024 deadline, but on Friday, NASA officials called it a goal.  Well do it when its safe, said Kathy Lueders, who leads NASAs human space exploration office.  She indicated NASA and SpaceX are shooting for later this decade. The astronauts will fly to the moon on the NASA-launched Orion capsule, then transfer to Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface and back.  NASA has said at least one of the first moonwalkers since 1972 would be the first woman on the moon. Another goal of the program, according to the space agency, is to send a person of color to the lunar surface. 
        
     On Friday, Jurczyk greeted the four astronauts arriving at Kennedy Space Center for SpaceXs third crew launch in less than a year. By coincidence, their flight to the International Space Station is set for next Thursday  Earth Day. Its a reminder of NASAs core mission of studying the home planet, Jurczyk said. The three men and one woman represent the U.S., France and Japan: NASAs Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Thomas Pesquet and Akihiko Hoshide, all experienced space fliers. Its definitely getting real, Kimbrough, the spacecraft commander, said after arriving by plane from Houston. This will be SpaceXs first crew flight to use a recycled Falcon rocket and Dragon crew capsule. NASA turned to U.S. private companies for crew transport after the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Certainly, I think all of them, until we get several years under our belt, should be considered test flights, Kimbrough told reporters. SpaceX uses the same kind of rocket and similar capsules for supply deliveries, and recycles those as well. McArthur is the only member of the crew who has yet to visit the space station. She flew the shuttle to the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. And launching out of Kennedy is new to Pesquet after more than 11 years as an astronaut. Were living in the golden age of human spaceflight, said Pesquet, a former Air France pilot. Looks like everybody, every country, has a project or a spacecraft. The astronauts left the runway in a pair of white gull-winged Teslas; SpaceX founder Musk also runs the electric car company. They had an early bedtime to sync up with what will be pretty much an all-nighter Thursday. Liftoff time is 6:11 a.m. The four will replace the SpaceX crew that launched last November. Those four will return to Earth at the end of April. A fresh three-person Soyuz crew, meanwhile, arrived at the space station last week from Kazakhstan, replacing two Russians and one American due back on Earth this weekend.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASAs Mars helicopter takes flight, 1st for another planet","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs experimental helicopter Ingenuity rose into the thin air above the dusty red surface of Mars on Monday, achieving the first powered flight by an aircraft on another planet. The triumph was hailed as a Wright brothers moment. The mini 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) copter even carried a bit of wing fabric from the Wright Flyer that made similar history at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. It was a brief hop  just 39 seconds and 10 feet (3 meters)  but accomplished all the major milestones. Goosebumps. It looks just the way we had tested, project manager MiMi Aung said as she watched the flight video during a later briefing. Absolutely beautiful flight. I dont think I can ever stop watching it over and over again. Flight controllers at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California declared success after receiving the data and images via the Perseverance rover. Ingenuity hitched a ride to Mars on Perseverance, clinging to the rovers belly when it touched down in an ancient river delta in February. The $85 million helicopter demo was considered high risk, yet high reward.  Scientists cheered the news from around the world, even from space, and the White House offered its congratulations. A whole new way to explore the alien terrain in our solar system is now at our disposal, Nottingham Trent University astronomer Daniel Brown said from England. 
        
     This first test flight  with more to come by Ingenuity, the next as soon as Thursday  holds great promise, Brown noted. Future helicopters could serve as scouts for rovers, and eventually astronauts, in difficult, dangerous places. Ingenuity has provided a third dimension to planetary exploration and freed us from the surface now forever, said JPL director, Michael Watkins. Ground controllers had to wait more than three excruciating hours before learning whether the preprogrammed flight had succeeded 178 million miles (287 million kilometers) away. The first attempt had been delayed a week because of a software error. When the news finally came, the operations center filled with applause, cheers and laughter. More followed when the first black and white photo from Ingenuity appeared, showing the helicopters shadow as it hovered above the surface of Mars.  The shadow of greatness, #MarsHelicopter first flight on another world complete! NASA astronaut Victor Glover tweeted from the International Space Station. Next came stunning  color video  of the copters clean landing, taken by Perseverance, the best host little Ingenuity could ever hope for, Aung said in thanking everyone. The helicopter hovered for 30 seconds at its intended altitude of 10 feet (3 meters), and spent 39 seconds airborne, more than three times longer than the first successful flight of the Wright Flyer, which lasted a mere 12 seconds on Dec. 17, 1903. To accomplish all this, the helicopters twin, counter-rotating rotor blades needed to spin at 2,500 revolutions per minute  five times faster than on Earth. With an atmosphere just 1% the density of Earths, engineers had to build a helicopter light enough  with blades spinning fast enough  to generate this otherworldly lift. The Martian wind was relatively gentle Monday: between 4 mph and 14 mph (7 kph to 22 kph). More than six years in the making, Ingenuity is just 19 inches (49 centimeters) tall, a spindly four-legged chopper. Its fuselage, containing all the batteries, heaters and sensors, is the size of a tissue box. The carbon-fiber, foam-filled rotors are the biggest pieces: Each pair stretches 4 feet (1.2 meters) tip to tip. Ingenuity also had to be sturdy enough to withstand the Martian wind, and is topped with a solar panel for recharging the batteries, crucial for surviving the minus-130 degree Fahrenheit (minus-90 degree-Celsius) Martian nights. NASA chose a flat, relatively rock-free patch for Ingenuitys airfield. Following Mondays success, NASA named the area for the Wright brothers. While these two iconic moments in aviation history may be separated by time and ... million miles of space, they now will forever be linked, NASAs science missions chief Thomas Zurbuchen announced. The little chopper with a giant job attracted attention from the moment it launched with Perseverance last July. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger joined in the fun, rooting for Ingenuity over the weekend. Get to the chopper! he shouted in a tweeted video, a line from his 1987 sci-fi film Predator.  Up to five increasingly ambitious flights are planned, and they could lead the way to a fleet of Martian drones in decades to come, providing aerial views, transporting packages and serving as lookouts for human crews. On Earth, the technology could enable helicopters to reach new heights, doing things like more easily navigating the Himalayas. Ingenuitys team has until the beginning of May to complete the test flights so that the rover can get on with its main mission: collecting rock samples that could hold evidence of past Martian life, for return to Earth a decade from now. The team plans to test the helicopters limits, possibly even wrecking the craft, leaving it to rest in place forever, having sent its data back home. Until then, Perseverance will keep tabs on Ingenuity. Flight engineers affectionately call them Percy and Ginny. Big sisters watching, said Malin Space Science Systems Elsa Jensen, the rovers lead camera operator.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Astronauts flying reused SpaceX rocket, capsule for 1st time","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  For the first time, NASA is putting its trust in a recycled SpaceX rocket and capsule for a crew.  Astronaut Megan McArthur takes special pleasure in the reused spacecraft set to soar Thursday morning. In a fun twist, shell sit in the same seat in the same capsule as her husband, Bob Behnken, did last spring for a test flight to the International Space Station. Its kind of a fun thing that we can share. I can see him and say, Hey, can you hand over the keys. Im ready now to go,  she said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.  While their 7-year-old son, Theo, is becoming a pro at parent launches, McArthur said hes not super excited about her being gone for six months. Thats how long she and her three crewmates will spend at the space station. This will be SpaceXs third crew flight for NASA from Floridas Kennedy Space Center in under a year. The commercial flights ended the U.S.'s reliance on Russian rockets launched from Kazakhstan to get astronauts to and from the space station after the shuttles retired.  SpaceXs Benji Reed noted Tuesday the private company already has put six people in space  as many as NASAs Project Mercury did back in the early 1960s when it launched the first Americans. The upcoming flight will boost that number to 10. Some highlights of the SpaceX flight: USE, RECYCLE, REPEAT Both the Dragon capsule and Falcon rocket for this mission have soared once before. The capsule launched the first SpaceX crew last May, while the rocket hoisted the second set of astronauts, who are still at the space station. For SpaceX, recycling is key to space exploration, Reed said, lowering costs, increasing flights and destinations, and allowing more kinds of people to jump on board. Each capsule is designed to launch at least five times with a crew. SpaceX and NASA are assessing how many times a Falcon can safely launch astronauts. For satellites, Falcons can be used for 10 flights. The company uses the same kind of rocket and similar capsules for station supply runs, and recycles those, too.  
        
     US-FRENCH-JAPANESE CREW This is the most internationally diverse crew yet for SpaceX. NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough, a retired Army colonel, is the spacecraft commander, with McArthur, an oceanographer, as his pilot. Thomas Pesquet, a former Air France pilot, is representing the European Space Agency. Engineer Akihiko Hoshide has worked for the Japanese Space Agency for nearly 30 years and helped build the space station. All but McArthur have already visited the 260-mile-high (420-kilometer-high) outpost. But shes ventured 100 miles (160 kilometers) higher on the space shuttle, taking part in NASAs final Hubble Space Telescope mission in 2009. The four have started a new recycled-rocket tradition for SpaceX crews, writing their initials in the soot of their booster. BON APPETIT With French and Japanese astronauts flying together, dining promises to reach new heights. Hoshide is taking up curry and rice, as well as canned fish and yakitori  grilled and skewered chicken  but no sushi. Pesquet had a Michelin-starred chef whip up some French delicacies: beef with red wine and mushroom sauce, truffled potato and onion tart, and almond tart with caramelized pears. There are also Crepes Suzette. Pesquet said last weekend he had some national pressure to fly French cuisine. His crewmates also had high expectations: OK, were flying with a Frenchman, it better be good. COMING & GOING Five days after this crews arrival at the space station, the one Japanese and three U.S. astronauts who have been up there since November will strap into their SpaceX capsule to come home. NASA wants some time in orbit between the two crews, so the newcomers can benefit from their colleagues experience up there. SpaceX is targeting an April 28 splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida. The company already is conferring with the Coast Guard to prevent pleasure boats from swarming the area like they did for the first SpaceX crews splashdown in August. More Coast Guard ships will be on patrol this time. SPACE SEXY AGAIN As Frances Pesquet sees it, the U.S. and European space agencies may be cool, but SpaceX is even cooler. Theyve done a really good job, I think, making human spaceflight sexy again. Sometimes people dont like me saying that, but thats kind of the truth. And its not that easy, he told the AP in a recent interview. Take the white-with-black-trim SpaceX spacesuits, which are color-coordinated with the rocket, capsule and gull-winged Teslas used to transport astronauts to the launch pad. Looking good is important for SpaceX, Pesquet noted, and its a reasonable price to pay to get the public enthusiastic about space travel. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Bad offshore weather delays SpaceX crew launch until Friday,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX on Wednesday bumped its next astronaut launch by a day because of dangerously high waves and wind offshore.  Liftoff is now scheduled an hour before sunrise Friday from NASAs Kennedy Space Center, when better weather is expected. The SpaceX Dragon capsule has the ability to abort the launch all the way to orbit in case of an emergency. Thats why good weather is needed not only at the Florida launch site, but all the way up the East Coast and across the North Atlantic to Ireland. Although the weather is probably going to look great here at the launch site, were worried about those downrange winds and wave heights in case of an abort, said Kennedys director, Robert Cabana, a former astronaut.  The four astronauts from the U.S., Japan and France will spend six months at the International Space Station.  This will be SpaceXs third launch of astronauts for NASA in less than a year. NASA turned to private companies once the shuttle program ended to haul not only supplies to the space station, but also people. SpaceX began delivering cargo in 2012 and flew its first crew up last May. For the first time, astronauts will be flying in a recycled capsule atop a recycled Falcon rocket. The capsule, dubbed Endeavour after the retired space shuttle, was used for SpaceXs first crew flight. The rocket was used for the companys second crew flight last November. 
        
     The four astronauts on that second Spacex flight will return to Earth next Wednesday, assuming Fridays launch occurs. Splashdown will occur in the Gulf of Mexico off the Tallahassee, Florida, coast. During an outdoor news conference near Kennedys countdown clock, NASAs acting administrator, Steve Jurczyk, stressed the space stations importance in the agencys effort to return astronauts to the moon. The 260-mile-high (420-kilometer-high) station is also key for Earth observations, he noted.  In Washington, the Senate held a confirmation hearing Wednesday for former U.S. senator Bill Nelson, nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as NASAs next administrator. While a Florida congressman, Nelson flew on space shuttle Columbia in January 1986, just a couple weeks before the Challenger launch disaster. Theres a lot of excitement going on at NASA right now and you all have seen it, Nelson told the Senate panel, citing Mondays debut flight of a small helicopter on Mars and the return of astronaut launches to Florida. Former space shuttle commander Pamela Melroy would serve as Nelsons deputy. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Biden pushes for momentum as US returns to climate fight,"WASHINGTON (AP)  President Joe Biden is convening a coalition of the willing, the unwilling, the desperate-for-help and the avid-for-money for a global summit Thursday aimed at rallying the worlds worst polluters to move faster against climate change. The presidents first task: Convincing the world that the politically fractured United States isnt just willing when it comes to Bidens new ambitious emissions-cutting pledges, but also able.  Success for Biden in the virtual summit of 40 leaders will be making his expected promises  halving coal and petroleum emissions at home and financing climate efforts abroad  believable enough to persuade other powers to make big changes of their own.  For small countries already fighting for their survival, global climate progress noticeably slowed in the four years of President Donald Trumps withdrawal from the effort. Panama Foreign Minister Erika Mouynes hopes the United States high-profile return to international climate work will spur months of one-on-one worldwide deal-making leading up to November. Thats when there will be United Nations talks in Glasgow, where about 200 governments will be asked to spell out what each is willing to do to keep the Earth from becoming a far hotter, more dangerous and less hospitable place.  With Bidens summit, we can start with that momentum, Mouynes said. In Panama, freshwater shortages that officials blame on climate change already are complicating shipping through the Panama Canal, one of the worlds main trade routes and the countrys main money earner. Even Panamas best climate safeguards, like hotlines and surveillance drones to catch rainforest logging, arent enough to save the country on their own, Mouynes says. Otherwise its just empty speeches one after the other, where we all say we want a green country, a green planet, and nothing happens, she said. 
        
     The summit will see Biden, who campaigned on promises for a high-employment, climate-saving technological transformation of the U.S. economy, pledge to halve the amount of coal and petroleum pollution the U.S. is pumping out by 2030, officials said this week. Thats compared to levels in 2005, and nearly double the voluntary target the U.S. set at the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. The European Parliament confirmed Wednesday that it will set a similarly ambitious target. The U.S. is looking to other allies, such as Japan and Canada, to announce their own intensified climate efforts, hoping that will spur China and others to slow building of coal-fired power plants and otherwise chill their smokestacks. And the world is looking to well-off countries to make clear how theyll help poorer countries shutter coal plants and retool energy grids, including $2 billion that the U.S. already promised but has never paid. The summit is not necessarily about everyone else bringing something new to the table  its really about the U.S. bringing their target to the world, said Joanna Lewis, an expert in China energy and environment at Georgetown University. This is an urgent but hardly perfect time for the U.S. to try to spur action for multiple reasons, and the summit will play out as a climate telethon-style livestream because of the coronavirus pandemic.  The worlds top two climate offenders, China and the United States, are feuding over nonclimate issues. Chinese President Xi Jinping waited until Wednesday to confirm he would even take part.  India, the worlds third-biggest emitter of fossil fuel fumes, is pressing the United States and other wealthier nations to come through on billions of dollars theyve promised to help poorer nations build alternatives to coal plants and energy-sucking power grids. Where is this money? There is no money in sight, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said ahead of the summit this month, after Biden climate envoy John Kerry visited. Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose nation by some assessments is the worlds fourth-worst climate polluter, also accepted the U.S. invitation but is fuming over Biden calling him a killer, as part of high tensions over Putins aggressiveness abroad and U.S. sanctions.  And at home, political divisions exposed by Trumps presidency have left the United States weaker than it was at the 2015 Paris global accord. Unable to guarantee that a different president in 2024 wont undo Bidens climate work, the Biden administration has argued that market forces  with a boost to get started  will soon make cleaner fuels and energy efficiency too cheap and consumer-friendly to trash. The president has every intention of getting reelected, and certainly, ensuring that he is implementing policies where ... addressing our climate crisis, putting Americans back to work, go hand in hand, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. Having the United States, with its influence and status, back in the climate game is important, said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki. But hoping the world will forget about the last four years seems like wishful thinking, he said. There is too much of an impulse in the U.S. to just wish away Trumps legacy and the fact that every election is now basically a coin toss between complete climate denial and whatever actions the Democrats can bring to the table. Biden sketched out some of his $2 trillion approach for transforming U.S. transportation systems and electrical grids in his campaign climate plan and in his infrastructure proposals for Congress. But theres no hard and fast plan detailing how the U.S. will fulfill Bidens promise to eliminate all carbon emissions from its economy by 2050. Deborah Seligsohn, a political scientist and expert in air pollution and governance at Villanova University, said the overall approach signaled by the White House  focusing on investment first, rather than regulation  was a promising departure from past administrations.  In his campaign, for example, Biden had called for giving Brazil $20 billion in international aid to protect the Amazon, the worlds largest rainforest and a sink for the worlds fossil fuel sins.  Before the summit, however, Senate Democrats are warning that Trump-allied Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro might take the money but keep up destruction of the Amazon. The United Nations is trying to consolidate the private financial sectors carbon-fighting campaign, Kerry and a U.N. finance official said Wednesday. The U.N.-backed Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which involves more than 160 companies with combined assets topping $70 trillion, aims to support efforts to stop fossil fuel emissions by 2050. China and the United States together account for nearly half of the worlds climate-wrecking emissions. Climate experts hope Xi will watch what the U.S. and Chinas neighbors pledge and toughen its own emissions goals in following months. Xis government continues building and financing new coal-fired power plants, and Chinas emissions are still rising. Myllyvirta, the climate expert at the Helsinki center, said Xis comments at recent domestic political forums make clear he is serious about cutting emissions. Amid U.S. and China disputes over territorial claims, trade practices and human rights, however, the two countries presummit pronouncements were an island of climate cooperation in a sea of complaints and grievances. The international community knows very well who is taking actions, who is playing lip service, who is making contributions and who is seeking ones own interest, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said before the summit. ___ Knickmeyer reported from Oklahoma City.

"NASAs Mars helicopter soars higher, longer on 2nd flight","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs little Mars helicopter aced its second test flight Thursday, soaring even higher and longer than before.  The 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) chopper, named Ingenuity, hovered longer and also flew side to side this time, according to NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. It achieved the intended altitude of 16 feet (5 meters) and even accelerated sideways 7 feet (2 meters). This hop lasted 52 seconds, 13 seconds longer than the first one.  Go big or go home! JPL tweeted in announcing the Earth Day news.  The success came just three days after Ingenuity made the first powered flight by an aircraft on another planet. The helicopter carried a bit of wing fabric from the Wright Flyer that made similar history at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903.  Flight controllers had to wait four hours before learning Thursdays outcome. Like it did during Mondays 10-foot-high (3-meter-high) hop, the helicopter sent back a black and white photo showing its shadow against the dusty, rock-strewn surface now known as Wright Brothers Field. It sounds simple, but there are many unknowns regarding how to fly a helicopter on Mars, Ingenuitys chief pilot, Havard Grip, said from JPL in a statement. Thats why were here  to make these unknowns known. One of the challenges is the planets extremely thin atmosphere  1% that of Earths. NASA plans up to three more test flights in the next 1 1/2 weeks, venturing higher each time with more complicated acrobatics. Ingenuity hitched a ride to Mars on the rover Perseverance, which photographed the proceedings from more than 200 feet (64 meters) away. The rover team allotted one month for the $85 million tech demo; The clock started ticking when Ingenuity was released from Perseverances belly on April 3. 
        
     We have two flights of Mars under our belts, which means that there is still a lot to learn during this month of Ingenuity, chief engineer Bob Balaram said in a statement. Perseverance and Ingenuity arrived at Mars in mid-February, landing in an ancient river delta following a 6 1/2-month flight.  Once Ingenuitys flights are complete, Perseverance  will set off on its journey to find any signs of past microscopic life. A robotic geologist, the rover will collect core samples of the most enticing rocks and set them aside for pickup by a future spacecraft a decade from now. In another first, an experiment on the rover successfully converted Mars carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere into pure oxygen this week. Five grams of oxygen was produced, according to NASA, the equivalent of 10 minutes of breathing for an astronaut. Large-scale production at Mars could yield oxygen not only for air, but also rocket fuel. More tests are planned over the next two years. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX aims for 3rd crew launch hour before Fridays sunrise,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX aimed to launch its third crew a little before sunrise Friday, this time using a recycled capsule and rocket.  The four astronauts, representing the U.S., Japan and France, were supposed to fly to the International Space Station on Thursday. But liftoff was delayed because of poor weather offshore. SpaceXs Dragon capsule requires calm waves and winds in case an emergency splashdown is needed during the climb to orbit. Fridays forecast should be much improved, officials said. Liftoff was set for 5:49 a.m. EDT. Our friends on the @Space_Station are expecting us to show up and we dont want to be late, tweeted French astronaut Thomas Pesquet. They even installed my bedroom recently and literally made my bed . Such nice hosts! For the first time, Elon Musks company is launching astronauts with a previously flown capsule and rocket, just as its done for station supply runs. This crew capsule launched with SpaceXs first crew last May, and the rocket hoisted the second crew in November. NASAs spacecraft commander Shane Kimbrough and his crew will spend six months at the space station, replacing four astronauts who will return next Wednesday in their own SpaceX capsule, parachuting into the Gulf of Mexico near Tallahassee, Florida. To celebrate Earth Day on Thursday, Kimbrough tweeted a sunrise beach shot from NASAs Kennedy Space Center.  
        
     Amazing way to appreciate our planet this morning! he said. Besides Kimbrough and Pesquet, the crew includes NASAs Megan McArthur and Japans Akihiko Hoshide.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

World leaders pledge climate cooperation despite other rifts,"WASHINGTON (AP)  The leaders of Russia and China put aside their raw-worded disputes with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday long enough to pledge international cooperation on cutting climate-wrecking coal and petroleum emissions in a livestreamed summit showcasing Americas return to the fight against global warming. Neither Vladimir Putin nor Xi Jinping immediately followed the United States and some of its developed allies in making specific new pledges to reduce damaging fossil fuel pollution during the first day of the two-day U.S.-hosted summit. But climate advocates hoped the high-profile  if glitch-ridden  virtual gathering would kickstart new action by major polluters, paving the way for a November U.N. meeting in Glasgow critical to drastically slowing climate change over the coming decade. The entire world faces a moment of peril but also a moment of opportunity, Biden declared, speaking from a TV-style chrome-blue set for the virtual summit of 40 world leaders. Participants appeared one after the other onscreen for what appeared to be a mix of live and recorded addresses.  The signs are unmistakable, Biden said. The science is undeniable. The cost of inaction keeps mounting. Bidens new U.S. commitment, timed to the summit, would cut Americas fossil fuel emissions as much as 52% by 2030. It comes after four years of international withdrawal from the issue under President Donald Trump, who mocked the science of climate change and pulled the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. 
        
     Bidens administration this week is sketching out a vision of a prosperous, clean-energy United States where factories churn out cutting-edge batteries and electric cars for export, line workers re-lay an efficient national electrical grid and crews cap abandoned oil and gas rigs and coal mines. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the administrations plans as costly and ineffective.  This is quite the one-two punch, McConnell said in a Senate speech Thursday. Toothless requests of our foreign adversaries ... and maximum pain for American citizens. At the summit, Japan announced its own new 46% emissions reduction target and South Korea said it would stop public financing of new coal-fired power plants, potentially an important step toward persuading China and other coal-reliant nations to curb building and funding of new ones as well. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, one of the leaders shown watching summit proceedings in the coronavirus pandemics familiar Brady Bunch-style multibox conference screen, said his nation would up its fossil fuel pollution cuts from 30% to at least 40%. Travel precautions under the pandemic compelled the summit to play out on livestream, limiting opportunities for spontaneous interaction and negotiation. Its opening hours were sometimes marked by electronic echoes, random beeps and off-screen voices. But the summit also marshaled an impressive display of the worlds most powerful leaders speaking on the single issue of climate change.  Chinas Xi, whose country is the worlds biggest emissions culprit, followed by the United States, spoke first among the other global figures. He made no reference to disputes over territorial claims, trade and other matters that had made it uncertain until Wednesday that he would even take part in the U.S. summit. And he said China would work with America in cutting emissions. To protect the environment is to protect productivity, and to boost the environment is to boost productivity. Its as simple as that, Xi said. Putin and his government have been irate over Bidens characterization of him as a killer for Russias aggressive moves against its opponents, and he is under pressure this week over the declining health of jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny. But he made no mention of those disputes in his own climate remarks. Russia is genuinely interested in galvanizing international cooperation so as to look further for effective solutions to climate change as well as to all other vital challenges, Putin said. Russia by some measures is the worlds fourth-biggest emitter of climate-damaging fossil fuel fumes. Climate efforts in recent years have proved a forum where even rival world leaders want to be seen as putting aside disputes to serve as international statesmen and women, even though the cumulative output of fossil fuel emissions is still hurtling the Earth toward disastrous temperature rises. The pandemic made gathering world leaders for the climate summit too risky. So Bidens staff built a small set in the East Room that looked like it was taken from a daytime talk show. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris joined Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House climate envoy John Kerry at a horseshoe-shaped table set up around a giant potted plant to watch fellow leaders speeches.  The format meant a cavalcade of short speeches by world leaders, some scripted, some not. This is not bunny-hugging, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said of the climate efforts. This is about growth and jobs. The Biden administrations pledge would require by far the most ambitious U.S. climate effort ever, nearly doubling the reductions that the Obama administration had committed to in the Paris climate accord. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was one of many allies welcoming the U.S. return after Trump.. Im delighted to see that the United States is back, is back to work together with us in climate politics, Merkel declared in her virtual appearance. Because there can be no doubt about the world needing your contribution if we really want to fulfill our ambitious goals. Pope Francis contributed a video from the Vatican, saying, I wish you success in this beautiful decision to meet, walk together going forward and I am with you all the way. The new urgency comes as scientists say that climate change caused by coal plants, car engines and other fossil fuel use is worsening droughts, floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters and that humans are running out of time to stave off catastrophic extremes of global warming. Leaders of smaller states and island nations buffeted by rising seas and worsening hurricanes appealed for aid and fast emissions cuts from world powers. We are the least contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, but the most affected by climate change, said Gaston Alfonso Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. He called for debt relief and more international assistance to recover from storms and the pandemic to prevent a flow of climate refugees. His people he said, are teetering on the edge of despair. Longtime climate policy experts, no strangers to climate summits with solemn pledges, watched some speeches with skepticism. After Brazils President Jair Bolsonaro promised an end to clearcutting in the Amazon, Dan Wilkinson of Human Rights Watchs environmental programs noted, It is going to be hard for anyone to take it seriously until they actually start taking steps. ___ Knickmeyer reported from Oklahoma City.

"Two pilots, rocket scientist, oceanographer flying SpaceX","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs third crew has an attack helicopter pilot, a former Air France pilot, a Japanese rocket scientist and an oceanographer. The four veteran astronauts should reach the International Space Station on Saturday for a six-month stay, following Fridays liftoff from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. A brief look at each:  Shane Kimbrough, 53, the flights commander, is a retired Army colonel who led a helicopter platoon during the 1991 Gulf War. His love of space came early: His grandparents lived near Floridas Kennedy Space Center. The son of an Army aviator who flew in Vietnam, Kimbrough grew up in Atlanta. He taught math at the U.S. Military Academy and jumped out of planes for the Army, before moving to Houston in 2000 to work with NASAs shuttle training aircraft. He became an astronaut in 2004, flying on the shuttle in 2008 and launching eight years later in a Russian capsule to the space station he helped build. He and wife Robbie have three grown children.   Megan McArthur, 49, the pilot, is flying in the same seat as husband Bob Behnken did during SpaceXs debut crew launch nearly a year ago. This time, he was the one with their 7-year-old son, Theo, waving goodbye. Its been 12 years since McArthur last rocketed into orbit, aboard a shuttle on NASAs final Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. Shes eager to see the space station, after two decades as an astronaut. Born in Hawaii but raised all over in a Navy family, McArthur conducted graduate research in underwater acoustics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, led diving expeditions and tested water equipment. She became an astronaut in 2000.   Thomas Pesquet, 43, was flying for Air France when the European Space Agency chose him as an astronaut 12 years ago. The son of schoolteachers, Pesquet found space cool while growing up in Normandy, and earned a degree in spacecraft design. He joined the French Space Agency as an engineer in 2002. Two years later, Air France tapped him for its flight training program. He logged 2,300 flight hours on commercial airliners before becoming an astronaut in 2009. Pesquet launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket to the space station in 2016 for a six-month mission. His longtime partner, Anne Mottet, works for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. 
        
      Akihiko Hoshide, 52, joined the Japanese Space Agency right out of college in 1992 as an engineer, working on the H-II rocket. He made the astronaut cut seven years later and helped develop Japans Kibo lab for the space station. He installed Kibo, or Hope, in 2008, launching aboard shuttle Discovery. Hoshide returned to the station in 2012 for six months, flying from Kazakhstan. Hell join Japans Soichi Noguchi at the station, before Noguchi departs next week on his own SpaceX ride. It will be really nice to see him  and we have the luxury of hugging in orbit, not like the situation on the ground because of the pandemic, Hoshide said. Hes married with an 11-year-old son.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX launches 3rd crew with recycled rocket and capsule,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched four astronauts into orbit Friday using a recycled rocket and capsule, the third crew flight in less than a year for Elon Musks rapidly expanding company. The astronauts from the U.S., Japan and France should reach the International Space Station early Saturday morning, following a 23-hour ride in the same Dragon capsule used by SpaceXs debut crew last May. Theyll spend six months at the orbiting lab.  It was the first time SpaceX reused a capsule and rocket to launch astronauts for NASA, after years of proving the capability on station supply runs. The rocket was used last November on the companys second astronaut flight. Embracing the trend, spacecraft commander Shane Kimbrough and his crew weeks ago wrote their initials in the rockets soot, hoping to start a tradition. If you have rapid and complete reusability, then that is the gateway to the heavens. Thats what were trying to get done, and the support of NASA makes a huge difference, Musk said after the launch. Just a week ago, NASA awarded SpaceX a nearly $3 billion contract to provide the lunar lander that will deliver astronauts to the surface of the moon  Musks Starship, intended to be fully reusable to attain his ultimate prize of carrying astronauts to Mars and building a city there. Flying in a recycled capsule Friday provided a bit of deja vu for NASA astronaut Megan McArthur. She launched in the same seat in the same capsule as her husband, Bob Behnken, did during SpaceXs first crew flight. This time, it was Behnken and their 7-year-old son waving goodbye. McArthur blew kisses and offered virtual hugs. 
        
      Also flying SpaceX on Friday: Japans Akihiko Hoshide and Frances Thomas Pesquet, the first European to launch in a commercial crew capsule. It was a stunning scene: The launch plume glowed against the dark sky, reflecting the sunlight at high altitude. Despite the early hour, spectators lined surrounding roads to watch the Falcon take flight an hour before sunrise. Liftoff was delayed a day to take advantage of better weather along the East Coast in case of a launch abort and emergency splashdown. Youre seeing a piece of history happening here, said Lance Bryan, visiting from Burnsville, Minnesota. Its, in this case, good history versus some other things that can happen that have been in our backyard practically. Hours after liftoff, SpaceX was notified of a piece of space junk that might come dangerously close to the capsule. So flight controllers ordered the astronauts to put on their spacesuits and lower their visors just in case. There was no danger, and the unidentified debris turned out to be farther than initially thought, passing about 28 miles (45 kilometers) from the vehicle. We dont know what the object was or how big it was, but it did not come close to Dragon, said NASA spokesman Rob Navias. A masked Musk met briefly with the astronauts at NASAs Kennedy Space Center before they boarded white gull-winged Teslas from his electric car company. The astronauts spouses and children huddled around the cars for one last love you before the caravan pulled away and headed to the pad in the predawn darkness. From now on, Ill see you on a screen! tweeted Pesquets partner, Anne Mottet. Visibly weary, Musk later said he doesnt sleep the night before a crew launch and this one was no exception.  It gets a little bit easier, but still pretty intense, I have to say, said Musk, who started his space company in 2002. 
        
     NASA limited the number of launch guests because of COVID-19, but passengers for SpaceXs first privately purchased flight made the cut. Tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, whos bought a three-day flight, watched the Falcon soar with the three people who will accompany him. Their capsule is still at the space station and due back on Earth with four astronauts next Wednesday. It will be refurbished in time for a September liftoff. Another crew flight for NASA will follow in October. For Fridays automated flight, SpaceX replaced some valves and thermal shielding, and installed new parachutes on the capsule, named Endeavour after NASAs retired space shuttle. Otherwise, the spacecraft is the same vehicle that flew before.  Were thrilled to have a crew on board Endeavour once again, SpaceX Launch Control radioed just before liftoff. All four astronauts clasped hands as Kimbrough noted it was the first time in more than 20 years that U.S., European and Japanese astronauts had launched together. The first-stage booster touched down on an ocean platform nine minutes after liftoff. SpaceX picked up the station slack for NASA after the space agencys shuttles retired in 2011, starting with supply runs the following year. The big draw was last years return of astronaut launches to Florida, after years of relying on Russia for rides. Its awesome to have this regular cadence again, said Kennedys director Robert Cabana, a former shuttle commander. Boeing, NASAs other contracted crew transporter, isnt expected to start launching NASA astronauts until early next year. First, it needs to repeat a test flight of an empty Starliner capsule, possibly in late summer, to make up for its software-plagued debut in December 2019. Last Friday, SpaceX beat out two other companies, including Jeff Bezos Blue Origin, to land astronauts on the moon for NASA in three or more years. Theyll descend to the lunar surface in Starship, the shiny, bullet-shaped rocketship that Musk is testing in the skies over southeast Texas, near the Mexican border. Musk said Starship should be ready to carry people in a couple years, although he expects to smash more of them before getting there. The 2024 deadline for putting astronauts on the moon, which was set by the Trump administration, is doable, he added.  Its a great time to be here, and were very excited, said the European Space Agencys Frank De Winne, an astronaut turned manager. The space station eventually will come to an end, he noted, but the partnership will continue amid hopes of European astronauts one day walking on the surface of the moon. ___ AP videojournalist Cody Jackson contributed to this report.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Restoring forests 1 tree at a time, to help repair climate","MADRE DE DIOS, Peru (AP)  Destruction of the forests can be swift. Regrowth is much, much slower. But around the world, people are putting shovels to ground to help it happen. In a corner of the Peruvian Amazon, where illegal gold mining has scarred forests and poisoned ground, scientists work to change wasteland back to wilderness. More than 3,000 miles to the north, on former coal mining land across Appalachia, workers rip out old trees that never put down deep roots and make the soil more suitable to regrow native tree species. In Brazil, a nursery owner grows different kinds of seedlings to help reconnect forests along the countrys Atlantic coast, benefiting endangered species like the golden lion tamarin. They labor amid spectacular recent losses  the Amazon jungle and the Congo basin ablaze, smoke from Indonesian rainforests wafting over Malaysia and Singapore, fires set mostly to make way for cattle pastures and farm fields. Between 2014 and 2018, a new report says, an area the size of the United Kingdom was stripped of forest each year. Rebuilding woodland is slow and often difficult work. And it requires patience: It can take several decades or longer for forests to regrow as viable habitats, and to absorb the same amount of carbon lost when trees are cut and burned. Planting a tree is only one step in the process, says Christopher Barton, a professor of forest hydrology at the Appalachian Center of the University of Kentucky. And yet, there is urgency to that work  forests are one of the planets first lines of defense against climate change, absorbing as much as a quarter of man-made carbon emissions each year. 
        
     Through photosynthesis, trees and other plants use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce chemical energy to fuel their growth; oxygen is released as a byproduct. As forests have shrunk, however, so has an already overloaded Earths capacity to cope with carbon emissions. Successful reforestation programs take into account native plant species. They are managed by groups with a sustained commitment to monitoring forests, not just one-off tree planting events. And usually, they economically benefit the people who live nearby  for instance, by creating jobs, or reducing erosion that damages homes or crops. The impact could be great: A recent study in the journal Science projected that if 0.9 billion hectares (2.2 billion acres) of new trees were planted  around 500 billion saplings they could absorb 205 gigatonnes (220 gigatons) of carbon once they reached maturity. The Swiss researchers estimated this would be equivalent to about two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Other scientists dispute those calculations, while some fear the theoretical promise of tree-planting as an easy solution to climate changes could distract people from the range and scope of the responses needed. But all agree: Trees matter. ___ On a spring morning, forestry researcher Jhon Farfan steered a motorcycle through the dense Peruvian jungle, his tires churning up red mud. He was following a narrow path cut by illegal gold miners in the heart of the Amazon, but he was not seeking treasure. Instead, he was on a quest to reforest abandoned gold mines within the worlds largest tropical forest. After three hours of difficult travel, he reached a broad clearing where knee-high saplings stood in rows, their yellow-green leaves straining for the sun. Farfan whipped out a clipboard with a diagram of the saplings planted months earlier, much like a teacher checking attendance. The goal is to look for the survivors, he said. Within the thick jungle, only a sliver of light escapes to the forest floor. Often more can be heard than seen: a chorus of howler monkeys, the chatter of red-crowned parakeets  reminders that the Amazon is home to more species diversity than anywhere on the planet. But the rainforest is under increasing threat from illicit logging, mining and ranching. In a region of southeastern Peru called Madre de Dios, Farfans job involves inspecting lands where the forest has already been lost to illegal mining spurred by the spike in gold prices following the 2008 global financial crash. To recover the gold, the floor of the jungle was turned upside down. There are no gold seams in the lowland areas of the Amazon, but only flakes of gold washed down from the Andes mountains by ancient rivers, buried beneath the soil. After cutting and burning centuries-old trees, miners used diesel pumps to suck up deep layers of the earth, then pushed the soil through filters to separate out gold particles. To turn gold dust into nuggets, they stirred in mercury, which binds the gold together but also poisons the land. Left behind are patches of desert-like land  dry, sandy, stripped of topsoil and ringed by trunks of dead trees. Last December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers. Most tree deaths happen in the first year, Farfan said. If the trees make it to year five, typically theyre going to be there a long time. A study of former gold mines in Peru by scientists at CINCIA and Wake Forest University several years ago found that seedlings transplanted with soil were more likely to survive than bare-root seedlings, and the use of special fertilizers also helped growth. Some of the trees tested had absorbed trace amounts of mercury through contaminated soil, but its not clear yet how this will affect them. Since the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 42 hectares (115 acres) with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date. The group is in discussion with Perus government to expand their efforts. Its very hard to stop mining in Madre de Dios, since its a major activity, said Farfan. The challenge now: to plant a tree that can grow in this soil. ___ While scientists struggle with tainted landscapes in the Amazon, activists a continent away are reckoning with flawed past attempts to heal the land. After miners left West Virginias Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with federal law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldnt seep down, and tree roots couldnt expand. Companies planted desperation species  grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure, but wouldnt reach their full height or restore the forest as it had been. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development. It was like trees trying to grow in a parking lot  not many could make it, said Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work. The Appalachian highlands once supported a large and unique ecosystem, dominated by 500,000 acres of red spruce forest a century and a half ago. But commercial logging in the late 1800s and later coal mining in the 20th century stripped the landscape, leaving less than a tenth of the red spruce forests intact. Now French and colleagues at Green Forests Work are collaborating with the U.S. Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support  by first tearing down other trees. We literally go in with a giant plow-like machine and rip the guts out of the soil, by dragging a 4-foot ripping shank behind a bulldozer, said Barton, the University of Kentucky professor and founder of Green Forests Work. Sometimes we call it ugly. This deep ripping, as its known, gives rainwater and tree roots a better chance to push down into the soil. A 2008 study found that disrupting the soil on U.S. brownfield sites through this method helped tree growth. After five growing seasons, trees planted on ripped sites had more roots compared to those where deep ripping didnt occur. Trees also grew taller. The idea of ripping up the ground seemed startling at first. When we first started, a lot of our colleagues thought we were crazy. But 10 years later, were well on our way, said Shane Jones, a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service. Earlier efforts at reforesting old mining sites within West Virginias Monongahela National Forest hadnt fared so well; sometimes, the majority of seedlings died. But in areas where the team has deep-ripped over the last decade, the survival rate of saplings has been around 90%. Green Forests Work has now reforested around 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested around 4,500 total acres since 2009. Their ultimate goal is to restart the natural cycle of the forest  so that scientists work becomes invisible again. ___ Other reforestation crusades are more personal. Maria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Graa, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazils lesser-known jungle  the Atlantic coastal rainforest. She collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. The Atlantic rainforest is one of the planets most threatened biomes, more than 90 percent of it was deforested, said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofits executive secretary. What is left is very fragmented. As she nears 50, Dona Graa says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities. She deplores the stupidity and ignorance of people who have destroyed most of the trees and continue destroying them. So Im trying . I cant do too much, but the little I can do, I try to do it properly to rescue those trees. And so, between feeding her chickens and raking the leaves, she grows seedlings of rare species  pau pereira, peroba, trees that people have damaged already, they dont exist anymore. She mixes limestone and clay, places it in plastic nursery bags and plants seeds in them; she irrigates them with water and cow urine. Local replanting efforts  which aim to reconnect fragmented parcels of forest  often use the seedlings from Dona Graas nursery, which gives her both income and great satisfaction. She does this, she said, for posterity. In the future when I pass away ... that memory I tried to leave for the people is: Its worth it to plant, to build, she said. ___ Federica Narancio contributed to this report from Peru and West Virginia, and Yesica Fisch reported from Brazil. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Last December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers. Since the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 42 hectares (115 acres) with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date. After miners left West Virginias Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with U.S. law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldnt seep down, and tree roots couldnt expand. Companies planted desperation species  grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure, but wouldnt reach their full height or restore the forest as it had been. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development. Now Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work, and his colleagues are collaborating with the U.S. Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support  by first tearing down other trees. Green Forests Work has reforested around 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested around 4,500 total acres since 2009.  Maria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Graa, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazils lesser-known jungle  the Atlantic coastal rainforest. She collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. The Atlantic rainforest is one of the planets most threatened biomes, more than 90 percent of it was deforested, said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofits executive secretary. What is left is very fragmented. As she nears 50, Dona Graa says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities. And so, between feeding her chickens and raking the leaves, she grows seedlings of rare species. She mixes limestone and clay, places it in plastic nursery bags and plants seeds in them; she irrigates them with water and cow urine. Local replanting efforts  which aim to reconnect fragmented parcels of forest  often use the seedlings from Dona Graas nursery. She does this, she said, for posterity. In the future when I pass away ... that memory I tried to leave for the people is: Its worth it to plant, to build, she said. ___ Federica Narancio contributed to this report from Peru and West Virginia, and Yesica Fisch reported from Brazil. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Lions kill cattle, so people kill lions. Can the cycle end?","LOIBOR SIRET, Tanzania (AP)  Saitoti Petro scans a dirt road in northern Tanzania for recent signs of the top predator on the African savannah. If you see a lion, he warns, stop and look it straight in the eyes _ you must never run. Petro points to a fresh track in the dirt, a paw print measuring nearly the length of a ballpoint pen. He walks along a few more yards reading tracks the way an archaeologist might decipher hieroglyphics, gleaning meaning from the smudges in the dust. A large male passed here within the past two hours, he says. Here hes walking slowly, then you see his claws come out in the tracks. Perhaps hes running after prey, or from something else. The tall, slender 29-year-old is marching with four other young men who belong to a pastoralist people called the Maasai. Beneath the folds of his thick cloak, he carries a sharpened machete. Only a few years ago, men of Petros age would most likely have been stalking lions to hunt them _ often, to avenge cattle that the big cats had eaten. But as Petro explains, the problem now is that there are too few lions, not too many. It will be shameful if we kill them all, he says. It will be a big loss if our future children never see lions. And so hes joined an effort to protect lions, by safeguarding domestic animals on which they might prey. Petro is one of more than 50 lion monitors from communities on the Maasai steppe who walk daily patrol routes to help shepherds shield their cattle in pasture, with support and training from a small, Tanzanian nonprofit called African People & Wildlife. Over the past decade, this group has also helped more than a thousand extended households to build secure modern corrals made of living acacia trees and chain-link fence to protect their livestock at night. 
        
     This kind of intervention is, in a way, a grand experiment. The survival of lions _ and many other threatened savannah species, from cheetahs to giraffes to elephants _ likely depends on finding a way for people, livestock and wild beasts to continue to use these lands together, on the plains where the earliest humans walked upright through tall grass. Across Africa, the number of lions has dropped by more than 40 percent in two decades, according to data released in 2015 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, putting lions on the list of species scientists consider vulnerable to extinction. They have disappeared from 94 percent of the lands they used to roam in Africa, what researchers call their historic range. The biggest reason for lions retreat is that their former grasslands are being converted into cropland and cities. Losing habitat is the top risk to wildlife in Africa and globally. But on open savannahs where lions still roam, poaching for body parts and revenge killings are the next most significant threats. Lions are respected as worthy adversaries in Maasai culture. Anyone who harms more than nine is said to be cursed. But avenging the death of a prize cow wins respect, like dueling to avenge a lost family member. These retaliatory killings have become more deadly in recent years, as many herdsmen have switched from spearing individual lions to leaving out poisoned carcasses, which can decimate a pride of lions, along with other animals that might feed on tainted meat. But what if the triggering conflicts could be prevented? Our elders killed and almost finished off the lions, Petro says. Unless we have new education, they will be extinct. And so he hikes the steppe, looking to teach people how to live more peaceably alongside large predators. On a July morning, he stops suddenly and points toward a tree-lined ravine. The tracks hes been following have veered off the road, so he thinks the lion moved toward a stream in the gorge. The footprints must be recent because there are not yet bits of grass strewn on top. As his team walks toward the gulley, they hear cow bells jingling. We should go and check if anyone is coming this way, says Petro. We need to warn them. They soon find two young shepherds _ pre-teen boys _ sitting under an acacia tree, playing with small yellow fruit like balls in the dirt. Their two dozen cattle are meandering toward the ravine. Petro kneels to greet the boys, then advises them about the lion. The men help the boys to turn their herd around, with a high whistle the cows recognize, sending them grazing in a safer direction. Petro knows most of the families near here; later, he will make a home visit. In most corners of the planet, humans and big predators dont easily co-exist. When forests and savannahs are converted to farms and cities, the land ceases to be suitable habitat for most large animals. And predators lingering on the edge of cultivated lands are often demonized, or exterminated _ witness the heated debates about allowing gray wolves on the margins of Yellowstone and the French Pyrenees. But on the elevated plains of northern Tanzania, pastoralists have long lived alongside wildlife: grazing their cows, goats and sheep on the same broad savannahs where zebras, buffalo and giraffe munch grass and leaves _ and where lions, leopards and hyenas stalk these wild beasts. Its one of the few places left on Earth where coexistence may still be possible, but its a precarious balance. And what happens here in Tanzania will help determine the fate of the species; the country is home to a more than a third of the roughly 22,500 remaining African lions, according to data from researchers at the University of Oxford. Theres some evidence that recent steps taken to mitigate conflict are working. In 2005, the village of Loibor Siret (population 3,000) on the Maasai steppe saw about three predator attacks on livestock each month. In 2017, the number had declined to about one a month. The biggest change in that interval was that about 90 village households built reinforced corrals, which are much more effective than the older barriers of tangled thorn bushes at keeping predators away from livestock. Although protecting animals in pasture is a trickier challenge, the lion monitors helped to defuse 14 situations in 2017 that might have led to lion hunts, according to records collected by African People & Wildlife. While the number of lion hunts in the region is dropping, they do still sometimes happen. In July, one of the field patrols submitted a report about a recent revenge killing, including a photograph of a dead lion with its four paws and tail removed _ an old ritual for collecting talismans. Despite such setbacks, the local lion population is beginning to bounce back. Within a study area monitored by the nonprofit Tarangire Lion Project, the monthly count of lions hit a low of around 120 lions in fall 2011 _ down from about 220 lions in 2004. But the population started to recover in 2012, reaching more than 160 lions by 2015. Once you make lions safe, their numbers can recover quickly, because lions reproduce rapidly, says Laly Lichtenfeld, an ecologist and co-founder of African People & Wildlife. Says Craig Packer, a biologist and founder of the Lion Center at the University of Minnesota, who is not involved in the project: These conflict-mitigation efforts clearly help lions, although theres always the question of whether theyre going to last 20 or 50 years with a growing human population. Wildlife refuges are sometimes not a sufficient answer _ at least for species that require large ranges. Within the boundaries of Tanzanias Tarangire National Park, lions sleep on open river banks and dangle from tree branches _ they are, after all, cats _ often ignoring the squadrons of open-top safari tour vehicles passing by. Here, they are mostly safe. But the protected area of the park is only a portion of the land that these lions and their prey depend upon. Large migratory animals range widely, and on the parched savannahs of eastern Africa, they mostly follow the rains. The zebras and wildebeests that spend the dry months inside Tarangire National Park move outside the park during the wet winter months, where they munch on more nutritious grass and give birth to most of their calves. And lions, leopards and cheetah trail behind them, roaming widely on the Maasai steppe. The animals in Tarangire spend so much of the year outside the park, you could never put a fence around it _ a fence that blocked migration in and out of the park would kill it, says Packer. Increasingly scientists are realizing that lands outside national parks must also be considered in conservation strategies. In a study published in March in the journal Science, researchers linked the access and condition of lands surrounding Tanzanias famous Serengeti-Mara ecosystem to the health of wildlife inside the park. Overgrazing and fire suppression on the edge of the park, for instance, squeezed the animals into a smaller area within it, they found. The current way of just thinking about the borders of protected areas isnt working, says Michiel Veldhuis, an ecologist at University of Leiden in the Netherlands and a study co-author. When devising conservation strategies, he says, we need to think about how to include people living next to protected areas. Those people can be skeptical. Some people in nearby villages say they arent happy about Petros efforts. We dont want to hear lions roar at night, says Neema Loshiro, a 60-year-old woman selling handmade jewelry spread out on a cloth on the street of Loibor Siret. The only wildlife she wants nearby are giraffes and impalas because theyre pretty and dont attack people or eat crops. Still, attitudes are evolving. Petro Lengima Lorkuta, Saitoti Petros 69-year-old father, killed his first lion when he was 25, hurling a spear after the cat attacked his largest bull. In those days, he says, If you killed a lion it showed that you were a strong warrior. Since his extended family moved into a new ranch home and erected a reinforced corral four years ago, he says they have not lost any livestock to predators. The modern fence is very helpful, he says. Now I love to see lions, just not too near his home _ and he supports his sons efforts to educate neighbors about avoiding predator conflicts. Petro still rises each day at dawn to take the cattle to pasture, as his ancestors have done for generations. But the culture is changing in many ways: Rather than allowing his father to arrange his marriages, as most young Maasai men do, Petro wooed his two brides. We expect the growing generation to get more education than us, he says, and therefore to know the importance of wild animals. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Astronauts replace old batteries in 1st of 5 spacewalks,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronauts hustled through the first of five spacewalks to replace old batteries at the International Space Station on Sunday. Christina Koch and Andrew Morgan removed three old batteries and installed two new ones delivered just a week ago, getting a jump on future work. These new lithium-ion batteries are so powerful that only one is needed for every two old ones. Awesome work today. We have made great progress, Mission Control radioed. Koch replied: It has been a wonderful day ... we look forward to the rest of the series. Koch and Morgan will venture back out Friday for more battery work 250 miles (400 kilometers) up. The 400-pound (180-kilogram) batteries  half the size of a refrigerator  are part of the space stations solar power network. Astronauts have been upgrading them since 2017 and are now more than halfway done. The old ones are 10 years old; the new ones are expected to last until the end of the space stations life, providing vital power on the night side of the Earth. These latest battery swaps are especially difficult given the extreme location on the stations sprawling frame. Its too far for the 58-foot (17-meter) robot arm to reach, forcing astronauts to lug the batteries back and forth themselves. Thats why so many spacewalks are needed this time to replace 12 old nickel-hydrogen batteries with six new lithium-ion versions. Koch and Morgan took turns holding each battery as they made their way, inchworm style, along the structure. The batteries were so bulky that it blocked the spacewalkers views of one another, prompting constant updates. I am right next to you, Koch said at one point. I have the battery, Morgan replied. Then Koch had the battery, and so it went until the job was complete. 
        
     They ended up plugging in two new batteries, one more than anticipated, and removing an extra old one. The seven-hour spacewalk ended on another high note, at least for Koch. As she headed back inside, Mission Control gave her a National Football League update: Good news, Eagles are ahead 14-0 in the second quarter. She replied, Go birds! The Philadelphia Eagles routed the New York Jets, 31-6. NASA plans to wrap up the five battery spacewalks this month, followed by a Russian spacewalk. Then five more U.S.-Italian spacewalks will be conducted in November and December to fix a key science instrument. NASA is calling it a spacewalk bonanza. This unusual crush of spacewalks will feature the first all-female spacewalk  by Koch and Jessica Meir  later this month. Koch is two-thirds of the way through a more than 300-day mission. It will be the longest single spaceflight by a woman. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA moves up 1st all-female spacewalk to fix power unit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is moving up the first all-female spacewalk to this week because of a power system failure at the International Space Station. Astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will now venture out Thursday or Friday, instead of next Monday, to deal with the problem. It will be the first spacewalk by only women in more than a half-century of spacewalking. A critical battery charger failed over the weekend, prompting the change, NASA officials said Monday. The women will replace the broken component, rather than install new batteries, which was their original job. Last week, astronauts conducted the first two of five spacewalks to replace old batteries that make up the stations solar power network. The remaining spacewalks  originally scheduled for this week and next  have been delayed for at least another few weeks so engineers can determine why the battery charger failed. Its the second such failure this year. The devices regulate the amount of charge going to and from each battery. One didnt kick in Friday night, preventing one of the three newly installed lithium-ion batteries from working. The balky charger is 19 years old; the one that failed in the spring was almost as old. Only three spares remain available. Its absolutely a concern at this point when you dont know whats going on, said Kenny Todd, a space station manager. Were still scratching our heads looking at the data. Hopefully, we can clear that up in relatively short order. 
        
     Despite the slight loss of power, the orbiting lab and its six occupants are safe, according to NASA, and science operations are unaffected. The current situation is manageable, but again not something that we would want to live with in the long term, Todd told reporters. NASA originally planned an all-female spacewalk last spring, but had to cancel it because of a shortage of readily available medium-size suits. Koch helped assemble an extra medium suit over the summer. Very good that we have 4 expert spacewalkers on board to shoulder this tough task. They are the A-team! tweeted astronaut Anne McClain, who would have gone spacewalking with Koch in March if not for the suit-sizing issue. While all four  two men and two women  are equally trained for the repair job, Koch and Meir are the right choices given the future spacewalking workload, officials noted. Since the first spacewalk in 1965, there have been 227 spacewalkers, only 14 of them women. Meir will be making her first spacewalk and become No. 15. All but one of these women has been American. The upcoming spacewalk will be absolutely ... an exciting event, said Megan McArthur, deputy chief of NASAs astronaut corps. The fact that it will be two women just is a reflection of the fact that we have so many capable, qualified women in the office. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

How do you help endangered gorillas? With lots of human help,"KINIGI, Rwanda (AP)  Deep in the rainforest of Volcanoes National Park, a 23-year-old female gorilla named Kurudi feeds on a stand of wild celery. She bends the green stalks and, with long careful fingers, peels off the exterior skin to expose the succulent inside. Biologist Jean Paul Hirwa notes her meal on his tablet computer as he peers out from behind a nearby stand of stinging nettles. The large adult male sitting next to her, known as a silverback, looks at him quizzically. Hirwa makes a low hum  ahh-mmm  imitating the gorillas usual sound of reassurance. Im here, Hirwa is trying to say. Its OK. No reason to worry. Hirwa and the two great apes are all part of the worlds longest-running gorilla study  a project begun in 1967 by famed American primatologist Dian Fossey. Yet Fossey herself, who died in 1985, would likely be surprised any mountain gorillas are left to study. Alarmed by rising rates of poaching and deforestation in central Africa, she predicted the species could go extinct by 2000. Instead, a concerted and sustained conservation campaign has averted the worst and given a second chance to these great apes, which share about 98% of human DNA. Last fall, the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature changed the status of mountain gorillas from critically endangered to endangered, an improved if still-fragile designation, reflecting new survey data. 
        
     It wouldnt have happened without an intervention some biologists call extreme conservation, which has entailed monitoring every single gorilla in the rainforest, periodically giving them veterinary care  to clean infected wounds, for instance  and funding forest protection by sending money into communities that might otherwise resent not being able to convert the woods into cropland. The gorillas are still here. We celebrate that as a victory, Hirwa says. Instead of disappearing, the number of mountain gorillas  a subspecies of eastern gorillas  has risen from 680 a decade ago to just over 1,000 today. Their population is split between two regions, including mist-covered defunct volcanoes within Congo, Uganda and Rwanda  one of Africas smallest and most densely populated countries. The population of mountain gorillas is still vulnerable, says George Schaller, a renowned biologist and gorilla expert. But their numbers are now growing, and thats remarkable. Once depicted in legends and films like King Kong as fearsome beasts, gorillas are actually languid primates that eat only plants and insects, and live in fairly stable, extended family groups. Their strength and chest-thumping displays are generally reserved for contests between male rivals. Hirwa works for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a conservation nonprofit group. The organization is a successor to the Digit Fund, which Fossey created in 1978 after poachers killed one of her favorite gorillas, Digit. Today the organization supports research, education and training for future conservationists in Africa. Every week, Hirwa and other scientists gather data as part of long-term behavioral research. As Hirwa recently observed a gorilla family, he gingerly pulled back a stalk of stinging nettles for a better view. He watched as the silverback, a 19-year-old named Pato, walked on all fours toward a squirming infant gorilla, Macibiri. Pato sat beside her and ran his long fingers through her fur, grooming her, looking for insects or other things caught in her glossy black coat. He made a low hum. Not every silverback will do that, will pay attention to the infants, Hirwa says. That shows his personality. Pato is one chill silverback. Hirwa noticed a fresh wound on Patos chest, a small red slash. Most likely, he surmised, Pato had been jousting with the familys second silverback for control of the group. Later, Hirwa informed the chief park warden and the staff at Gorillas Doctors, a nongovernmental group whose veterinarians work in the forest. The vets monitor wounds and signs of respiratory infections, but they intervene only sparingly. When they do  for example, by darting a gorilla with antibiotics  they almost never remove the animals from the mountain, since reuniting gorillas can be difficult. A long absence can change the delicate social dynamic. Our hospital is the forest, says Jean Bosco Noheli, a veterinarian at Gorilla Doctors. When his team goes into the field to address a gorilla emergency, they must carry everything they might need in equipment bags weighing up to 100 pounds  including portable X-ray machines. Schaller, the biologist, conducted the first detailed studies of mountain gorillas in the 1950s and early 60s, in what was then the Belgian Congo. He also was the first to discover that wild gorillas could, over time, become comfortable with periodic human presence, a boon to researchers and, later, tourists. Today, highly regulated tour groups hike in the Rwandan rainforest to watch gorillas. Within Volcanoes National Park, tour groups are limited to eight people at a time, with only an hour spent observing gorillas. You cant carry food or even water bottles near the animals, lest a curious silverback snatch them and perhaps be exposed to your germs. Dont hold eye contact for too long. And if a gorilla acts aggressive  which is rare  look down, bend your knee and show you acknowledge its authority. Hirwa calls this submissive pose. The number of tourists per day is limited, and the price is steep: $1,500 per visit. Ticket revenue pays for operating costs and outstrips what might have been made from converting the rainforest to potato farms and cattle pastures. About 40% of the forest already was cleared for agriculture in the early 1970s. With tourism, the tension is always not to overexploit, says Dirck Byler, great ape conservation director at the nonprofit Global Wildlife Conservation, which is not involved in the Rwanda gorilla project. But in Rwanda, so far theyre careful, and its working. The idea of using tourism to help fund conservation was contentious when conservationists Bill Weber and Amy Vedder first proposed it while living in Rwanda during the 1970s and 80s. Fossey herself was skeptical, but the pair persisted. The wonder of the gorillas lives, their curiosity, their social interactions  we felt thats something that could be accessible to others, through careful tourism, Vedder says. Figuring out the balance of how many people could visit the forest, and for how long, was a delicate process of trial and error, Weber says. The pair, who are married and currently professors at Yale University, had another idea, equally radical when it was first proposed  some of the money raised must benefit local communities. Back then, the field of conservation was dominated by the fortress model': You draw a line, build a wall, hire guards and keep local people out, Weber says. But it wasnt really working to stop poaching. There needs to be a real incentive for local people to care about conservation. In 2005, the government adopted a model to steer 5% of tourism revenue from Volcanoes National Park to build infrastructure in surrounding villages, including schools and health clinics. Two years ago, the share was raised to 10%. To date, about $2 million has gone into funding village projects, chief park warden Prosper Uwingeli says. Every year, we meet with the communities, he says. We have to give back. Before taking on the job of running what amounts to one of Rwandas most high-profile enterprises, Uwingeli studied gorilla behavior as a research assistant at the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Sometimes he misses the quiet, patient work of a scientist. But his time in the field also helped shape his mission. We dont want to protect the park with guns. We want to protect and conserve this park with people who understand why, and who take responsibility, he says. One recent morning at dawn, Emmanuel Bizagwira, one of the parks 100 full-time gorilla trackers, spotted something moving in the trees ahead. Can you see over there? he says, pointing with his radio antenna. The gorillas are eating there. I saw them. Did you see the trees? Theyre there. Pushing through waist-high shrubs alongside fellow tracker Safari Gabriel, he kept his eyes on the trees where hed seen movement. Each morning, his job is to locate the whereabouts of a particular 24-member gorilla family, called Agashya group, then alert the park warden. These gorilla trackers are the backbone of the entire conservation project. Their work enables the scientists, tour guides and veterinarians to find gorillas quickly and do their jobs. Bizagwiras grandfather also hiked in the same forest. He was a poacher who laid traps for bushmeat, mostly intended for antelopes but sometimes also ensnaring gorillas. Bizagwira, 31, says he is grateful to have steady work to protect the gorillas. I love my job, I love wild animals, he says. He can identify several dozen plants that gorillas eat, and looks for torn or crushed stems to determine where gorilla troops may have recently passed. Sometimes, he glimpses elephants and golden monkeys in the same forest. At Nyabitsinde Primary School, nearly every pupil has at least one relative working in nearby Volcanoes National Park. Leontine Muhawenimana, who is 11, says her father also is a tracker, and she likes to hear his stories about gorillas. The school has new classrooms with blackboards and wooden benches, and a colorful mural outside the bathroom reads Washing hands prevents diseases. But the school is still short on some basic supplies, like pencils. The money that built this school comes from tourism, says Fabien Uwimana, a French and English teacher. More children today can go to school. The money from tourism helps, but the region is still poor. Jean Claude Masengesho lives with his parents and helps them farm potatoes. About once a week, the 21-year-old earns a little extra money helping tourists carry their bags up the mountain, totaling about $45 a month. He would like to someday become a tour guide, which would earn him about $320 monthly. The obstacle is that most tour guides have attended college, and Masengesho isnt sure how his family can afford tuition. Its my dream, but its very hard, he says. In this village, every young persons dream is to work in the park. In the meantime, he draws portraits of gorillas with green and black crayons. Mostly, he draws silverbacks. He is fascinated by gorillas, but also pragmatic. People come from all over the world to see the gorillas, he says. Gorillas bring us money from all over the world, and we need to protect them. Sixty years after he first moved to central Africa to study gorillas as a wide-eyed 26-year-old with a notebook, the veteran biologist Schaller says conservation may need both a moral and an economic argument. Schaller believes that people have no right to exterminate a species, but also that you have to find some economic benefit for the people that border the park. You have to involve them somehow, he says, make them feel its their park, too. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Ticket revenue pays for operating costs and outstrips what might have been made from converting the rainforest to potato farms and cattle pastures. About 40% of the forest already was cleared for agriculture in the early 1970s. With tourism, the tension is always not to overexploit, says Dirck Byler, great ape conservation director at the nonprofit Global Wildlife Conservation, which is not involved in the Rwanda gorilla project. But in Rwanda, so far theyre careful, and its working. The idea of using tourism to help fund conservation was contentious when conservationists Bill Weber and Amy Vedder first proposed it while living in Rwanda during the 1970s and 80s. Fossey herself was skeptical, but the pair persisted. The wonder of the gorillas lives, their curiosity, their social interactions  we felt thats something that could be accessible to others, through careful tourism, Vedder says. Figuring out the balance of how many people could visit the forest, and for how long, was a delicate process of trial and error, Weber says. In 2005, the Rwandan government adopted a model to steer 5% of tourism revenue from Volcanoes National Park to build infrastructure in surrounding villages, including schools and health clinics. Two years ago, the share was raised to 10%. To date, about $2 million has gone into funding village projects, chief park warden Prosper Uwingeli says. We dont want to protect the park with guns. We want to protect and conserve this park with people who understand why, and who take responsibility, he says. The money from tourism helps, but the region is still poor. Jean Claude Masengesho lives with his parents and helps them farm potatoes. About once a week, the 21-year-old earns a little extra money helping tourists carry their bags up the mountain, totaling about $45 a month. He would someday like to become a tour guide, which could earn him about $320 monthly. The obstacle is that most tour guides have attended college, and Masengesho isnt sure how his family can afford tuition. Its my dream, but its very hard, he says. In this village, every young persons dream is to work in the park. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Space shipment launched with sports car parts, cookie oven","A supply ship rocketed toward the International Space Station on Saturday with sports car parts, an oven for baking cookies and a vest to protect against radiation. Northrop Grumman launched its Cygnus capsule for NASA from Wallops Island, Virginia. The 8,200-pound shipment (3,700 kilograms) should reach the orbiting lab Monday. Good launch all the way around, a ground controller observed. The space stations astronauts will test the oven by baking chocolate chip cookies and try out the new safety vest to gauge its comfort. Both experiments are seen as precursors to moon and Mars journeys. Other newly arriving equipment will be used in a series of NASA spacewalks later this month to fix a key particle physics detector. Parked outside the space station since 2011, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer needs new cooling pumps to continue its search for elusive dark matter and antimatter. Italys Lamborghini is also along for the ride. Its sending up samples of carbon fiber used in its sports cars for six months of direct space exposure. Researchers are considering the materials for medical implants. Like space, the insides of a persons body are an extreme environment, explained Houston Methodists Alessandro Grattoni, who is collaborating with Lamborghini on the experiment. As a nanomedicine specialist, he said Friday hes continuously on the lookout for new materials for devices that are inserted beneath the skin. These minuscule implants release therapeutic drugs to treat cancer, hormone deficiencies and other illnesses. 
        
     Northrop Grumman is now controlling two Cygnus capsules in orbit, a first for the Virginia-based company. Named for the swan constellation, the Cygnus launched last spring is flying free of the 250-mile-high (400-kilometer-high) space station, after completing its grocery run. It will be directed to a fiery re-entry sometime in the near future, taking station trash down with it, according to company officials. The newest Cygnus is officially called the S.S. Alan Bean after the Apollo 12 astronaut who became the fourth man to walk on the moon 50 years ago this month. He later commanded NASAs first space station, Skylab, and became known for his cosmic-themed paintings. He died last year. NASA has contracted with Northrop Grumman and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked. This is Northrop Grummans 12th successful Cygnus flight since 2013. The company has upgraded both its Cygnus and Antares rocket to haul more cargo from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility on the eastern Virginia shore. The space station is currently home to three Americans, two Russians and one Italian.",https://apnews.com/space-shipment-launched-with-sports-car-parts-cookie-oven-a8a6b36173304405a5a43c35e490eaa1,science
Boeing: Pin problem caused parachute issue in capsule test,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeing says a problem with a pin caused its Starliner capsule to land with two instead of three parachutes earlier this week. The crew capsule underwent a safety test flight Monday, soaring nearly a mile into the New Mexico sky. Only two main parachutes deployed. Boeings vice president for commercial crew, John Mulholland, said Thursday that the rigging was not connected properly because the pin wasnt secured in place. Mulholland says the company is double-checking the parachute rigging on the capsule due to rocket into orbit next month. Only a dummy and some cargo will be on that test flight to the International Space Station. NASA is counting on Boeing and SpaceX to start taking astronauts to the space station from Cape Canaveral, Florida, sometime next year.",https://apnews.com/national-b96411c950be41e4a9ae967028b40d58,science
China aims to build its own Yellowstone on Tibetan plateau,"XINING, China (AP)  Theres a building boom on the Tibetan plateau, one of the worlds last remote places. Mountains long crowned by garlands of fluttering prayer flags  a traditional landscape blessing  are newly topped with sprawling steel power lines. At night, the illuminated signs of Sinopec gas stations cast a red glow over newly built highways. Ringed by the worlds tallest mountain ranges, the region long known as the rooftop of the world is now in the crosshairs of Chinas latest modernization push, marked by multiplying skyscrapers and expanding high-speed rail lines. But this time, theres a difference: The Chinese government also wants to set limits on the regions growth in order to design its own version of one of the U.S.'s proudest legacies  a national park system. In August, policymakers and scientists from China, the United States and other countries convened in Xining, capital of the countrys Qinghai province, to discuss Chinas plans to create a unified park system with clear standards for limiting development and protecting ecosystems. The countrys economy has boomed over the past 40 years, but priorities are now expanding to include conserving key natural resources, says Zhu Chunquan, the China representative of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a Switzerland-based scientific group. Its quite urgent as soon as possible to identify the places, the ecosystems and other natural features to protect, Zhu says. 
        
     Among other goals, China aims to build its own Yellowstone on the Tibetan plateau. Zhu serves on an advisory committee providing input on the development of Chinas nascent national park system, expected to be officially unveiled in 2020. Chinese officials also have visited U.S. national parks, including Yellowstone and Yosemite, and sought input from varied organizations, including the Chicago-based Paulson Institute and the Nature Conservancy. The ambition to create a unified park system represents a new and serious effort to safeguard Chinas biodiversity and natural heritage, Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm says. One of the first pilot parks will be in Qinghai, a vast region in western China abutting Tibet and sharing much of its cultural legacy. The area also is home to such iconic and threatened species as the snow leopard and Chinese mountain cat, and encompasses the headwaters of three of Asias great waterways: the Yangtze, Yellow and Mekong Rivers. This is one of the most special regions in China, in the world, says Lu Zhi, a Peking University conservation biologist who has worked in Qinghai for two decades. While construction continues at a frenzied pace elsewhere on the Tibetan plateau, the government already has stopped issuing mining and hydropower permits in this region. But a key question looms over the project: Can China marry the goals of conservation and tourism, while safeguarding the livelihoods and culture of the approximately 128,000 people who live within or near the parks boundaries, many of them Tibetan? China has a dense population and a long history, Zhu says. One of the unique features of Chinas national parks is that they have local people living either inside or nearby. Yellowstone is widely considered the worlds first national park. After it was created in 1872, the U.S. government forced the Native Americans who lived in the area to resettle outside the park boundaries, in keeping with the 19th-century notion that wilderness protection meant nature apart from people. But countries that attempt to establish park systems in the 21st century now must consider how best to include local populations in their planning. Figuring out how to achieve ecological conservation and support for the communities at the same time  thats the most complicated rub you have, says Jonathan Jarvis, a former director at the U.S. National Park Service and now a professor of the University of California, Berkeley, who has toured the Qinghai pilot park, called Sanjiangyuan. China has previously undertaken vast resettlement programs to clear land for large infrastructure projects, such as Three Gorges Dam and the South-to-North Water Transfer Project. These resettlements left many farmers in new homes without suitable agricultural fields or access to other livelihoods. But in developing the national parks, the government is giving conservation-related jobs to at least a swath of people living in Sanjiangyuan to stay and work on their land. The One Family, One Ranger program hires one person per family for 1800 yuan a month ($255) to perform such tasks as collecting trash and monitoring for poaching or illegal grazing activity. Its difficult to interview residents in Chinas ethnic borderlands like Qinghai, due to restrictions on journalists that make it hard to travel widely or freely in those areas. Regions with large ethnic and religious minorities, including all Tibetan areas, are subject to heightened political and religious controls. But a few people living in Angsai, a Tibetan village located within the new Qinghai park, were willing to speak, although its not possible to determine if their experiences are typical. A-Ta is a Tibetan herder whose income largely comes from raising yaks and collecting caterpillar fungus, a folk medicine taken as a purported aphrodisiac or for respiratory problems. He also leads a team of trash collectors, traveling as much as 34 kilometers (21 miles) a day to comb the hillsides for plastic bottles and other waste as part of the One Family, One Ranger program. I am living in this land, my living is relying on this land, he says, as his sister heats a kettle in their modest home. A poster showing the faces of Chinas past leaders and current Communist Party general secretary, Xi Jinping, hangs on the wall. A-Ta says he is grateful for work that allows his family to stay on their land, even as people in other parts of Qinghai have had to leave. His own son is employed leading a relocation program for a huge population of nomads in Dzarto, a county in southern Qinghai. I love this land very much, he says. I always motivate and encourage people to protect the environment and contribute to the conservation work. Kunchok Jangtse is a Tibetan herder who also earns money cleaning up rubbish through the One Family, One Ranger program. He has an additional volunteer position through the Chinese nonprofit Shanshui  the name means mountain, water  installing and maintaining motion-activated camera traps, which help scientists monitor endangered species in Qinghai. As he affixes a camera trap to a thin tree trunk, he explains, The reason why it has to be installed in this location is because this is the main migration route of the majority of wild animals. Such camera traps have captured rare footage of snow leopards and Chinese mountain cats, including mothers and their cubs playing near a temporary den. Kunchok Jangtse says the work of protecting the environment, including reporting illegal poaching activity, is important. Our religion is connected with wild animals, because wild animals have a consciousness and can feel love and compassion  therefore, we protect wild-animals, he says. From his main work raising livestock and collecting caterpillar fungus, Kunchok Jangtse says he can make about 20,000 yuan ($2,830) a year. He is grateful for the additional income from the ranger program, but mainly hopes his other livelihood wont be impeded  and that he wont eventually be forced to leave. Im not a highly educated person, and I am very concerned it may bring many difficulties in my life if I would switch my job and move to another place, he says. The question of local peoples culture and livelihoods is one of the top concerns that former U.S. National Park Service director Jarvis says China has to wrestle with, along with establishing laws and funding. They need a legal framework that defines what a park is, Jarvis says. And they need sustainable funding. The creation of protected areas is not a new idea in China. In fact, roughly 15% of the countrys land already is assigned to a bewildering patchwork of local and regional parks. But many existing reserves are simply parks on paper, run by various agencies without enforceable guidelines. In contrast, the national parks system is being designed from the ground-up to incorporate global best practices and new science. In his office in Beijing, Ouyang Zhiyun, deputy director at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, pores over hundreds of carefully shaded maps of mainland China that denote priority areas for protecting threatened and endangered species, as well as eco-system services, like safeguarding water supplies and limiting soil erosion. The question isnt just how much total land youre protecting, but which lands youre protecting, he notes. Recently, Ouyang was the lead scientist for Chinas sweeping national ecosystems assessment, which used 20,000 satellite images and 100,000 field surveys to examine how Chinas land changed between 2000 and 2010, with some of the findings published in the journal Science in 2016. One resulting statistic: Chinas urban area increased 28% during that period. Now Ouyang is drawing upon that work, combined with surveys of more than 1,500 species of endangered and threatened plants and animals, to map priority areas for conservation and advise park planners. He is focusing on habitats of endangered species that live only in China. If we lose it here, its gone, he says. The first parks to be formally incorporated into Chinas national park system will showcase the countrys vast and varied landscapes and ecosystems  from the granite and sandstone cliffs of Wuyishan in eastern China to the lush forests of southwestern Sichuan province, home to giant pandas, to the boreal forests of northeastern China, where endangered Siberian tigers roam. When it comes to ecology, few countries have more to lose, or to save, than China.

NASA warned of safety risks in delayed private crew launches,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA auditors warned Thursday the space agency faces significant safety and technical challenges that need to be solved before astronauts fly in private capsules. In its report, NASAs inspector general office noted Boeing and SpaceX are several years late in transporting crews to the International Space Station. The private capsules likely wont be certified before next summer, according to the report, and NASA should set a realistic timetable to avoid compromising safety. NASA officials concurred with this and most of the other recommendations in the 53-page audit. The auditors reported, meanwhile, that NASA overpaid Boeing $287.2 million to keep the company moving forward. Most of this overcharge was unnecessary, they said, a point with which NASA disagreed. The report shows, on average, a seat on Boeings Starliner capsule will cost $90 million, almost double the price of a ride on SpaceXs crew Dragon, at $55 million. Thats based on a crew of four flying one or two times a year. In case of further delays by Boeing and SpaceX, NASA is seeking to buy extra seats on Russian rockets in 2020 and 2021, another recommendation of the auditors. NASA has been paying Russia to ferry astronauts to the space station since the shuttles stopped flying in 2011; the most recent price was about $82 million a seat. SpaceX test-fired the launch escape engines on one of its capsules Wednesday at Cape Canaveral, an apparent success. Last April, the same test resulted in the destruction of the capsule. 
        
     Next up for SpaceX  possibly next month  is a test of the emergency escape system during an actual launch. That would be the last major flight hurdle for SpaceX before launching a pair of NASA astronauts to the space station sometime next year. Boeing completed its launch abort test last week in New Mexico. Only two of the three parachutes deployed, but the empty capsule still landed safely. Boeing aims to launch a Starliner  minus a crew  to the space station in mid-December. SpaceX conducted a similar test flight in March. During a visit to NASAs Ames Research Center in Northern California on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence said astronauts would be launching again from Cape Canaveral by spring. He did not indicate which company might be first. Boeing and SpaceX have made significant progress during these past eight years, NASA Inspector General Paul Martin and his auditors concluded in Thursdays report. However, after more than 2 years of delays both contractors will miss the current schedule to begin crewed test flights in late 2019, they wrote. Addressing outstanding technical challenges, safety and performance testing, and verification of the contractors requirements, hazards, and safety concerns likely will take significant time to complete. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Possible meteor outburst this week worth a look up,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Scientists are predicting a rare meteor outburst this week that may be brief but incredibly intense. A brilliant flurry in the sky near the Unicorn constellation is expected Thursday night over the eastern half of North America and all South America. The action should unfold early Friday morning over the western portions of Europe and Africa. Hundreds of shooting stars may be visible as Earth plows through the dusty tail of an unidentified comet. The alpha Monocerotids  named after the constellation Monoceros or the Unicorn  most recently produced an outburst in 1995.

Boeing names space test dummy Rosie after WWII riveter,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX had Ripley. Now Boeing has Rosie. As Boeing moved its Starliner crew capsule to its pad Thursday for a launch next month, the company revealed the name of the test dummy on board. Rosie the Astronaut is named after World War IIs Rosie the Riveter. The dummy has hundreds of sensors for the first Starliner test flight to the International Space Station. And its wearing Rosie the Riveters trademark red polka-dot head scarf, along with a Boeing blue spacesuit. Boeing said it chose the name given its long history of hiring women, especially during World War II to keep up bomber production. Shes flying for everyone on our team who took on the challenge of human spaceflight and said, We can do it,  Leanne Caret, president of Boeings defense, space and security unit, said in a statement. United Launch Alliances Atlas V rocket will provide the ride. Liftoff is targeted for Dec. 17. SpaceX turned to the Alien movies in naming its test dummy, Ripley, launched aboard a crew Dragon capsule in March. Flights with NASA astronauts should follow next year for both private companies. The first Starliner crew will include a woman, NASAs Nicole Mann. She and her two crewmates were present for Thursdays capsule move. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Spacewalking astronauts slice into cosmic ray detector,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts ventured out Friday for the second week in a row to repair a cosmic ray detector, this time actually cutting into the $2 billion instrument. The International Space Stations Luca Parmitano sliced through eight stainless steel tubes, using hardware store-type bolt cutters. That set the stage to install new coolant pumps during the third spacewalk on Dec. 2. Parmitano had to sever the tubes in a specific order and notified Mission Control each time before cutting. His spacewalking partner, Andrew Morgan, backstopped everything. NASA likened the repair work to heart bypass surgery. At least four spacewalks are needed to fix the spectrometer, on the hunt for elusive dark matter and antimatter for 8  years. Without a new cooling system, the experiment  led by a Nobel laureate  would end. NASA considers these the most complicated spacewalks since the Hubble Space Telescope repair missions a few decades ago. The spectrometer was not designed to be operated on in orbit. A zip tie got away from Parmitano  floating harmlessly into space  as he struggled to free power cables buried in the spectrometer. Mission Control told him not to worry about it. It was the only snag in the 6 1/2-hour spacewalk. To all of you up there, thanks again for another incredible spacewalk, Mission Control radioed. Parmitano, an Italian, and Morgan, an American, began the repair work last week. They spent years training for the operation before launching in July. 
        
     The 7 -ton (6,800-kilogram) spectrometer rode to the space station during shuttle Endeavours final mission in 2011. If successful, the repairs will keep the device working throughout the life of the station, or another five to 10 years. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Intense monitoring and care lift mountain gorilla numbers,"KINIGI, Rwanda (AP)  Deep in the rainforest of Volcanoes National Park, a 23-year-old female gorilla named Kurudi feeds on a stand of wild celery. She bends the green stalks and, with long careful fingers, peels off the exterior skin to expose the succulent inside. Biologist Jean Paul Hirwa notes her meal on his tablet computer as he peers out from behind a nearby stand of stinging nettles. The large adult male sitting next to her, known as a silverback, looks at him quizzically. Hirwa makes a low hum  ahh-mmm  imitating the gorillas usual sound of reassurance. Im here, Hirwa is trying to say. Its OK. No reason to worry. Hirwa and the two great apes are all part of the worlds longest-running gorilla study  a project begun in 1967 by famed American primatologist Dian Fossey. Yet Fossey herself, who died in 1985, would likely be surprised any mountain gorillas are left to study. Alarmed by rising rates of poaching and deforestation in central Africa, she predicted the species could go extinct by 2000. Instead, a concerted and sustained conservation campaign has averted the worst and given a second chance to these great apes, which share about 98% of human DNA. Last fall, the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature changed the status of mountain gorillas from critically endangered to endangered, an improved if still-fragile designation, reflecting new survey data. 
        
     It wouldnt have happened without an intervention some biologists call extreme conservation, which has entailed monitoring every single gorilla in the rainforest, periodically giving them veterinary care  to clean infected wounds, for instance  and funding forest protection by sending money into communities that might otherwise resent not being able to convert the woods into cropland. The gorillas are still here. We celebrate that as a victory, Hirwa says. Instead of disappearing, the number of mountain gorillas  a subspecies of eastern gorillas  has risen from 680 a decade ago to just over 1,000 today. Their population is split between two regions, including mist-covered defunct volcanoes within Congo, Uganda and Rwanda  one of Africas smallest and most densely populated countries. The population of mountain gorillas is still vulnerable, says George Schaller, a renowned biologist and gorilla expert. But their numbers are now growing, and thats remarkable. Once depicted in legends and films like King Kong as fearsome beasts, gorillas are actually languid primates that eat only plants and insects, and live in fairly stable, extended family groups. Their strength and chest-thumping displays are generally reserved for contests between male rivals. Hirwa works for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a conservation nonprofit group. The organization is a successor to the Digit Fund, which Fossey created in 1978 after poachers killed one of her favorite gorillas, Digit. Today the organization supports research, education and training for future conservationists in Africa. Every week, Hirwa and other scientists gather data as part of long-term behavioral research. As Hirwa recently observed a gorilla family, he gingerly pulled back a stalk of stinging nettles for a better view. He watched as the silverback, a 19-year-old named Pato, walked on all fours toward a squirming infant gorilla, Macibiri. Pato sat beside her and ran his long fingers through her fur, grooming her, looking for insects or other things caught in her glossy black coat. He made a low hum. Not every silverback will do that, will pay attention to the infants, Hirwa says. That shows his personality. Pato is one chill silverback. Hirwa noticed a fresh wound on Patos chest, a small red slash. Most likely, he surmised, Pato had been jousting with the familys second silverback for control of the group. Later, Hirwa informed the chief park warden and the staff at Gorillas Doctors, a nongovernmental group whose veterinarians work in the forest. The vets monitor wounds and signs of respiratory infections, but they intervene only sparingly. When they do  for example, by darting a gorilla with antibiotics  they almost never remove the animals from the mountain, since reuniting gorillas can be difficult. A long absence can change the delicate social dynamic. Our hospital is the forest, says Jean Bosco Noheli, a veterinarian at Gorilla Doctors. When his team goes into the field to address a gorilla emergency, they must carry everything they might need in equipment bags weighing up to 100 pounds  including portable X-ray machines. Schaller, the biologist, conducted the first detailed studies of mountain gorillas in the 1950s and early 60s, in what was then the Belgian Congo. He also was the first to discover that wild gorillas could, over time, become comfortable with periodic human presence, a boon to researchers and, later, tourists. Today, highly regulated tour groups hike in the Rwandan rainforest to watch gorillas. Within Volcanoes National Park, tour groups are limited to eight people at a time, with only an hour spent observing gorillas. You cant carry food or even water bottles near the animals, lest a curious silverback snatch them and perhaps be exposed to your germs. Dont hold eye contact for too long. And if a gorilla acts aggressive  which is rare  look down, bend your knee and show you acknowledge its authority. Hirwa calls this submissive pose. The number of tourists per day is limited, and the price is steep: $1,500 per visit. Ticket revenue pays for operating costs and outstrips what might have been made from converting the rainforest to potato farms and cattle pastures. About 40% of the forest already was cleared for agriculture in the early 1970s. With tourism, the tension is always not to overexploit, says Dirck Byler, great ape conservation director at the nonprofit Global Wildlife Conservation, which is not involved in the Rwanda gorilla project. But in Rwanda, so far theyre careful, and its working. The idea of using tourism to help fund conservation was contentious when conservationists Bill Weber and Amy Vedder first proposed it while living in Rwanda during the 1970s and 80s. Fossey herself was skeptical, but the pair persisted. The wonder of the gorillas lives, their curiosity, their social interactions  we felt thats something that could be accessible to others, through careful tourism, Vedder says. Figuring out the balance of how many people could visit the forest, and for how long, was a delicate process of trial and error, Weber says. The pair, who are married and currently professors at Yale University, had another idea, equally radical when it was first proposed  some of the money raised must benefit local communities. Back then, the field of conservation was dominated by the fortress model': You draw a line, build a wall, hire guards and keep local people out, Weber says. But it wasnt really working to stop poaching. There needs to be a real incentive for local people to care about conservation. In 2005, the government adopted a model to steer 5% of tourism revenue from Volcanoes National Park to build infrastructure in surrounding villages, including schools and health clinics. Two years ago, the share was raised to 10%. To date, about $2 million has gone into funding village projects, chief park warden Prosper Uwingeli says. Every year, we meet with the communities, he says. We have to give back. Before taking on the job of running what amounts to one of Rwandas most high-profile enterprises, Uwingeli studied gorilla behavior as a research assistant at the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Sometimes he misses the quiet, patient work of a scientist. But his time in the field also helped shape his mission. We dont want to protect the park with guns. We want to protect and conserve this park with people who understand why, and who take responsibility, he says. One recent morning at dawn, Emmanuel Bizagwira, one of the parks 100 full-time gorilla trackers, spotted something moving in the trees ahead. Can you see over there? he says, pointing with his radio antenna. The gorillas are eating there. I saw them. Did you see the trees? Theyre there. Pushing through waist-high shrubs alongside fellow tracker Safari Gabriel, he kept his eyes on the trees where hed seen movement. Each morning, his job is to locate the whereabouts of a particular 24-member gorilla family, called Agashya group, then alert the park warden. These gorilla trackers are the backbone of the entire conservation project. Their work enables the scientists, tour guides and veterinarians to find gorillas quickly and do their jobs. Bizagwiras grandfather also hiked in the same forest. He was a poacher who laid traps for bushmeat, mostly intended for antelopes but sometimes also ensnaring gorillas. Bizagwira, 31, says he is grateful to have steady work to protect the gorillas. I love my job, I love wild animals, he says. He can identify several dozen plants that gorillas eat, and looks for torn or crushed stems to determine where gorilla troops may have recently passed. Sometimes, he glimpses elephants and golden monkeys in the same forest. At Nyabitsinde Primary School, nearly every pupil has at least one relative working in nearby Volcanoes National Park. Leontine Muhawenimana, who is 11, says her father also is a tracker, and she likes to hear his stories about gorillas. The school has new classrooms with blackboards and wooden benches, and a colorful mural outside the bathroom reads Washing hands prevents diseases. But the school is still short on some basic supplies, like pencils. The money that built this school comes from tourism, says Fabien Uwimana, a French and English teacher. More children today can go to school. The money from tourism helps, but the region is still poor. Jean Claude Masengesho lives with his parents and helps them farm potatoes. About once a week, the 21-year-old earns a little extra money helping tourists carry their bags up the mountain, totaling about $45 a month. He would like to someday become a tour guide, which would earn him about $320 monthly. The obstacle is that most tour guides have attended college, and Masengesho isnt sure how his family can afford tuition. Its my dream, but its very hard, he says. In this village, every young persons dream is to work in the park. In the meantime, he draws portraits of gorillas with green and black crayons. Mostly, he draws silverbacks. He is fascinated by gorillas, but also pragmatic. People come from all over the world to see the gorillas, he says. Gorillas bring us money from all over the world, and we need to protect them. Sixty years after he first moved to central Africa to study gorillas as a wide-eyed 26-year-old with a notebook, the veteran biologist Schaller says conservation may need both a moral and an economic argument. Schaller believes that people have no right to exterminate a species, but also that you have to find some economic benefit for the people that border the park. You have to involve them somehow, he says, make them feel its their park, too. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

American families of missing Uighurs speak out at DC event,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Nearly two years after the Chinese government began to detain members of Muslim minority groups in western China, a growing number of family members abroad are refusing to remain silent. On Sunday, about three dozen relatives of some of the 1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs and others being held without charge spoke out about the mass detentions at an event in Washington, D.C., hoping to raise awareness of what many are calling a human rights travesty but which Beijing defends as necessary to counter violent religious extremism. If you know someone who is missing, it is time to speak up, said Ferkat Jawdat, a Virginia-based software engineer. Hes lost contact with his 52-year-old mother in Xinjiang, a Chinese region home to the predominantly Muslim Uighur (pronounced WEE-gur) and Kazakh ethnic minorities. Xinjiang has been subject to a severe security crackdown in recent years that has made surveillance cameras and police checkpoints ubiquitous. The internment camps are a relatively recent phenomenon, but have expanded rapidly as a primary means of intimidation and social control. For members of the Uighur diaspora, losing a family member into the sprawling system has become all too common. Jawdat co-organized Sundays gathering so that Uighurs in the U.S. could start collecting information on their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and even children whose whereabouts are unknown. They plan to present the data to the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the U.S. State Department. 
        
     Some of the attendees have confirmation that their loved ones are detained in Xinjiang. Others have simply lost contact  and fear the worst. We want to raise awareness about what can happen to American families  many of these people here are American citizens, said Jawdat, a U.S. citizen who helped organize the event, held in the basement of a public library. Similar gatherings took place concurrently in eight other countries, including Turkey, France, Germany, Australia and Canada, he said. Those in China with relatives abroad come under particular suspicion from the Chinese security forces, increasing the likelihood of them being interned. Abduwaris Ablimit, a 34-year-old chef living in Boston, said his first impulse had not been to speak out, frightened of what the Chinese authorities might do in retaliation. The last time he heard his parents voices was on a recorded message through the Chinese messaging app WeChat. Please dont call me again, son, his mother said through sobs, Ablimit recalled. Maybe one day we will see each other again. She sent the message in July 2017. Since then, Ablimit has lived in fear that his parents and brother, well-known Uighur pop singer Zahirshah Ablimit, were sent to an internment camp. His suspicions were confirmed in December, when Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported that a police officer in Ablimits Xinjiang hometown said he had been involved in detaining Ablimits parents. A second officer told RFA that he had arrested Ablimits brother. Former camp detainees have told The Associated Press that after being confined in the camps, they were forced to renounce their faith and swear fealty to Chinas ruling Communist Party. They said they were subject to political indoctrination and psychological torture, without legal recourse. They describe conditions in the camps as grim, with poor food, crowded cells and little medical assistance. China says the camps are vocational training centers aimed at helping those vulnerable to extremism to be cured of such thoughts and gain job skills. Apart from Turkey, whose people share cultural, religious and linguistic ties with Uighurs, the Muslim world has remained largely silent over the camps. Experts attribute that to their economic dependence on China, similarly authoritarian political systems and Beijings claims that it is countering a shared terror threat. In the face of such silence, relatives of internees are taking it upon themselves to speak out. After more than a year of being unable to reach his parents, Ablimit started talking to the media and reaching out to the U.S. consulates in Beijing and Shanghai. According to text messages reviewed by the AP, Ablimit received threatening messages from someone who claimed to be a Chinese police officer. The person urged Ablimit to stay quiet about his familys case. But Ablimit, who traveled to Washington for Sundays meeting, wasnt swayed. Im not afraid anymore, he said. I just need to find the truth.",https://apnews.com/general-news-a45a11071461457cabb16bb557430793,science
AP Analysis: Hot records falling twice as often as cold ones,"Over the past 20 years, Americans have been twice as likely to sweat through record-breaking heat rather than shiver through record-setting cold, a new Associated Press data analysis shows. The AP looked at 424 weather stations throughout the Lower 48 states that had consistent temperature records since 1920 and counted how many times daily hot temperature records were tied or broken and how many daily cold records were set. In a stable climate, the numbers should be roughly equal. Since 1999, the ratio has been two warm records set or broken for every cold one. In 16 of the last 20 years, there have been more daily high temperature records than low. The AP shared the data analysis with several climate and data scientists, who all said the conclusion was correct, consistent with scientific peer-reviewed literature and showed a clear sign of human-caused climate change. They pointed out that trends over decades are more robust than over single years. The analysis stopped with data through 2018. However, the first two months of 2019 are showing twice as many cold records than hot ones. Thats temporary and trends are over years and decades, not months, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt. We are in a period of sustained and significant warming and  over the long run  will continue to explore and break the warm end of the spectrum much more than the cold end, Arndt said. 
        
     Former Weather Channel meteorologist Guy Walton, who has been studying hot and cold extreme records since 2000, said the trend is unmistakable. You are getting more extremes, Walton said. Your chances for getting more dangerous extremes are going up with time. No place has that been more noticeable than the southern California city of Pasadena, where 7,203 days went by between cold records being broken. On Feb. 23, Pasadena set a low temperature record, its first since June 5, 1999. Vermont native Paul Wennberg felt it. He moved to Pasadena in 1998 just before the dearth of cold records. Even with the local cold we had this past month, its very noticeable, said Wennberg, a California Institute of Technology atmospheric sciences professor. Its just been ever warmer. In between the two cold record days, Pasadena set 145 hot records. That includes an all-time high of 113 degrees last year. Last year was unbelievable here, Wennberg said. The tops of a lot of the hedges, they essentially melted. Scientists often talked about human-caused global warming in terms of average temperatures, but thats not what costs money or sends people to the hospital. A study this month found that in just 22 states, about 36,000 people on average go to the hospital because of excessive summertime heat. The extremes affect our lives, Arndt said, adding that they are expensive, with hospital stays, rising energy bills and crop losses. National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Gerald Meehl, who has published peer-reviewed papers on the rising hot-to-cold ratio, said people pay more attention to climate when records are broken. The AP counted daily records across 424 stations starting in 1920 and ending in 2018. The AP only considered daily  not all-time  high maximum temperatures and low minimum temperatures and only used stations with minimal missing data. Temperatures that tied previous records were counted in addition to temperatures that broke previous records. More typical than Pasadena is Wooster, Ohio. From 1999 on, Wooster saw 106 high temperature records set or broken and 51 cold ones. In the previous eight decades, the ratio was slightly colder than one to one. At MW Robinson Co., people are lining up for air conditioning installation as the climate seems to get have been getting hotter over the years, said Lori Bowersock, who coordinates the firms HVAC installations. Its more and more every year, Bowersock said. Usually we dont have them lined up like this. The APs other findings:  Since Jan. 1, 1999, just under half the stations had at least twice as many hot records set than cold ones, including Wooster.  In all, 87 percent of the weather stations had more hot records than cold since 1999. There have been 42 weather stations that have at least five hot records for every cold one since 1999, with 11 where the hot-to-cold ratio is 10-to-1 or higher, including Pasadena.  All nine of NOAAs climate regions have seen more hot records set than cold ones since 1999, with the West, Southwest and Northeast having a 3-to-1 ratio.  All four seasons have had more hot records broken than cold for the same time period.  Most decades in the 20th century had close to an even ratio of hot to cold. The 1930s, driven by Dust Bowl summers, had about 1.4 hot records for every cold. The 1960s and 1970s had about 1.5 cold records for every hot. The 21st century has a 1.9-to-1 hot-to-cold ratio. As a measure of climate change, the dailies (temperature records) will tell you more about whats happening, said climate scientist Chris Field of Stanford. The impacts of climate change almost always come packaged in extremes. ___ Borenstein, an AP science writer, reported from Washington. Forster, an AP data journalist, reported from New York.

NASA nixes 1st all-female spacewalk due to suit-sizing issue,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA has nixed the first all-female spacewalk over a spacesuit sizing issue. Astronaut Anne McClain was supposed to float out of the International Space Station this Friday with newly arrived Christina Koch, to replace old batteries. But McClain pulled herself from the lineup because theres not enough time to get two medium suits ready for them. Koch will go out with a male crewmate, Nick Hague. NASA spokeswoman Brandi Dean said Tuesday that McClain trained before flight in both medium and large spacesuits. She wore a medium when she went out on her first spacewalk last Friday and was supposed to switch to a large this week. But after last weeks spacewalk, she decided that a large would be too big. It would have taken 12 hours to get another medium spacesuit ready and potentially compromised safety, according to Dean. These spacewalks are months late, and with cargo deliveries coming up, NASA wants to keep everything on track. In 54 years of spacewalking, women have only gone outside with men. Thats because men have always outnumbered women in space. As women continue to make up a greater percentage of the astronaut corps, more gender records will be set and not just in spacewalking, Dean noted. McClain, Koch and Hague are part of NASAs Astronaut Class of 2013, the only time there have been the same number of women accepted as men. NASA chose four women and four men that year. 
        
     Koch and Hague will continue the battery-swapping work that McClain and Hague began last Friday outside the space station. Old nickel-hydrogen batteries in the solar power grid are being replaced with new, powerful lithium-ion batteries. McClain will get another shot at spacewalking April 8 when she ventures outside with Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques. There are six U.S. spacesuit tops on the station  or hard upper torsos, as NASA calls them  with two considered spares. Both Hague and Saint-Jacques take large. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Pence calls for landing US astronauts on moon in 5 years,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday called for landing astronauts on the moon within five years, an accelerated pace that would aim to put Americans on the lunar south pole. Pence said NASA needs to achieve that goal by any means necessary. Speaking at a meeting of the National Space Council in Huntsville, Alabama, he said NASA rockets and lunar landers will be replaced by private craft, if required. Its time to redouble our effort, he said. It can happen, but it will not happen unless we increase the pace. Now, the earliest possible landing on the moon by NASA isnt until 2028, Pence said. He acknowledged talent  and money  will be necessary to pull it off earlier. Pence warned that if NASA cant put astronauts on the moon by 2024, we need to change the organization, not the mission. The space agency must transform into a leaner, more accountable and more agile organization, and must adopt an all-hands-on-deck approach, he said. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine assured Pence that NASA will do everything possible to meet the deadline. Some outside experts were skeptical of the new timeline. I will be astonished if this happens, said Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, noting that a lunar lander still needs to be designed, built and tested. That is a hard challenge on a five year time scale even without political budget infighting, he wrote in an email. 
        
     This summer marks the 50th anniversary of the first manned moon landing. Since Apollo astronauts last walked on the moon in 1972, no country has made a serious attempt to send humans back to the lunar surface. For decades, NASA has flip-flopped between the moon and Mars, a victim of changing presidential administrations. More recently, President Barack Obama targeted Mars as astronauts next big destination, while President Donald Trump has favored the moon. In order to get astronauts on the moon by 2024, Bridenstine said the space agencys new megarocket will be needed, but its development and pace will need to be faster. Two weeks ago, he said NASA was considering using private rockets instead to launch its new Orion capsule around the moon without a crew on a test flight next year. But on Tuesday, he expressed confidence that the SLS, or Space Launch System, would be ready for the job. He also stressed the need for an outpost with astronauts near the moon to serve as a stepping-off point for lunar landings. Pence leads the National Space Council. The advisory group held its fifth meeting at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, right next door to NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center, where the Saturn V moon rockets were developed decades ago and where the Boeing-built SLS is now managed. This longtime rocket know-how is why Huntsville is nicknamed Rocket City. It took just eight years for NASA to accomplish everything to put astronauts on the moon in July 1969. It was unacceptable, Pence said, that SLS delays and cost overruns point to a 2028 target date  nearly two decades after the SLS program began. The vice president instructed NASA to aim to land on the moons south pole, where considerable amounts of ice could be used for drinking and making rocket fuel. The exploration of the heavens in this still new century will go forward with or without the United States. But Americans dont do second place. Americans lead, and so we will, Pence said to cheers and applause. Planetary scientist Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute said 2024 is feasible provided the accelerated effort is funded properly and commercial space systems are fully embraced. The moon is a truly outstanding target, both for science and for getting our exploration legs back before we set out to further destinations like Mars, Stern wrote in an email. But former NASA official Scott Hubbard said five years seems awfully short to me, given the lack of national security incentives like those that existed during Apollo and the Cold War race to beat the Soviets to the moon. Hubbard pointed out that both Bush administrations proposed similar far-reaching exploration efforts. Those didnt go anywhere and collapsed of their own significant financial weight, he noted in an email. The University of Colorado at Boulders Bobby Braun said hed like to review the budget and details for implementation as those details matter. He previously served as NASAs chief technologist. The United States aerospace community is certainly capable of achieving this goal if provided with stability of purpose and the resources to do so, Braun wrote in an email. ___ Science writer Seth Borenstein contributed from Washington. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Wine cellar in space: 12 bottles arrive for year of aging,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A dozen bottles of fine French wine arrived at the space station Monday, not for the astronauts, but for science. The red Bordeaux wine will age for a year up there before returning to Earth. Researchers will study how weightlessness and space radiation affect the aging process. The goal is to develop new flavors and properties for the food industry. The bottles flew up aboard a Northrop Grumman capsule that launched from Virginia on Saturday and arrived at the International Space Station on Monday. Each bottle was packed in a metal canister to prevent breakage. Universities in Bordeaux, France, and Bavaria, Germany, are taking part in the experiment from Space Cargo Unlimited, a Luxembourg startup. Winemaking uses both yeast and bacteria, and involves chemical processes, making wine ideal for space study, said University of Erlangen-Nurembergs Michael Lebert, the experiments scientific director, in a company video. The space-aged wine will be compared to Bordeaux wine aged on Earth. Whats left will go to those who helped pay for the research, according to a company spokeswoman. This is the first of six space missions planned by the company over the next three years touching on the future of agriculture given our changing world. This is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, Nicolas Gaume, chief executive and co-founder of Space Cargo Unlimited, said in a statement. 
        
     NASA is opening the space station to more business opportunities like this and, eventually, even private astronaut missions. The Cygnus capsule that pulled up to the space station on Monday contains multiple commercial ventures. Also on board: an oven for baking chocolate chip cookies, as well as samples of carbon fiber used by Italys Lamborghini in its sports cars. Budweiser has already sent barley seeds to the station, with an eye to becoming the beverage of choice on Mars. In 2015, a Japanese company known for its whiskey and other alcoholic drinks sent up samples. Scotch also made a visit to space in another experiment. As for high-flying wine cellars, this isnt the first. A French astronaut took along a bottle of wine aboard shuttle Discovery in 1985. The bottle remained corked in orbit. The space stations current crew includes three Americans, two Russians and an Italian, who might have preferred a good Chianti on board. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

More delays for Boeings new space capsule for astronauts,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeings new space capsule for astronauts faces more launch delays. The Starliner capsule was supposed to make its debut this month, after a series of postponements. But the first test flight is now off until August. And the second test flight, with astronauts, wont occur until late in the year. NASA announced the revised lineup Wednesday. At the same time, officials said the first Starliner crew will remain at the International Space Station longer than the few weeks originally anticipated. The mission length will be decided later. SpaceX, NASAs other commercial crew provider, successfully flew its new Dragon capsule without a crew to the International Space Station last month. The first flight with astronauts could be as early as this summer, but the schedule is under review. Boeing said the last major milestones have been cleared and the capsule is almost finished. But scheduling conflicts with an early summer Air Force launch helped push the Starliners debut into August. The Starliner will fly on United Launch Alliances Atlas V rocket, the same kind of rocket needed for the Air Forces critical mission in late June, from the same pad. While the first SpaceX astronauts will visit the space station for a few weeks at most, the Starliners three-person crew will move into the orbiting complex for an extended period. The typical station stay is about six months. 
        
     NASA wants to reduce its reliance on expensive Russian Soyuz capsules as soon as possible, and so the Boeing test flight will double as a taxi mission for station residents. NASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets since the end of the space shuttle program. SpaceX Dragons and Boeing Starliners will return human launches to Florida, following the eight-year hiatus. NASA contracted with the two companies to handle space station ferry flights, so it could focus on getting astronauts to the moon and, eventually, Mars. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Spacewalking astronauts tackle battery, cable work","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts completed battery and cable work outside the International Space Station on Monday despite communication trouble that sometimes made it hard for them to hear. During the spacewalk, Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques reported that U.S. astronaut Anne McClains voice was faint at times. The problem worsened as their 6 -hour excursion drew to a close. We know that its a lot of hard work and a lot of big sighs of relief as soon as this hatch gets closed, McClain said once the pair were inside the air lock. Within moments, the spacewalkers could barely hear their colleagues over the radio loop. They had to shout and repeat words at times, as did the astronauts on the other side of the hatch. McClain, meanwhile, reported having a thin layer of moisture inside her helmet. The change to her visor was noticeable in the last 15 minutes of the spacewalk, she noted. NASA is wary about moisture inside helmets ever since an Italian astronaut almost drowned during a spacewalk nearly six years ago because of a water leak in his suit. McClain insisted she wasnt wet, and that the moisture was minimal. A crewmate later noted perspiration. Earlier, McClain and Saint-Jacques hustled through their part in battery swap-outs that began last month. It was the third spacewalk in just 2  weeks for the space station crew. 
        
     The cable routing took more time, providing a backup power circuit for the stations Canadian-made robot arm and expanding wireless communications. At one point, the spacewalkers had to use a pry bar to loosen a stuck fastener and get behind a protective panel. The ongoing battery work involved re-installing two old batteries. One of six new lithium-ion batteries did not work, so McClain had to remove an adapter plate she put in. Last week, flight controllers used the space stations robot arm to remove the failed battery along with an associated charging device. Working remotely, the controllers also installed a spare charging device and one of the old batteries made of nickel hydrogen. The second outdated battery will go in  robotically  later this week. NASA said it will send up another new battery, although its uncertain when. Until then, this combination of old and new batteries is expected to work fine, according to managers. Because of trouble with a trunnion pin, Saint-Jacques could not complete prep work for a future payload platform. McClain has now logged two spacewalks and Saint-Jacques one. Their six-month mission began in December. The next spacewalk will be next month by the two Russians on board. Two other Americans round out the six-person crew. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Former astronaut Owen Garriott dies, flew on Skylab station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Former astronaut Owen Garriott, who flew on Americas first space station, Skylab, and whose son followed him into orbit, has died at age 88. He died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to NASA. Dad had a great 88 orbits around the sun! tweeted son Richard, a computer game developer who paid the Russians $30 million for a ride to the International Space Station in 2008. Owen Garriott served on the second Skylab crew in 1973, spending close to 60 days in space, a record at the time. He also was part of the ninth space shuttle mission, flying aboard Columbia in 1983 and operating a ham radio for the first time from orbit. While he never flew in space again, Garriott traveled to Kazakhstan in 2008 for his sons launch aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. They were the first U.S. father and son space travelers. The first second-generation astronaut, a Russian, launched just months before Richard Garriott and accompanied him back to Earth. While he was normally very Spock like ... our adult bonding around the experience of space was a rare treasure we shared, Richard Garriott said Tuesday via Twitter. In 50 years, from my fathers Apollo era to our new commercial era, much has been accomplished, he tweeted. Yet, none without the risks undertaken by those early pioneers! Owen Garriott was born in Enid, Oklahoma and served with the Navy. He was selected as an astronaut in 1965. As an associate professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, he was one of the first six scientist-astronauts picked by NASA. 
        
     Garriott later held other positions within NASA, including director of science and applications at Johnson Space Center in Houston. He left NASA in 1986. Condolences streamed in from fellow astronauts. Saddened to learn the passing of former Astronaut Owen Garriott who pioneered long-duration spaceflight aboard #Skylab, tweeted Scott Kelly, who spent a U.S.-record one year aboard the International Space Station. Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin described Garriott as a good friend and an incredible astronaut.

"US astronaut to spend 11 months in space, set female record","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA astronaut will spend nearly a year at the International Space Station, setting a record for women. Station astronaut Christina Koch will remain on board for about 11 months, until February  approaching but not quite breaking Scott Kellys 340-day U.S. record. One month down. Ten to go, she tweeted Wednesday. She said it feels awesome having so much extra time in space and a true honor and a dream come true. Koch knew before launching last month that her flight might stretch into 2020 and sought advice from Kelly as well as retired astronaut Peggy Whitson, the current record-holder for female space fliers. Koch will break Whitsons 288-day record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman at the end of December. I hope that me being up here and giving my best every day is a way for me to say thank you to people like her, Koch said in a NASA interview broadcast Wednesday. Koch said before launching, she and her husband listened to an audio recording of Kellys 2017 autobiography, Endurance. She said there was a lot of helpful advice. An electrical engineer whos worked in Antarctica, Koch will undergo medical tests during her stay. More subjects and more diversity are needed, she noted, to better understand the effects of long-term spaceflight as NASA aims to return astronauts to the moon within five years. Its almost turning into not that big of a deal to have somebody on board station for 10, 11 months because weve done it before, were good at it and were going to keep doing it, she said. 
        
     Koch was supposed to become part of the first all-female spacewalking team, but instead ventured out a few weeks ago with a male crewmate. Only one usable medium spacesuit was available, and the two women on board both needed mediums. Another NASA astronaut also will have an extended stay. Dr. Andrew Morgan will launch to the space station this summer for a nine-month mission  also considerably longer than the usual six months. The physician and Army officer will lift off from Kazakhstan with an Italian and a Russian on July 20, the 50th anniversary of the first manned moon landing. Both Koch and Morgan are part of NASAs Astronaut Class of 2013, the first to have a 50-50 split between women and men. NASA announced the extended assignments this week. The primary reason for the schedule shuffling is to free up a seat on a pair of Russian Soyuz spacecraft for the United Arab Emirates first astronaut, Hazza al-Mansoori. He will spend just over a week in orbit this fall. Russia still holds the worlds space endurance record. A Russian cosmonaut-physician spent nearly 15 months on a single mission aboard the former Mir space station in the mid-1990s. Kelly returned to Earth in 2016 and Whitson in 2017. Both are now retired from NASA. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Americas 1st female astronaut candidate, Jerrie Cobb, dies","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Americas first female astronaut candidate, pilot Jerrie Cobb, who pushed for equality in space but never reached its heights, has died. Cobb died in Florida at age 88 on March 18 following a brief illness. News of her death came Thursday from journalist Miles OBrien, serving as a family spokesman. In 1961, Cobb became the first woman to pass astronaut testing. Altogether, 13 women passed the arduous physical testing and became known as the Mercury 13. But NASA already had its Mercury 7 astronauts, all jet test pilots and all military men. None of the Mercury 13 ever reached space, despite Cobbs testimony in 1962 before a Congressional panel. We seek, only, a place in our nations space future without discrimination, she told a special House subcommittee on the selection of astronauts. Instead of making her an astronaut, NASA tapped her as a consultant to talk up the space program. She was dismissed one week after commenting: Im the most unconsulted consultant in any government agency. She wrote in her 1997 autobiography Jerrie Cobb, Solo Pilot, 'My country, my culture, was not ready to allow a woman to fly in space. Cobb served for decades as a humanitarian aid pilot in the Amazon jungle. She should have gone to space, but turned her life into one of service with grace, tweeted Ellen Stofan, director of the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum and a former NASA scientist. 
        
     The Soviet Union ended up putting the first woman into space in 1963: Valentina Tereshkova. NASA didnt fly a woman in space  Sally Ride  until 1983. Cobb and other surviving members of the Mercury 13 attended the 1995 shuttle launch of Eileen Collins, NASAs first female space pilot and later its first female space commander. Jerrie Cobb served as an inspiration to many of our members in her record breaking, her desire to go into space, and just to prove that women could do what men could do, said Laura Ohrenberg, headquarters manager in Oklahoma City for the Ninety-Nines Inc., an international organization of licensed women pilots. Still hopeful, Cobb emerged in 1998 to make another pitch for space as NASA prepared to launch Mercury astronaut John Glenn  the first American to orbit the world  on shuttle Discovery at age 77. Cobb maintained that the geriatric space study should also include an older woman. I would give my life to fly in space, I really would, Cobb told The Associated Press at age 67 in 1998. Its hard for me to talk about it, but I would. I would then, and I will now. It just didnt work out then, and I just hope and pray it will now, she added. It didnt. NASA never flew another elderly person in space, male or female. Geraldyn Cobb was born on March 5, 1931, in Norman, Oklahoma, the second daughter of a military pilot and his wife. She flew her fathers open cockpit Waco biplane at age 12 and got her private pilots license four years later. The Mercury 13s story is told in a recent Netflix documentary and a play based on Cobbs life, They Promised Her the Moon, is currently running in San Diego. In her autobiography, Cobb described how she danced on the wings of her plane in the Amazon moonlight, when learning via radio on July 20, 1969, that Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had landed on the moon. She wrote: Yes, I wish I were on the moon with my fellow pilots, exploring another celestial body. How I would love to see our beautiful blue planet Earth floating in the blackness of space. And see the stars and galaxies in their true brilliance, without the filter of our atmosphere. But Im happy flying here in Amazonas, serving my brethren. Contenta, Senor, contenta.

SpaceX suffers serious setback with crew capsule accident,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX has suffered a serious setback in its effort to launch NASA astronauts into orbit this year. Over the weekend, the Dragon crew capsule that flew to the International Space Station last month was engulfed in smoke and flames on an engine test stand. SpaceX says it was testing the Dragons abort thrusters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, when Saturdays accident occurred. The company says the test area was clear and no one was injured. This Dragon was supposed to be used in a launch abort test in June, with another capsule making the first flight with a crew as early as July. NASA said Monday its too early to revise the target launch dates.

Mars lander picks up whats likely 1st detected marsquake,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs InSight lander has picked up a gentle rumble at Mars, believed to be the first marsquake ever detected. InSights quake monitor recorded and measured the faint signal April 6, and scientists announced the finding Tuesday. While the rumble sounds like soft wind, scientists believe it came from within the red planet. The Paris Institute of Earth Physics Philippe Lognonne, whos in charge of the experiment, said its exciting to finally have proof that Mars is still seismically active. Mars is not nearly as geologically active as Earth and, like our moon, lacks tectonic plates. Weve been waiting months for a signal like this, Lognonne said in a statement. InSights lead scientist, Bruce Banerdt of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said this carries out the scientific work begun by the Apollo moonwalkers nearly a half-century ago. The astronauts left behind seismometers that measured thousands of moonquakes. As for Mars, weve been collecting background noise up until now, but this first event officially kicks off a new field: Martian seismology! 'Banerdt said in a statement. Researchers are still analyzing the data, as well as three other even fainter seismic signals detected since mid-March. By analyzing marsquakes, scientists hope to learn more about how rocky planets formed. The French seismometer was placed directly on the Martian surface in December, a few weeks after the spacecraft landed. 
        
     InSights other main experiment isnt going as well. The German-built drilling instrument  dubbed the mole  has managed to penetrate only a foot or two (50 centimeters) into Mars, far short of its goal to measure the planets internal temperature. Engineers are still trying to figure out why and how the device got stuck. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX delays launch to freshly repaired space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX delayed a supply run Friday to the International Space Station, back to full power and accepting deliveries after quick repairs. A Falcon rocket was poised to blast off before dawn Friday, with a Dragon cargo capsule. But an electrical problem cropped up at the last minute with the ocean platform needed to recover the first-stage booster following liftoff. SpaceX said it will try again early Saturday morning. The delivery is already running a few days late because of a space station power shortage that stalled deliveries until a failed electrical box could be replaced. NASA completed the job Thursday. The landing platform was stationed 14 miles (22 kilometers) offshore. The new booster was originally supposed to return to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for eventual recycling, but SpaceX is still cleaning up from the April 20 accident that destroyed a crew Dragon capsule. The empty capsule was undergoing ground testing when the blast occurred. The cause is not yet known. SpaceX said before Saturdays launch attempt, it will patch a helium leak at the launch pad that also occurred late in the countdown. With only a split second to launch the rocket, there was not enough time to solve any issues. If the Dragon capsule isnt flying by Saturday, SpaceX will have to wait a week before its next try because of other Air Force operations.",https://apnews.com/general-news-cecb0a79b1dd4df790a10c041e3a8d0f,science
SpaceX launches supplies to space station after power delays,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched a load of supplies to the International Space Station on Saturday following a pair of unusual power delays. A Falcon rocket raced into the pre-dawn darkness, carrying a Dragon capsule with 5,500 pounds (2,500 kilograms) of goods. This recycled Dragon  which is making its second space trip  is due to arrive at the orbiting lab Monday. The booster, meanwhile, streaked to a smooth landing on a recovery ship just offshore. SpaceX couldnt resist the Star Wars Day connection  Saturday is May 4. Dragon is now officially on the way to the space station, the SpaceX launch commentator announced once the capsule reached orbit and its solar wings unfurled. Until next time, May the Fourth be with you. The delivery is a few days late because of electrical power shortages that cropped up first at the space station, then at SpaceXs rocket-landing platform in the Atlantic. Both problems were quickly resolved with equipment replacements: a power-switching unit in orbit and a generator at sea. Minutes after liftoff, SpaceX landed its brand new, first-stage booster on the ocean platform roughly 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the coast, considerably closer than usual with the sonic booms easily heard at the launch site. That looked really, really cool in the night sky, said Hans Koenigsmann, a SpaceX vice president who left his launch control seat to run outside and watch. 
        
     The booster likely will be reused for SpaceXs next station supply run. Thats why the company and NASA halted Fridays countdown at the last minute  so the recovery ship could be repaired and have full power for the landing operation. It was the first time a launch like this was nixed by rocket-landing concerns. The booster should have returned to Cape Canaveral, but SpaceX is still cleaning up from the April 20 accident that destroyed an empty crew Dragon capsule. Koenigsmann said earlier this week the company still does not know what caused the empty capsule to burst apart in flames on a test stand. The capsules SuperDraco launch-abort thrusters were just a half-second from firing when the blast occurred. This first crew capsule had completed a successful test flight, minus a crew, to the space station in March. SpaceX intended to refly the capsule on a launch-abort test in June, ahead of the first flight with astronauts on a new crew Dragon. The schedule is now up in the air, as SpaceX scrambles to identify and correct whatever went wrong. SpaceX has been restocking the station since 2012. This latest cargo Dragon  making the companys 17th shipment  is carrying equipment and experiments for the six space station astronauts, including an instrument to monitor carbon dioxide in Earths atmosphere. The California-based company is also under contract with NASA, along with Boeing, to transport astronauts to the space station. Its unclear whether these commercial crew flights will begin this year, given the Dragon accident and Boeings own delays with its Starliner capsule. Astronauts have not launched from Cape Canaveral since the last space shuttle mission in 2011, instead riding Russian rockets at a steep cost to NASA. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Scrawny dwarf planet, named Goblin, found well beyond Pluto","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A scrawny dwarf planet nicknamed the Goblin has been discovered well beyond Pluto. A round frozen world just 186 miles (300 kilometers) across, the Goblin was spotted by astronomers in 2015 around Halloween, thus its spooky name. But it wasnt publicly unveiled until Tuesday following further observations with ground telescopes. Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science , one of the astronomers who made the discovery, said the Goblin is on the small end for a dwarf planet. It is officially known as 2015 TG387 by the International Astronomical Unions Minor Planet Center. This is the third dwarf planet recently found to be orbiting on the frigid fringes of our solar system. Goblins orbit is extremely elongated  so stretched out, in fact, that it takes 40,000 years for it to circle the sun. At its most distant, the Goblin is 2,300 times farther from the sun than Earth. Thats 2,300 astronomical units, or AU. One AU is the distance from Earth to the sun, or roughly 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). At its closest, the Goblin is 65 times farther from the sun than Earth, or 65 AU. Pluto, by comparison, is approximately between 30 and 50 AU. Sheppard, along with Northern Arizona Universitys Chad Trujillo and the University of Hawaiis David Tholen, spotted the Goblin in October 2015 when it was relatively nearby  around 80 AU. 
        
     The two other dwarf planets are Sedna, discovered in 2003, which is about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) across, and 2012 VP113, about 310 miles (500 kilometers). They were found by some of the same astronomers. Thousands  even a million  more such objects could be way out there orbiting in the so-called Inner Oort Cloud, according to the researchers. Theyre in hot pursuit of them, as well as a potentially bigger-than-Earth planet known as Planet 9, or Planet X, believed by some scientists to be orbiting at a distance of hundreds of AU. These objects are on elongated orbits, and we can only detect them when they are closest to the Sun. For some 99 percent of their orbits, they are too distant and thus too faint for us to observe them. We are only seeing the tip of the ice berg, Sheppard said in an email. Sheppard said the faraway objects are like breadcrumbs leading us to Planet X. The more of them we can find, the better we can understand the outer solar system and the possible planet that we think is shaping their orbits  a discovery that would redefine our knowledge of the solar systems evolution, he said in a statement. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Debut of SpaceX, Boeing crew capsules off until next year","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The debut of SpaceX and Boeing crew capsules is off until next year. NASA said this week that the first commercial test flights have slipped from late this year into next. SpaceX is shooting for a January shakedown of its Dragon capsule, without anyone on board. Boeing is aiming for a March trial run of its Starliner capsule, also minus astronauts. Those tests would be followed by flights with crews next summer. SpaceX is targeting June and Boeing, August. That would be eight years after astronauts last rocketed into orbit from the U.S. Since the retirement of NASAs shuttles in 2011, U.S. astronauts have had to rely on Russian capsules to get to and from the International Space Station. Soyuz tickets have cost more than $81 million apiece. NASA stresses these latest launch dates are subject to still more change.

NASA X-ray Space Telescope back online after brief shutdown,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  One of NASAs space telescopes is back in business after a two-day shutdown. NASA said Monday that the Chandra X-ray Observatory came back online Friday. Chandras trouble occurred less than a week after the Hubble Space Telescope was sidelined. In both cases, the problem was in the pointing system. Officials say a glitch in one of Chandras gyroscopes generated three seconds of bad computer data last Wednesday. That was enough for the 19-year-old telescope to go into so-called safe mode, during which science observations cease. Flight controllers restored Chandras pointing by switching to a backup gyroscope. Observations are expected to resume with Chandra by the end of this week.

AP analysis: Obamacare shapes opioid grant spending,"With Republicans and Democrats joining forces again in a bipartisan effort to target the U.S. opioid crisis, an Associated Press analysis of the first wave of emergency money from Congress finds that states are taking very different approaches to spending it. To a large extent, the differences depend on whether states participated in one of the most divisive issues in recent American politics: the health overhaul known as Obamacare. The AP analysis found states that expanded Medicaid under President Barack Obamas health overhaul reported spending their allocations more slowly than states that didnt expand the health insurance program to poor, childless adults. Why? In states that expanded Medicaid, the insurance program already covers addiction treatment for nearly everyone who is poor and needs it. Medicaid allows states to go beyond the basics with the grant money, while non-expansion states have to fill in for basic needs with fewer dollars, said Brendan Saloner, an addiction researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In effect, Medicaid expansion states had a running start on the opioid crisis, while states without the extra Medicaid funding hastened to catch up. Non-expansion states are dealing with populations more likely to be uninsured and more likely to need coverage for addiction treatment, Saloner said. In contrast, states with Medicaid expansion can use the grants to create new infrastructure, asking providers to take risks by investing in new personnel, new systems and new ways of doing things, Saloner said. The puzzle is how to keep momentum going after the funds are gone. The Medicaid insurance expansion gives states a head start because they have a coordinated, reliable and consistent source of coverage for a demographic group hit hard by addiction, said Trish Riley, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. Its not grant funded. Its not stopgap, Riley said. 
        
     Coverage matters, period, Riley said. Thirty-three states have expanded Medicaid, receiving enhanced federal funding to cover poor adults. Historically, Medicaid has covered a large share of all addiction treatment in the U.S., more than all private insurance combined. Medicaid covers 4 out of 10 adults under age 65 with opioid addiction. On Election Day, voters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah will decide whether their states should expand Medicaid. Montana voters will decide on maintaining that states expansion. The emergency money from Congress was part of a two-year, nearly $1 billion grant program. It was distributed according to a formula favoring states with more overdose deaths and treatment needs. California received nearly $45 million. Texas got $27.6 million. Florida got $27.2 million. States spent the money at different paces and on different services, the AP found. In total, states used the money to provide treatment to nearly 119,000 people with opioid addiction, including nearly 3,000 pregnant women. More than 33,000 people received recovery services, such as training and housing. In Massachusetts, with Medicaid expansion already paying for treatment, the grant goes largely toward such recovery services. Phillip Oliver, a 48-year-old who has struggled with addiction since his early teens, is training to work in the restaurant industry; his tuition is covered by the grant. Michael Robinson, who is in recovery from heroin addiction, got a care services coordinator, a $500 benefit and a six-week training program in construction. Two months ago, the 25-year-old became a union carpenter and has been working on building projects across the Boston area since. Its a great thing theyre doing, Robinson said. The reason a lot of people stay getting high is they have nothing to look forward to. They dont have the jobs skills and the streets are all they know. Tennessee, which has not expanded Medicaid, is spending its grant at a quicker pace than most other states, filling empty slots at treatment facilities that were instantly ready for more clients. One is Buffalo Valley Inc. with 14 locations around the state. Thanks to the federal grant, Buffalo Valley is treating an additional 1,000 people a year with opioid addiction and without insurance. People like Tim Nolen, 36, of Nashville. I see it as a blessing, said Nolen, who after years addicted to pain pills is making progress with medication and counseling. The biggest thing for me was, not having insurance, I could still get help and I didnt have to go bankrupt to get it. The AP obtained the spending data via a Freedom of Information Act request filed with federal health officials. The 12 months of spending totaled $270 million, a portion of the $1 billion Congress approved in 2016 to address opioid addiction under the 21st Century Cures Act. To compare states, AP obtained year-end reports and analyzed actual expenditures from May 2017 through April 2018. States were required to report on money actually spent, not what they intended to spend. In some states, structural delays  choosing contractors through competitive bidding, for example  led to less time for invoices to be submitted and paid by the end of the period. California officials said such processes and a deliberate effort to build an entirely new treatment structure explain why the state still had $41 million of its grant left after the first 12 months. The AP analysis found: States that did not expand Medicaid spent $2,645 per patient on opioid addiction treatment on average. Expansion states spent $1,581 per patient for treatment. States that did not expand Medicaid spent $1,170 per person served on recovery support services. Expansion states spent $446 per person served on recovery. States that did not expand Medicaid spent 71 percent of their grant money in the first year. Expansion states spent 59 percent of their grant money. States can get permission to carry over unspent money into the next year. Virginia and Maine were counted as non-expansion states in APs analysis because neither states expansion was implemented in time to affect grant spending. Federal officials said states had some leeway in how they categorized money spent but also got some guidance. For instance, states were instructed to categorize the opioid overdose drug naloxone under the treatment category. Its too early to pinpoint whether the spending may be helping solve the crisis. The Trump administration has said a recent survey shows efforts are working. Fewer people used heroin in 2017 for the first time than the previous year. Fewer were misusing or addicted to prescription opioid painkillers. And more people were getting treatment for heroin and opioid addiction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released preliminary figures that appear to show a leveling off in overdose deaths. In the shadow of the bitter fight over Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court confirmation, Congress passed the bipartisan Support for Patients and Communities Act, which includes multiple provisions to address the opioid crisis and reauthorizes the Cures Act grants through 2021. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the measure. Debbie Hillin of Buffalo Valley in Tennessee said she worries Congress wont continue the grants beyond that. Its an overwhelming concern.

AP analysis: Obamacare shapes opioid grant spending,"With Republicans and Democrats joining forces again in a bipartisan effort to target the U.S. opioid crisis, an Associated Press analysis of the first wave of emergency money from Congress finds that states are taking very different approaches to spending it. To a large extent, the differences depend on whether states participated in one of the most divisive issues in recent American politics: the health overhaul known as Obamacare. The AP analysis found states that expanded Medicaid under President Barack Obamas health overhaul reported spending their allocations more slowly than states that didnt expand the health insurance program to poor, childless adults. Why? In states that expanded Medicaid, the insurance program already covers addiction treatment for nearly everyone who is poor and needs it.

Next US astronaut on Russian rocket confident after mishaps,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A U.S. astronaut said Friday she has no qualms about riding a Russian rocket next month despite back-to-back mishaps. Army Lt. Col. Anne McClain said spaceflight is never 100 percent safe and its coincidental that the last two Soyuz missions to the International Space Station encountered trouble. Last month, astronauts had to make an emergency landing in Kazakhstan following a failed launch. A month earlier, a space station air leak was traced to a hole mysteriously drilled into a docked Soyuz capsule. Russian investigators are still working to understand how a rocket sensor ended up bent during manufacturing and how the hole wound up in the Soyuz. McClain is set to blast off Dec. 3 on her first spaceflight, with a Russian and Canadian. They will spend six months aboard the orbiting lab. The 39-year-old helicopter pilot, who has a young son, said her family is used to her risky work  she flew combat missions in the military. Her crewmates, both men, also have children, she noted from training quarters in Star City, Russia. The hardest part about this business is being away from the kids, she said in an interview with The Associated Press. But what I hope to teach him  and what I hope to teach all kids that are kind of looking at this  is that to achieve anything, it takes a lot of sacrifice. Her own dream of becoming an astronaut goes back to her preschool days in Spokane, Washington. NASA chose her in 2013. 
        
     McClain said she views the Oct. 11 launch accident as a success story, given that the abort system saved her friends lives. She was back home in Houston, watching the flight and listening to the astronauts radio communications. The crew was lucky. But every crew that makes it to orbit is lucky. Spaceflights not easy, she said. The American on the aborted flight, Nick Hague, gave her the inside scoop when he got back to Houston. Hague and Russian Alexei Ovchinin have been promised another shot at space, possibly next year. But McClain said shes uncertain whether they will arrive before her own mission ends in June. Since the accident, three Soyuz rockets have launched successfully with satellites. One more Soyuz flight is planned before McClains launch, this one carrying supplies for the space station. Her own rocket has been inspected for any deformities. Shes so confident in the rocket and its decades-long history of successes that she said she would have climbed aboard the Soyuz to fly the day after the accident. The launch abort was the first in 35 years for Russias human spaceflight program and only the third one ever. Russian officials have moved up McClains flight by a few weeks so she, Canadian David Saint-Jacques and Russian Oleg Kononenko can spend enough time with the current three station residents, an American, German and Russian due to return to Earth on Dec. 20. The two Russians plan a spacewalk during their shared time to survey the punctured Soyuz from the outside. A makeshift patch is keeping the spacecraft airtight. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA accepts delivery of European powerhouse for moonship,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA has accepted delivery of a key European part needed to power the worlds next-generation moonship. U.S. and European leaders gathered at Kennedy Space Center on Friday to mark the occasion. The newly arrived powerhouse, or service module, will propel NASAs Orion capsule to the moon during a test flight without passengers planned for 2020. A mega rocket under development by NASA, known as SLS for Space Launch System, will launch the combo. The European component allows us to take people farther into space than weve ever gone before, so it is a really big event for all of the Orion program, said NASAs Orion program manager Mark Kirasich.  Orion and the attached service module are meant to fly near the moon, but not land. Future missions will carry astronauts, with the goal of building an outpost just beyond the moon that could enable lunar landings and Mars expeditions. The European Space Agencys director general, Jan Worner, stressed to the crowd, We will not go back to the moon, we will go forward to the moon. Thats because it will be in a totally different way involving cooperation rather than competition, as was the case during NASAs Apollo moon-landing program of the 1960s and 1970s. On its only spaceflight to date, the Orion capsule soared more than 3,600 miles (5,800 kilometers) above Earth in 2014. The second, considerably more distant demo will come in 2020 with the Orion and service module; that will mark the SLS launch debut. This mission has been repeatedly delayed. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Its named after Apollo 16 moonwalker and the first space shuttle commander John Young, who died in January. The stations German commander, Alexander Gerst, tweeted, Welcome aboard, S.S. John Young! Ice cream and other fresh food are the first things coming out. On Sunday, a Russian supply ship brought a full load.

"NASA spacecraft arrives at ancient asteroid, its 1st visitor","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  After a two-year chase, a NASA spacecraft arrived Monday at the ancient asteroid Bennu, its first visitor in billions of years. The robotic explorer Osiris-Rex pulled within 12 miles (19 kilometers) of the diamond-shaped space rock. It will get even closer in the days ahead and go into orbit around Bennu on Dec. 31. No spacecraft has ever orbited such a small cosmic body. It is the first U.S. attempt to gather asteroid samples for return to Earth, something only Japan has accomplished so far. Flight controllers applauded and exchanged high-fives once confirmation came through that Osiris-Rex made it to Bennu  exactly one week after NASA landed a spacecraft on Mars. Relieved, proud, and anxious to start exploring! tweeted lead scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona. To Bennu and back! With Bennu some 76 million miles (122 million kilometers) away, it took seven minutes for word to get from the spacecraft to flight controllers at Lockheed Martin in Littleton, Colorado. The company built the spacecraft there. Bennu is estimated to be just over 1,600 feet (500 meters) across. Researchers will provide a more precise description at a scientific meeting next Monday in Washington. About the size of an SUV, the spacecraft will shadow the asteroid for a year, before scooping up some gravel for return to Earth in 2023. 
        
     Scientists are eager to study material from a carbon-rich asteroid like dark Bennu, which could hold evidence dating back to the beginning of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago. As such, its an astronomical time capsule. A Japanese spacecraft, meanwhile, has been hanging out at another near-Earth asteroid since June, also for samples. It is Japans second asteroid mission. This latest rock is named Ryugu and about double the size of Bennu. Ryugus specks should be here by December 2020, but will be far less than Osiris-Rexs promised booty. Osiris-Rex aims to collect at least 60 grams, or 2 ounces, of dust and gravel. The spacecraft wont land, but rather use a 10-foot (3-meter) mechanical arm in 2020 to momentarily touch down and vacuum up particles. The sample container would break loose and head toward Earth in 2021. The collection  parachuting down to Utah  would represent the biggest cosmic haul since the Apollo astronauts hand-delivered moon rocks to Earth in the late 1960s and early 1970s. NASA has brought back comet dust and solar wind particles before, but never asteroid samples. Japan managed to return some tiny particles in 2010 from its first asteroid mission , also named Hayabusa. Both Bennu and Ryugu are considered potentially hazardous asteroids. That means they could smack Earth years from now. At worst, Bennu would carve out a crater during a projected close call 150 years from now. Contact with Bennu will not significantly change its orbit or make it more dangerous to us, Lauretta stressed. Scientists contend the more they learn about asteroids, the better equipped Earth will be in heading off a truly catastrophic strike. The $800 million Osiris-Rex mission began with a 2016 launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Its odometer read 1.2 billion miles (2 billion kilometers) as of Monday. Both the spacecraft and asteroids names come from Egyptian mythology. Osiris is the god of the afterlife, while Bennu represents the heron and creation. Osiris-Rex is actually a NASA acronym for origins, spectral interpretation, resource identification, security-regolith explorer. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Christmas turkey, fruitcake rocketing toward space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Christmas turkey rocketed toward the International Space Station on Wednesday, along with cranberry sauce, candied yams and the obligatory fruitcake. The SpaceX booster missed its landing zone on the ground after liftoff, however, and ended up in the sea just a couple of miles offshore. Groans filled SpaceX Mission Control in Hawthorne, California, as live video showed the first-stage rocket booster spinning out of control, still high above Cape Canaveral. It was the companys first missed ground landing, although it has overshot floating barges plenty of times in the past, a tougher feat to pull off. A SpaceX commentator called it a bummer, but noted it was secondary to the Falcon 9 rockets main mission of getting the Dragon capsule to orbit. SpaceX chief Elon Musk said the booster appeared to be undamaged. The hydraulic pump for the landing fins apparently stalled, but the engines stabilized the approximately 160-foot-tall booster just in time, allowing for an intact landing in water! Musk noted via Twitter. Ships en route to rescue Falcon, he tweeted. SpaceXs 12 previous ground landings  dating back to 2015  all were successful. Altogether, the company has recovered 32 boosters following liftoff  33 once this one is towed back, said Hans Koenigsmann, a SpaceX vice president. He did not know if it could be reused. Koenigsmann said the booster deliberately avoided land after sensing a problem, a built-in safety feature, and even managed to touch down upright in the Atlantic, atop its landing legs. 
        
     Public safety was well protected here, he told reporters. The disappointment was offset by the successful flight of the Dragon capsule and its 5,600 pounds (2,500 kilograms) of cargo. It should reach the space station Saturday. What a great day for a launch, said Kennedy Space Center director Bob Cabana. Twenty years ago this week, Cabana commanded the shuttle mission that carried up the first U.S. part of the space station . Besides smoked turkey breast and all the other fixings for Christmas dinner, the delivery includes 40 mice and 36,000 worms for aging and muscle studies. Researchers expect a tenfold increase in the worm population. There will be plenty of room on board for all the tiny nematodes. It turns out their muscles are similar to ours in structure and function, making them perfect lab substitutes, said lead scientist Timothy Etheridge of the University of Exeter in England. The launch was delayed a day when NASA discovered that the food for the mouse-tronauts was moldy. More food had to be rushed in from California. Just two days earlier, three astronauts arrived at the space station to join the three already there. The crew includes two Americans, two Russians, one German and one Canadian. The newest residents will remain on board for six months, while the others will return to Earth on Dec. 20.  SpaceX has been making station deliveries for NASA since 2012. The private company expects to start launching station crews next year. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Spacewalking astronauts check site of capsule leak,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts ripped through thick insulation on a capsule docked to the International Space Station on Tuesday, looking for clues to a mysterious drilled hole that leaked precious cabin air four months ago. Russians Sergei Prokopyev and Oleg Kononenko spotted the tiny hole in the external hull of the Soyuz capsule, more than five hours into their grueling spacewalk. That is exactly the hole weve been looking for, guys, radioed Russian Mission Control outside Moscow. The spacewalkers reported seeing no drill marks around the black dot, like on the inside. Back in August, the station crew patched the hole in the Soyuz capsule, plugging it with epoxy and gauze. Russian space officials wanted the site surveyed from the outside, before the capsules return to Earth next week with Prokopyev and two others. This part of the capsule will be jettisoned as usual before atmospheric re-entry, and so poses no risk for descent. Prokopyev and Kononenko had to use a pair of telescoping booms to reach the Soyuz. It took nearly four hours for them to cross the approximately 100 feet (30 meters) to get there. Then the insulation proved harder to remove than expected, taking another one to two hours of effort. To expose the external hull, they cut away a 10-inch (25-centimeter) swatch of thermal insulation and debris shield. Bits of shredded silver insulation floated away like confetti, as the two slashed at it with a knife and long cutters. The astronauts collected samples of the black epoxy sealant protruding from the hole, just one-tenth of an inch (2 millimeters) across. 
        
     Their spacewalk lasted almost eight hours. It is high time you went home, Mission Control urged. It was very difficult ... but we were able to get it done, one of the spacewalkers said. NASA said the pieces of freed insulation posed no threat to the space station and would likely burn up in the atmosphere in a day or so. The capsule leak caused a flap between the U.S. and Russian space agencies, following its discovery at the end of August. Russian space chief Dmitry Rogozin observed that the hole could have been drilled during manufacturing  or in orbit. The space stations commander at the time flatly denied any wrongdoing by himself or his crew. Rogozin has since backpedaled his statement, blaming the news media for twisting his words. A Russian investigation is ongoing, according to Rogozin, and samples collected during the spacewalk will be returned to Earth on the Soyuz. The spacewalk findings could lead to better repair techniques in the future, officials said. The Soyuz is scheduled to depart the orbiting lab on Dec. 19, U.S. time, with Prokopyev, American Serena Aunon-Chancellor and German Alexander Gerst, the stations current skipper. It ferried them up in June. Remaining aboard the 250-mile-high (400-kilometer-high) outpost for the next six months will be an American, Russian and Canadian who arrived last week. This was the 213th spacewalk in 20 years at the space station. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"AP analysis: Unemployment, income affect life expectancy","NEW YORK (AP)  Even your lifespan can be local. Researchers have long said that health disparities are heavily influenced by where you live. New data from the National Center for Health Statistics show just how much your neighborhood can impact the length of your life. In recent years, the U.S. has seen overall life expectancy decrease, from 78.7 years in 2015 to 78.6 years in 2017. Experts have pointed to opioid addiction and an increase in suicides as the main reasons. Behind that national average are American neighborhoods where recently born residents can expect to live much longer, or much shorter, lives. The Associated Press analyzed life expectancy and demographic data for 65,662 census tracts, which are geographic areas that encompass roughly 4,000 residents. The AP found that certain demographic qualities  high rates of unemployment, low household income, a concentration of black or Native American residents and low rates of high school education  affected life expectancy in most neighborhoods. An increase of 10 percentage points in the unemployment rate in a neighborhood translated to a loss of roughly a year and a half of life expectancy, the AP found. A neighborhood where more adults failed to graduate high school had shorter predicted longevity. New York state had the largest range for life expectancy among its neighborhoods, spanning 34.5 years. The places with the highest and lowest estimates are both in New York City. Children born between 2010 and 2015 in part of the northern half of Roosevelt Island have an estimated life expectancy of 59 years; a child born 6 miles away in Chinatown in lower Manhattan can expect to live 93.6 years. 
        
     In one North Carolina neighborhood  Fearrington Village in Chatham County  a child born between 2010 and 2015 can expect to live 97.5 years, the highest estimated lifespan for any neighborhood in the U.S. A child in part of Stilwell in Adair County, Oklahoma, can expect 59 years on average, the nations lowest. The AP analysis also found discrepancies among states. Life expectancy in Hawaii topped all other states at 82 years. Mississippis estimate of 74.9 was the lowest, followed closely by West Virginia, Alabama, Oklahoma and Kentucky. The AP analyzed 88.7 percent of all U.S. census tracts. Maine and Wisconsin were excluded because some of their death records lacked home addresses of the deceased. The data is part of a new partnership between the National Center for Health Statistics, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Through the collaboration, researchers used six years of death records and demographic data to create a longevity estimate for nearly every census tract in the country.",https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-ea3be7fb82bf4bec90a00d75957f833b,science
3 space station astronauts return to Earth,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Three astronauts returned from the International Space Station to the snowy, bitingly cold flat lands of Central Asia, ending a 5 1/2-month mission highlighted by robotic renovations, schoolteacher pep talks and heavenly greetings from Pope Francis. The two Americans and one Russian landed in a Soyuz capsule shortly after sunrise Wednesday, local time, in Kazakhstan, where the temperature was below freezing. Flight controllers feared snow and freezing rain might hamper recovery efforts, but NASA said the weather wasnt nearly as bad as had been feared and the pickup teams got to where they needed to be. NASAs Joe Acaba and Mark Vande Hei, and Russias Alexander Misurkin emerged from the capsule one by one, smiling, waving and pumping their fists in the air as they were carried to outdoor chairs. Medical staff wrapped them in thick blankets, while taking their pulse and making sure they were fine. The astronauts checked out of the space station just a few hours earlier, hugging the three men remaining behind. Were already missing you, radioed station commander Anton Shkaplerov as the capsule backed away. In handing over the skippers job to Shkaplerov, Misurkin joked that at least he and his two crewmates didnt break anything and hopefully accomplished some good science. Theyd lived on the space station since September. Acaba is the first astronaut of Puerto Rican heritage and a former schoolteacher. He teamed up with another educator-astronaut, Ricky Arnold, whos launching in three weeks, to perform the science lessons prepared by Christa McAuliffe 32 years ago. She died in the shuttle Challenger launch disaster. 
        
     During a series of spacewalks spanning months, Acaba and Vande Hei helped replace the aging mechanical hands of the stations big robot arm. And last fall, they had a chance to chat with Pope Francis, discussing the beauty and fragility of the home planet. As is customary, NASA planned to hustle Acaba and Vande Hei back to Houston, with Misurkin heading to cosmonaut headquarters at Star City, Russia. A replacement crew, including former teacher Arnold, will lift off from Kazakhstan on March 21 and bring the space station back up to a full crew of six. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/3-space-station-astronauts-return-to-earth-bf156620f75e4ee2956b08d8c68dcfa9,science

The latest Falcon took flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, early Tuesday, successfully hoisting a massive communications satellite for Spains Hispasat corporation. The orbiting satellite is almost as big as a city bus. No attempt was made to recover the first-stage booster. Waves offshore were too rough for a barge landing.  SpaceX has been flying the Falcon 9 since mid-2010. Fifty launches in less than eight years is a pretty good clip, by rocket standards.

Our 1st interstellar visitor likely came from 2-star system,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Our first known interstellar visitor likely came from a two-star system. Thats the latest from astronomers who were amazed by the mysterious cigar-shaped object, detected as it passed through our inner solar system last fall. The University of Torontos Alan Jackson reported Monday that the asteroid  the first confirmed object in our solar system originating elsewhere  is probably from a binary star system. Thats where two stars orbit a common center. According to Jackson and his team, the asteroid was likely ejected from its system as planets formed. It has been wandering interstellar space for a long time since, the scientists wrote in the Royal Astronomical Societys journal, Monthly Notices . Discovered in October by a telescope in Hawaii millions of miles away, the asteroid is called Oumuamua, Hawaiian for messenger from afar arriving first, or scout. The red-tinged rock is estimated to be possibly 1,300 feet (400 meters) long and zooming away from the Earth and sun at more than 16 miles (26 kilometers) per second. Last month, a science team led by Wesley Fraser of Queens University Belfast reported that Oumuamua is actually tumbling through space, likely the result of a collision with another asteroid or other object that kicked it out of its home solar system. He expects it to continue tumbling for billions of more years. Scientists originally thought it might be an icy comet, but now agree it is an asteroid. 
        
     The same way we use comets to better understand planet formation in our own solar system, maybe this curious object can tell us more about how planets form in other systems. Jackson said in a statement. Close binary star systems may be the source of the majority of interstellar objects out there, both icy comets and rocky asteroids, according to the researchers.",https://apnews.com/our-1st-interstellar-visitor-likely-came-from-2-star-system-0148dacdfc1942cb9aa037e67abfb736,science
"NASAs Mars rover Curiosity marks 2,000th day on red planet","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Mars rover Curiosity has now marked 2,000 days on the red planet. Thats 2,000 days by Martian standards. A Martian sol, or solar day, is equivalent to 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds. So 2,000 days on Mars equal 2,055 days here on Earth. Either way, its a big milestone this week for scientists eager for Curiosity to begin drilling again, this time into potentially clay-rich rocks on the slopes of Mount Sharp. The six-wheeled rover has traveled 11.6 miles (18.7 kilometers) since its arrival in 2012. The rover Opportunity, though, has Curiosity beat. Last month, NASAs busy Opportunity surpassed its 5,000 day on Mars. Its been exploring Mars since 2004. NASA plans to send another robotic geologist to Mars in May. Named InSight, the lander will stay in one place as a heat-measuring device burrows deep into the Martian terrain. Curiositys flight controllers, meanwhile, are testing a new drilling method. The rovers drill stopped working properly in 2016, and so engineers devised another way to bore into Martian rocks and get the pulverized rock samples into the rovers lab instruments.",https://apnews.com/nasas-mars-rover-curiosity-marks-2-000th-day-on-red-planet-909b4841ea3f40b6abd6a4b810413a43,science
NASA delays next-generation space telescope until 2020,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is delaying the launch of its next-generation space telescope  its highest science priority  until at least 2020. Top officials said Tuesday that more time is needed to assemble and test the James Webb Space Telescope, which is considered a successor to the long-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. Its the latest in a series of delays for the telescope, dating back a decade. More recently, Webb was supposed to fly this year, but last fall NASA bumped the launch until 2019. Simply put, we have one shot to get this right before going into space, explained Thomas Zurbuchen, NASAs associate administrator of science. For such a highly complex machine designed to look at the universe in a way that weve never seen it, there can be no shortcuts, he stressed. The telescope will study planets orbiting other stars, while probing the earliest times of the cosmos. Some mistakes were made while preparing the telescope, which slowed work. At the same time, NASA underestimated the scale of the job, Zurbuchen said. Unlike Hubble, which was serviced regularly by space shuttle astronauts, Webb will orbit the sun at a point about 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth  unreachable in case of a breakdown. Hubble lifted off in 1990 with a flawed mirror that blurred its vision; spacewalking astronauts had to fix it in 1993. Youve heard this before, but it rings true for us. Really, failure is not an option, Zurbuchen told reporters in a teleconference. 
        
     NASA and its partner, the European Space Agency, will firm up a new launch date, now tentatively targeted for May 2020 from French Guiana. An independent review board is being formed to look into the remaining work and feasible launch dates. Once a date is actually set, NASA said it will provide a new cost estimate. Officials acknowledge the cost may exceed the $8 billion development cap set by Congress. NASA already has poured $7.3 billion into the telescope, said Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot. He promised Congress would receive a detailed report on schedule and cost this summer. The telescope is named after the NASA administrator who oversaw the Mercury and Gemini programs and development of the Apollo moon missions. All its parts are now at Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems in Redondo Beach, California. The two halves of the 13,500-pound (6,100-kilogram) observatory still must be joined and the entire structure tested. Extensive testing is the only way to ensure that the mission will succeed with high confidence, Zurbuchen said. In addition to a mirror 21 feet (6.5 meters) across, Webb will sport a five-layer sunshield the size of a tennis court so it can make infrared observations at frigid temperatures. Several tears across all five layers occurred during folding and deployment of the sunshield during testing. The spacecrafts propulsion system also had its share of trouble. NASA, meanwhile, is launching a planet-hunting spacecraft named Tess on April 16 from Cape Canaveral. Tess will serve as a scout for Webb, identifying planets around nearby stars that Webb later will study for possible signs of life. Neither Tess nor other joint missions will be impacted by the Webb delays, Zurbuchen said.",https://apnews.com/nasa-delays-next-generation-space-telescope-until-2020-57a443d19e1d48abab1282119cbd62aa,science
NASA astronauts go spacewalking days after reaching orbit,"Two new arrivals at the International Space Station went spacewalking Thursday less than a week after moving in, completing all their work despite a slightly shortened excursion. NASA astronauts Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold quickly installed new wireless antennas and removed leaky hoses from a radiator. They also replaced a broken camera. We got a lot done today, Mission Control radioed, offering congratulations. The astronauts brought the old equipment inside for eventual return to Earth. It was a tight fit inside the airlock as the spacewalk concluded at the six-hour, 10-minute mark. The spacewalk was planned for 6  hours, but NASA decided to limit the mens time outside because of an issue with Feustels air-cleaning system. They still managed to complete all their tasks and tackled an extra chore. NASA stressed Feustels suit issue was unrelated to the trouble he had earlier in the day. His suit failed three leak checks after he put it on, but passed on the fourth try. That put the astronauts more than an hour late in getting outside. You guys are working harder up there today than in the gym, Mission Control said before the spacewalk had begun. Feustel and Arnold rocketed away from Kazakhstan last Wednesday and arrived at the 250-mile-high outpost two days later. They will remain on board until August. Shuttle astronauts often went spacewalking a few days after reaching orbit, given their short flights, but its less common for station residents who spend five to six months aloft. 
        
     A space station manager, NASAs Kenny Todd, said earlier this week that both Feustel and Arnold were experienced spacewalkers from the old space shuttle days and were used to a quick transition in orbit. But Todd cautioned theres nothing routine about spacewalking and is probably the most dangerous undertaking by orbiting astronauts. This was Feustels seventh spacewalk and Arnolds third. The intense pace continues next week.

New NASA boss gets hearty congratulations from space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new boss is already getting cheers from space. Immediately after being sworn into office Monday by Vice President Mike Pence, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine took a call from the three U.S. astronauts at the International Space Station who offered hearty congratulations. The Oklahoma congressman became the 13th administrator of NASA, filling a position that had been vacant for more than a year. America loves what you guys are doing, Bridenstine, a former naval aviator, told the astronauts. He promised to do his best as we reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind. This is the 60th anniversary year for NASA . Bridenstine is the first elected official to lead NASA, something that had bogged down his nomination last year by President Donald Trump. The Senate approved his nomination last week by a narrow vote of 50-49. Mondays swearing-in ceremony took place at NASA headquarters in Washington. Pence noted that the space agency, under Bridenstines direction, will work to get astronauts back to the moon and then, with help from commercial space and international partners, on to Mars. NASA will lead the way, said Pence, who heads the newly resurrected National Space Council. Charles Bolden Jr., a former space shuttle commander and major general in the Marines, was NASAs last official administrator.

WALL-E and EVE on their way to Mars with InSight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs next Mars explorer is going to have company all the way to the red planet: a couple of puny yet groundbreaking sidekicks. Named after the characters in the 2008 animated movie, the small satellites WALL-E and EVE hitched a ride on the Atlas V rocket that launched early Saturday from California with the Mars InSight lander. Similar in size to a briefcase or large cereal box, the satellites popped out from the rockets upper stage after liftoff and are hightailing it to Mars, right behind InSight. This is the first time little cube-shaped satellites, CubeSats as theyre known, have set sail for deep space. The journey will span 6 1/2 months and 300 million miles (485 million kilometers). A brief look at the $18.5 million experiment tagging along with InSight: ___ MINI SATS: Miniature satellites, or CubeSats, have been piggybacking on big-ticket space missions for well over a decade, providing relatively cheap and fast access to orbit for students and other out-of-the-mainstream experimenters. Until now, the hundreds of CubeSats have been confined to Earth orbit. That is changing with NASAs Mars Cube One project, or MarCO. The European Space Agency, meanwhile, has its CubeSat sights on the moon. A recent competition yielded two winning proposals: a CubeSat to explore the moons far side from lunar orbit, and another to probe a permanently shadowed crater near the moons south pole, also from lunar orbit. NASA is also looking to send CubeSats to the moon, as well as an asteroid. MOVIE CONNECTION: It turns out that these twin cubes are equipped with the same type of cold gas propulsion system used in fire extinguishers to spray foam. In the movie WALL-E, the title character uses a fire extinguisher to propel through space. Team members couldnt resist the connection, thus the names WALL-E and EVE, after WALL-Es love interest, for the two mini-spacecraft. Engineers want to test this compact propulsion system for guiding the 30-pound (13.6-kilogram) cubes to Mars. 
        
     GETTING TO MARS: WALL-E and EVE will trail a few thousand miles (kilometers) behind InSight en route to Mars. The two mini-spacecraft will also be a few thousand miles (kilometers) apart from one another. Thats to prevent any collisions or even close calls. While that may seem far apart, its actually fairly close by space standards, according to Brian Clement, an engineer on the project at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. While InSight will be stopping at Mars on Nov. 26, WALL-E and EVE will zoom past the planet from about 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) out. Dont expect any Thunderbird pilot-theatrics as the cubes fly by, like a tilting of the solar wings in salute. That would make a great movie, but thats definitely not the way were going to do it, Clement said. EXTRA EARS: Besides testing the cubes maneuvering system, NASA wants to see if WALL-E and EVE can transmit data to Earth from InSight during its descent to Mars. If the experiment succeeds, it should take just several minutes for flight controllers to hear from the cubes. No worries if theyre silent. NASA will rely on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter already circling the planet as the main communication link with InSight during descent and touchdown. It will take a lot longer, though, to get confirmation. The beauty of a CubeSat relay system is that it could provide descent information at planets and other cosmic stop-offs lacking established communications. POST MARS: Once past Mars, WALL-E and EVE will remain in an elliptical orbit around the sun, together for years to come. But they wont work for long. Once they run out of fuel, they wont be able to point their solar wings toward the sun for recharging. ___ The story summary and extended headline of this story have been edited to correct that the satellites are going to Mars with the Martian lander, not the rocket. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceXs upgraded rocket soars with satellite for Bangladesh,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX lifted Bangladeshs first satellite into orbit Friday using an upgraded rocket designed for dozens of repeat flights including back-to-back, same-day launches. SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk said launching the same rocket twice within 24 hours will be crazy hard, but he hopes to pull off the feat as early as next year. This latest and final version of the companys Falcon 9 rocket  capable of more than 10 reflights, possibly even 100  made its debut Friday. It soared from NASAs Kennedy Space Center into a hazy afternoon sky, carrying a communication satellite named Bangabandhu-1 after the founding father of Bangladesh. A last-minute abort halted Thursdays try. This newest booster landed on an ocean platform following liftoff as planned. What a great sight! the launch commentator announced as cheers and applause filled SpaceX Mission Control in Hawthorne, California. The booster will be taken apart for analysis before flying again in a few months. Musks goal is to eventually have little if any prep work between launches. The whole point of reusability  multiple flights with swift turnarounds, airplane-style  is to shave launch costs. This is a ridiculously hard thing, Musk told reporters before Thursdays postponement. It has taken us ... 16 years of extreme effort and many, many iterations and thousands of small but important development changes to get to where we think this is even possible. Crazy hard. We still need to demonstrate it. Its not like weve done it. But it can be done. 
        
     The Falcon 9 is SpaceXs workhorse, regularly hauling satellites into orbit and supplies to the International Space Station. This new and improved model will be used to launch astronauts for NASA in the coming year. So far, the first-stage boosters have been recycled once, for a total of two flights apiece. There has been a fair amount of maintenance between uses. For this new model, SpaceX enhanced engine performance, strengthened various parts of the rocket and improved the landing gear system. In the most visible change, the segment between the first and upper stages went from white to black with the addition of new thermal insulation. Musk wants to ultimately recover the entire rocket, not just the first stage, which accounts for 60 percent of the cost. He expects more customers to start gravitating toward flight-proven rockets as he calls them. Would you rather fly in an aircraft that has never had a test flight before or would you rather fly in an aircraft that has flown many times successfully? he said. Musk plans to launch about 30 of these upgraded Falcon 9s before switching to a massive rocket still in development known as the BFR, or Big Falcon Rocket. Capable of launching spacecraft to Mars  Musks ultimate ambition is to colonize the red planet  the BFR will replace not only the Falcon 9, but the brawny Falcon Heavy. The Heavy debuted in February, launching Musks Tesla electric sports car toward the orbit of Mars. Bangladesh, meanwhile, was thrilled to have its own satellite to spread internet throughout the land and provide emergency services in case of natural disasters.

Spacewalking astronauts perform pump swap at space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts carried out a high-flying, high-tech version of musical chairs Wednesday, rearranging pumps outside the International Space Station. Popping out early, NASA astronauts Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold quickly swapped the positions of two spare ammonia pumps that are part of the space stations critical cooling system. One pump got too cold because of a power shutdown 17 years ago and is called Frosty; flight controllers plan to test it in the coming days to see if it still works. The other, a failed unit dubbed Leaky, spewed out ammonia five years ago. Frosty took Leakys spot on a robot-arm mechanism, while Leaky was moved to a long-term storage platform. Ammonia coolant is toxic, and Mission Control repeatedly warned the spacewalkers to be careful of any leaks. A brand new spare pump arrived at the space station last month. This fresh pump is named Motley since its comprised of a variety of spare parts. Weve been doing a ton of work to play musical chairs with all these (pumps) so we can have good available spares, flight controller Alex Apyan said from Houston during the spacewalk. Each 235-pound pump, the size of a flat box, is about 3 feet by 2.5 feet by 1.5 foot. Feustel and Arnold also installed a new camera and communication device, and even accomplished some extra chores. Nice work, Mission Control said as the 6 1/2-hour spacewalk came to a close. All right, guys, we are ready for you all to start heading home. 
        
     The spacewalkers laughed and shared jokes as they floated back inside. Anyone home? Trick or treat! one of them jokingly called out. Meanwhile, the stations six-man crew is expecting a delivery. Orbital ATK plans to launch a supply ship Sunday from Wallops Island, Virginia. Weather permitting, the pre-dawn flight of the Antares rocket should be visible along the East Coast from New England to South Carolina. Feustel and Arnold went spacewalking at the end of March, shortly after arriving at the 250-mile-high lab.

NASA shipper Orbital ATK launches space station supplies,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  One of NASAs prime shippers, Orbital ATK, launched a fresh load of supplies to the International Space Station from Virginia on Monday. The Antares rocket blasted off from Wallops Island before dawn, treating early risers along the East Coast to a cosmic light show, at least where skies were clear. The area of visibility stretched from New England to the Carolinas, and as far inland as Pittsburgh and Charlotte. The 7,400-pound shipment  a third of it research  should reach the orbiting lab Thursday. A flight controller wished the Cygnus capsule a smooth trip on the rest of its journey. Very exciting morning. Earths newest spacecraft launched this morning in a column of fire and roar, NASAs space program manager, Kirk Shireman, said from Houston. The Cygnus holds a student cement-mixing experiment, as well as an atom-cooling chamber from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory that uses lasers to get temperatures colder than even space itself. Theres also equipment for a spacewalk next month, as well as computers and groceries for the six station astronauts. Named for the swan constellation, the Cygnus is making Orbital ATKs ninth contracted delivery for NASA. SpaceX is NASAs other supplier. This particular Cygnus is called the S.S. J.R. Thompson in honor of the former NASA and Orbital ATK executive, who died in November. Launch controllers wore dark suits, white shirts and red ties in memory of Thompson, who dressed that way on the job.

"New US weather satellite cant keep cool, could hurt photos","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The nations newest weather satellite, launched less than three months ago, has a serious cooling problem that could affect the quality of its pictures. The trouble is with the GOES-17 satellites premier instrument for taking images of hurricanes, wildfires, volcanic eruptions and other natural calamities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday. The imagers infrared sensors arent getting properly cooled. Experts are scrambling to understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Officials expect it will take at least a few months to figure out. As you can imagine, doing this remotely from 22,000 miles below only looking at the on-orbit data is a challenge, said Steve Volz, head of NOAAs satellite and information service. NOAA stresses that three other GOES satellites in orbit, including GOES-16 launched in 2016, are healthy and meeting forecasting needs. Launched in 2016 as the first in a $11 billion effort to revolutionize forecasting, GOES-16 monitors the Atlantic and East Coast. GOES-17, the second in the series, is intended to provide the same sophisticated coverage for the western U.S. and Pacific region. Volz told reporters the trouble was discovered three weeks ago during the satellites routine checkout in orbit. The satellite was launched by NASA on March 1 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. This is a serious problem, Volz said. The infrared channels are important elements of our observing requirement, and if they are not functioning fully, it is a loss. 
        
     The problem is with 13 of the 14 channels in the infrared and near infrared, which are meant to operate at around minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 200 degrees Celsius). The imagers cooling system  which uses propolyne  is not maintaining that frigid temperature during the warmer part of each orbit, and so the channels arent working well about half the time. The two channels operating in the visible light are unaffected. An identical imager on the GOES-16 satellite, launched in 2016, has been operating perfectly. So have similar imagers on a pair of Japanese weather satellites. The imagers are built by Harris Corp., based near Cape Canaveral. GOES-16 stunned meteorologists with its astonishingly fast, crisp images of last summers flooding from Hurricane Harvey in Houston, and then of Hurricanes Irma and Maria as the massive storms approached the Caribbean and U.S. We expected the same performance, and we still hope for that, Volz said. NOAAs next satellite in the series, which would become GOES-18, isnt due to launch until 2020, but the date might be moved up if necessary, according to Volz. GOES stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Space station accepts special delivery from Virginia,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station accepted delivery Thursday of more than 7,000 pounds of supplies from Virginia. A commercial cargo ship arrived at the orbiting lab three days after launching from Wallops Island. Orbital ATK shipped the goods for NASA in a Cygnus capsule, which is named after the swan constellation. NASA astronauts Scott Tingle and Ricky Arnold used the stations big robot arm to snag the Cygnus from orbit, as the craft passed 260 miles above Africas Cape of Good Hope and swung out over the southern Indian Ocean. Excellent job, guys, Mission Control radioed. Youve got a whole team down here in Houston with big smiles on their faces, along with the Orbital ATK controllers in Dulles, Virginia. It was a beautiful day to grapple the spaceship, Arnold replied. The crew will unload the food, equipment and science experiments, then fill the capsule with trash for a fiery re-entry in July. Research accounts for about one-third of the newly arrived contents, including a small chamber from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory that will use lasers to chill atoms to temperatures colder than space itself. This particular Cygnus is dubbed the S.S. J.R. Thompson in honor of the former NASA and Orbital ATK executive who died in November. Six men call the space station home: three Americans, two Russians and a Japanese. Three of them will return to Earth in just over a week.",https://apnews.com/space-station-accepts-special-delivery-from-virginia-02235aef61a947e3b6d44b70457c2e90,science
"Space Delivery: Astronauts get ice cream, make-own pizzas","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronauts got a mouth-watering haul with Tuesdays Earth-to-space delivery  pizza and ice cream. A commercial supply ship arrived at the International Space Station two days after launching from Virginia.

Astronauts always crave pizza in orbit, but its been particularly tough for Italys Paolo Nespoli. Hes been up there since July and has another month to go. Nespoli used the space stations robot arm to grab the cargo ship, as they zoomed 260 miles above the Indian Ocean. Besides flatbread, the capsule contains all the makings of a good Earth pizza: sauce, cheese, pepperoni, anchovy paste, tomatoes, pesto, olive oil and more. Astronauts also get a hankering for cold treats, thus the big frozen shipment of ice cream cups, ice cream sandwiches, ice cream bars and frozen fruit bars. In all, the capsule contains nearly 4 tons of cargo. Its named the S.S. Gene Cernan in honor of the last man to walk on the moon, who died in January. The experiments include mealworms and micro clover, sent up by high school students. The supply ship will remain at the space station until the beginning of December, when its cut loose with a load of trash.

(AP)  A stash of frozen treats and other supplies rocketed toward the International Space Station on Sunday, this time from Virginias cold eastern shore. NASAs commercial shipper, Orbital ATK, launched the cargo ship just after sunrise from Wallops Island, aboard an unmanned Antares rocket. The Cygnus capsule should reach the orbiting lab Tuesday. Its loaded with 7,400 pounds of cargo, including sweet treats for the six station astronauts. There are frozen fruit bars, ice cream bars, ice cream sandwiches and cups of chocolate and vanilla ice cream  about 80 in all, according to NASA. The crew expects pizza as well. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli has been craving pizza for months. Pizza and ice cream on the way! NASA astronaut Joe Acaba tweeted following liftoff. Eagerly awaiting the arrival. This marked Orbital ATKs first launch from its home turf in more than a year. The last time it made a space station delivery, it used another companys rocket flying from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Crowds gathered at Wallops in freezing temperatures and cheered as the rocket soared toward the southeast. Sunrise made it hard to see the launch farther afield. The field of visibility stretched from New England to the Carolinas. A launch attempt on Saturday was nixed after a plane strayed into the restricted airspace. Sundays try was almost foiled by a couple of boats that briefly wandered into the keep-out zone.

20 years of changing seasons on Earth packed into 2 minutes,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA captured 20 years of changing seasons in a striking new global map of the home planet. The data visualization, released this week, shows Earths fluctuations as seen from space. The polar ice caps and snow cover are shown ebbing and flowing with the seasons. The varying ocean shades of blue, green, red and purple depict the abundance  or lack  of undersea life. Its like watching the Earth breathe. Its really remarkable, said NASA oceanographer Jeremy Werdell, who took part in the project. Two decades  from September 1997 to this past September  are crunched into 2  minutes of viewing. Werdell finds the imagery mesmerizing. Its like all of my senses are being transported into space, and then you can compress time and rewind it, and just continually watch this kind of visualization, he said Friday. Werdell said the visualization shows spring coming earlier and autumn lasting longer in the Northern Hemisphere. Also noticeable to him is the Arctic ice caps receding over time  and, though less obvious, the Antarctic, too. On the sea side, Werdell was struck by this hugely productive bloom of biology that exploded in the Pacific along the equator from 1997 to 1998  when a water-warming El Nino merged into cooling La Nina. This algae bloom is evident by a line of bright green. In considerably smaller Lake Erie, more and more contaminating algae blooms are apparent  appearing red and yellow. 
        
     All this data can provide resources for policymakers as well as commercial fishermen and many others, according to Werdell. Programmer Alex Kekesi of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said it took three months to complete the visualization, using satellite imagery. Just like our Earth, the visualization will continually change, officials said, as computer systems improve, new remote-sensing satellites are launched and more observations are made.",https://apnews.com/20-years-of-changing-seasons-on-earth-packed-into-2%C2%BD-minutes-63b554ba6f6547c09be8d83d452d56e3,science
"Mars theory gets dusted: Streaks may be sand, not water","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A new study suggests that dark streaks on Mars represent flowing sand  not water. Mondays news throws cold water on 2015 research that indicated that lines on some Martian slopes were signs of water currently on the planet. Instead, Arizona scientists report in Nature Geoscience that these lines appear more like dry, steep flows of sand, rather than water trickling downhill, at or near the surface. If water is present, they said, its likely a small amount  and not conducive to life. NASA, though, said the jury is still out. The lead scientist for NASAs Mars exploration program, Michael Meyer, points out that the latest study does not rule out the presence of water. But he acknowledges, It just may not be as exciting as the idea of rivers going down the sides of cliffs. NASAs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provided the images of these so-called recurring slope lineae, or RSL. Thousands have been spotted on Mars, from the equator midway to each pole. The team led by the U.S. Geological Surveys Colin Dundas in Flagstaff, Arizona, measured 151 of these dark lines at 10 sites. Most of them end with slopes between 28 degrees and 35 degrees, a match for active sand dunes on both Mars and Earth, according to the researchers. A thin layer of dust on top that shifts and sometimes brightens the surface might help explain why these streaks seem to occur in the Martian summertime and then disappear, only to reappear the next year. If these lines are dry, this suggests that recent Mars has not had considerable volumes of liquid water, the researchers write. 
        
     Thats key because water in liquid form would be essential to microbial life. Dundas and his colleagues stress that many questions remain, demanding further study. To Meyer, this is what makes Mars so fun. Scientists have long gone back and forth thinking of Mars as being dry or wet depending on the most recent data. I still think that Mars poses a great potential for having had life early on in its history, Meyer said. As long as thats true, we also have a reasonable possibility of life still being on Mars. It just happens to be cryptic or well hidden.  NASA currently has no rover  either at Mars or in development  capable of climbing such steep slopes. That has engineers coming up with ideas like Martian helicopters or drones. But going from a clever idea that works in your sandbox to something that goes to Mars takes a fair amount of engineering development, Meyer said.",https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-6bbe6c0c6de943b99b2d307ac3964bb6,science

"NASA nails test on Voyager spacecraft, 13 billion miles away","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA has nailed an engine test on a spacecraft 13 billion miles away. Last week, ground controllers sent commands to fire backup thrusters on Voyager 1, our most distant spacecraft. The thrusters had been idle for 37 years, since Voyager 1 flew past Saturn. To NASAs delight, the four dormant thrusters came alive. It took more than 19 hours  the one-way travel time for signals  for controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to get the good news. Engineers wanted to see if these alternate thrusters could point Voyager 1s antenna toward Earth, a job normally handled by a different set thats now degrading. The thrusters will take over pointing operations next month. The switch could extend Voyager 1s life by two to three years. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 is the only spacecraft traveling through interstellar space, the region beyond our solar system. Voyager 2 is close on its heels  nearly 11 billion miles from Earth. The thruster test worked so well that NASA expects to try it on Voyager 2. That wont happen anytime soon, though, because Voyager 2s original thrusters are still working fine. The Voyager flight team dug up old records and studied the original software before tackling the test. As each milestone in the test was achieved, the excitement level grew, said propulsion engineer Todd Barber. The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all, he said in a statement. The twin Voyagers provided stunning close-up views of Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 also offered shots of Uranus and Neptune.",https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-a9cc6be4b2984390925d80ba6c875600,science
"SpaceX launching recycled rocket, supply capsule for NASA","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Space Age hand-me-downs are soaring to a whole new level. On Tuesday, SpaceX plans to launch its first recycled rocket for NASA. The unmanned Falcon 9  last used in June  will carry up a Dragon capsule thats also flown on a previous space station supply run. NASAs International Space Station manager, Kirk Shireman, said the risk of launching a recycled rocket is about the same as for a brand new one. He expects to be just as anxious as he always is at every launch. Its still a dangerous business, he told reporters Monday. Although NASAs best rocket experts conducted an extensive review of the recycled and meticulously inspected booster, there is never zero risk, he pointed out. The private SpaceX has launched recycled rockets three times before, on commercial satellite deliveries. And back in June, SpaceX launched a previously flown Dragon to the space station. This latest Dragon to fly  loaded with nearly 5,000 pounds of food, gear and experiments, and likely some Christmas presents  first flew in 2015. While the notion of reusable rockets is hardly new  NASAs now retired space shuttles reused main engines and booster segments  SpaceX is intent on driving down launch costs by salvaging its boosters and other components, and reflying them again and again. This is the beginning of rapid and reliable reusability, said Jessica Jensen, a SpaceX manager. We want to be able to send thousands of people into space, not just tens, and so reusability is a very key part of that, and were excited because tomorrow is just one step closer to that. 
        
     As before, the first-stage booster will attempt to land back at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This will be the first launch in more than a year from Launch Complex 40. The pad was ruined when a SpaceX rocket exploded during testing in September 2016. In a $50 million rebuild, SpaceX made the pad more robust, burying support equipment and fuel lines under concrete and steel. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacex-launching-recycled-rocket-supply-capsule-for-nasa-379565283a4e4317b54dad8ffa35643d,science
Mannequin Skywalker rides Blue Origins new crew capsule,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

An instrumented test dummy was aboard, named Mannequin Skywalker and dressed in a blue  naturally  flight suit. He had a great ride, Bezos said via Twitter. The New Shepard rocket, named after the first American in space, Alan Shepard, landed back on the ground following the 10-minute suborbital flight. The capsule reached a peak altitude of 99.39 kilometers above sea level or 61.7 miles, just shy of the 100-kilometer or 62.1-mile mark thats considered the start of true space.

"Eighth planet found in faraway solar system, matching ours","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A record-tying eighth planet has been found in a faraway solar system, matching our own in number. Even more amazing, machines and not humans made the discovery. NASA joined with Google on Thursday to announce the finding. This eighth planet orbits the star known as Kepler-90. Like Earth, this new planet, Kepler-90i, is the third rock from its sun. But its much closer to its sun  orbiting in just 14 days  and therefore a scorching 800 degrees Fahrenheit (427 Celsius) at the surface. In fact, all eight planets are scrunched up around this star, orbiting closer than Earth does to our sun. This is the only eight-planet solar system found like ours  so far  tying for the most planets observed around a single star. Our solar system had nine planets until Pluto was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union, a decision that still stands. Some astronomers, however, suspect there could be a large ninth planet out there: an elusive Planet X the size of Neptune but much farther out. The Kepler-90 system also could have a ninth planet or more, according to the researchers. It is 2,545 light-years away; a light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. Google used data collected by NASAs keen planet hunter, the Kepler Space Telescope, to develop the machine-learning computer program. It focuses on weak planetary signals  so feeble and numerous it would take humans ages to examine. 
        
     While machine learning has been used before in the search for exoplanets  planets beyond our solar system  its believed to be the first time an artificial neural network like this has been used to find a new world. This is a really exciting discovery, and we consider it to be a successful proof of concept to be using neural networks to identify planets, even in challenging situations where the signals are very weak, said Christopher Shallue, a senior software engineer at Google in Mountain View, California. NASA astrophysicist Jessie Dotson, the Kepler project scientist, is so excited to see where this goes next. Who knows what potential insights might be gained, she said. Shallue teamed up with astronomer Andrew Vanderburg of the University of Texas at Austin to develop the program. They essentially trained a computer to identify exoplanets based on Keplers observations in changing stellar brightness  the subtle, fleeting dip in a stars brightness when a planet passes in front of it. The two used a technique similar to what had been previously used by others to enable machines to distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs. Besides identifying Kepler-90i, the machine-learning program also confirmed an exoplanet missed by astronomers in yet another solar system: Kepler-80g, the sixth planet in that particular solar system. Shallue and Vanderburg plan to keep up the hunt, using the program to scour the 150,000-plus stars observed by Kepler. In all, more than 3,560 exoplanets have been confirmed to date  two-thirds of them spotted by the 2009-launched Kepler  with another approximately 4,500 candidates awaiting verification. It will be up to more advanced telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope targeted for launch in 2019, to study the atmospheres of these distant worlds and sniff out any traces of possible life, Vanderburg noted. Shallue said Google plans to release all the code needed for someone to join the exoplanet search, using a basic home computer and the publicly available Kepler data. No specialized hardware should be needed, he said. Neither NASA nor Google expect to put astronomers out of business. Shallue sees this as a tool to help astronomers have more impact and increase their productivity. It certainly will not replace them at all, he assured reporters. ___ Online: NASA: https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/eighth-planet-found-in-faraway-solar-system-matching-ours-8ae0b787b8d74cd69df8ae39da048577,science
SpaceX 1st: Recycled rocket soars with recycled capsule,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX racked up another first on Friday, launching a recycled rocket with a recycled capsule on a grocery run for NASA. The unmanned Falcon rocket blasted off with a just-in-time-for-Christmas delivery for the International Space Station, taking flight again after a six-month turnaround. On board was a Dragon supply ship, also a second-time flier. It was NASAs first use of a reused Falcon rocket and only the second of a previously flown Dragon. Within 10 minutes of liftoff, the first-stage booster was back at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, standing upright on the giant X at SpaceXs landing zone. Thats where it landed back in June following its first launch. Double sonic booms thundered across the area. At SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, cheers erupted outside the companys glassed-in Mission Control, where chief executive Elon Musk joined his employees. The Dragon reaches the space station Sunday. The capsule last visited the 250-mile-high outpost in 2015. This time, the capsule is hauling nearly 5,000 pounds of goods, including 40 mice for a muscle-wasting study, a first-of-its-kind impact sensor for measuring space debris as minuscule as a grain of sand and barley seeds for a germination experiment by Budweiser, already angling to serve the first beer on Mars. Ven Feng, a NASA manager, said he had a little sense of deja vu watching Fridays launch and landing of the same rocket he saw take off and return in June. 
        
     Quite an achievement, he said. For the past two years, the private SpaceX has been salvaging as much as possible from rockets following liftoff. Rather than letting first-stage boosters sink in the Atlantic, as other orbital rocket makers do, SpaceX flies them back to Cape Canaveral for vertical touchdowns or, when extra rocket power is needed to propel a satellite extra high, to a floating ocean platform. Reusability is the future for spaceflight, according to NASAs station program manager Kirk Shireman. The reality is, the business of space is dominated by launch costs ... so getting the costs down is important for everyone, Shireman said. NASA flew its first reused capsule back in June. But managers waited until SpaceX had three rocket reflights under its belt, before putting NASAs station equipment and experiments on a secondhand Falcon. After extensive reviews, the risk of flying a reused rocket, versus a brand new one, was judged to be pretty much equal, he said. Fridays booster recovery was the 20th for the company. Jessica Jensen, a SpaceX manager, said the company aims to reuse rockets  and capsules  far more than twice. The only way to get thousands of people into space  the ultimate goal of Musk  is by drastically cutting launch costs, she said. This was the first launch from the SpaceX-rented Complex 40 in more than a year. The last time a Falcon rocket stood at the pad ready to fly, in September 2016, it blew up during a fueling drill. SpaceX spent $50 million rebuilding the pad. Fridays successful liftoff means SpaceX has now launched from all three of its pads  two in Florida and one in California  in the same year. This was a fantastic way to end the year for SpaceX East Coast launches, Jensen told reporters. The space station is down to three astronauts until Sundays launch of three more. The Dragon should arrive at the orbiting outpost a few hours after the fresh crew launches from Kazakhstan. Once back up to full capacity, the station will be home to three Americans, two Russians and one Japanese. SpaceX  one of two private shippers contracted by NASA  has been making station supply runs since 2012. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/spacex-1st-recycled-rocket-soars-with-recycled-capsule-46da60a945f14556a1079be46d6a8e83,science

An American, Russian and Japanese arrived at the orbiting lab Tuesday, two days after launching from Kazakhstan. They received special greetings from the new U.S. ambassador to Russia, who gathered with the astronauts families at Mission Control outside Moscow to watch the new crews entrance. Ambassador Jon Huntsman told newly arrived NASA astronaut Scott Tingle that he got a tear in his eye, as he watched Tingles family when the hatches opened. It was the most special thing being here and feeling the emotion. Everyone is so proud of you, Huntsman told Tingle, a Navy captain and a space newcomer. Tingles three children radioed encouragement as well. Hey, space suits you. Dig it, said daughter Amy. Tingle flew up in a Soyuz capsule with Russias Anton Shkaplerov, a space station resident for the third time, and Japans Norishige Kanai, a surgeon making his first spaceflight.

SpaceX unveils new Falcon Heavy rocket before January launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX unveiled its new Falcon Heavy rocket on Wednesday, a month before its first launch. Photos posted by SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk show the new rocket inside its Florida hangar. Missing is the cargo for the January test flight. Musk has said the Falcon Heavy will launch his own cherry-red Tesla Roadster into space. First, SpaceX will test-fire the rockets 27 engines at the pad; the company is aiming to do that by the end of the month. The launch is planned for a few weeks after the test. Falcon Heavy is essentially the companys Falcon 9 times three. It features three Falcon 9 first-stage boosters joined together with a second-stage on the middle one. It also has three times more engines. The Falcon 9 is now used to hoist satellites and supplies to the International Space Station. The Heavy is intended for super-big satellites, as well as cargo destined for points far beyond, like Mars. Musk has repeatedly warned theres a good chance the new rocket could blow up, thus his own personal property will be aboard. He heads up the Tesla electric car company, as well as SpaceX and several other companies. If all goes as planned, Musks Roadster will wind up in a long, elliptical orbit around the sun, stretching as far out as the orbit of Mars. He laid out the jaw-dropping plan in a series of tweets earlier this month. Last week, a SpaceX manager said the company will meet all necessary government requirements. 
        
     I love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future, Musk wrote. The Falcon Heavy will be minus its featured load for the test. Thats been customary ever since a Falcon 9 exploded during a 2016 practice engine firing, destroying both rocket and satellite. The Falcon Heavy will have double the thrust of the next biggest rocket out there today, according to Musk. Guaranteed to be exciting, one way or another, he promised.  SpaceX advertises that the Falcon Heavy will be able to lift 140,660 pounds of cargo to low-Earth orbit, 37,040 pounds to Mars, and 7,720 pounds to Pluto. NASAs Saturn V moon rocket, used during the late 1960s and early 1970s, will still top the charts. But none of it was reusable. NASA introduced reusability with its space shuttles in 1981, reflying the orbiters as well as booster segments and main engines until their retirement in 2011. SpaceX has paved the way for rocket reusability on the commercial side of orbital flight. Two of the Heavys three first-stage boosters have flown before. After blasting off from NASAs historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, all three will attempt vertical landings, two on land and one on a floating offshore platform. SpaceX is working on an even bigger rocket that would replace the Falcon line. NASA is also working on a megarocket, the Space Launch System or SLS.

SpaceX launches secret satellite Zuma on 1st flight of year,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX has launched a secret satellite codenamed Zuma on its first flight of the new year. The unmanned Falcon rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sunday night, carrying the satellite toward an undisclosed orbit. SpaceX ended launch commentary five minutes into the flight, due to the classified nature of the U.S. satellite. But the company continued to broadcast the return of the first-stage booster to Cape Canaveral, where it landed upright as part of a recycling effort. Northrop Grumman provided the satellite, for which government agency it wouldnt say. The name Zuma refers to a Southern California beach. Last year was a banner year for SpaceX , with 18 launches.

"Astronauts ace stations 200th spacewalk, shortened by leak","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An equipment water leak shortened Fridays spacewalk by two U.S. astronauts at the International Space Station, but they still managed to replace a faulty electronics box. Despite the initial trouble, it was a milestone moment as Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer floated outside on the stations 200th spacewalk. The astronauts wasted no time removing the old electronics box, their No. 1 chore, and plugging in a new unit. The device  a bit unwieldy at more than 5 feet long  supplies electricity and data to science experiments on the outside of the station. The pair also whipped through other tasks, leaving only two undone. During earlier preparations, a small amount of water leaked from the connection point between an umbilical hose and Fischers suit. The hose is one of two that provide water, oxygen, power, cooling and communications for astronauts before they float outside. The leaky hose had to be disconnected before the spacewalk could begin. The astronauts ended up sharing Whitsons hose while they waited, which reduced their suit battery power. As a result, Mission Control cut the spacewalk from the intended 6  hours to four hours even before it began. The change-out went so well and fast 250 miles up that the spacewalkers had time to squeeze in a few other chores including the addition of a special data connector to the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. 
        
     Launched in 2011 on the next-to-last shuttle flight, the high-profile particle physics detector known as AMS is still working and has measured 100 billion particles. But its in need of repairs because of failing coolant pumps; Fridays work on a bypass route for data should help future efforts. In the end, Whitson and Fischer accomplished everything but the installation of a high-definition TV camera and wireless communication antennas. As the spacewalk drew to a close, Whitson  the worlds most experienced female astronaut  said it was amazing to have taken part in the landmark spacewalk. Fischer agreed, saying he was humbled to follow in the legacy. Today threw us a lot of curve balls, Mission Control said, but noted the astronauts hit a grand slam. This spacewalk was supposed to take place in early April, but was put on hold because of delays in launching the replacement box and spectrometer equipment. The parts finally arrived late last month aboard Orbital ATKs commercial cargo ship, the S.S. John Glenn, named after the first American to orbit Earth. It was the first spacewalk for Fischer, who arrived at the station less than a month ago. Whitson has performed more spacewalks than any other woman. This was her ninth. Shes also spent more time in space than any other American, 552 days over three missions and counting. She doesnt return to Earth until September. Mission Control stressed throughout the day that Fischers suit was fine and that the leak was confined to the umbilical hose. Spare parts are on board to restore the system. NASA is especially wary of leaks involving spacesuits. In 2013, an Italian astronaut almost drowned during a spacewalk when water from the suits cooling system flooded his helmet. Astronauts kicked off space station construction in orbit in 1998. The 200 mark includes assembly and maintenance by Russian spacewalkers as well as U.S.",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-ab26a7e0608e407b9890dad396ac8c5a,science
SpaceX launches top-secret spy satellite for US government,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched a top-secret spy satellite for the U.S. government Monday morning and then successfully landed the booster for recycling. The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from its NASA-leased pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It was SpaceXs first mission for the National Reconnaissance Office. No details were divulged about the newly launched NRO satellite. Instead, SpaceX focused its webcast on the successful touchdown of the first-stage booster. The leftover booster  its job done  landed next door at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station several minutes after liftoff. Sonic booms rattled the area, serving as a Monday morning wake-up call. Across the country, cheers erupted at SpaceX Mission Control at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX strives to return most of its boosters for reuse. The companys first recycled rocket flew last month. This was the fourth SpaceX booster landing at Cape Canaveral; even more have landed on ocean platforms. SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk said via Twitter that both the launch and landing were good. But the upper-level wind at liftoff was unusually high. Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6 percent of the theoretical load limit, he said in a tweet. Earlier in the morning, he noted about the wind, Worrying, but not a showstopper. Sundays launch attempt was foiled at the last minute by a bad sensor. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacex-launches-top-secret-spy-satellite-for-us-government-1e204d83f7cd4fd2a877108db9264d4f,science
NASA nixes crew for test flight of new megarocket in 2019,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs new megarocket will launch without astronauts on its test flight, now delayed until 2019 because of technical challenges, the space agencys top leaders said Friday. In February at the request of the White House, NASA began studying the possibility of putting a crew on the first flight. After reviewing the costs and risks, the space agency decided against it. The White House took part in the decision, said NASAs Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot. Still in development, the super-sized Space Launch System rocket is meant to eventually send astronauts to Mars. The first launch had been targeted for next year, but now wont happen until 2019 when NASA will send an unoccupied Orion capsule to the vicinity of the moon for a three-week trial run. The second flight will have astronauts on board. It is scheduled for 2021, but will almost certainly be later because of all the delays with the first flight. It would have cost a lot more money and time to add life-support systems and other human-required equipment for the test flight, said Bill Gerstenmaier, head of NASAs human explorations and operations. The best plan we have is actually the plan were on right now, he said. The test flight can be more dynamic, as NASA calls it, without a crew, and the lessons learned can help advance the next mission when people finally are on board. 
        
     Lightfoot said it would have been technically feasible to add a crew, given more funding, but decided to stay the course. It would have cost an extra $600 million to $900 million to outfit the system for astronauts on the initial flight, Gerstenmaier said. Earlier this week, NASA reported that a section of test hardware was damaged during manufacturing in New Orleans. No one was injured in the May 3 mishap. Technicians were lowering the dome for the bottom of a liquid oxygen tank, when the dome ended up ramming into a support structure. NASA is investigating. Gerstenmaier called it an unfortunate event but said it shouldnt affect the schedule much. Late last month, the U.S. Government Accountability Office warned that a delay was likely for the first SLS flight, crew or not. The current exploration effort will cost nearly $24 billion by the end of fiscal 2018, the GAO reported. Lightfoot acknowledged that he and others are frustrated by the technical challenges that have slowed down the program. The agency is aiming for a sustainable program within the available resources, he said, not just a single-objective mission. The Apollo moon program of the 1960s and early 1970s represented a sprint to a single destination, Gerstenmaier noted. The SLS rocket is meant to support flights to not only the moon and Mars, but the moons of Mars and even farther into the solar system, with potential commercial activity as well. The megarocket represents a robust foundation for ultimately moving human presence out into the solar system, Gerstenmaier said. Thats a grander vision in a way than just moving people to the moon for the first time, although that was a very special moment and a very special challenge for those teams moving forward. But were building off of that legacy now to move in a more sustained manner, he said. Earlier this year, SpaceX announced a bold mission to send two paying passengers on a flight around the moon in 2018. SpaceX chief Elon Musk also aims to colonize Mars. Ive been saying it for a while. This is an and proposition, this is not an or, Lightfoot said. If you look at what were trying to do, its going to take really all of us, frankly, to get this done.",https://apnews.com/nasa-nixes-crew-for-test-flight-of-new-megarocket-in-2019-f49ba206fc5c4fd1a45e178dc0d33f8d,science
NASA orders up urgent spacewalking repairs at space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA has ordered up urgent spacewalking repairs at the International Space Station. On Tuesday, two astronauts will venture out to replace a data relay box that broke over the weekend. The job falls to the two Americans on board: commander Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer. The failed unit was installed not quite two months ago. It is one of two that control the stations radiators and solar panels, among other critical systems. NASA said everything is still safe in orbit because one relay box is still working, and no operations have been affected. But officials want the bad one quickly replaced, in case the good one also goes down. Astronauts performed a similar spacewalk in 2014. This so-called multiplexer-demultiplexer unit, or MDM, failed Saturday for unknown reasons. It was a refurbished device  containing upgraded software  and was installed at the end of March by Whitson and another astronaut. Station managers decided Sunday to do a spacewalk Tuesday morning to replace it with an on-board spare. The spacewalk should last just two hours. Whitson and Fischer went spacewalking 1 weeks ago. That excursion was cut short because of a leaky umbilical hose inside the space station. If Tuesdays replacement work goes well, Fischer also will hook up wireless communications antennas outside the orbiting lab, a job left undone during the May 12 spacewalk. Six months into a 9 1/2-month mission, Whitson already holds multiple space records, including most accumulated time in space by an American and most spacewalks by a woman. This will be her 10th spacewalk and tie the record for most spacewalks by a U.S. astronaut. Fischer arrived at the space station last month. Also on board are two men from Russia and one from France. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-685b969af03d41258aec37b70b3113aa,science
"After 9 months in space, mouse sperm yield healthy mice","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  After nine months in space, mouse sperm has yielded healthy mice, Japanese scientists reported Monday. The freeze-dried sperm samples were launched in 2013 to the International Space Station and returned to Earth in 2014. The intense radiation of space caused slight DNA damage to the sperm. Yet, after in vitro fertilization on the ground, healthy offspring resulted. The baby mice grew into adults with normal fertility of their own. The researchers  led by Sayaka Wakayama of the University of Yamanashi  said its a step toward reproducing other mammals, even humans, using space-preserved sperm. They envision missions lasting several years or multiple generations, during which assisted reproductive technology might be used for domestic animals and people, too. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Previous developmental studies in space have involved, among other things, fish and amphibians. Mammals are more difficult to maintain and handle in space, and so testing, by comparison, has been limited. More extensive testing on sperm preservation is needed in space, according to the researchers. Besides looking ahead to long-term space crews and societies, the researchers see other reasons for saving sperm in space, including in the event of disasters on Earth. The moon would be ideal for underground sperm storage, they noted, in particular lunar lava tubes because of their very low temperatures, protection from space radiation by thick bedrock layers, and complete isolation from any disasters on Earth. ___ Online: http://nasonline.org/publications/pnas/",https://apnews.com/after-9-months-in-space-mouse-sperm-yield-healthy-mice-a770d0cfaaea4897a08bba2f9b281026,science
Spacewalking astronauts pull off urgent station repairs,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts completed urgent repairs at the International Space Station on Tuesday, replacing equipment that failed three days earlier and restoring a backup for a vital data-relay system. It took commander Peggy Whitson much longer than expected to install the spare unit. Success finally came after her spacewalking partner, Jack Fischer, blasted the area with nitrogen gas to clear away flecks of metal. Mission Control noted that the failure occurred only 2 days, 21 hours, 38 minutes earlier, and we are already back in a good position, so excellent work.  Testing confirmed the new unit worked, restoring full redundancy to the system that operates the space stations solar panels, radiators and robotic equipment. Very good. We are really happy about that, Whitson said. Tuesdays spacewalk lasted less than three hours  exceedingly short by NASA standards. Whitson has now tied the record for most spacewalks by an American  10  and moved up to third place on the all-time spacewalking list. The failed data-relay unit  recently refurbished with upgraded software  was just installed in March. Even though a second unit worked just fine after Saturdays breakdown, NASA scrambled to put together a spacewalk so there would be a backup in case that second unit failed, too, crippling the system for station cooling and solar energy production. Whitson had no trouble removing the broken unit. But it took her two tries to install the replacement. 
        
     During the first attempt, Whitson discovered what appeared to be metal shavings in the holes for the bolts. Fischer used a cleaning tool  essentially a nitrogen gas blaster  and blew away debris from the three holes. I think all three look clean as a whistle, he reported before Whitson bolted down the spare box. The data-relay boxes are officially known as MDMs or multiplexer-demultiplexers. Theyre compact: Each one weighs 50 pounds (22 kilograms) and measures 14 by 8 by 13 inches (35-20-33 centimeters.) Whitson and Fischer were just out spacewalking on May 12. That excursion was cut short by leaking station equipment, leaving two antenna installations undone. So Fischer completed the chore Tuesday. It was only the second spacewalk for Fischer, a rookie astronaut who arrived at the orbiting lab last month. He marveled at the world 250 miles (400 kilometers) below as he worked, commenting, Oh my gosh, its so beautiful. Whats more awesome than being on @Space_Station? Getting a call from mission control 4 another spacewalk! Dancing w/ the cosmos, he said in a tweet before going out. Whitson, the worlds most experienced female astronaut, is more than halfway through an extended 9 -month mission, her third spaceflight. Shes spent more time off the planet than any other American and, at age 57, is the oldest woman to ever fly in space. Tuesdays excursion gave her 60 hours out in the vacuum, behind only Russias Anatoly Solovyev, with 78 hours over 16 spacewalks, and fellow American 10-time spacewalker Michael Lopez-Alegria, with more than 67 hours over 10 trips. The space station also is home to two Russians and a Frenchman. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-a60468fa724849588c0c0b05fee14809,science
NASA spacecraft will aim straight for sun next year,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft will aim straight for the sun next year and bear the name of the astrophysicist who predicted the existence of the solar wind nearly 60 years ago. The space agency announced Wednesday that the red-hot mission would be named after Eugene Parker, professor emeritus at the University of Chicago. Its the first NASA spacecraft to be named after a researcher who is still alive, noted the agencys science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen. Scheduled to launch next summer from Cape Canaveral, the Parker Solar Probe will fly within 4 million miles of the suns surface  right into the solar atmosphere. That will be considerably closer than any other spacecraft, and subject the probe to brutal heat and radiation like no other man-made structure before. The materials werent available until now to undertake such a grueling mission. The purpose is to study the suns outer atmosphere and better understand how stars like ours work. NASA spacecraft have traveled inside the orbit of Mercury, the innermost planet. But until you actually go there and touch the sun, you really cant answer these questions, like why is the corona  the outer plasma-loaded atmosphere  hotter than the actual surface of the sun, said mission project scientist Nicola Fox of Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory. Parker Solar Probe  formerly known as Solar Probe Plus  will venture seven times closer than any previous spacecraft, Fox said. 
        
     The announcement came during a University of Chicago ceremony honoring Parker, who turns 90 on June 10. Parker called it a heroic scientific space mission, referring to the temperatures and solar radiation to be endured by the spacecraft, and the extreme safeguards taken. The probe will be ready to do battle with the solar elements as it divulges the secrets of the expanding corona, he said. While 4 million miles may not sound that close, it is by solar standards, according to Fox. She urged the crowd to remember while viewing the total solar eclipse this August to remember that the spacecraft eventually will be right in there amid the hazy corona surrounding the sun. Parker Solar Probe will travel at a blistering speed of 430,000 mph (692,000 kph) and zip in and out of a region where the mercury hits 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius). Solar probe is going to be the hottest, fastest mission. I like to call it the coolest, hottest mission under the sun, Fox said. The spacecraft will carry a chip containing photos of Parker as well as a copy of his ground-breaking research paper from 1958. Parkers prediction of solar wind  the intense flow of charged particles or plasma from the sun  initially was met with skepticism and even ridicule. But it was confirmed a few years later by observations from NASAs Mariner 2 spacecraft. Until then, scientists believed the space between planets was merely vacuum, rather than part of the encompassing heliosphere it proved to be. ___ Online: University of Chicago: http://www.uchicago.edu/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/parker-solar-probe",https://apnews.com/nasa-spacecraft-will-aim-straight-for-sun-next-year-8ecdfa76079945d1bfc83013bdd6fb98,science
SpaceX taking recycling all the way to orbit with cargo ship,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX is taking recycling to a whole new realm  all the way to orbit. On this weeks supply run to the International Space Station, SpaceX will launch a Dragon capsule thats already traveled there. The milestone comes just two months after the launch of its first reused rocket booster for a satellite. This whole notion of reuse is something thats very, very important to the entire space industry, NASAs space station program manager Kirk Shireman said at a news conference Wednesday. While the concept is not new  the space shuttles, for instance, flew multiple times in orbit  its important for saving money as well as technical reasons, he noted. This particular Dragon flew to the station in 2014. SpaceX refurbished it for Thursday evenings planned launch, providing a new heat shield and fresh parachutes for re-entry at missions end. There were so many X-rays and inspections that savings, if any, were minimal this time, said Hans Koenigsmann, vice president of flight reliability for SpaceX. The vast majority of this Dragon has already been to space, including the hull, thrusters and tanks. Its packed with 6,000 pounds of station cargo, including mice and flies for medical research. While this Falcon booster is new, SpaceX will attempt to land it at Cape Canaveral following liftoff so it, too, can be reused. So far, first-stage boosters have flown back and landed vertically four times on the designated X at the Air Force station; even more touchdowns have occurred on ocean platforms, all part of an effort to save time and money. 
        
     The private SpaceX and NASA are discussing the possibility of flying a reused booster on an upcoming delivery mission. Koenigsmann told reporters more and more reused capsules will carry cargo to the space station, each possibly flying three times. Dragon capsules are being developed to carry astronauts to the space station as early as next year; its too soon to say whether those, too, will be recycled, he said. Wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the return of the first Dragon capsule to visit the space station. This will be the 12th Dragon visit overall and the 11th under NASA contract. The Dragon is the only unmanned supply ship that returns to Earth; the others are filled with trash and burn up on re-entry. And by SpaceXs count, this will be the 100th launch from NASAs historic Launch Complex 39-A at Kennedy Space Center. Its the same exact spot from which men flew to the moon and shuttles soared until their retirement in 2011. SpaceX is leasing the pad from NASA. Fairly good weather is forecast for the 5:55 p.m. liftoff. Two of the space stations five residents, meanwhile, are scheduled to return to Earth on Friday via a Russian Soyuz capsule. A Russian and Frenchman will be headed home, leaving two Americans and one Russian in orbit. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-9b17d1876ece4f7b947c757e942bdba5,science

Space station welcomes 1st returning vehicle since shuttle,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station welcomed its first returning vehicle in years Monday  a SpaceX Dragon capsule making its second delivery. Space shuttle Atlantis was the last repeat visitor six years ago. Its now a museum relic at NASAs Kennedy Space Center. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer noted the special significance of SpaceXs recycling effort as soon as he caught the Dragon supply ship with the stations big robot arm. Thats right, its flying its second mission, Fischer said. We have a new generation of vehicles now led by commercial partners like SpaceX. SpaceX is working to reuse as many parts of its rockets and spacecraft as possible to slash launch costs. The California-based company launched its first recycled booster with a satellite in March; another will fly in a few weeks. The Dragon pulled up two days after launching from Florida. This same capsule dropped off a shipment in 2014. SpaceX refurbished it for an unprecedented second trip, keeping the hull, thrusters and most other parts but replacing the heat shield and parachutes. Until their retirement in 2011, NASAs shuttles made multiple flights to the space station. This new 6,000-pound shipment includes live lab animals: 40 mice, 400 adult fruit flies and 2,000 fruit fly eggs that should hatch any day. The mice are part of a bone loss study, while the flies are flying so researchers can study their hearts in weightlessness. Even more than mice and rats, the hearts of fruit flies are similar in many ways to the human heart, beating at about the same rate, for instance. 
        
     Some of these animals will return to Earth aboard the Dragon in about a month. SpaceX officials anticipate using Dragon capsules as many as three times. Its starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good.

Musk said the latest touchdown was pretty much dead center at the SpaceX landing zone at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Liftoff occurred next door at Kennedy Space Center. The Dragon is the only station supply ship capable of returning items, like science samples. On Sunday, an Orbital ATK cargo ship named in honor of the late John Glenn departed the station. It will remain in orbit a week before burning up in the atmosphere upon re-entry. Glenn, the first American to orbit the world, died in December at age 95. Godspeed & fair winds S.S.

SpaceX chief says 1st launch of big new rocket will be risky,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs chief said Wednesday that the first launch of its big new rocket is risky and stands a real good chance of failure. Founder Elon Musk told a space station research conference Wednesday that he wants to set realistic expectations for the flight later this year from Cape Canaveral. The Falcon Heavy will have three boosters instead of one, and 27 engines instead of nine, all of which must ignite simultaneously. No one will be aboard the initial flights. When it comes time to add people, Musk said, no question, whoevers on the first flight, brave. SpaceX plans to fly two paying customers to the moon late next year, using a Falcon Heavy. While the moon may not be in Musks personal travel plans, he said in response to a question that hed like to ride one of his smaller Falcon rockets to the International Space Station in maybe three or four years. SpaceX plans to start ferrying NASA astronauts to the orbiting outpost, using Falcon 9 rockets and enhanced Dragon capsules, by the middle of next year. SpaceX now uses the Dragon capsule to deliver supplies to the space station. All right, well put you on the manifest, said NASAs space station program manager Kirk Shireman. Speaking for over an hour at the Washington conference, Musk encouraged people to go to Cape Canaveral for the Falcon Heavy launch. Its guaranteed to be exciting, he promised, getting a big laugh. 
        
     Theres a lot of risk associated with Falcon Heavy, real good chance that that vehicle does not make it to orbit, he said. Major pucker factor, really, is like the only way to describe it. Building the Falcon Heavy has proven harder than SpaceX envisioned, according to Musk. But it will be capable of lifting more than double the amount of payload into orbit than the current Falcon 9, and also hoisting a SpaceX Dragon capsule into a loop around the moon. As for Mars, Musk said he favored friendly competition for getting astronauts to the red planet. NASA for years has supported an international effort. Musk said it would be better to have at least two or three-country coalitions striving to get there first and making the most progress. He praised the model used by NASA in the commercial crew program, in which both SpaceX and Boeing are developing capsules for flying space station astronauts. Americans have not launched from home soil since the last shuttle flight in 2011, instead forced to use Russian rockets. The crew Dragons will parachute into the ocean just like the cargo Dragons; land landings were scrapped because of the work needed to make everything safe. Musk said hes updated his long-term plan for colonizing Mars to make it more economically feasible. The vehicles will be smaller, although still big. He promised to share his evolving ideas at a September conference in Australia. Going to Mars is not for the faint of heart, Musk stressed. Its risky, dangerous, uncomfortable and you might die. Now do you want to go? For a lot of people, the answer is going to be hell no, and for some, its going to be hell yes. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacex-chief-says-1st-launch-of-big-new-rocket-will-be-risky-4cfb43b21a5842e09079219a06dd069b,science
NASA delays satellite launch to replace damaged antenna,"CAPE CANVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA has delayed the launch of a major communications satellite by more than two weeks to replace a damaged antenna. One of the antennas on the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite ended up broken earlier this month during final launch preps. Liftoff is now targeted for Aug. 20 from Cape Canaveral, Florida aboard an Atlas V rocket. Satellite maker Boeing was preparing the satellite for an early August launch when the accident occurred. Boeing said late Wednesday that its investigating the mishap, along with NASA. Engineers are also looking into a potential, unrelated problem with ground equipment.

Whats a total solar eclipse and why this one is so unusual,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Total solar eclipses occur every year or two or three, often in the middle of nowhere like the South Pacific or Antarctic. What makes the Aug. 21 eclipse so special is that it will cut diagonally across the entire United States. The path of totality  where day briefly becomes night  will pass over Oregon, continuing through the heartland all the way to Charleston, South Carolina. Those on the outskirts  well into Canada, Central America and even the top of South America  will be treated to a partial eclipse. The last time a total solar eclipse swept the whole width of the U.S. was in 1918. No tickets are required for this Monday show, just special eclipse glasses so you dont ruin your eyes. Some eclipse tidbits : WHATS A TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE? When the moon passes between Earth and the sun, and scores a bulls-eye by completely blotting out the sunlight, thats a total solar eclipse . The moon casts a shadow on our planet. Dead center is where sky gazers get the full treatment. In this case, the total eclipse will last up to 2 minutes and 40-plus seconds in places. A partial eclipse will be visible along the periphery. Clouds could always spoil the view, so eclipse watchers need to be ready to split for somewhere with clear skies, if necessary. WHATS THE PATH ON AUG. 21? The path of totality will begin near Lincoln City, Oregon, as the lunar shadow makes its way into the U.S. This path will be 60 to 70 miles wide (97 to 113 kilometers); the closer to the center, the longer the darkness. Totality will cross from Oregon into Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and, finally, South Carolina. It will also pass over tiny slivers of Montana and Iowa. The eclipse will last longest near Carbondale, Illinois: two minutes and 44 seconds. The biggest cities in the path include Nashville; Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina; Salem, Oregon; Casper, Wyoming; and just partially within, St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri. 
        
     LAST TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSES IN U.S.? Hawaii experienced a total solar eclipse in 1991. But the U.S. mainland hasnt seen a total solar eclipse since 1979, when it swooped across Oregon, Washington state, Idaho, Montana and North Dakota, then into Canada. Before that, in 1970, a total solar eclipse skirted the Atlantic coastline from Florida to Virginia. Totality  or total darkness  exceeded three minutes in 1970, longer than the one coming up. The countrys last total solar eclipse stretching from coast to coast, on June 8, 1918 , came in over Oregon and Washington, and made a beeline for Florida. WHENS THE NEXT ONE? If you miss the Aug. 21 eclipse  or get bitten by the eclipse bug  youll have to wait seven years to see another one in the continental U.S. The very next total solar eclipse will be in 2019 , but youll have to be below the equator for a glimpse. Were talking the South Pacific, and Chile and Argentina. Its pretty much the same in 2020. For the U.S., the next total solar eclipse will occur on April 8, 2024 . The line of totality will cross from Texas, up through the Midwest, almost directly over Indianapolis, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York, up over New England and out over Maine and New Brunswick, Canada.",https://apnews.com/whats-a-total-solar-eclipse-and-why-this-one-is-so-unusual-c77ba44324c84a6caf7a048ebc4a3111,science

Astronomers are projecting a slightly higher than normal rate of 150 meteors per hour across North America. But the bright moon will wash out the finer Perseids. So the viewing rate will be more like 30 to 40 meteors an hour. Peak viewing will be Friday night, early Saturday, Saturday night and early Sunday. The real cosmic show will be the total solar eclipse  the first to cross the U.S. coast to coast in 99 years. NASAs meteor expert, Bill Cooke, says the Perseids can be the warm-up act.

"Christmas delivery at space station, courtesy of Japan","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Christmas gifts arrived at the International Space Station on Tuesday, courtesy of Japan. A Japanese cargo ship pulled up at the orbiting lab four days after launching. The capsule  called Kounotori, or white stork  contains nearly 5 tons of food, water, batteries and other supplies. NASA said there also are Christmas presents for the two Americans, three Russians and one Frenchman on board. Commander Shane Kimbrough, an American, and Frances Thomas Pesquet used the robot arm to grab the capsule 250 miles above Chile. Flight controllers in Japan and Houston applauded  and some of the Japanese even bowed. Kimbrough said the crew was really excited to accept delivery and radioed thanks to all. The vehicle is beautiful, and it performed flawlessly, he said. Barely two weeks ago, a Russian supply ship was destroyed shortly after liftoff. At the same time, one of NASAs main suppliers, SpaceX, is grounded. So the Japanese delivery is especially welcome. The astronauts need the six new lithium-ion batteries for next months spacewalks. They will replace the old nickel-hydrogen batteries that store energy generated by the stations big solar panels. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-3198c776d50a4491b0688554f4512e47,science
NASA launches 8 mini-satellites for hurricane forecasting,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA launched eight mini-satellites Thursday morning to measure surface wind deep in the heart of hurricanes. The plane carrying the satellites took off shortly after sunrise Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. An hour later, the co-pilot pushed the button that released the Pegasus rocket and attached satellites from the belly of the plane, 39,000 feet above the Atlantic and 100 miles east of Daytona Beach. The Pegasus fired five seconds later, propelling the satellites into an orbit more than 300 miles high. The satellites successfully peeled away from the rockets upper stage two at a time, at half-minute intervals, generating applause in Launch Control. The $157 million Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System, or CYGNSS, is meant to improve hurricane forecasting. The satellites have GPS navigation receivers to frequently measure the surface roughness of oceans, enabling scientists to calculate wind speed and storm intensity. Unlike weather satellites already in orbit, these spacecraft can peer through rain swirling in a hurricane, all the way into the eye, or core. It looked beautiful, NASA launch manager Tim Dunn said. Were very excited. Each spacecraft is just 64 pounds, with a 5-foot wingspan. The University of Michigans Christopher Ruf, the principal researcher, said the satellites will undergo a few months of testing and should start churning out full-fledged science data in the spring for NASA and the National Weather Service. Scientists want the satellites up and running before the start of hurricane season on June 1. 
        
     NASA opted for an air launch by aerospace company Orbital ATK, versus a traditional rocket liftoff from the ground, to cut costs. The first launch attempt, on Monday, was foiled by a tripped circuit breaker on the plane that prevented the satellite-release system from working. Then on Wednesday, a spacecraft software issue forced another delay. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/cygnss/",https://apnews.com/nasa-launches-8-mini-satellites-for-hurricane-forecasting-7238b1d0f23e498f923bd8ad4fcdcf5e,science
Spacewalking astronauts upgrade station with new batteries,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts hooked up fancy new batteries Friday on the International Space Stations sprawling power grid. NASA reported that all three lithium-ion batteries were up and running, a successful start to the space agencys long-term effort to upgrade the aging solar power system. Before venturing out, Commander Shane Kimbrough and Peggy Whitson got a hand from a robot that took care of most of the grunt work  Dextre, a hulking machine with 11-foot arms. Remotely operating Dextre outside the 250-mile-high lab, flight controllers in Houston spent the past week replacing decade-old, nickel-hydrogen batteries with the new ones. Handling all those batteries  each about half a refrigerator in size  was cumbersome and time-consuming. On Friday, it was up to Kimbrough and Whitson to wire up three of the six new batteries delivered last month in a Japanese cargo capsule. The two made fairly quick work of it. Im on a roll, right? Kimbrough asked Whitson halfway through the job. The two were so far ahead that they tackled some extra work. I look forward to doing it again, Kimbrough told Mission Control as the 6 -hour spacewalk drew to a close. Kimbrough and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet will plug in three more batteries next Friday. NASA expects it will take two to three years to change out all 48 nickel-hydrogen batteries that make up the stations solar power system. The lithium-ion batteries are so efficient that only 24 will be needed, saving space for other items during supply runs. 
        
     The batteries store power that is tapped whenever the orbiting outpost is on the nighttime side of Earth. Dextre, the stations robotic handyman, removed the old batteries and popped in the new ones in a series of maneuvers that began on New Years Eve. The robot also loosened bolts on metal attachment plates for the new batteries, saving the spacewalkers even more time. Starting Sunday, Dextre will be back at it, paving the way for next Fridays spacewalk. NASAs chief astronaut, Christopher Cassidy, said from Mission Control that sticky bolts often stymie astronauts, so everyone was grateful to turn over the chores to Dextre, short for dexterous. Spacewalks are high-risk activities, NASA managers noted, and so reducing crew time outside is always preferable. Almost as a reminder, Mission Controls main contact for the spacewalkers was Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, who nearly drowned in 2013 when his helmet flooded with water from his spacesuits cooling system. He directed Kimbrough and Whitsons every move, and praised them for an awesome job. Most of the old batteries will be junked along with other station trash in a month, burning up in the atmosphere along with the Japanese supply ship that delivered the new batteries. Whitson now ties the record for most spacewalks by a woman  seven. At 56, shes the worlds oldest and most experienced spacewoman. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/spacewalking-astronauts-upgrade-station-with-new-batteries-e8e94a8c641543cfa1f84fa271429d6f,science
Report: Our moon may have formed from multiple small ones,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A series of cosmic collisions may have spawned multiple moonlets that morphed into the one big moon we know today. Rather than one giant impact that knocked off part of early Earth and created the moon, a number of smaller collisions may have produced lots of mini-moons, Israeli scientists reported Monday And those mini-moons, over millions of years, may have clumped together to make one large one. The researchers conducted nearly 1,000 computer simulations and estimate about 20 impacts could do the job. They say that would explain why the moon seems to be composed of material from Earth, rather than some other planet, too. Its actually an old theory revitalized now by the Weizmann Institute of Sciences Raluca Rufu in Rehovot, Israel, and his team. Their findings were published in Nature Geoscience. Our model suggests that the ancient Earth once hosted a series of moons, each one formed from a different collision with the proto-Earth, said co-author Hagai Perets of the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. Rufu added in the same statement: Its likely that small moons formed through the process could cross orbits, collide and merge. Small collisions like this were common in the early solar system, and support their premise. But a London scientist not associated with the study  Imperial Colleges Gareth Collins  is urging more evidence on both sides of the moon-forming argument. 
        
     Some of the moonlets surely were lost in space or did not merge properly with what was to become todays moon, Collins said in a companion article, and so many more impacts may have been required. That, in turn, would make the multi-impact theory far less probable than any of the more exotic single-impact scenarios, he wrote. Rufu and his colleagues agree more work is needed to understand how moonlets might indeed merge into one final moon. ___ Online: Nature Geoscience: http://www.nature.com/ngeo/index.html",https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-5562f285e4464d439c7f686fb205b77b,science
Scientists: Moon over the hill at 4.51 billion years old,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  It turns out the moon is older than many scientists suspected: a ripe 4.51 billion years old. Thats the newest estimate, thanks to rocks and soil collected by the Apollo 14 moonwalkers in 1971. A research team reported Wednesday that the moon formed within 60 million years of the birth of the solar system. Previous estimates ranged within 100 million years, all the way out to 200 million years after the solar systems creation, not quite 4.6 billion years ago. The scientists conducted uranium-lead dating on fragments of the mineral zircon extracted from Apollo 14 lunar samples. The pieces of zircon were minuscule  no bigger than a grain of sand. Size doesnt matter, they record amazing information nonetheless! lead author Melanie Barboni of the University of California, Los Angeles, said in an email. She noted that the moon holds so much magic ... the key to understand how our beautiful Earth formed and evolved. The moon was created from debris knocked off from Earth, which itself is thought to be roughly 4.54 billion years old. Some of the eight zircon samples were used in a previous study, also conducted at UCLA, that utilized more limited techniques. Barboni said she is studying more zircons from Apollo 14 samples, but doesnt expect it to change her estimate of 4.51 billion years for the moons age, possibly 4.52 billion years at the most. It would be more a double-checking than anything else, she explained. She and her colleagues  whose work appeared Wednesday in the journal Science Advances  are eager to learn more about the moons history and, in turn, the evolution of early Earth and the entire solar system. 
        
     Apollo 14s Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell collected 92 pounds of rocks and used tubes to dig up soil while exploring the moons Fra Mauro highlands in February 1971. They conducted two spacewalks, spending nine hours altogether out on the lunar surface. Its the second major moon study this week. On Monday, Israeli scientists suggested our Earths constant companion may actually be a melting pot of many mini-moons. Rather than one giant impact that shaved off a chunk of Earth and formed the moon, a series of smaller collisions may have created multiple moonlets that eventually merged into one, according to the researchers. Barboni said regardless of how the moon came to be  one big strike at Earth, many smaller ones or even none at all  you still end up at the end solidifying the moon as we know it today. The giant impact theory holds that the resulting energy formed a lunar lava ocean that later became solid. Its this solidification age that Barboni and her team have now ascertained. We finally pinned down a minimum age for the moon formation, she said, regardless of how it formed. ___ Online: Journal: http://advances.sciencemag.org/",https://apnews.com/general-news-1875312b718a4b678ac160d0505ee09e,science
NASA displays Apollo capsule hatch 50 years after fatal fire,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A relic from Americas first space tragedy is finally going on display this week, 50 years after a fire on the launch pad killed three astronauts at the start of the Apollo moon program. The scorched Apollo 1 capsule remains locked away in storage. But NASA is offering visitors at Kennedy Space Center a look at the most symbolic part: the hatch that trapped Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee in their burning spacecraft on Jan. 27, 1967. A flash fire erupted inside the capsule during a countdown rehearsal, with the astronauts atop the rocket at Cape Canaverals Launch Complex 34. A cry came from inside: Got a fire in the cockpit! White struggled to open the hatch before quickly being overcome by smoke and fumes, along with his two crewmates. It was over for them in seconds. Investigators determined the most likely cause to be electrical arcing from defective wiring. With its moon program in jeopardy, NASA completely overhauled the Apollo spacecraft. The redesigned capsule  with a quick-release hatch  carried 24 men to the moon; 12 of them landed and walked on its surface. For the astronauts families, Apollo 1 is finally getting its due. The tragedy has long been overshadowed by the 1986 Challenger and 2003 Columbia accidents. Remnants of the lost shuttles have been on display at the visitor complex for 1  years. Im just so pleased that they finally decided to do something  visibly  to honor the three guys, said Chaffees widow, Martha. Its time that they show the three who died in the fire appreciation for the work that they did. 
        
     On Friday  the 50th anniversary  the crews families will help dedicate the new exhibit. For most of them, a private tour Wednesday marks the first time theyve seen any of the capsule. This is way, way, way long overdue. But were excited about it, said Scott Grissom, Gus older son. NASA was embarrassed about the fire and thats why they pretty much kept it in the closet as long as they have. Like the rest of America, NASA was in shock and simply did not want to talk about it, said Martha Chaffee. Exhibits at Kennedy and elsewhere would mention the fire but not highlight it. As the years and decades rolled by, Apollo 1 became a mere footnote in space history. Chaffees daughter, Sheryl, who retired last month after working at Kennedy for 33 years, recalls having to buy a memorial wreath herself to display at the space center on the 20th anniversary. The Astronauts Memorial Foundation took over the annual observance that honors all astronauts killed in the line of duty  this years ceremony is Thursday. But it wasnt until NASA unveiled its tribute to the 14 Challenger and Columbia astronauts in June 2015 that the agency wondered why it hadnt done anything similar for Apollo 1. This wasnt our generation ... it wasnt on our radar like the shuttle accidents were, explained Kelvin Manning, associate director of Kennedy Space Center. Determined to make things right, he and others at Kennedy began work on a display. NASA consulted the two surviving widows and six children, explaining it wanted to honor the three men and their sacrifice, and show how Apollo 1 ultimately paved the way to the moon. Grissom, an original Mercury astronaut, was the second American to fly in space. White was the nations first spacewalker. Chaffee was the rookie for the flight, a demo in low-Earth orbit. With the families blessing, NASA last year pulled the hatch from storage at Langley Research Center in Virginia. All three layers of the hatch underwent preservation, but were not altered in any way. The white outer hatch is still discolored and pitted, with what looks to be charring in an upper corner. The middle hatch appears darkened. The orange inner hatch is scuffed. The three sections stand side-by-side. In the very next display case is the redesigned hatch. It was just one of numerous changes made to the spacecraft, as well as to procedures. No more pure oxygen, high-pressure cabin atmosphere on the ground, for example, and everything fireproofed inside. The exhibit is in the same building that holds one of three remaining Saturn V rockets built for moon shots. Bonnie Baer, Whites daughter, is grateful the entire capsule is not on display, as so many other family members have been urging for decades. I want them to be remembered for the other things and not necessarily for the accident, she said. As the 30th anniversary of the fire approached, Betty Grissom, Gus widow, had pushed to have the capsule put on public display. The request was denied. Theres a long list of places where really bad things happened to our country, but we display those respectfully and appropriately, Scott Grissom said, citing the Alamo, Gettysburg and the Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. The retired FedEx pilot said displaying the hatch is a start. This is a long overdue step at doing right. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov",https://apnews.com/general-news-24090704a2b14f2291cf50b3e93c8209,science
"Apollo 1s crew: a Mercury astronaut, spacewalker and rookie","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The three astronauts killed 50 years ago in the first U.S. space tragedy represented NASAs finest: the second American to fly in space, the first U.S. spacewalker and the trusted rookie. They were selected for the first manned mission of the Apollo moon program, meant to orbit the Earth in a shakedown flight. They died in a fire at their launch pad during a countdown rehearsal on Jan. 27, 1967. A brief look at the men: VIRGIL GUS GRISSOM Grissom, 40, was the second American in space and perhaps best known for the sinking of his Mercury capsule, the Liberty Bell 7. The hatch to the capsule prematurely blew off at splashdown on July 21, 1961. Grissom was pulled to safety, but his spacecraft sank. Next came Gemini. NASA assigned Grissom as commander of the first Gemini flight in 1965, and he good-naturedly picked Molly Brown as the name of the spacecraft after the Broadway musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown. He was an Air Force test pilot before becoming an astronaut and his two sons ended up in aviation. Scott retired several years ago as a FedEx pilot, while younger Mark is an air traffic controller in Oklahoma. Their mother, Betty, still lives in Houston. Scott recalls how his father loved hunting, fishing, skiing and racing boats and cars. To young boys, all that stuff is golden, he says. ___ EDWARD WHITE II White, 36, made history in 1965 as Americas first spacewalker. 
        
     NASA chose the most athletic member of its still-new astronaut corps to take this big step. Back during his West Point days, White had excelled at hurdling and almost made the 1952 U.S. Olympic track team. He went on to become an Air Force test pilot. White was in NASAs second astronaut group. During Gemini 4, he spent 21 minutes out in the vacuum of space. Although it was strenuous, going back inside, he said, was the saddest moment of my life. He had two children, Edward White III and Bonnie Baer. His daughter says that for all who knew her father, he truly was a standout. He was just ahead of his time, she says, because even back then, he used to run and work out. Their mother, Patricia, who had remarried, died in 1983. ___ ROGER CHAFFEE Chaffee, 31, was the baby of the crew, a never-flown-in-space rookie. Chaffee was just 7 when he took his first plane ride over Lake Michigan with his father, who was a barnstorming pilot. He was chosen for NASAs third astronaut group in 1963. To this day, his widow, Martha, looks at his picture and thinks to herself, how lucky I was. She remarried, but later divorced. Sheryl Chaffee, one of their two children with brother Stephen, retired at the end of December as a real estate property officer following a 33-year career at Kennedy Space Center. On the way home from her last day at work, she and her husband, also a space center employee, drove past the abandoned launch pad where her father and his crewmates died. Another rookie astronaut, Donn Eisele, actually was promised Apollo 1, but shoulder surgery sidelined him and the slot fell to Chaffee, a Navy lieutenant commander.",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-va-state-wire-fl-state-wire-493d3dc8f55646a3a1014b33e67423dc,science
Hundreds honor 3 astronauts lost in Apollo fire 50 years ago,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Moonwalkers and dozens of others who took part in NASAs storied Apollo program paid tribute Thursday to the three astronauts killed in a fire 50 years ago. On the eve of the Apollo 1 anniversary, hundreds gathered at Kennedy Space Center to honor Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. They died during a countdown rehearsal at the launch pad, inside their burning spacecraft, on Jan. 27, 1967 On Friday, NASA is opening an Apollo 1 exhibit featuring the hatch that prevented the three astronauts from escaping. It has been concealed for the past half-century along with the capsule. The families of Grissom, White and Chaffee got an early look Wednesday evening at the display at the visitor complex, and liked what they saw. Really awesome, said daughter Sheryl Chaffee, who just retired from NASA. Its very fitting. We all feel like its about time. The Apollo 1 fire  NASAs first space tragedy  has long been overshadowed by the 1986 Challenger and 2003 Columbia accidents. The 14 lost shuttle astronauts also were recognized Thursday, along with seven other U.S. astronauts killed in plane crashes. The anniversaries of all three big accidents fall within days: Apollo 1 on Jan. 27, Challenger on Jan. 28 and Columbia on Feb. 1. Among the many astronauts attending Thursdays ceremony were the two surviving crew members of Apollo 11, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, as well as Apollo 16 moonwalker Charlie Duke and Apollo 10s Thomas Stafford. 
        
     Collins, who orbited the moon in 1969 while Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed on it, said Apollo 1 never launched, but in many ways was as important as later flights. Without Apollo 1 and the lessons learned from it, he noted, a fire probably would have occurred on a flight in space and seriously stalled the moon program. Yes, Apollo 1 did cause three deaths, but I believe it saved more than three later, Collins said. It slowed things down for a year or so, but spacecraft improvements enabled Apollo missions to get going by the fall of 1968, pick up speed, and land on the moon on July 20, 1969. NASA was able to meet the end-of-decade deadline set by President John F. Kennedy, to land a man on the moon and return him home safely. Grissom, White, Chaffee, Kennedy. I think these four names are appropriately mentioned in the same breath, Collins told the crowd. More than 100 fifth-graders from Apollo Elementary School, just across the Indian River in Titusville, packed the ceremony hall. Afterward, they posed in front of the massive granite Space Mirror Memorial. To student Noah Duncan, 50 years ago seems like 100. 10 years is a long time. Im only 10! added classmate Lyzara Figueroa. It was an emotional day for all the families; Chaffees widow, Martha, dabbed her eyes during throughout the tribute. They will gather again Friday evening at Cape Canaveral Air Force Stations abandoned Launch Complex 34 to mark the exact time of the accident, 6:31 p.m. To each of you who knew these three men so well, thank you for your sacrifices, Collins said. The Apollo crew was magnificent. ___ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/ Astronauts Memorial Foundation: http://www.astronautsmemorial.org/",https://apnews.com/general-news-db098789caa04454af37d4877d11bffe,science

A lunar eclipse starts everything off Friday night. The moon will pass into Earths outer shadow, or penumbra. The moon wont be blacked out like in a full eclipse. Only part of the moon will be shaded, but it should be easily visible from much of the world. Comet 45P, meanwhile, will zoom past Earth early Saturday morning. It will be an extremely close encounter as these things go, passing within 7.7 million miles (12.4 million kilometers) of Earth. Its relative speed: 14.2 miles per second, or a breakneck 51,120 mph.

Saturday mornings planned launch will be SpaceXs first from Florida since a devastating rocket explosion at a neighboring pad last summer. The accident prompted SpaceX to whip 39A into shape sooner than anticipated under its lease with NASA. The pad wrecked in the Sept. 1 accident remains unusable. I can tell you its an extra special launch .... maybe extra nerve-wracking, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told reporters Friday just outside the pad fencing. A brief rundown on historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center: ___ BIG BEGINNINGS NASA built 39A, as its commonly known, in the mid-1960s for the monstrous Saturn V moon rockets. It was first used in 1967 for an unmanned test flight, followed by another early the next year. Next came the astronauts, with Apollo 8 soaring to the moon right before Christmas 1968. SpaceX chief Elon Musk noted late last week via Instagram, We are honored to be allowed to use it. ___ SHOWSTOPPING ACTS The crescendo came on July 16, 1969, as Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins embarked on the first manned moon landing. All six Apollo moon-landings originated from here, as did close-call Apollo 13. Columbia made the first space shuttle flight from this pad on April 12, 1981, while Atlantis closed out the program from the same spot on July 8, 2011. 
        
     ___ FREQUENT FLIER This will be the 95th rocket launch from 39A. It was the departure point for 82 space shuttle flights and 11 Apollo missions, as well as the unmanned 1973 launch of Skylab, NASAs original space station. One flight resulted in casualties. As Columbia lifted off on Jan. 16, 2003, foam insulation from the external fuel tank broke off and gouged the left wing. Columbia and its crew were lost 16 days later during re-entry. ___ SPACEX TAKEOVER SpaceX signed a 20-year lease with NASA in 2014, beating out another tech billionaires rocket company, Jeff Bezos Blue Origin. Renovation work was accelerated after SpaceXs Sept. 1 rocket explosion a few miles away at Launch Complex 40 on Air Force property. The accident occurred during fueling for a prelaunch test. It is from pad 39A that SpaceX plans to launch Falcon rockets with space station-bound astronauts for NASA as early as next year. The company also might send spacecraft and, ultimately, crews to Mars from this location as well. What an awesome use of a great American asset, Kennedy Space Centers director, Robert Cabana, said Friday. Without the lease agreement, this pad would have just sat here and rusted away in the salt air. ___ LESSER-KNOWN TWIN Just a mile to the north, Launch Complex 39B is the lesser-known, lesser-used twin. Apollo 10 christened 39B in 1969. In the shuttle era, Challenger inaugurated the pad on Jan. 28, 1986. The doomed flight with schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe lasted 73 seconds. In all, 53 shuttle missions began from this pad, for a total of 59 launches of all types. It was last used in 2009 for an unmanned test flight of NASAs Ares rocket, canceled soon afterward. NASA is transforming 39B for its yet-to-fly Space Launch System megarocket, intended to send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/fl-state-wire-ca-state-wire-0b14ae5cd8b2404f8621df156fd6f03b,science
The Latest: SpaceX cancels rocket launch from NASA moon pad,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Latest on SpaceX rocket launch that was scheduled for liftoff Saturday (all times local): 10:01 a.m. SpaceX will have to wait at least another day to launch from NASAs historic moon pad. Last-minute rocket trouble forced SpaceX to halt Saturdays countdown at Floridas Kennedy Space Center. The unmanned Falcon rocket remains at Launch Complex 39A, waiting to soar on a space station delivery mission. Its the same pad where Americans flew to the moon almost a half-century ago, and where the shuttle program ended in 2011. This will be SpaceXs first Florida launch since a rocket explosion last summer. The next launch attempt could come as early as Sunday morning. ___ SpaceX is all set to launch a rocket from NASAs historic moon pad. As the sun rose Saturday over Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the unmanned Falcon rocket stood at Launch Complex 39A, ready to soar. Liftoff is scheduled for 10:01 a.m. SpaceX is sending up a load of space station supplies from the exact spot where Americans flew to the moon almost a half-century ago. The pad was last used in 2011 for NASAs final space shuttle flight. This is SpaceXs first launch from Florida since a rocket explosion Sept. 1.

"SpaceX aborts approach to space station, delivery delayed","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A navigation error forced SpaceX to delay its shipment to the International Space Station on Wednesday, following an otherwise smooth flight from NASAs historic moon pad. SpaceXs supply ship, the Dragon, was less than a mile from the orbiting outpost when a problem cropped up in the GPS system. The approach was aborted, and the Dragon backed away. NASA said neither the station nor its six-person crew was in any danger, and another attempt would be made Thursday. As a pilot it is sometimes better to accelerate and circle around than attempt a difficult landing, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet said in a tweet from the space station. Same in space  well be ready tomorrow! Just a few hours earlier, Russia successfully launched a cargo ship from Kazakhstan, its first since a failed launch in December. SpaceX launched the Dragon capsule Sunday from Kennedy Space Centers Launch Complex 39A, out of action since NASAs space shuttle program ended in 2011. Its the same spot where astronauts flew to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s. SpaceX has a 20-year lease with NASA for 39A; besides launching station cargo from there, the company hopes to send up astronauts as early as next year. Everything was going well with this latest SpaceX flight until the GPS issue. The Dragons computers halted the rendezvous from just seven-tenths of a mile away. SpaceX said the problem is well understood and can be fixed before Thursday mornings delivery attempt. The Russian supplies should arrive Friday. 
        
     This was the first time that SpaceX had to abort a shipment at the last minute like this. The private company, led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has been making station deliveries since 2012. In December, Russia lost a load of station supplies shortly after liftoff. The upper stage of the Soyuz rocket and the cargo ship ended up in pieces over Siberia. Its the same kind of rocket used for launching crews, and the accident ended up delaying the return of three space station astronauts and the launch of two others. Russian investigators concluded there was a manufacturing flaw in the third-stage engine. The 250-mile-high station is home to two Americans, three Russians and Frances Pesquet. ___ AP reporter Vladimir Isachenkov contributed to this report from Moscow. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-842e28c3002d469c9650005423662e8a,science
Cool facts about 7 Earth-size planets circling single star,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Talk about an Earth-shattering discovery. Scientists have spotted seven Earth-size planets around a nearby star, some or all of which could harbor water and possibly life. Thats the biggest cluster of planets like this yet to be found. Heres a quick look: AGE OF AQUARIUS This star system is less than 40 light-years from Earth, or 235 trillion miles away, in the constellation Aquarius. At the hub is a small, faint star known as Trappist-1. Seven planets circle Trappist-1, with orbits ranging from 1  to 20 days. If Trappist-1 were our sun, all these planets would fit inside the orbit of Mercury. Thats how close they are to their star and why their orbits are so short. The planets have no real names. Theyre only known by letters, b through h. The letter A refers to the star itself. ___ GOLDILOCKS ZONE Three of the planets are smack dab in the so-called habitable zone, also known as the Goldilocks zone, where conditions are just right for water and life to flourish  not too much and not too little stellar energy. The four other planets are tantalizingly close to the Goldilocks zone so close that they, too, could harbor water and potentially life. But just because a planet is in this sweet spot, doesnt mean life exists or ever did. If aliens were observing our solar system from the Trappist-1 network, they might be saying, Hey, there are three habitable planets there, Venus, Earth and Mars, said Sara Seager, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology astrophysicist who did not take part in the study. The point is, lets wait and see whats out there, she cautioned. ___ 
        
     HOWS THE VIEW? Trappist-1, one of numerous ultracool dwarf stars out there in the galaxy, glows red. If you were to stand on one of the planets, the star might appear to be salmon-colored. Its planets are clumped so closely together, they would appear twice as big as our moon in the sky. The temperature could be pretty similar to Earth as well, at least on one of these planets. ___ NOW WHAT? Scientists need to study the atmospheres of these almost assuredly rocky planets before jumping to any conclusions about water and life. The Hubble Space Telescope already is on the case. The still-under-construction James Webb Space Telescope will join in once its launched next year. The Webb will search for gases that might be a byproduct of life: oxygen, ozone and methane. Scientists say it should take five years to get a handle on all these atmospheres, and figure out whether water  and maybe life  are present. Altogether, astronomers have confirmed close to 3,600 planets outside our solar system since the 1990s, but barely four dozen are in the potential habitable zone of their stars, and of those, just 18 are approximately the size of Earth.",https://apnews.com/general-news-438ed9a61aad484ca99ae571d4a92a69,science
SpaceX makes good on space station delivery a little late,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX made good on a 250-mile-high delivery at the International Space Station on Thursday, after fixing a navigation problem that held up the shipment a day. Everything went smoothly the second time around as the station astronauts captured the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship as the two craft sailed over Australia. On Wednesday, a GPS system error prevented the capsule from getting close enough to be grabbed by the stations big robot arm. The Dragon  loaded with 5,500 pounds of supplies  rocketed away Sunday from NASAs historic moon pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Now leased by the SpaceX, the pad had been idle since the close of the shuttle program almost six years ago. The stations six-person crew will accept another shipment Friday, this one from the Russians. Given the Dragons delayed arrival  liftoff also occurred a day late  the astronauts were under orders to open the capsule as soon as possible to retrieve sensitive science experiments. Sorry about the delays, Mission Control radioed. Now the real work starts. Congratulations Dragon on a successful journey from Earth and now welcome on board, said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who operated the robot arm. At the top of the crews unloading list: 20 mice that are part of a wound-healing experiment. Before the flight, researchers made small surgical wounds in some of the animals thigh bones then treated the area. Scientists want to see how quickly the wounds heal in weightlessness. Another 20 mice are taking part in the study on the ground, as control subjects. 
        
     Other newly arrived research: highly infectious MRSA bacteria, triple-contained so it doesnt get loose up there; stem cells; and instruments for studying lightning and the Earths ozone layer. The Dragon will remain at the space station for a month before it is cut loose to bring back science samples and other items. Its the only supply ship capable of returning intact to Earth; all the others burn up during re-entry. SpaceX is one of two private companies flying up supplies for NASA. Besides Frances Pesquet, the space station is home to two Americans and three Russians. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-b382fb22b3ce4e39acd0d079a6e3c02c,science
NASA weighing risk of adding crew to megarockets 1st flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is weighing the risk of adding astronauts to the first flight of its new megarocket, designed to eventually send crews to Mars. The space agencys human exploration chief said Friday that his boss and the Trump administration asked for the feasibility study. The objective is to see what it would take to speed up a manned mission; under the current plan, astronauts wouldnt climb aboard until 2021 at best. The Space Launch System, known as SLS, will be the most powerful rocket when it flies. NASA is shooting for an unmanned test flight for late next year. Putting people on board would delay the mission and require extra money. The space agencys William Gerstenmaier said if adding astronauts postpones the first flight beyond 2019, it would probably be better to stick with the original plan. Under that plan, Gerstenmaier said, nearly three years are needed between an unmanned flight test and a crewed mission to make launch platform changes at Kennedy Space Center. We recognize this will be an increased risk to put astronauts on the initial flight, Gerstenmaier said. Astronauts are taking part in the study, which will weigh the extra risk against the benefits. On Thursday, an independent safety panel cautioned that NASA needs a compelling reason to put astronauts on the initial flight, given the risk. The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel was formed in the wake of the Apollo 1 fire that killed three astronauts in a countdown test 50 years ago last month. 
        
     The capsule that will carry the astronauts  NASAs new Orion  already has flown on a space demo. Containing memorabilia and toys but no people, the capsule was launched into an extremely long orbit of Earth in 2014 by a Delta IV rocket, and splashed down into the Pacific. NASA normally prefers testing rockets without people, although for the inaugural space shuttle flight in 1981, two pilots were on board. A small crew of two also is planned for the 2021 SLS mission, which could fly to the vicinity of the moon. An inaugural flight with astronauts would grab more attention. But Gerstenmaier said the public aspect wont be taken into consideration. There are pros and cons both ways, and its hard to judge that (public) aspect, he told reporters. But I look at it more kind of matter-of-factly. What do I gain technically by putting crew on? NASA expects to issue its report in about a month. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/index.html",https://apnews.com/la-state-wire-tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-0efb7ccffcff4c8babcc24710a61cb6b,science
SpaceX says it will fly 2 people to moon next year,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX said Monday it will fly two people to the moon next year, a feat not attempted since NASAs Apollo heyday close to half a century ago. Tech billionaire Elon Musk  the companys founder and chief executive officer  announced the surprising news barely a week after launching his first rocket from NASAs legendary moon pad. Two people who know one another approached the company about sending them on a weeklong flight just beyond the moon, according to Musk. He wont identify the pair or the price tag. Theyve already paid a significant deposit and are very serious about it, he noted. Fly me to the moon ... Ok, Musk said in a light-hearted tweet following the news conference. Musk said SpaceX is on track to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA in mid-2018. This moon mission would follow about six months later, by the end of the year under the current schedule, using a Dragon crew capsule and a Falcon heavy rocket launched from NASAs former moon pad in Florida. If all goes as planned, it could happen close to the 50th anniversary of NASAs first manned flight to the moon, on Apollo 8. The SpaceX moonshot is designed to be autonomous  unless something goes wrong, Musk said. I think they are entering this with their eyes open, knowing that there is some risk here, Musk told reporters in the telephone conference, a day after teasing via Twitter that an announcement of some sort was forthcoming. 
        
     Theyre certainly not naive, and well do everything we can to minimize that risk, but its not zero. But theyre coming into this with their eyes open, said Musk, adding that the pair will receive extensive training before the flight. Musk said he does not have permission to release the passengers names, and he was hesitant to even say if they were men, women or even pilots. He would only admit, Its nobody from Hollywood. The paying passengers would make a long loop around the moon, skimming the lunar surface and then going well beyond, perhaps 300,000 or 400,000 miles distance altogether. Its about 240,000 miles to the moon alone, one way. The mission would not involve a lunar landing. This should be a really exciting mission that hopefully gets the world really excited about sending people into deep space again, Musk said. NASA will have first dibs on a similar mission if it so chooses, he said. The space agency learned of his plan at the same time as reporters. In a statement, NASA commended SpaceX for reaching higher. In all, 24 astronauts flew to the moon and 12 walked its surface from 1969 to 1972. The California-based SpaceX already has a long list of firsts, with its sights ultimately set on Mars. It became the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and safely return it to Earth in 2010, and the first commercial enterprise to fly to the space station in 2012 on a supply mission. Just a week ago, SpaceX made its latest delivery from Kennedy Space Centers legendary Launch Complex 39A, where the Apollo astronauts flew to the moon and shuttle crews rocketed into orbit. That will be where the private moon mission will originate as well. The crew Dragon capsule  an upgraded version of the cargo Dragon  has yet to fly in space. Neither has a Falcon Heavy rocket, which is essentially a Falcon 9 rocket with two strap-on boosters, according to Musk. A Falcon Heavy test flight is planned this summer, while an empty crew capsule is set to launch to the space station late this year. He said there will be ample time to test both the spacecraft and the rocket, before the moon mission. NASA last week announced it was studying the possibility of adding crew to the test flight of its megarocket, at the request of the Trump administration. Such a flight to the lunar neighborhood wouldnt happen before 2019 at best  if, indeed, that option is even implemented. Musk said anything that advances the space exploration cause is good, no matter who goes first. Retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who will celebrate his homecoming this week from a one-year space mission, was quick to tweet: Its been almost a year. Send me! Musk said he expects to have more moon-mission customers as time goes by. At the same time, SpaceX is also working on a so-called Red Dragon, meant to fly to Mars around 2020 with experiments, but no people  and actually land. His ultimate goal is to establish a human settlement on Mars. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-21ff8510640e4ec59cacfc9a91a84215,science

Booster rocket fires in key NASA test for Mars missions,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs fireworks came early this year with a successful rocket test in Utah. On Tuesday, NASA fired a booster intended to hoist astronauts into true outer space. The ground test lasted the full two minutes, and the early word is that everything went well. NASA plans to use the mega-rocket for trips to Mars in the 2030s. This is the second and final test-firing of the booster designed for NASAs Space Launch System. The debut launch from Floridas Kennedy Space Center in 2018 wont carry people. But a few years later, astronauts will climb aboard for a flight near the moon. Tuesdays test was conducted by Orbital ATK, the NASA contractor that also made the smaller shuttle boosters for NASA. This 154-foot-long booster was horizontal and pointing toward a mountain near Promontory, Utah, when it spewed out flames and smoke  3.6 million pounds of rocket thrust. Each SLS rocket will have two boosters along with four main engines. There ultimately will be 9 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, considerably more than the now-retired shuttle, noted former astronaut Charles Precourt, an Orbital ATK vice president. Precourt said the team worked nonstop over the past five weeks to prepare for Tuesdays milestone. Really a delight, he said.

"Triple sunrises, sunsets at this strange new world","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Imagine a planet with triple sunrises and sunsets every day for part of the year, and nonstop daylight at other times. Astronomers revealed such a place Thursday: a strange new world in the Constellation Centaurus that has not one, not two, but three suns. Whats more, a year there lasts half a millennium from Earths perspective. Discoverer and lead author Kevin Wagner said hes thrilled to have seen such a beautiful part of nature that nobody else has seen. As amazing as three sunsets and sunrises are, I think nature will have some other surprises in store for us as we continue exploring, Wagner, a doctoral student at the University of Arizona at Tucson, said via email. Triple-star systems with detected planets are rare enough; this is believed to be just the fifth such discovery. But the giant gassy world in this one  formally known as Planet HD 131399Ab  has the biggest known orbit in a multi-star system. Its orbit is double Plutos  or roughly 550 Earth years. Thats how long it takes to orbit its systems brightest star, a super-size sun. The two smaller stars orbit one another and, as a pair, orbit with their big stellar brother. Planet HD 131399Ab has four times the mass of our own Jupiter. With such a wide orbit and companion stars, scientists would expect a planet like this to be kicked out in a tug of stellar war. Yet thats not the case. 
        
     During part of the planets orbit, all three stars are visible on the same day, offering triple sunrises and sunsets and allowing for day and night. For about one-fourth of its year  around 100 to 140 Earth years  theres continuous daylight. Thats because as the big sun is rising, the two smaller ones are setting. With three suns, the planet will see different weird combinations of sunrises and sunsets, said co-author Daniel Apai, a University of Arizona astronomer. He added: This is a system for which I would not want to design a calendar. The astronomers used the European Southern Observatorys Very Large Telescope in Chile to spot the planet 320 light-years away. It is one of the few exoplanets  planets outside our own solar system  to be directly imaged. Most exoplanets are identified by periodic dips in starlight as the planets pass between us and their stars. The team reported the discovery Thursday in the journal Science. As for the planets alphabet-soup label, I wish we had a better name, Wagner noted. There is an official protocol for naming planets and their surface features. The International Astronomical Union, in fact, has a relatively new group to handle public naming campaigns. Informally, we called in The Planet, Apai said in an email. But with more possible planet candidates in sight, we will have to change this soon. ___ Online: Science: http://www.sciencemag.org/ European Southern Observatory: http://www.eso.org/vlt",https://apnews.com/triple-sunrises-sunsets-at-this-strange-new-world-425ae757dd824a05ae60a87554ba5fdb,science
SpaceX launches space station docking port for NASA,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX successfully launched a critical space station docking port for astronauts early Monday, along with a DNA decoder for high-flying genetic research. As an extra treat, the company brought its leftover first-stage booster back to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for a vertical touchdown  only the second such land landing for an orbital mission and the ultimate in recycling. Twin sonic booms rocked the moonlit night, old shuttle landing-style. A really good day, observed Hans Koenigsmann, vice president of flight reliability for SpaceX. The cosmic double-header got underway as the unmanned Falcon rocket streaked upward through the middle-of-the-night darkness, carrying 5,000 pounds of food, experiments and equipment for the International Space Station. The orbiting outpost was soaring over the North Atlantic at liftoff. It was SpaceXs second shot at delivering a new-style docking port for NASA. The last one went up in smoke over the Atlantic last year, a rocket accident casualty. NASA needs this new docking setup at the space station before Americans can fly there in crew capsules set to debut next year. SpaceX is building astronaut-worthy versions of its Dragon cargo ships, while Boeing  which makes these docking ports  is working on a crew capsule called Starliner. The pair would dock to this ring and another due to fly in a year. The Dragon and its latest shipment are due Wednesday at the 250-mile-high outpost. 
        
     NASAs space station program manager Kirk Shireman expected to be sweating bullets without a doubt at liftoff, as always. He said all the cargo is precious, but really wants this docking port up there safe and sound. SpaceX, meanwhile, had its sights not only on orbit, but also on the ground. SpaceX brought its leftover first-stage booster back just a couple miles from where it lifted off eight minutes earlier. The company has now pulled off five vertical booster landings since December, three on an ocean platform and two on land. Employees at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, cheered loudly and applauded when the 15-story booster touched down smoothly. Koenigsmann said the booster looked to be in excellent shape and probably pretty soon ready to fly again. SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk wants to refly his rockets to shave launch costs. The boosters normally are ditched at sea. The company hopes to launch its first recovered rocket this fall. The two Americans on the six-person station crew will perform a spacewalk in August to hook up the new docking ring, about 5 feet across and 3 1/2 feet tall. Another port  cobbled together from spare parts  will replace the one lost in the June 2015 launch accident. NASA went with private companies to supply the space station in the wake of the shuttle retirement five years ago this week. The next step will be launching NASA astronauts from U.S. soil; for now, Americans are hitching rides on Russian rockets. Russia, meanwhile, also has a supply ship on the way. Launched over the weekend, its due there Monday night. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/fl-state-wire-ca-state-wire-8da2a6adca75411399c1aaccc5636fa2,science
"5 years after shuttle, NASA awaits commercial crew capsules","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Five years after Atlantis completed the space shuttle programs final voyage, NASA is still at least a year away from launching its astronauts from U.S. soil. When Atlantis returned to Earth on July 21, 2011, everyone knew there would be a lengthy gap. But the pilots who guided Atlantis to one last wheels stop are doing all they can to hurry up the future, albeit from different teams. One works for Boeing on the companys Starliner crew capsule under development. The other is one of four NASA astronauts training for the initial test flights. This unprecedented switch from government to commercial rocketships promises to usher in a whole new era, according to Atlantis commander Christopher Ferguson. Think space tourists, orbiting factories, lunar camps, private Mars labs and more. Were on the verge of commercially taking people back and forth to low-Earth orbit. This is practically unheard of, Ferguson said earlier this month. He now works for Boeing, one of two private companies coming up with new capsules to carry astronauts. Boeings Starliner is set to sail to the International Space Station in early 2018. SpaceXs souped-up Dragon capsule is scheduled to launch by the end of next year. Ever since shuttles Atlantis, Discovery and Endeavour retired to museums, Americans have been stuck riding Russian rockets to the space station. NASA has been relying on SpaceX and Orbital ATK to keep the station supplied. The latest cargo Dragon arrived Wednesday. Its primary payload: a docking port needed for the crew-worthy Dragon and Starliner. 
        
     Commercial space stations likely will replace the multination space station, Ferguson noted. So were sort of setting the stage for commercial habitation of low-Earth orbit  all with the intent of going beyond, he said. NASA is looking to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. It is developing the Orion spacecraft to do just that, along with a mega-rocket set to debut in 2018. On this fifth anniversary of the last shuttle flight, space station commander Jeffrey Williams prefers to focus on the future, rather than the past. It was tough for everybody to retire the shuttle, Williams said from orbit last week. It was a great vehicle and did its job. But thats the point  it did its primary job. It fulfilled its primary purpose of building the station. During a July 8 commemoration of the shuttles last liftoff, Ferguson and his co-pilot Douglas Hurley recalled how they had to practically be dragged from the cockpit following touchdown. Hurley is now training for test flights of the new capsules. I didnt want to leave, Ferguson said. I just thought, Were not done yet. And its true. Were not done yet. Hurley noted how he, Ferguson and the two other Atlantis astronauts  Sandra Magnus and Rex Walheim  turned out the cabin lights the night before landing and took in the views of Earth. Their space station visit had gone incredibly well, and the goodbyes with many of their flight controllers had been said. I just remember just sitting there going, This is unbelievable, I cant believe Im doing this. ... The whole mission kind of came crashing in. Kennedy Space Centers director, former astronaut Robert Cabana, said it was bittersweet hearing Atlantis twin sonic booms on return one last time. After 135 shuttle flights spanning 30 years, it was sad, but there was a great joy about it, too. A postscript: Thanks to SpaceX, the sonic booms are back. For only the second time, the leftover first-stage booster of a SpaceX Falcon rocket landed back at Cape Canaveral following Mondays launch, its return heralded by sonic booms. Like the first time in December, the booster touched down vertically just a few miles from where it took off on the space station delivery mission. No longer accustomed to these booms, some area residents called 911 to report a middle-of-the-night explosion. ___ Online: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/5-years-after-shuttle-nasa-awaits-commercial-crew-capsules-3ffc7547de0f404b9b5db9531a55a69f,science
Space station supply run by Orbital ATK slips to Sept.,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A space station supply run by a Virginia company has slipped to September. Orbital ATK, one of NASAs prime shippers, was supposed to return its Antares rocket to flight this month after a nearly two-year grounding. But on Wednesday, the company delayed liftoff of the retooled, unmanned rocket until mid-September. Antares flights have been on hold since an October 2014 launch explosion at Wallops Island, Virginia. Orbital ATK says it needs more time to inspect and test the rocket. The company also has to fit into the International Space Station schedule. Orbital ATK used another companys rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to fulfill its obligations to NASA, following the Antares accident. But now the company wants to get back on track at Wallops. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/",https://apnews.com/va-state-wire-fl-state-wire-a0be97354b2b4e19847d36fc48a7ad16,science
Outburst of shooting stars up to 200 mph - meteors per hour,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The heavens will be bursting with shooting stars this week. Thursday night into early Friday, the annual Perseid (PUR'-see-ihd) meteor shower is expected to peak with double the normal number of meteors. Scientists call this an outburst, and they say it could reach up to 200 meteors per hour. Prime viewing should be in the pre-dawn hours of Friday, after the moon sets. The last Perseids outburst was in 2009. Thanks to a gravity nudge from Jupiter, debris from comet Swift-Tuttle could stray closer to Earth again. These scattered specks of dust  a trail in the comets wake  are what flash as they enter the atmosphere at a mind-blowing 132,000 mph and burn up. Heres something to think about. The meteors youll see this year are from comet flybys that occurred hundreds if not thousands of years ago, NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke said in a statement. And theyve traveled billions of miles before their kamikaze run into Earths atmosphere. Scientists hope to capture the action with a new instrument at the International Space Station. The U.S.-Japanese experiments name is appropriately named Meteor. An August tradition, the Perseids are so named because the meteors appear to emanate from the constellation Perseus, the Medusa-killing hero of Greek mythology. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/outburst-of-shooting-stars-up-to-200-mph-meteors-per-hour-33d0509c8a52483486e576c6bad39567,science
Spacewalking astronauts install new front door for visitors,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port  their major objective  in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. Were done for the day, Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suits cooling system, almost led to a spacewalkers drowning in 2013. The stations new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans havent rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASAs last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules cant dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Fridays success paved the way for these future spaceships. 
        
     Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station, Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides  at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASAs second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one  cobbled together from spare parts  should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position  the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Fridays spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceXs crew Dragon ship will fly on the companys own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at missions end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeings Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliances trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights  intended to go all the way to the space station and dock  will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, Hey, now that theyve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA? We cant tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be, Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. But were well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html",https://apnews.com/spacewalking-astronauts-install-new-front-door-for-visitors-c736b9f98f2e4a49bfacb8cb4c2b7b01,science
Astronaut breaks US record: 521 days in space and counting,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronaut Jeffrey Williams has a new record for NASA under his space belt. The commander of the International Space Station marked a U.S. recording-breaking 521st day in orbit Wednesday, a number accumulated over four flights. That surpasses the 520-day record set by Scott Kelly, whose one-year space station mission ended in March. By the time Williams returns to Earth in two weeks to close out his latest half-year trip, he will have logged 534 days off the planet for NASA. His record wont last long. Space station veteran Peggy Whitson will top that after she flies up in November for another six-month stay. Shes already at the 377-day mark for total space time, a record for a woman. And even that wont come close to the world record of 879 days held by Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka  a total of 2  years. Kelly, who is now retired from NASA, called Williams from Mission Control in Houston and offered congratulations on passing me up here. Its great to see another record broken, Kelly radioed. But I do have one question for you. And my question is: You got another 190 days in you? Williams replied, That questions not for me, thats for my wife. He thanked Kelly for accepting the one-year stint so I didnt have to. Williams recalled telling his wife, Anna-Marie, and the rest of his family that if he did the one-year flight versus his current six-month assignment that hed be back six months earlier  in March. 
        
     That never flew with anybody, he confided. As it is, Williams will be No. 14 on the worlds most-time-in-space list, behind 13 Russians, by the time he lands. Williams, 58, a retired Army colonel, rocketed into orbit in March along with two Russians. They will return via a Russian Soyuz capsule to Kazakhstan on Sept. 7. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk next week before heading home. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/national-national-b08d1045e018493aae404bf7d9861940,science
"SpaceX Dragon returns to Earth with station science, gear","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX Dragon capsule returned to Earth on Friday with scientific gifts from the International Space Station. NASA astronaut Kate Rubins waved goodbye as the Dragon slowly flew away Friday morning. Six hours later, the spacecraft parachuted into the Pacific, just off Mexicos Baja California coast. Its loaded with 3,000 pounds of research and equipment, including 12 mice that flew up on the Dragon as part of a genetic study. Good splashdown of Dragon confirmed, SpaceX reported via Twitter. Rubins and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi used the big robot arm to release the capsule. Mission Control thanked the astronauts for their effort, then added, To the Dragon recovery team, fair winds and following seas. The Dragon delivered a new docking port last month that will be used in another year or two by SpaceX and Boeing, which are developing crew capsules for NASA. Its shuttles five years retired, the space agency has turned over orbital deliveries of both cargo and astronauts to private companies, in order to focus on Mars exploration. In the meantime, NASA astronauts ride in Russian capsules to the space station. SpaceX is the only space station shipper capable of returning items for analysis back to Earth; thats why the Dragon is so important to NASA.

Astronauts take 2nd spacewalk in 2 weeks for radiator work,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronauts took their second spacewalk in two weeks Thursday, taking care of some long overdue radiator work outside the International Space Station. Commander Jeffrey Williams used a power drill-type tool to fold up a 44-foot-long thermal radiator thats no longer in use. Spacewoman Kate Rubins floated nearby, making sure Williams was clear of the panel as it slowly retracted, accordion style. With the radiator closed all the way, they cinched it down in four spots for safekeeping. NASA wants to preserve the radiator as a spare. Outstretched, it was at greater risk of getting hit with space junk. The radiator was extended in 2012 to help stop a coolant leak. But the leak ended up being elsewhere. Another team of astronauts attempted the radiator retraction late last year, but couldnt complete the job, so it fell into Williams and Rubins gloved hands. The radiator is part of the 250-mile-high labs heat-dispelling system. The two U.S. astronauts installed two new high-definition TV cameras and a camera light, tightened bolts on a solar-panel rotary joint, tied down the brake handles for a rail car, and whipped through a few other chores. As the spacewalk passed the six-hour mark, Mission Control declared victory with all major objectives met, and sent the astronauts back inside. The spacewalk lasted nearly seven hours. Great working with you today, Mission Control radioed. 
        
     The same two astronauts installed a new docking port during a spacewalk Aug. 19. Williams returns to Earth next week. He already holds the NASA record for most accumulated time in orbit; his tally will reach 534 days over four missions by the time hes back on Earth. Mission Control, meanwhile, kept news about a devastating launch pad explosion at Cape Canaveral from the two spacewalkers while they were outside. SpaceX was fueling its unmanned Falcon rocket for a test engine firing when a fireball erupted, an hour into the spacewalk. Both the rocket and its payload  an Israeli communications satellite  were destroyed. The launch had been scheduled for Saturday. SpaceX is one of two companies supplying the space station for NASA. Its also working on a crew capsule to ferry station U.S. astronauts; that first flight was supposed to come as early as next year.

"Explosion at SpaceX launch pad destroys rocket, satellite","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A massive fireball and explosion erupted Thursday at SpaceXs main launch pad, destroying a rocket as well as a satellite that Facebook was counting on to spread internet service in Africa. There were no injuries. The pad had been cleared of workers before what was supposed to be a routine pre-launch rocket engine test. SpaceX chief Elon Musk said the accident occurred while the rocket was being fueled and originated around the upper-stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown, Musk said via Twitter. More soon. The explosion  heard and felt for miles around  dealt a severe blow to SpaceX, still scrambling to catch up with satellite deliveries following a launch accident last year. Its also a setback for NASA, which has been relying on the private space company to keep the International Space Station stocked with supplies and, ultimately, astronauts. SpaceX was preparing for the test firing of its unmanned Falcon rocket when the blast happened shortly after 9 a.m. at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The test was in advance of Saturdays planned launch of an Israeli-made communications satellite to provide home internet for parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Europe. A video of the explosion shows a fireball enveloping the top of the rocket. Moments later, the nose cone containing the satellite plunged to the ground, followed by more explosions. 
        
     Buildings four miles away shook from the blast, and a series of explosions continued for several minutes. Dark smoke filled the overcast sky. A half-hour later, a black cloud hung low across the eastern horizon. Video cameras showed smoke coming from the restricted site well into late afternoon. Most of the rocket was still standing, although the top third or so was clearly bent over. The explosion occurred at Launch Complex 40 at the Air Force station, right next door to NASAs Kennedy Space Center, where emergency staff went on standby and monitored the air for any toxic fumes. The initial blast sent NASA employees rushing outside to see what happened. The Air Force stressed there was no threat to public safety in the surrounding communities. While the pad was still burning, it was off-limits. We want to make sure we isolate any potential problem, said Shawn Walleck, a spokesman for the Air Forces 45th Space Wing, because at this point, weve had no casualties, weve had no injuries, and we want to keep it that way. By evening the fire was out, but the pad was going to remain off-limits until Friday morning as a precaution, the Air Force said. Facebook spokesman Chris Norton said the social media company was disappointed by the loss, but remain committed to our mission of connecting people to the internet around the world. Founder Mark Zuckerberg was in Kenya on Thursday, discussing internet access with government officials. The satellites Israeli-based operator, Spacecom, said the loss will have a significant impact on the company. Just last November, ground controllers lost contact with the previous satellite in this so-called Amos series. The new satellite was supposed to provide services to television and internet operators and a number of clients, including Facebook. The Falcon rocket destroyed Thursday is the same kind used to launch space station supplies. The last such flight took place in July. SpaceX, one of two companies making deliveries, is also working on a crew capsule to ferry station U.S. astronauts. Two NASA astronauts were doing a spacewalk 250 miles up, outside the space station, when the explosion occurred. Mission Control did not tell them about the accident, saying all communication was focused on the spacewalk. NASA later put out a statement, saying the space agency remains confident in its commercial partners, SpaceX included. The space station is well stocked and able to weather any potential delays to upcoming SpaceX deliveries, NASA said. At the same time, NASA said it remains on track for next Thursdays launch of an asteroid-chasing and sampling spacecraft, the first of its kind for the U.S. The spacecraft and the Atlas rocket were inside their hangar at the time of the explosion, barely a mile away; preliminary inspections show both to be in good shape. The California-based SpaceX had been ramping up with frequent launches to make up for a backlog created by a launch accident in June 2015. In that mishap, a support strut evidently snapped in the upper stage; the problem was fixed. Until Thursday, the company had successfully carried out eight launches this year, with nine more in the wings by years end, including the debut flight of the so-called Falcon Heavy. Now that lineup is in jeopardy. SpaceX is leasing the Cape Canaveral pad from the Air Force for unmanned Falcon launches. The company is also redoing a former shuttle pad at Kennedy for future manned flights for NASA. The first crewed flight was supposed to take place by the end of next year. Boeing also is developing a crew capsule for NASA. Even before Thursdays accident, NASAs inspector general office was skeptical there would be astronaut flights by SpaceX or Boeing before late 2018. Technical challenges are piling up and threaten to cause delays, according to a report issued Thursday. Sen.

"Blue Origin successfully tests escape system, lands rocket","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Rocket company Blue Origin pulled off a double success Wednesday, coming a step closer to launching people into space. The aerospace startup led by Amazons Jeff Bezos tested the escape system of its space capsule in remote west Texas. Forty-five seconds into the flight, the capsule popped off like a champagne cork, propelled by an escape motor mounted underneath. Not only did the empty capsule land safely under parachutes four minutes after liftoff, the rocket managed to fly back and land upright. This was the first inflight test of the emergency escape system, designed to save lives if something goes wrong with the rocket during liftoff, and the first test of its kind in the U.S. since the 1960s. Blue Origins launch commentators called it an epic flight from beginning to end. Bezos had warned in advance that the booster rocket probably would end up crashing back to Earth, after being jolted by the 70,000 pounds of force exerted by the escape system. Instead, the booster made what looked to be a fine vertical touchdown seven minutes after liftoff, just a couple miles from its launch pad. Wow. There it is. There you go, New Shepard. Look at her, launch commentator Ariane Cornell exclaimed once the booster landed. What an extraordinary test and a tremendous final flight for both craft. The rocket and capsule system are intended for suborbital flight and are called New Shepard after the first American in space, Alan Shepard. Bezos hopes to launch the first test flight with humans as early as next year, followed by tourists and other paying customers. The capsule could hold up to six people. 
        
     Blue Origin is aiming for reusability to lower launch costs. After the capsule darted away at 400 mph, the rocket kept going up, reaching more than 240,000 feet high, before descending to the desert floor. This rocket has flown five times and is now bound for a museum along with the capsule. The capsule also had flown before, including a launch pad escape test, minus a rocket, in 2012. Based in Kent, Washington, Blue Origin has taken over a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for future orbital flights. That newly unveiled system, still in development, is called New Glenn for the first American to orbit the Earth, John Glenn. While another private space company, SpaceX, has landed some of its first-stage boosters at Cape Canaveral or just offshore on a floating platform  all of them used in orbital missions  it has yet to reuse any of these recovered rockets. It had hoped to do so by years end, but an explosion on the launch pad during testing on Sept. 1 has everything on hold. Both the SpaceX Falcon rocket and its payload, an Israeli satellite, were destroyed. Blue Origins escape system differs from that used by NASA during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, and what the Russians still use on their Soyuz capsules. Those capsules were designed to be pulled off by an escape tower mounted on top, while the New Shepard vessel is meant to be pushed off from a motor underneath. That way, the escape motor can be flown multiple times, as long as it is not activated in an emergency. The escape towers, meanwhile, have to be jettisoned before re-entry. The Soyuz system actually saved the lives of two Soviet cosmonauts in 1983 when their rocket caught fire on the pad. Back in the 1960s, NASA propelled mock Apollo spacecraft off Little Joe II rockets in preparation for the moon-landing missions, but no one was on board. Blue Origin broadcast the test live on its website. ___ Online: Blue Origin: https://www.blueorigin.com/",https://apnews.com/blue-origin-successfully-tests-escape-system-lands-rocket-b4030e471ba144d59435942a7be67327,science
"Space center reopens after hurricane, damage in millions","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Kennedy Space Center reopened for business Tuesday, relying on industrial air conditioners rushed in from around the country in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. Director Robert Cabana said the damage  mostly ripped-off roofs  is still being tallied, but is in the millions of dollars. He said it would have been much worse had Matthew not weakened and veered slightly offshore Friday as it swept up the Florida coast. We were definitely blessed, Cabana, a former space shuttle commander, told reporters. Among the buildings with roof and water damage: the 1960s-era beach house once used by astronauts for parties and barbecues before launches. Cabana hopes to get it repaired for conferences. The portable air conditioning units were brought in after the roof came off the building that serves as the electrical room for air conditioning throughout the main launch area. The switching equipment ended up soaked. Without the new units, employees could not have returned so quickly, Cabana noted. Even so, some workers were displaced. About 8,300 people work at Kennedy. This time, all of the panels held on the massive Vehicle Assembly Building. Back in 2004, while the space shuttles were still flying, hundreds of panels were blown off the face of the 525-foot-tall structure by Hurricane Frances, creating gaping holes. Cabana said corrosive fasteners failed back then and were replaced with stainless steel washers and locknuts. 
        
     It did its job. The panels look great. We kept them all on, Cabana said. The launch pad being modified for NASAs future mega rocket held up well, as did the pad being leased by SpaceX. No flight hardware was damaged, and the planned November launch of a next-generation weather satellite shouldnt suffer too much of a delay. The space center  which shut down last Thursday to everyone except a 116-person crew  experienced surface winds of 80 mph to 86 mph. Gusts of more than 135 mph were measured at 500 feet.

Galaxy count may now top 2 trillion across universe,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Thought the universe was crowded with 100 billion to 200 billion galaxies? Try 1 trillion or even 2 trillion galaxies and more. Thats the latest census, reported Thursday. An astrophysics professor at the University of Nottingham in England led the international team that came up with the mind-boggling estimate of 2 trillion galaxies in the universe. Professor Christopher Conselice said that represents a minimum tenfold increase. In a phone interview, Conselice said he was surprised by the results. He anticipated two or three times more galaxies, perhaps, but 10 is quite high and it could prove to be even greater. The scientists based their galaxy head count on deep-space surveys already conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope and ground observatories. They turned the images into 3-D and used new mathematical models for the update. It boggles the mind that over 90 percent of the galaxies in the universe have yet to be studied, Conselice said in a statement. Who knows what interesting properties we will find when we discover these galaxies with future generations of telescopes? Even scientists have trouble wrapping their minds around such huge numbers. According to Conselice, 2 trillion is roughly equivalent to the number of seconds in 1,000 average lifetimes. The findings are being reported in Astrophysical Journal. ___ Online: Space Telescope Science Institute: http://www.stsci.edu/portal/",https://apnews.com/galaxy-count-may-now-top-2-trillion-across-universe-7df0ecfc78c94ce1a76d2ccc116e2bd7,science
Rocket launch reignites space station deliveries in Virginia,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

It was the first flight of Orbital ATKs unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. It is great to be back, said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATKs space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as magnificent and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. Its been a very difficult two years, and I cant imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I cant imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight, Bolden told the launch control crowd. But you know, we made it and thats whats all important. 
        
     Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATKs Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus  named after the swan constellation  will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. Thats because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another companys rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASAs other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last months rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Culbertson and other Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Although it took longer to resume flights at Wallops than expected, he noted, it was done right, and that was the most important thing. NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russias Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1 weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/rocket-launch-reignites-space-station-deliveries-in-virginia-2cc08b4af93c468eb5d9fda1fab9f41d,science
SpaceX closer to understanding rocket explosion at pad,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX said Friday its closer to understanding last months rocket explosion at the launch pad and aims to resume flights by years end. The company already had targeted the rockets helium system as being breached. On Friday, SpaceX said the investigation has been further narrowed to one of the pressurized helium containers, located in the second-stage oxygen tank. In recent testing, SpaceX said its managed to recreate a system failure, noting it can happen entirely through helium-loading conditions, namely temperature and pressure. More tests are planned at SpaceX facilities in Texas to identify the precise cause. The unmanned Falcon rocket erupted in a fireball Sept. 1 during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Both the rocket and the satellite on board were destroyed. Facebook had wanted to use the Israeli-made satellite to spread internet access in Africa. It was the second Falcon failure in just over a year for Elon Musk, the billionaire behind SpaceX. In June 2015, a rocket loaded with space station supplies erupted shortly after liftoff. Company officials said the two accidents were unrelated, although the 2015 loss also originated in the upper-stage helium system. In that instance, a support strut broke. SpaceXs efforts are now focused on two areas - finding the exact root cause, and developing improved helium loading conditions that allow SpaceX to reliably load Falcon 9, the company said on its web site. This is an important milestone on the path to returning to flight. 
        
     Falcon rockets have been grounded as SpaceX conducts the investigation along with NASA, the Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and industry experts. The California-based company has about 70 launches in line, worth more than $10 billion. The September explosion  which occurred as the rocket was being fueled for a test-firing of its engines  damaged the SpaceX launch pad. Until repairs can be completed, the company has the option of launching from its soon-to-be-modified pad at neighboring Kennedy Space Center  once used by NASAs moon rockets and space shuttles  or from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Besides launching commercial satellites, SpaceX hauls supplies to the International Space Station for NASA and is developing a bigger Falcon capable of flying astronauts to the orbiting lab in another year or two. Less than two weeks ago, NASAs other major shipper, Orbital ATK, resumed launches from Wallops Island, Virginia, following an explosion of its Antares rocket soon after liftoff in 2014. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-071938a1eddd4be58797327c778ff345,science
One-year spaceman sees mission as steppingstone to Mars,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  As soon as he returns from the International Space Station, NASAs first and only yearlong spaceman, Scott Kelly, will try to pop up from a lying position and stand still for three minutes. Hell take a crack at a mini-obstacle course and attempt to walk a straight line, heel to toe  all so researchers can see whether hed hit the ground running if this were Mars instead of Earth. NASA considers it crucial prep work for future Mars explorers who will have to spend much longer in space and wont have the help of a welcoming committee. In fact, this mission  which began with a launch last March  is all about Mars. I think well learn a lot about longer-duration spaceflight and how that will take us to Mars someday, Kelly said Thursday in his final news conference from orbit. So Id like to think that this is another of many steppingstones to us landing on Mars sometime in our future. Kellys 340-day mission  the longest by 125 days for NASA  comes to a dramatic end Wednesday on the remote steppes of Kazakhstan. (It will be Tuesday night in the U.S.) The astronaut will ride a Soyuz spacecraft back with two Russians, including Mikhail Kornienko, his roommate for the past year. Once out of the capsule, the two will submit to a multitude of field tests. What could new arrivals do on Mars, asks Dr. Stevan Gilmore, the lead flight surgeon who will be at the landing site to receive Kelly. Could they jump up and down? Could they open a hatch? Could they do an immediate spacewalk? 
        
     The tests on Kelly and Kornienko should provide some answers. There will also be blood draws, heart monitoring and other medical exams. The testing will continue for weeks if not months once theyre back home in Houston and at cosmonaut headquarters at Star City, Russia. Checkups will also continue for Kellys identical twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. The 52-year-old brothers joined forces to provide NASA with a potential gold mine of scientific data: one twin studied for a year in orbit  twice the usual space station stay  while his genetic double underwent similar tests on the ground. While a handful of Russians have spent longer in space, the record being a 438-day flight, those expeditions date back to the 1980s and 1990s aboard the Mir space station, rustic if not rickety compared with the current space station. Medical testing was spotty back then, and the data werent always widely shared. As of Thursday  Day 335  Kelly professed to feeling pretty good. Indeed, flight surgeon Gilmore doesnt expect any alarming results at touchdown. Kellys vision has degraded a bit as it did during his last mission, a normal outcome for some astronauts because of increased pressure inside the skull in weightlessness. He anticipates his bones and muscles have weakened as well, despite daily exercise in orbit. The real question mark  and Kellys biggest concern  is the possible lingering effects of space radiation. Hopefully, Ill never find out what the true effects are of that, Kelly said in a TV interview last week. NASA will need to tackle the problem for Mars trips because of the increased level of exposure. Johnson Space Center physiologist John Charles puts the psychological side of long-duration spaceflight right up there with radiation, as well as in-flight medical care and even food preservation and packaging for the long haul. Just about everything is a big problem for Mars, Charles said in a phone interview. Mars expeditions planned for the 2030s will last 2 years; the anticipated crew size will be four to six. The astronauts will almost certainly have to grow some of their own food; thats the reason for an experimental greenhouse aboard the space station. Kelly and his crewmates grew red romaine lettuce in the mini-hothouse last summer and sampled some of the crop. Even more impressive, Kelly nursed zinnias back to health in January, displaying a lush orange and yellow bouquet on Valentines Day. He had to channel my inner Mark Watney  the lone astronaut who survives on potatoes in last years blockbuster movie The Martian  to save the zinnias from mold. Trust me when to add water, Kelly urged Mission Control, not some preflight script. Thats how it will need to be when astronauts venture to Mars, he gently reminded everyone. Charles stresses that Mars travel will be different than a space station stay. No regular phone chats with the husbands, wives and kids back home. No constant whispering in the astronauts ears from Mission Control. Support would come via email. Theyre going to be highly autonomous, Charles said of the Mars explorers, and thats something that were trying to practice on the space station now ... learning how to get Mission Control out of the back pockets of the astronauts. Kelly points out that crew quarters on Mars-bound craft will be much tighter than the space station  and nothing like the spaceships of science fiction. Between sleeping and working on his laptop, Kelly estimates hes spent almost half his time inside his personal cubicle  about the size of a phone booth. NASA will need to improve privacy on Mars missions, he said, if it hopes to combat crew stress and fatigue. The toughest part for Kelly has been the physical isolation from everyone he loves, 250 miles below him. But on a trip to Mars, tens of millions of miles away, astronauts wont be able to even see Earth. Obviously going to Mars, there are a lot of other challenges, but none of these we cant overcome, Kelly said. NASA is discussing doing more one-year flights with the other countries involved in the station program; more subjects are needed for a better understanding of all the challenges. Its a long time, no matter how you cut it. Just ask Kelly, who recently acknowledged, a year now seems longer than I thought it would be. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/1ym/",https://apnews.com/one-year-spaceman-sees-mission-as-steppingstone-to-mars-6fb3d8bea66a4fc7bbce296d5f43f285,science
NASA spaceman back from record year flight; gives thumbs up,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronaut Scott Kelly returned to Earth on Wednesday after an unprecedented year in space for NASA, landing in barren Kazakhstan with a Russian cosmonaut who shared his whole space station journey. Their Soyuz capsule parachuted onto the central Asian steppes and ended a science-rich mission at the International Space Station that began last March and was deemed a steppingstone to Mars. It was a triumphant homecoming for Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko after 340 days in space. Kelly pumped his fist as he emerged from the capsule, then gave a thumbs-up. He smiled and chatted with his doctors and others as photographers crushed around him in the freezing cold. The air feels great out here, NASA spokesman at the scene, Rob Navias, quoted Kelly as saying. I have no idea why you guys are all bundled up. Clearly animated and looking well, he said he didnt feel much different than he did after his five-month station mission five years ago. Kelly and Kornienko had checked out of the space station 3 hours earlier. In total, they traveled 144 million miles through space, circled the world 5,440 times and experienced 10,880 orbital sunrises and sunsets during the longest single spaceflight by an American. Kelly posted one last batch of sunrise photos Tuesday on Twitter, before quipping, I gotta go! His final tweet from orbit came several hours later: The journey isnt over. Follow me as I rediscover # Earth! 
        
     Piloting the Soyuz capsule home for Kelly, 52, and Kornienko, 55, was the much fresher and decade younger cosmonaut Sergey Volkov, whose space station stint lasted the typical six months. The two yearlong spacemen faced a series of medical tests following touchdown. Before committing to even longer Mars missions, NASA wants to know the limits of the human body for a year, minus gravity. As he relinquished command of the space station Monday, Kelly noted that he and Kornienko have been up here for a really, really long time and have been jokingly telling one another, We did it! and We made it! A year now seems longer than I thought it would be, Kelly confided a couple weeks ago. Not quite a year  340 days to be precise, based on the Russian launch and landing schedule. But still record-smashing for NASA. Kellys closest U.S. contender trails him by 125 days. Russia continues to rule, however, when it comes to long-duration spaceflight. The world record of 438 days was set by a Russian doctor during the mid-1990s. A really smart person said to me one time, Teamwork makes the dreamwork in spaceflight, and spaceflight is the biggest team sport there is, Kelly said Monday. He acknowledged each of the 13 U.S., Russian, European and Japanese space fliers with whom he and Kornienko lived during the past year. Its incredibly important that we all work together to make what is seemingly impossible, possible. For NASA, that mission possible is Mars. Scientists are hoping for more one-year subjects as NASA gears up for human expeditions to Mars in the 2030s. Radiation will be a top challenge, along with the body and minds durability on what will be a 2-year journey round trip. With his one-year mission, Kelly has helped us take one giant leap toward putting boots on Mars, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement. The choice of the pioneering Kelly turned out to be a bonanza. His identical twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, offered himself up as a medical guinea pig so researchers could study the differences between the genetic doubles, one in space and the other on the ground. They provided blood, saliva and urine samples, underwent ultrasounds and bone scans, got flu shots and more, all in the name of science. My brother @StationCDRKelly is back home on our planet! Talk about aliens. Hes been off the planet for a year, Mark Kelly joked via Twitter. Kelly and Kornienko were due to split up later Wednesday. Kelly heads to Houston with two flight surgeons and several other NASA reps, arriving late Wednesday night. Thats where hell be reunited with his two daughters, ages 21 and 12; his girlfriend, a NASA public affairs representative at Johnson Space Center; and his brother and his brothers wife, former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Excited to welcome him back in Houston, Giffords tweeted. Kornienko returns to his home in Star City, Russia, near Moscow, to his wife, daughter and toddler grandson. Kelly has spent more time in space, altogether, than any other American: 520 days over the course of four missions. Realizing this is likely his last journey, it was a little bittersweet saying goodbye to his orbiting home. Hell have plenty of pictures, at least, for the scrapbook  he posted 1,000 dramatic, color-drenched pictures of Earth on his Twitter and Instagram accounts. What a ride he took us on! fellow astronaut Reid Wiseman said in a tweet from Houston. Those of us who dream of sending astronauts to deep space thank Scott Kelly for his sacrifice, said Jim Green, director of planetary science for NASA, and are thrilled to welcome him home. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew/ Kellys photos: http://windowsonearth.org",https://apnews.com/nasa-spaceman-back-from-record-year-flight-gives-thumbs-up-f9320bd2886746359f7880a4cae0923f,science
"Yearlong spaceman plunges into pool: Man, that feels good","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs yearlong spaceman Scott Kelly took a long-anticipated plunge Thursday, jumping into his backyard pool, astronaut outfit and all. Oh, man, that feels good, Kelly said as he floated to the surface. After nearly a year of space sponge baths, Kelly didnt even take time to change out of his blue flight suit. He walked right up to the edge of the pool, tilted sideways and fell in. It was still dark outside early Thursday morning in Houston  hed been yearning for this moment throughout his U.S- record setting mission. A video of his plunge was posted to his Twitter account Thursday, a day after his return from the International Space Station. Theres no place like home, he tweeted. Kelly  looking and acting remarkably hearty after 340 days in space  was reunited with his family earlier in the morning in Houston after a flight from Kazakhstan, where his mission ended. Kellys girlfriend, Johnson Space Center public affairs representative Amiko Kauderer, and his two daughters, ages 20 and 12, rushed into his arms after he exited the NASA jet. His identical twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, and their father were next to greet him. Also welcoming him home: Marks wife, former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. This last leg of his journey, by plane, took a whole day because of weather delays. So it was in the wee hours  27 hours after returning to Earth in a Russian Soyuz capsule  when Kelly finally got to Houstons Ellington Airport near Johnson Space Center. 
        
     Im used to going 17,500 mph, but this airplane doesnt do quite that, Kelly joked at a brief welcoming ceremony attended by Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden. She brought him a gift of beer from President Barack Obama and some apple pie. Nothings more American than that! she said. Kelly noted that when he left Houston in February last year, he was still 50. Now hes 52, thanks to his Feb. 21st birthday. It was a very long trip, he said. But it feels great. Its great to be back in Texas on U.S. soil. Before he could go home to his own bed  and his own pool  Kelly had to detour to Johnson to endure more medical tests to measure his bodys adaptation to gravity. The main reason for the long trip  double the usual station stint  was so NASA could gather data that will keep future Mars explorers healthy and happy during the 2-year expeditions planned for the 2030s and beyond. His brother took part in many of the studies as a ground control and unprecedented genetic double. The Russian cosmonaut with whom Kelly spent the year in space  Mikhail Kornienko  is undergoing his own medical checkups back home in Star City, Russia. The Russians hold the world record for days in space  438  set back in the mid-1990s at the former Mir space station. Next up for Kelly: a news conference at Johnson on Friday and a continuing series of tests, expected to last for months and possibly a year. Ditto for his brother. After 340 days off the planet and 5,400 times around it, Mark proudly tweeted, its good to have you home, @StationCDRKelly. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew/",https://apnews.com/yearlong-spaceman-plunges-into-pool-man-that-feels-good-b5e0b485a3d148e6915017349e5a3d01,science
"1-year spaceman: Tired, joints ache, cant sink basketball","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Fresh from a year in space, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly said Friday his muscles and joints ache. His skin is so sensitive it burns when he sits or walks. And he cant sink a basketball shot. Hes surprised  not necessarily about his basketball skills, but everything else. After his previous half-year space station mission five years ago, he wasnt nearly this tired or sore. Adjusting to space is easier than adjusting to Earth for me, he said at his first postflight news conference Friday. Like other astronauts, he got taller in space. He said he gained 1 inches. But he lost it almost as soon as he stood on solid ground. Kelly returned from the International Space Station on Wednesday, ending a 340-day mission that set a U.S. record. It took him a full day to get back home from the landing site in Kazakhstan to Houston. Thats when the aches and pains set in  this from the guy who hopped out of his space capsule and later promptly jumped into his backyard pool. Initially, he felt better than last time, but that quickly changed. The 52-year-old astronaut said because his skin hasnt had significant contact with anything for so long  in space, clothes just float around you  its very, very sensitive. Its almost like a burning feeling wherever I like sit or lie or walk. Im not wearing these shoes all the time, he said, kicking up his right foot, which sported a shiny black dress shoe. I just wore them for you guys. Thick running shoes are his preference these days; they make his feet feel a little bit better. 
        
     As for the culture shock of being back on Earth, Kelly expects that will hit soon. From having so little on the space station and so few choices about what youre going to do every day, whats available to you, to basically having just about anything, he told reporters. His first food back on Earth? A banana he found on his bed aboard the plane. He didnt realize the irony until he ate half of it; he cavorted around the space station a few weeks ago in a gorilla suit, a gag gift from his identical twin, Mark, a retired astronaut. The genetic doubles  one in space, one on the ground  took part in medical studies throughout the flight. NASA wants to know how the body and mind adjust to long periods in space before sending astronauts to Mars; expeditions are planned for the 2030s. NASAs chief space station scientist, Julie Robinson, said shed ideally like 10 or 12 astronauts to spend extra-long periods in space to know what all the risks might be. Johnson Space Center physiologist Dr. John Charles said he was impressed Kelly managed to complete all his physical exercises  standing up suddenly, walking heel-to-toe, navigating an obstacle course  immediately after touchdown. Hed likely fare well on Mars, scrambling to get out of a spacecraft on his own, taking a fast spacewalk and settling in, according to Charles and Mark Kelly. Hed be a good example of somebody who could probably make that trip to Mars for six months and then in a short period of time, do some reasonable work, observed Mark Kelly. Round trip, a Mars mission would last 2 years. Kellys companion for the entire space journey, cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, 55, is back home in Star City, Russia, dealing with his own adjustments to gravity. Many of their blood, urine and saliva samples are still up on the space station, frozen. NASA must wait until its commercial shipper SpaceX is delivering back and forth again  following a launch accident last summer  to get the scientific treasure trove, hopefully in May. Charles expects it will take the next year to analyze all the data. During his year in space, Kelly sent back dazzling photos of Earth and chronicled his space days on Twitter, attracting more than 1 million followers. He partnered with his girlfriend, Amiko Kauderer, a public affairs representative at Johnson, to set social media ablaze. Kelly holds the U.S. record for total days in space  520 days over four missions. He doubts hell fly again for NASA. But perhaps in the next 20 years, youll be able to just buy a cheap ticket, go for a little visit. Ill never be done with space, he said. I will always be involved. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew/",https://apnews.com/1-year-spaceman-tired-joints-ache-cant-sink-basketball-97ff75331d14483c93a2ba105ce6e5dd,science
NASA salvages Mars mission that should have launched by now,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs next Mars mission is still alive. Instead of scrapping the grounded Mars InSight spacecraft, the space agency announced Wednesday its shooting for a 2018 launch. The robotic lander was supposed to lift off this month, but ended up sidelined in December by a leak in a key French instrument. Project managers said the device should be redesigned in time. May 2018 represents the next available launch window. Opportunities to launch to Mars arise just every two years, based on the alignment of Earth and its neighbor. The InSight spacecraft aims to study the interior of Mars by drilling deep within. The sensors for the French seismometer need to operate in a vacuum chamber in order to measure subtle ground movements. The vacuum chamber was leaking. The other main science instrument, a German heat-flow probe, was ready to fly. Its unknown how much the two-year delay will cost. NASAs only other option was to kill the project. John Grunsfeld, head of NASAs science mission directorate, said the scientific goals are compelling and the repair plans are sound. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, will take over the redesign, building and testing of the vacuum chamber, while the French space agency focuses on the science instrument itself. The quest to understand the interior of Mars has been a long-standing goal of planetary scientists for decades, Grunsfeld said in a statement. Were excited to be back on the path for a launch, now in 2018. 
        
     Mars is NASAs prime focus these days. Just last week, astronaut Scott Kelly completed a 340-day mission at the International Space Station thats considered a scientific steppingstone for sending humans to the red planet in the 2030s. Another NASA Mars lander  this one a car-sized, wheeled rover  is scheduled for a 2020 launch. The red planet already is teeming with active spacecraft, including NASAs Opportunity and Curiosity rovers on the surface, and Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Maven orbiter from high above. Europe has its Express spacecraft in orbit around the red planet. Europe is launching another Mars mission Monday from Kazakhstan  an orbiter for measuring atmospheric gases and a lander collectively known as ExoMars 2016. ___ Online: NASA: http://insight.jpl.nasa.gov/home.cfm",https://apnews.com/fl-state-wire-ca-state-wire-3b6cc8e7373c4531972f679a2732c8a6,science
Star astronaut Scott Kelly: Time right to retire from NASA,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  After 20 years with NASA, Americas star astronaut Scott Kelly says its time to move on. Hes already hopped on the speaker circuit but is saving the serious job discussions for retirement, coming up in just two weeks. You need to leave when the times right for you  and the time is right for me, Kelly said in an interview with The Associated Press. The 52-year-old Kelly announced his retirement last Friday, just nine days after returning from a yearlong, record-breaking mission at the International Space Station. The astronaut said he doesnt have a full-time job lined up yet despite plenty of offers. Hell have more flexibility to pursue goals, he said, once hes no longer a civil servant after April 1. But hell still be available for NASA debriefings and medical tests. NASA will only have to pay me $10 an hour instead of $70 an hour, so theyre getting a good deal, Kelly said. This just allows me to meet my NASA responsibilities, but do other things. Speaking by phone Wednesday from Houston  where he plans to stay put at least for now  Kelly said he doubts his bosses at Johnson Space Center were surprised when he informed them last week that he would be leaving. After four missions, he hadnt expected to fly again for NASA. I even told my bosses that Id love to work as a part-timer, Kelly said, perhaps as a contractor flying NASA planes. I would love to stay as involved with human spaceflight as I can. Im a huge believer in it. 
        
     Hell continue to be a medical test subject, along with his identical twin, Mark, who retired as an astronaut soon after the shuttle program ended in 2011. Mark agreed to take part in an unprecedented twins study that got underway well before Scotts launch last year from Kazakhstan. Researchers are comparing the space twin with his ground-bound genetic double, on the lookout for any physical changes. Both Navy pilots, NASA chose them as astronauts in April 1996. Next week, Kelly heads to Russia, where hell be reunited with the cosmonaut who shared his 340-day space station mission, Mikhail Kornienko. The pair will undergo debriefings with Russian space officials, like their NASA counterparts, keenly interested in the effects of long-duration spaceflight as Mars beckons. The mission set a U.S. record for a single spaceflight; Russia still holds the world record of 438 days, set back in the 1990s aboard the Mir station. Kelly also holds the U.S. record for most time spent accumulatively in space: 520 days over four missions. Like his brother, Scott Kelly has signed on with a speakers bureau. Hes already booked as keynote speaker at a credit union conference at Walt Disney World in April. Ill certainly do a lot of public speaking and talk about the space program, he said. Kelly is looking forward to spending more time with his two daughters, ages 12 and 21. The youngest lives in Virginia Beach with her mother, who is divorced from Kelly; the oldest lives in Houston. Until this month, hed been training for or flying NASA missions almost continuously for 10 years. Ten years is a long time. A years actually a long time  I just realized how long a year is, he said, chuckling. He described being off the planet for a year like an eternity. By contrast, its been kind of a blur since he landed March 2 in Kazakhstan, going from one medical test and debrief to another, with just one day off at home. His legs are still swollen and sore; the ankles, knees and hips are stiff, the results of so much time in weightlessness. Its slowly getting better, Kelly said. No part of him wishes he were still up on the space station, but he wont rule out a return to orbit one day on the burgeoning commercial side. I tell you what, he said, I probably will not go a day in my life ever again without thinking about the folks who are in space and how difficult a job it is. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew",https://apnews.com/star-astronaut-scott-kelly-time-right-to-retire-from-nasa-f7ad9e077a634608b4426cbf000a3ced,science
Space station delivery rich in science and technology,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A space station supply ship is set to blast off Tuesday night with a commercial-quality 3-D printer for astronaut as well as public use  for a price  and the makings for a large-scale fire. Dont worry: The blaze is for scientific purposes only and wont ignite until the unmanned craft is clear of the International Space Station at missions end. NASA project manager Gary Ruff said this blaze will be second in size only to the 1997 fire on the Russian Mir space station, which was caused by a defective oxygen-generating canister. Orbital ATKs capsule, named Cygnus after the swan constellation, holds nearly 8,000 pounds of station supplies for NASA. One-fourth of that is scientific research, including robotic grippers inspired by the tiny, sticky hair on geckos feet. An Atlas rocket provided by United Launch Alliance will provide the ride from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Excellent weather is forecast for the 11:05 p.m. launch. A look at some of the experiments bound for the space station and its six-man crew: ___ FIRE ON BOARD NASA will deliberately set a fire inside the trash-packed Cygnus cargo ship, once it leaves the space station in May and is a safe distance away. Researchers want to understand how a fire spreads in weightlessness  how fast and how big does it get? The goal is to improve fire safety on future spacecraft. An electrical igniter will be used to light a yard-long cotton-fiberglass sheet inside a box. The burn should last 15 to 20 minutes, with a pair of cameras recording the flames and sensors making measurements. A week or so later, the capsule will burn up as planned over the Pacific. The test is called Saffire, short for Spacecraft Fire Experiment. 3-D SPACE PRINTS, ANYONE? 
        
     This new 3-D printer is an update to one launched to the space station in 2014. Northern California-based company Made In Space says the new printer is bigger and better. The first printer created items no bigger than an iPhone, this new printer will churn out items as big as an iPad mini. It will be controlled from the ground, with minimal input from the astronauts. The intention is to make 3-D items as needed for real-time use. But the company also is leasing the printer for groups interested in creating customized 3-D items in space. Some of the items will be returned to Earth aboard SpaceX Dragon capsules, according to the company. METEOR SHOWERS UP CLOSE A new camera will provide high-definition video of meteors entering Earths atmosphere. It should be ready to go well before the Perseids meteor shower in August. Southwest Research Institutes Michael Fortenberry and his team want to analyze the chemical composition of incoming meteors. This is the third attempt to get the experiment to the space station; the first was destroyed in an Orbital launch explosion in 2014, the second in a SpaceX launch accident last June. SLIP-SLIDING AWAY A spacecraft landing on an asteroid will need to anchor itself to avoid floating away, given the exceedingly low gravity. The question is: Will the anchor stay put or yank free? Researchers hope to better understand the loose, gravelly asteroid surface with a NASA experiment known as Strata. Theyve pulverized a hunk of meteorite discovered in Africa to simulate the surface material found on airless asteroids; 400 grams are on board. Silica glass shards also are making the trip, along with other materials stored in tubes, so researchers can see how they move around in weightlessness. GECKO GRIPPERS Some of natures best grippers can be found on the feet of geckos. Researchers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have based their new mechanical spring-loaded grippers on the thousands of tiny sticky hairs found on geckos feet. Five handheld grippers will be tested on the space station; one will remain on board an entire year. Researchers envision using these so-called Gecko Grippers for robots hands and feet, allowing them to crawl around the outside of a spacecraft to perform inspections or repairs. The reusable grippers can be turned on and off, and adhere to multiple surfaces, making them ideal for future space station use, according to NASA scientist Pete Hasbrook. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-va-state-wire-fl-state-wire-ca-state-wire-c6c4611d479c42c38d9554080c214720,science
Space station cargo launches by light of nearly full moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Fresh supplies shipped out late Tuesday for the International Space Station, where the shelves finally are getting full after a string of failed deliveries. Launching beneath the light of a nearly full moon, the unmanned Atlas V rocket provided late-night sparkle as it headed north with its precious cargo and paralleled the East Coast on its way to orbit. Orbital ATKs Cygnus capsule holds nearly 8,000 pounds of food, equipment and scientific research for NASA, including a commercial-quality 3-D printer anyone can rent and experimental robotic grippers modeled after the thousands of sticky hairs on geckos feet. As usual, some surprises were tucked away for the six space station astronauts, who should receive the delivery Saturday. Maybe theyll find a few Easter eggs on board, who knows? Frank Culbertson, Orbital ATKs space systems president, said with a smile early Wednesday. He said he didnt want to give away too much, in case the crew got wind of it. Theres also a fire experiment that will remain on the Cygnus. Researchers will ignite a large-scale blaze, in a contained box, to see how it spreads in weightlessness. The fire will not be set until the Cygnus departs the space station in May, full of trash for a destructive re-entry. Named after the swan constellation, the Cygnus is one of two commercial vehicles used to stock the 250-mile-high space station. Both haulers have lost shipments to rocket failures over the past 1 years and are still working to catch up. A Russian shipment also ended up destroyed. 
        
     Orbital ATK has been using another companys Atlas rockets to keep the station supplies flowing in the wake of its October 2014 launch explosion at Wallops Island, Virginia. This is the second Cygnus assigned to an Atlas; the first flew from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in December. The company hopes to resume supply runs from Wallops this summer with its own Antares rockets. SpaceX, meanwhile, is aiming for an April 8 launch of its Dragon cargo carrier; the last one was destroyed in a June launch accident. It will be the first time both a Cygnus and Dragon are at the orbiting outpost at the same time. Orbital ATK named this capsule after the late Rick Husband, commander of the doomed space shuttle Columbia. He piloted the first shuttle docking at the International Space Station, in 1999. His widow and two children were on hand for the launch. Godspeed SS Rick D Husband! astronaut Terry Virts said in a tweet from NASAs Mission Control in Houston. NASA contracted out space station cargo deliveries  and beginning as early as next year, crew taxi flights  to concentrate on getting humans to Mars in the 2030s. Earlier this month, U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly returned from a yearlong stay at the station, helping to push that goal forward. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com",https://apnews.com/general-news-b3e1bfb4eecf499b802ef73b0ecaff9c,science
"Space station getting inflatable room, a cosmic 1st","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Forget blowup air mattresses. Space station astronauts are getting their first inflatable room. Its a technology demo meant to pave the way for moon bases and Mars expeditions, as well as orbiting outposts catering to scientists and tourists in just a few more years. Bigelow Aerospace is behind the experiment, which will get a ride to the International Space Station with another private space company. An unmanned SpaceX Falcon rocket is set to launch late Friday afternoon, carrying a capsule full of supplies with the pioneering pod in its trunk. It will be SpaceXs first station delivery since a launch accident halted shipments last June. Once attached to the station, the soft-sided Bigelow compartment will be inflated to the size of a small bedroom. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, BEAM for short, will stay there for two years  with astronauts occasionally ducking in. It will be the first time an astronaut steps inside an expandable habitat structure in space. Its not just historic for our company, which obviously is the case, but I think its historic for the architecture, said Robert Bigelow, founder and president of Bigelow Aerospace and owner of Budget Suites of America. As a precursor to larger systems, Bigelow said BEAM could change the entire dynamic for human habitation in space. He hopes to have a pair of private space stations ready for launch by 2020. 
        
     In the meantime, companies even countries  are clamoring to put their own experiments inside the empty BEAM, Bigelow said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. If everything goes well, that next commercial step could happen in perhaps six months, he said. The North Las Vegas-based company wont divulge the material used for BEAMs outer layers  or even how many layers  just that the layers are spread out to absorb and break up any penetrating bits of space junk. Back when NASA was working on the technology in the 1990s, a combination of Nextel, Kevlar, foam and other fabric formed the multilayer shield. NASA called its project TransHab, for Transit Habitat. It never flew to space, despite elaborate blueprints and ground mock-ups. Designers envisioned an inflatable, four-level compartment, complete with dining, sleeping and exercising areas for station crews. Congress canceled TransHab in 2000 and Bigelow Aerospace bought the patent from NASA. The company launched a pair of expandable spacecraft a decade ago from Russia as an experiment. Called Genesis I and II, theyre still orbiting. NASA, meanwhile, paid Bigelow Aerospace $17.8 million for the upcoming test flight, making the BEAM the most affordable module ever launched to the space station, said Michael Gold, director of operations and business growth for Bigelow Aerospace. Expandable habitats like BEAM, officials noted, need to be just as strong  or stronger  than the standard metal cylinders that make up the current space station. BEAM has proven to be equal or better against space debris than metal, said NASA project manager Rajib Dasgupta. Bigelow goes as far as to say: The aluminum cans are antiquated. Beyond low-Earth orbit, radiation poses increased health risks to crews living inside aluminum walls. So inflatable spacecraft, he said, are cheaper, bigger, safer and, potentially, longer lasting. Bigelow said BEAM is nothing like a balloon  its not going to go bang  or even a football. Think steel belts in a car tire. Its pretty novel. The beauty of expandable habitats is their compactness for launch. BEAM will travel in the Dragon capsules unpressurized compartment; the space stations big robot arm will grab the structure and attach it to a berthing port. BEAM will expand four times in volume when it is inflated in late May or early June, with a little station air at first, then special inflation tanks. The collapsed BEAM measures about 7 feet long (2 meters) and 8 feet (2 meters) in diameter. Inflated, it will be about 13 feet long (4 meters) and 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, and provide 565 cubic feet (16 cubic meters) of space, about the size of a small bedroom. BEAM has been bundled up for more than a year  it should have flown last fall, but was delayed by the SpaceX rocket grounding. Bigelow stressed that the main purpose is testing and engineers dont know now how well it will work after being compressed for so long. The chamber will stay put for two years, providing measurements on radiation, impact resistance and temperature. Astronauts will venture inside four or so times a year to inspect surfaces, collect air and microbial samples, and change out sensors. Otherwise, the hatch will remain sealed. After two years, BEAM will be cut loose, eventually burning up on re-entry. Bigelow Aerospace has plans for a much larger expandable habitat B330, providing 11,654 cubic feet (330 cubic meters) of internal space, the size of a couple of buses. The company hopes to launch two of the B330s around 2020, providing opportunities for companies, schools, countries outside the space mainstream, and NASA, too, if it likes. In an artists rendering, the two habitats are linked in orbit. Then theres the companys envisioned Olympus, a supersize space station-hotel combo. NASA, meanwhile, imagines inflatable modules at Mars awaiting astronauts traveling in the traditional Orion spacecraft that is hooked up with inflatable compartments to ease the eight-month, one-way journey. Its an important piece to the human space exploration puzzle, Gold said. Regardless of where you go, you need a place to live and work. __ Online: Bigelow Aerospace: http://bigelowaerospace.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/space-station-getting-inflatable-room-a-cosmic-1st-9e8b182cbb6140e6a68401d0c5941736,science
Easter delivery: Cargo ship arrives at space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The six astronauts at the International Space Station got an early Easter treat this weekend with the arrival of a supply ship full of fresh food and experiments. Instead of the usual bunny, Saturdays delivery came via a swan  Orbital ATKs Cygnus capsule, named after the swan constellation. The cargo carrier rocketed away from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday night. NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra used the stations big robot arm to grab the capsule, as the two craft soared 250 miles above the Indian Ocean. Excellent work, gentlemen, Mission Control radioed. Four hours later, the capsule was bolted firmly to the complex. Its the first of three shipments coming up in quick succession. A Russian cargo ship will lift off Thursday, followed by a SpaceX supply run on April 8. NASA has turned to private industry to keep the space station stocked. The newly arrived Cygnus holds nearly 8,000 pounds of groceries, equipment and research. Among the newfangled science: robotic grippers modeled after geckos feet and the ingredients for a large-scale, controlled fire. A commercial-quality 3-D printer is packed inside as well; anyone will be able to order prints, for a price, from the Made In Space company. Virginia-based Orbital ATK hints Easter eggs may also be on board. The blaze  confined to a box inside the Cygnus  wont be set until the capsule departs in May with a load of trash. NASA researchers want to see how fast the cotton-fiberglass fabric burns, in hopes of improving future spacecraft safety. Following the experiment, the capsule will burn up, for real, during re-entry. 
        
     As it turns out, the Cygnus had an out-of-the-ordinary ride to orbit. The first-stage booster of the normally reliable unmanned Atlas V rocket stopped firing six seconds early, and the upper stage had to compensate by burning a minute longer, to get the capsule in the right orbit. Rocket maker United Launch Alliance has delayed its next launch, a military satellite mission, to figure out what went wrong. The commander of the doomed space shuttle Columbia, meanwhile, is being honored with this latest delivery. Orbital ATK named this Cygnus after Rick Husband, who piloted the first shuttle docking at the space station in 1999. He died aboard Columbia during re-entry in 2003, along with six other astronauts. Kopra called him a personal hero and said he was honored to welcome the S.S. Rick Husband aboard. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/",https://apnews.com/easter-delivery-cargo-ship-arrives-at-space-station-cc407d1862ea48d1abd247bd2dbff325,science
SpaceX delivers worlds 1st inflatable room for astronauts,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX has made good on a high-priority delivery: the worlds first inflatable room for astronauts. A SpaceX Dragon cargo ship arrived at the International Space Station on Sunday, two days after launching from Cape Canaveral. Station astronauts used a robot arm to capture the Dragon, orbiting 250 miles above Earth. The Dragon holds 7,000 pounds of freight, including the soft-sided compartment built by Bigelow Aerospace. The pioneering pod  packed tightly for launch  should swell to the size of a small bedroom once filled with air next month. It will be attached to the space station this Saturday, but wont be inflated until the end of May. The technology could change the way astronauts live in space: NASA envisions inflatable habitats in a couple decades at Mars, while Bigelow Aerospace aims to launch a pair of inflatable space stations in just four years for commercial lease. For now, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module  BEAM for short  will remain mostly off-limits to the six-man station crew. NASA wants to see how the experimental chamber functions, so the hatch will stay sealed except when astronauts enter a few times a year to collect measurements and swap out sensors. This is SpaceXs first delivery for NASA in a year. A launch accident last June put shipments on hold. SpaceX flight controllers at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, applauded when the hefty station arm plucked Dragon from orbit. A few hours later, the capsule was bolted securely into place. 
        
     It looks like we caught a Dragon, announced British astronaut Timothy Peake, who made the grab. There are smiles all around here, NASAs Mission Control replied. Nice job capturing that Dragon. SpaceX is still reveling in the success of Fridays booster landing at sea. For the first time, a leftover booster came to a solid vertical touchdown on a floating platform. SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk wants to reuse boosters to save money, a process that he says will open access to space for more people in more places, like Mars. His ambition is to establish a city on Mars. NASA also has Mars in its sights and looks to send astronauts there in the 2030s. In order to focus on that objective, the space agency has hired U.S. companies like SpaceX to deliver cargo and, as early as next year, astronauts to the space station. U.S. astronauts currently have to hitch rides on Russian rockets. In a sign of these new commercial space times, a Dragon capsule is sharing the station for the first time with Orbital ATKs supply ship named Cygnus, already parked there two weeks. This is also the first time in five years that the compound has six docking ports occupied: Dragon, Cygnus, two Russian Progress freighters and two Russian Soyuz crew capsules. The Dragon will remain at the station for a month before returning to Earth with science samples, many of them from one-year spaceman Scott Kelly. He ended his historic mission last month. Cygnus will stick around a little longer. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-b0124852290a4c9394e55529ca413e30,science
NASAs planet-hunting Kepler Spacecraft in emergency mode,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is trying to resuscitate its planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft, in a state of emergency nearly 75 million miles away. The treasured spacecraft  responsible for detecting nearly 5,000 planets outside our solar system  slipped into emergency mode sometime last week. The last regular contact was April 4; everything seemed normal then. Ground controllers discovered the problem Thursday, right before they were going to point Kepler toward the center of the Milky Way as part of a new kind of planetary survey. Kepler was going to join ground observatories in surveying millions of stars in the heart of our galaxy, in hopes of finding planets far from their suns, like our own outer planets, as well as stray planets that might be wandering between stars. This is the latest crisis in the life of Kepler. Launched in 2009, the spacecraft completed its primary mission in 2012. Despite repeated breakdowns, Kepler kept going on an extended mission dubbed K2  until now. The vast 75 million-mile distance between Kepler and Earth make it all the harder to fix. Even at the speed of light, it takes 13 minutes for a signal to travel to the spacecraft and back, mission manager Charlie Sobeck said in a weekend web update from NASAs Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. Recovering from this emergency condition is the teams priority at this time, Sobeck said. More than 1,000 of Keplers detected 5,000 exoplanets have been confirmed to date, according to NASA. Kepler is named after the 17th century German astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-b8810c82971e40a8b8661381d31e9044,science
SpaceXs recovered rocket back at port after sea landing,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The rocket that made a historic landing at sea last week is back at its home port. SpaceXs recovered 15-story booster, still standing tall on its floating platform, pulled into Floridas Port Canaveral before dawn Tuesday. The company plans to test-fire the engines 10 times. If everything looks good, the booster could be used again on another mission as early as June. SpaceX is the first company to land a rocket at sea. This particular first-stage booster hoisted space station supplies for NASA on Friday. Normally, it would have ended up at the bottom of the Atlantic. SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk says reusability is crucial for lowering launch costs and opening access to space. His dream is to build a city on Mars. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacexs-recovered-rocket-back-at-port-after-sea-landing-1ef8c96bcf2d4aaaabdf1527c2a0d857,science
British astronaut all set to run London Marathon from space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Britains first official spaceman, Timothy Peake, says hes ready to run the London Marathon in 1 weeks  from 250 miles up. But hes not expecting to set a PR, or personal record. The 44-year-old astronaut said hes glad hes had plenty of time to get used to the International Space Station treadmill. One of the biggest challenges, he said, is the harness he wears to keep his feet on the treadmill in weightlessness: It tends to rub his shoulders and waist. Its a great challenge that I set myself, and Im quite glad this is happening later on in the mission, said Peake, a space station resident since December. In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Peake said he has the harness fitting pretty well now, and hes got a few training half-marathons and a little longer under his space belt. The former British Army helicopter test pilot hopes to finish the 26.2-mile race on April 24 in under four hours  maybe even 3 hours and 30 or 45 minutes if Im feeling really good. Thats about 2  laps around Earth. He completed the London Marathon in about 3 hours and 15 minutes in 1999. Hell run at the same time as all the other estimated 38,000 marathoners, including several European Space Agency and UK Space Agency representatives who call themselves Team Astronaut. The point is to share in a little of Tims pain, said Jonathan Scott, head of the medical projects and technology team at ESAs space medicine office in Cologne, Germany. Scott will wear a replica Russian launch and entry spacesuit for the entire race  to significantly add to the Fun Factor, he explained in a web posting. A UK Space Agency employee, Libby Jackson, also will wear a spacesuit replica. 
        
     It will be the second space marathon: U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams took part in the 2007 Boston Marathon, finishing in just under 4 hours. Peakes U.S. crewmates, Jeffrey Williams and Timothy Kopra, promise to assist in any way they can. Well check in on him every now and then, and make sure he gets all the food and drink that he needs to make it through it, Williams told the AP. While he cant exactly carbo-load up there, Peake has managed to fill up on fruit this week: Fresh oranges and apples were aboard the SpaceX Dragon supply ship that arrived Sunday. Peake and his Team Astronaut colleagues on the ground are running the marathon for the Princes Trust, a charity set up by Prince Charles 40 years ago to train and educate disadvantaged young people in Britain. ___ Online: European Space Agency: http://www.esa.int/ESA",https://apnews.com/british-astronaut-all-set-to-run-london-marathon-from-space-c11dacaa8fb9445fbc686880deafdb7c,science
Hubble Telescope finds tiny moon orbiting dwarf planet,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Chalk up a moon for the icy dwarf planet Makemake. The Hubble Space Telescope has detected a tiny, dark moon circling the dwarf planet on the frozen fringes of our solar system. On Tuesday, scientists announced the discovery by some members of the team that spotted Plutos smaller moons years ago. Makemake itself is just 870 miles wide. Its moon  dubbed MK2  is a mere 100 miles across and more than 1,300 times fainter with its black surface. Makemake is named after the creation deity in the Rapa Nui mythology of Easter Island. Hubbles wide-field camera made the observations last April, spotting MK2 13,000 miles from Makemake. Previous searches were unsuccessful because of the glare from Makemake. Further observations will be needed to determine if MK2s orbit is circular or oval. Scientists said the discovery is further evidence that most dwarf planets way out in the Kuiper Belt  well beyond the orbit of Neptune  do, indeed, seem to have moons. MK2 will allow researchers to study Makemake in even greater detail, said Alex Parker of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who led the image analyses. It is a very exciting discovery! Parker said in an email. It means that Makemake is no longer the odd-one-out in the moon-hosting Kuiper Belt dwarf planet club, and it means that we can do detailed studies of the mass and density of Makemake that would have been impossible without the moon. Makemake is second to Pluto in brightness among the dwarf planets known to inhabit the Kuiper Belt. ___ Online: Space Telescope Science Institute: http://www.stsci.edu/portal/",https://apnews.com/hubble-telescope-finds-tiny-moon-orbiting-dwarf-planet-654266657b904a1c8e849d0ff89b0b70,science
3 planets orbiting dwarf star prime spots to search for life,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers searching for life beyond our solar system may need to look no farther than a little, feeble nearby star. A Belgian-led team reported Monday that its discovered three Earth-sized planets orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star less than 40 light-years away. Its the first time planets have been found around this type of star  and it opens up new, rich territory in the search for extraterrestrial life. Because this star is so close and so faint, astronomers can study the atmospheres of these three temperate exoplanets and, eventually, hunt for signs of possible life. Theyre already making atmospheric observations, in fact, using NASAs Spitzer Space Telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope will join in next week. Altogether, its a winning combination for seeking chemical traces of life outside our solar system, said Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Julien de Wit, a co-author of the study, released by the journal Nature. The star in question  named Trappist-1 after the Belgian telescope in Chile that made the discovery  is barely the size of Jupiter and located in the constellation Aquarius. Other exoplanet searches have targeted bigger, brighter stars more like our sun, but the starlight in these cases can be so bright that it washes out the signatures of planets. By comparison, cool dwarf stars that emit infrared light, like Trappist-1, make it easier to spot potential worlds. 
        
     University of Liege astronomers in Belgium  lead study authors Michael Gillon and Emmanuel Jehin  built the Trappist telescope to observe 60 of the nearest ultra-cool dwarf stars. The risky effort paid off, de Wit noted in an email. Systems around these tiny stars are the only places where we can detect life on an Earth-sized exoplanet with our current technology, Gillon said in a statement. So if we want to find life elsewhere in the universe, this is where we should start to look. The two inner exoplanets take between 1.5 and 2.4 days to orbit the Trappist-1 star. The precise orbit time of the third planet is not known, but it falls somewhere between 4.5 days and 73 days. That puts the planets 20 times to 100 times closer to their star than Earth is to our sun, Gillon noted. The setup is more similar in scale to Jupiters moons than to our solar system, he added. Although the two innermost planets are very close to the star, it showers them with only a few times the amount of energy that Earth receives from our own sun. The third exoplanet farther out may receive significantly less of such radiation than Earth does. The astronomers speculate the two inner exoplanets may have pockets where life may exist, while the third exoplanet actually might fall within the habitable zone  real estate located at just the right distance from a star in order to harbor water and, possibly, life. Spitzer and Hubble should answer whether the exoplanets have large and clear atmospheres, according to de Wit. They also might be able to detect water and methane, if molecules are present. Future observatories, including NASAs James Web Space Telescope set to launch in 2018, should unearth even more details. Gillon and his colleagues identified the three exoplanets by observing regular dips in the infrared signals emanating from the Trappist-1 star, some 36 light-years away. A single light-year represents about 6 trillion miles. The astronomers conducted the survey last year using the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope, or Trappist. Its considered a prototype for a more expansive European project that will widen the search for potentially habitable worlds to 500 ultra-cool stars. This upcoming project is dubbed Speculoos  short for Search for Habitable Planets Eclipsing Ultra-Cool Stars. ___ Online: Nature: http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html",https://apnews.com/3-planets-orbiting-dwarf-star-prime-spots-to-search-for-life-b1b9466b3cfb4438975bfd84f5096fee,science
Mercury a black speck as it makes rare transit of sun Monday,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Earthlings are in for a treat Monday as Mercury makes a relatively rare transit of the sun. The solar systems smallest, innermost planet will resemble a black round dot as it passes in front of our big, bright star. The last time Mercury crossed directly between the Earth and sun was in 2006, and it wont happen again until 2019  and then, until 2032. NASA says the event occurs only about 13 times a century. Louis Mayo, program manager at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, considers it a big deal. Astronomers get excited when any two things come close to each other in the heavens, Mayo said in a statement. The eastern U.S. and Canada will see the entire 7 1/2-hour transit, as will most of South America, western Europe and westernmost Africa. In the western portion of North America, stargazers can join in midway, at sunrise, while those in eastern Europe, central Asia, the Middle East and most of Africa will have to call it quits early when the sun goes down. Australia will have to sit this one out altogether. Forget eclipse glasses. At barely 3,000 miles across, Mercury would be too small to spot. Youll need binoculars or telescopes equipped with proper solar filters to protect your eyes. Look for Mercury south of the suns equator. The planet might appear as though its hardly moving, but in reality it will be zooming past the sun at nearly 106,000 mph. 
        
     Three spacecraft will observe the transit, so if you cant catch it with your own eyes, check out the space agency online . NASA promises images close to real time from its Solar Dynamic Observatory. Astronomers have been observing Mercury transits since the 1600s. Mondays occurrence will allow scientists to fine-tune instruments aboard solar observatories like SDO and learn even more about the sun. ___ Online: NASA: www.nasa.gov/transit",https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-1483ec838891444db1c8f89c38ff2245,science
Supermoon plus eclipse equals rare sky show Sunday night,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Get ready for a rare double feature, starring our very own moon. A total lunar eclipse will share the stage with a so-called supermoon Sunday night or early Monday, depending where you are. That combination hasnt been seen since 1982 and wont happen again until 2033. When a full or new moon makes its closest approach to Earth, thats a supermoon. Although still about 220,000 miles away, this full moon will look bigger and brighter than usual. In fact, it will be the closest full moon of the year, about 30,000 miles closer than the average distance. (The moons orbit is far from a perfect circle.) NASA planetary scientist Noah Petro is hoping the celestial event will ignite more interest in the moon. He is deputy project scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO, which has been studying the moon from lunar orbit since 2009. The moons a dynamic place, Petro said Wednesday. Were seeing changes on the surface of the moon from LRO. Were seeing that its not this static dead body in the sky ... its this great astronomical object that we have in our backyard, essentially. So people should get out and start looking at it. Many stargazers, professional and amateur alike, dislike the term supermoon, noting the visible difference between a moon and supermoon is slight to all but the most faithful observers. Its not like the difference between an ordinary man and Superman, said Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine. It really ought to be called a tiny, slightly little bit bigger moon, rather than the supermoon. 
        
     The full eclipse of the moon will last more than an hour and be visible, weather permitting, from North and South America, Europe, Africa and western Asia. Showtime on the U.S. East Coast is 10:11 p.m. EDT (0211 GMT); thats when the moon, Earth and sun will be lined up, with Earths shadow totally obscuring the moon. In Europe, the action will unfold before dawn Monday. No matter where, the preshow will begin two hours earlier. There wont be another total lunar eclipse until 2018. This eclipse marks the end of a tetrad, or series of four total lunar eclipses set six months apart. This series began in April 2014.

Life on Mars? NASA says planet appears to have flowing water,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Mars appears to have flowing rivulets of water, at least in the summer, scientists reported Monday in a finding that boosts the odds of life on the red planet. Mars is not the dry, arid planet that we thought of in the past, said Jim Green, director of planetary science for NASA. Scientists in 2008 confirmed the existence of frozen water on Mars. Now instruments aboard NASAs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have yielded what researchers said is the strongest evidence yet that water in liquid form trickles down certain Martian slopes. And because liquid water is essential to life, the finding could have major implications for the possibility of microscopic life forms on Earths next-door neighbor. It suggests that it would be possible for there to be life today on Mars, NASAs science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, said at a Washington news conference. The rivulets  if thats what they are, since the evidence for their existence is indirect  are about 12 to 15 feet wide and 300 feet or more long, scientists said. They apparently consist of wet soil, not standing water. The water is believed to contain certain salts  not ordinary table salt, but magnesium perchlorate, magnesium chlorate and sodium perchlorate. Like road salt used to melt ice and snow on Earth, such compounds can prevent water from freezing at extremely low temperatures. 
        
     That would explain how water could exist in liquid form on Mars, which has an average temperature of minus 81 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition to supporting life, the presence of liquid water could make things easier for astronauts visiting or living on Mars. Water could be used for drinking and for creating oxygen and rocket fuel. NASAs goal is to send humans there in the 2030s. Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASAs Mars exploration program, said the only definitive way for now to determine whether theres life on Mars is to collect rocks and soil for analysis on Earth, something a U.S. lander set for liftoff in 2020 will do. Water is one of the most precious resources necessary for a human mission to the red planet, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House science, space and technology committee, said in a statement. The more evidence we find of it, the more encouraged I am for future Mars missions. Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona at Tucson, a scientist on the project, said he, for one, believes the possibility of life on Mars to be very high. The source of the briny water is a mystery. Scientists said it could be melting ice, an underground aquifer, water vapor from the thin Martian atmosphere, or some combination. The evidence of flowing water consists largely of dark, narrow streaks on the surface that tend to appear and grow during the warmest Martian months and fade the rest of the year. The streaks are in places where the temperature is as low as 10 below zero. They were spotted by the Mars orbiters high-resolution, telescopic camera, and another on-board instrument detected the chemical signature of salt compounds combined with water. McEwen said that there appears to be a significant volume of water, speculating it could fill many Olympic swimming pools, but that it is spread thin. Present-day Mars is nothing like ancient Mars. Three billion years ago, our most Earthlike neighbor had a huge ocean, but something radical happened, and exactly what remains a mystery. The notion of water and life on Mars has been irresistible to earthlings for generations. In 1877, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli spied what he called canali on Mars  Italian for channels  but the word was mistranslated as canals in English, causing imaginations to run wild. In the early 1900s, amateur astronomer Percival Lowell claimed to have spotted irrigation canals and theorized they were built by Martians. In 2008, NASAs Phoenix spacecraft landed on Mars and confirmed the long-suspected presence of ice in the soil. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the planet since 2006. The latest findings were published in the journal Nature Geoscience. The lead author, Lujendra Ojha, a doctoral candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology, first noticed the streaks on Mars in 2010. Ojha and colleagues speculated at the time that they were seeing flowing water. For NASA, at least, the timing couldnt be better. This Friday, the NASA-approved movie The Martian has its premiere. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the average temperature on Mars is minus 81, not minus 85. ___ Online: NASA: http://mars.nasa.gov",https://apnews.com/general-news-b98512b9072949af8f5f12f5a9d6c9cd,science
"Blue sky and red ice at Pluto, NASA spacecraft discovers","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The sky over Pluto may not be sunny but its undoubtedly blue. NASAs New Horizons spacecraft discovered Plutos blue sky during the historic flyby of the icy dwarf planet in July. The images of Plutos atmospheric haze were beamed down last week and released by NASA on Thursday. The particles in the atmospheric haze are actually red and gray, according to scientists. But the way the particles scatter blue light is what has everyone excited about the dwarf planet orbiting on the far fringes of our solar system, a twilight zone known more formally as the Kuiper Belt. Who would have expected a blue sky in the Kuiper Belt? Its gorgeous, Alan Stern, the principal scientist for New Horizons, said in a NASA release about the latest images. The blue tint can help scientists understand the size and makeup of the haze particles surrounding Pluto, where twilight constantly reigns given the 3.6 billion-mile distance between it and the sun. Plutos high-altitude haze seems to be comparable to that of Saturns moon, Titan, according to NASA, and the result of interaction between molecules. In another finding Thursday, scientists have uncovered numerous ice patches on Plutos surface. The exposed water ice appears to be, mysteriously, red. Scientists said they are uncertain why the ice appears in certain places at Pluto and not others. Launched in 2006, New Horizons is now 63 million miles beyond Pluto. Johns Hopkins University in Maryland is operating the spacecraft for NASA. ___ Online: Johns Hopkins: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/",https://apnews.com/md-state-wire-fl-state-wire-7593557867d44bd9b7c4b0f913c5ac50,science
Faraway object being destroyed by real-life Death Star,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A white dwarf star in the Constellation Virgo turns out to be a death star worthy of Star Wars. Astronomers announced Wednesday that they have discovered a rocky object coming apart in a death spiral around this distant star. They used NASAs exoplanet-hunting Kepler spacecraft to make the discovery, then followed up with ground observations. This is something no human has seen before, said Andrew Vanderburg of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the lead author. Were watching a solar system get destroyed, he said in a statement. The data show the object in an orbit 520,000 miles (837,000 kilometers) from the white dwarf. Thats the approximate distance from the Earth to the moon, and back. Vanderburg and his team also found several additional chunks of orbiting material. Scientists believe the original object may have been a planet whose orbit became unstable, and was kicked inward. The pieces already are being vaporized by the white dwarf, located about 570 light-years from Earth, and will eventually be ripped apart. The fictional Death Star of Star Wars fame was the Empires monstrously big space arsenal capable of destroying an entire planet. The findings are being published this week in the journal Nature. ___ Online: Nature: http://www.nature.com/ Kepler: http://kepler.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/national-national-02236836cfcc48049f555c171464f252,science
NASAs New Horizons on new post-Pluto mission,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The spacecraft that gave us the first close-up views of Pluto now has a much smaller object in its sights. NASAs New Horizons was programmed to fire its thrusters Thursday afternoon, putting it on track to fly past a recently discovered, less than 30-mile-wide object out on the solar system frontier. The close encounter with whats known as 2014 MU69 would occur in 2019. It orbits nearly 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto. Flight controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, sent commands in advance for the course change. In all, four maneuvers will be needed, carried out over the next two weeks. Thursday afternoons was the first; it was expected to be several hours before controllers received confirmation that everything had gone well. Launched in 2006, New Horizons became Plutos first visitor from planet Earth in July. The spacecraft remains in excellent health following a 3 billion-mile (4.8 billion kilometer) journey and still holds a years worth of scientific data for transmission back to Earth. NASA and the New Horizons team chose 2014 MU69 in August as New Horizons next potential target, thus the nickname PT-1. Like Pluto, MU69 orbits the sun in the frozen, twilight zone known as the Kuiper Belt. The extremely remote, faint object was spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014. It beat out a few other candidates because it will take less fuel to get there. 
        
     MU69 is thought to be 10 times larger and 1,000 times more massive than average comets, including the one being orbited right now by Europes Rosetta spacecraft. On the other end, MU69 is barely 1 percent the size of Pluto and perhaps one-ten-thousandth the mass of the dwarf planet. So the new target is a good middle ground, according to scientists. Lead scientist Alan Stern said flight controllers still are working out just how close New Horizons will be able to zoom past MU69. The goal is to get closer than the 7,770 miles (12,500 billion kilometers) that the spacecraft came within Pluto. The team plans to formally ask NASA next year to fund the mission extension for studying MU69. Scientists promise a better name before showtime on Jan. 1, 2019. Although this flyby probably wont be as dramatic as the exploration of Pluto we just completed, Stern wrote in a blog earlier this month for Sky & Telescope magazine, it will be a record-setter for the most distant exploration of an object ever made. Johns Hopkins designed the spacecraft, about the size of a baby grand piano, and has been operating it for NASA. ___ Online: Johns Hopkins: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/",https://apnews.com/nasas-new-horizons-on-new-post-pluto-mission-f3c16918bd7b445d8fd581640197590a,science
Story Time from Space: Astronauts getting new picture books,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Once upon a time, when NASAs shuttles were still flying, an astronaut read a childrens story from space. Thus was born Story Time from Space, a program that takes bedtime stories to new heights in its effort to get children excited about science. The latest bundle of picture books, mostly about space, is scheduled to rocket to the International Space Station in just over a month, joining five bedtime stories already there. The astronaut readings are posted online, available at any time for children to see. The delivery, targeted for December, was delayed a year because of a Virginia launch explosion. Another launch accident, this one from Cape Canaveral in June, destroyed a set of science experiments meant to supplement the stories. As always, theres a moral to these hard-luck launch tales. One of the big takeaways from spaceflight is that it takes a fair amount of patience and just perseverance to make these things happen, said Alvin Drew, the astronaut who kicked off the Story Time project during space shuttle Discoverys final flight in 2011. A cool plot twist: Two of the seven picture books going up  Mousetronaut and Mousetronaut Goes to Mars  were written by a former astronaut whose identical twin just happens to be spending a year in orbit. If Mark Kellys books arrive at the space station by years end, his brother, Scott, should be able to read them on camera before his one-year space mission ends in March. 
        
     It was such a neat opportunity, Story Times creator, Patricia Tribe, said of the Kelly brothers connection. Also going up: ex-astronaut John (Danny) Olivas Endeavours Long Journey. Author-astronomer Jeffrey Bennetts latest childrens book, I, Humanity will join his dog-in-space Max series already at the orbiting lab. An English schoolboy will vicariously travel along as well. Seven-year-old Roraigh Curran of Chorley in northwestern England won a contest by London-based Lost My Name books. His prize: a personalized version of The Incredible Intergalactic Journey Home sent to the space station for a reading. The soon-to-be-space bound book shows satellite views of Roraighs hometown, even his street and house, and stars in the sky spell out his name  Roraighs favorite part. At school, hes already known as The Space Boy, according to his father, Ciaran Curran. Its amazing, Roraigh said by phone this month. I just like the fact that its all about me! As part of the prize, he has been invited to the books launch from Cape Canaveral on Dec. 3. The books will ride along with 7,000 pounds of space station cargo. Tribe said the beauty of the Story Time project  part of the nonprofit Global Space Education Foundation  lies in its simplicity. Everybody can relate to having books read to them, she said by phone from British Columbia, where she now lives. Drew did his 2011 demo as a favor for Tribe, former education director at Space Center Houston, the tourist side of Johnson Space Center. She was trying to get NASA on board. He picked Bennetts Max Goes to the Moon, reading the story about the spacefaring dog from his laptop in the cramped cockpit of Discovery. Parents loved it, kids loved it and, yes, NASA loved it, too, according to Drew. It was easy to go run with it after that, said Drew, whos temporarily assigned to the White House office of science and technology policy, Next, NASA astronaut Michael Hopkins and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata read stories from the stations observation tower, or cupola, with Earth clearly visible out the windows. Two of the stories are posted online; three are still being edited, including one in Japanese. Through his books, Bennett seeks to share his love of science and learning, and encourage children to dream about ways to make the world a better place. The Story Time project allows them to hear his stories read from space, Bennett said via email last week. For me, this is a dream come true. ___ Online: Story Time from Space: http://storytimefromspace.com/",https://apnews.com/story-time-from-space-astronauts-getting-new-picture-books-7be20a6518834132a24e382f0896b0f6,science
Astronaut completes spacewalk right before setting US record,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs yearlong spaceman, Scott Kelly, chalked up his first spacewalk Wednesday just hours before he sets a record for the nations longest trip off the planet. Kelly found himself repeatedly wiping away excess grease while lubricating the snares on the tip of the International Space Stations big robot arm. The job was sloppier and more time-consuming than expected, and couldnt be completed as time ran out. Its so messy, Kelly said. Kelly and fellow spacewalker Kjell Lindgren spent seven hours outside tackling a long overdue list of maintenance chores. In addition to the routine lube work, they routed cable for a future docking port, removed insulation from an electronic switching unit, and covered an antimatter and dark matter detector. A few tasks had to be left undone. Theyll venture back out Nov. 6 for round two. Thursday, meanwhile, promises to be another banner day for Kelly. In the wee hours of Thursday morning, just after midnight Eastern time, Kelly will break the American record for NASAs longest single space shot. That 215-day record  more than seven months  was set in 2007. Kelly has been living at the orbiting lab since March. He is to remain there until March 2016. Russian Mikhail Kornienko is also part of the one-year experiment in preparation for eventual Mars expeditions, although it will fall shy of the 14-month world record held by a fellow cosmonaut, Valery Polyakov, who lived on Russias old Mir space station in 1994 and 1995. 
        
     Former space station resident Michael Lopez-Alegria has been counting down the days until Kelly surpasses his record of 215 days, eight hours and 22 minutes. Proud to pass the baton, he said in a tweet. President Barack Obama already has relayed congratulations. In a phone call last week, Obama told Kelly his feat is nothing to sneeze at. Kelly assured the president that even though he feels like hes been in orbit a long time and still has a long way to go, it shouldnt be a problem getting to the end with enough energy and enthusiasm to complete the job. Records are made to be broken, Kelly noted. Earlier this month, Kelly broke the U.S. record for the most accumulative time in space: 383 days and counting over four missions. It will total 522 days by the time he returns to Earth, well short of the Russian record. Before Wednesdays spacewalk, Kellys identical twin, Mark, a retired astronaut, urged his brother to be careful but still have fun. Dont forget to take a good selfie! Mark said via Twitter. He commanded the mission that delivered the antimatter-hunting Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer in 2011; it was the next-to-last shuttle flight. Scientists wanted the device covered with a thermal blanket to keep it cooler and prolong its life. As Lindgren gathered up cables 250 miles above Earth, Mission Control asked him to call out the serial number on one and wondered whether he knew when it was put there. He didnt. You were probably still in diapers, Mission Control informed the first-time space flier. Im still in diapers, he replied with a chuckle, getting a big laugh in Houston. Yes, astronauts wear diapers during lengthy spacewalks. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew",https://apnews.com/astronaut-completes-spacewalk-right-before-setting-us-record-715b70c0d6a04aaba217819c2b3ee690,science
"NASA: Sun stripping away Martian atmosphere, left dry planet","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Mars-orbiting Maven spacecraft has discovered that the sun likely robbed the red planet of its once-thick atmosphere and water. On Thursday, scientists reported that even today, the solar wind is stripping away about 100 grams of atmospheric gas every second. Thats about a quarter-pound a second lost to the stream of charged particles shooting away from the sun at 1 million mph (1.61 million kph). Big solar storms traveling at twice that speed increase the escape rate by 10 to 20 times  and more. Because of their prevalence billions of years ago, these storms would have been enough to gut the atmosphere of ancient Mars and transform it from a moist, warm place potentially capable of microscopic life to the cold, dry desert of today. I cant help but imagine hamburgers flying out of the Martian atmosphere, one per second, Maven scientist Dave Brain told reporters with a smile. Its instead oxygen and carbon dioxide that are leaving the planet, which are important both for water and for the climate of the planet overall. These latest Mars findings by robotic scouts such as Maven are a key part of NASAs push to send human explorers to the red planet in the 2030s. Just over a month ago, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed evidence of salt water trickling down Martian slopes, at least in the summer. NASAs next mission begins in March with the launch of another orbiting explorer. Principal scientist Bruce Jakosky and his team reported that during massive solar ejections of gas in March, the spacecraft noticed oxygen ions were flung higher into the atmosphere than expected. At the same time, streams of fast-moving magnetic activity shot 3,100 miles out into space. 
        
     That led the researchers to conclude Mars atmospheric decline may have been driven in large part by major solar events such as this, early in the planets history. The atmosphere likely would have disappeared over a period of a few hundred-millions years. Mars no longer has a global magnetic field, but when it did 4 billion years ago, that would have prevented this wholesale loss of atmosphere, the researchers said. Earths strong magnetic field seals in our own atmosphere, preventing direct erosion by the solar wind. Jakosky said further analysis will allow scientists to better define the atmospheric escape rate of ancient Mars. In any event, given the current loss, the existing thin atmosphere would be gone in another few billions of years, he noted, although the gas is also locked up in the polar caps and in the subsurface. Jakosky and Brain work at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Their findings appear in this weeks Science journal. The issue includes four studies conducted by the spacecraft, which has been circling Mars and studying its atmosphere for the past year. Maven, about the size of a school bus, was launched from Cape Canaveral in 2013. Maven also was able to observe a Martian aurora thought to be in the same category as Earths northern lights. Researchers suspect the remnant magnetic field of Mars crust is driving the auroras. ___ Online: NASA: http://mars.nasa.gov/maven/ Maven: http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/",https://apnews.com/national-a5fcfcd8673e474597f034e087a6f60c,science
"Spacewalkers encounter leaking ammonia, spoils radiator work","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts encountered leaking ammonia and minor glove damage while performing plumbing work outside the International Space Station on Friday, then fell so far behind that they had to leave a radiator job undone. NASA said neither the leak nor glove snag posed any danger to Kjell Lindgren or Scott Kelly, making their second spacewalk in 1 1/2 weeks. Lindgren reported intermittent flakes of escaping toxic ammonia early in the spacewalk, while making connections in a cooling line. He assured Mission Control it appeared to be just a small leak. The astronauts later checked each others suits for ammonia residue and found none. Such contamination could be hazardous if brought inside. Mission Control assured the pair that any trace of ammonia would have been dissipated by the sun. Minutes after the ammonia leak, Kelly, NASAs yearlong spaceman, reported that the forefinger of his right glove had a stitch poking out. He said it looked like a loop. Flight controllers in Houston scrambled to make certain the damage was, indeed, slight and superficial; they determined it was. Although the astronauts got out the hatch early to work on the space stations cooling system, the ammonia leak slowed them down, so much so that Mission Control had them undo their radiator work. Their main job was to undo jury-rigged repairs made to a leaky cooling line three years ago. The ammonia leak subsequently was fixed another way  by replacing a failed pump  so NASA wanted the radiator system back in its original setup. That meant topping off the ammonia coolant supply and retracting a backup radiator no longer needed. 
        
     The ammonia refill went well. So did the radiator retraction. It took Lindgren 50 turns on a pistol-grip tool to fold up the 44-foot-long radiator, accordion style. There was no time to cinch it down, however, so he had to redeploy it a few hours later, his earlier effort wasted. Leaving the backup radiator fully extended should pose little risk for damage, NASA said. Fridays spacewalk ended up lasting nearly eight hours, much longer than intended. You make us proud, Mission Control told the astronauts. Welcome back, Japanese crewmate Kimiya Yui added from inside. Their shorter spacewalk on Oct. 28 featured a robot-arm lube job and other mundane maintenance. Kelly has been at the 250-mile-high outpost since March, and isnt due back until next March. Friday marked his 224th consecutive day in orbit, already a U.S. record. His companion for the long haul is Russian Mikhail Kornienko. Four other astronauts are on board for the typical six months: Lindgren, Yui and two Russians. Going off grid for spacewalk, Kelly said via Twitter before heading out. Ill be back w you again soon! His identical twin, Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, wished him luck. Be safe & dont break anything on the @Space_Station! he said in a tweet. This was the 190th spacewalk in the stations 17-year history.

Newest Pluto pics show day in life of dwarf planet,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs newest Pluto pictures depict an entire day on the dwarf planet. The space agency released a series of 10 close-ups of the frosty, faraway world Friday, representing one full rotation, or Pluto day. A Pluto day is equivalent to 6.4 Earth days. The New Horizons spacecraft snapped the pictures as it zoomed past Pluto in an unprecedented flyby in July. Pluto was between 400,000 and 5 million miles from the camera for these photos. A similar series of shots were taken of Plutos jumbo moon, Charon. But the Pluto pictures stand out much more because of the orbs distinct heart-shaped region.

Weather forces 2nd delay for critical space station shipment,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  For the second day in a row, poor weather stalled a critical space station delivery for NASA on Friday. An unmanned Atlas rocket stood ready to lift off at sunset with 7,400 pounds of supplies for the International Space Station, representing the first U.S. delivery in months. But gusty wind interfered; launch controllers waited nearly a half-hour for the wind to ease, but it did not. Thursdays launch attempt was rained out. It appears that maybe Mother Nature has played tricks on us once again, reported NASA launch commentator Mike Curie. The next launch attempt is Saturday, although forecasters put the odds of acceptable conditions at a lowly 30 percent. Were ready to try again another day, said Vernon Thorp, a program manager for United Launch Alliance, the rocket maker. The six space station astronauts have gone without U.S. shipments since April. Two private companies hired by NASA to replenish the orbiting lab are stuck on Earth with grounded rockets. Orbital ATK bought another companys rocket, the veteran Atlas V, for this supply mission. Orbitals last grocery run ended in a fiery explosion seconds after liftoff in October 2014. SpaceX, the other supplier, suffered a launch failure in June. Russia also lost a supply ship earlier this year. But its since picked up the slack, along with Japan. A Russian resupply mission, in fact, is scheduled just before Christmas. 
        
     Much-needed food is inside Orbitals cargo carrier, named Cygnus after the swan constellation. NASA normally likes to have a six-month stash of food aboard the space station, but its down a couple months because of the three failed flights. Space station program manager Kirk Shireman expects it will take another year to get the pantry full again  provided there are no more accidents. Also aboard the newest Cygnus capsule: clothes, toiletries, spacewalking gear, air-supply tanks and science experiments.

Dangerous wind again stalls launch of space station supplies,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Once again, high wind is keeping space station supplies stuck on Earth. An unmanned rocket loaded with 7,400 pounds of cargo for the International Space Station  the first U.S. shipment in months  was grounded by dangerous gusts Saturday. It was the third weather delay in a row. Launch director Bill Cullen called off the attempt three hours in advance. Technical troubles had bumped the late afternoon launch time to the last possible moment in the window; given the high odds of excessive wind, there seemed little reason to proceed. The next try  No. 4  comes Sunday afternoon. The weather is expected to improve, but still only 40 percent favorable. NASA is anxious to get its commercial supply chain moving again. Its two suppliers are grounded because of launch accidents dating back to 2014, and the space station pantry needs restocking. Shipper Orbital ATK is using another companys rocket, the venerable Atlas V, for this grocery run. But even the Atlas is no match for Mother Nature. Besides food, Orbitals Cygnus cargo carrier contains clothes and toiletries for the six space station residents, as well as spacewalking gear, air-supply tanks and science experiments. Christmas presents also are on board. In orbit, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly had to endure some teasing from his identical twin back home about the repeated delays.

Liftoff: 1st US shipment in months flying to space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A U.S. shipment of much-needed groceries and other astronaut supplies rocketed toward the International Space Station for the first time in months Sunday, reigniting NASAs commercial delivery service. If the Orbital ATK capsule arrives at the space station Wednesday as planned, it will represent the first U.S. delivery since spring. Santa is on his way! Tory Bruno, president of rocket maker United Launch Alliance, announced via Twitter. More than anyone, perhaps, the six space station astronauts were thrilled following all the weather-related delays. They managed to photograph the rising rocket from their windows as both craft sailed over the Atlantic. Caught something good on the horizon, commander Scott Kelly reported in a tweet. To NASAs relief, the weather cooperated after three days of high wind and cloudy skies that kept the Atlas V rocket firmly on the ground. Everything came together on the fourth launch attempt, allowing the unmanned Atlas to blast off with 7,400 pounds of space station cargo, not to mention some Christmas presents for the awaiting crew. Just before liftoff, Bruno urged, Everyone cross your fingers and think happy weather thoughts. It apparently worked. The Atlas soared through clouds and, 21 minutes later, ended up placing the Cygnus cargo carrier in the perfect orbit. Ecstatic launch controllers applauded, shook hands and hugged one another. Were real happy to be back in space, said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbitals space systems group. 
        
     United Launch Alliance manager Vernon Thorp couldnt help but notice all the number fours in Sundays launch equation. Liftoff occurred at 4:44 p.m. on the fourth launch attempt, and Orbitals designation for the mission was  yep  number four. I guess the numbers just all lined up right today, Thorp told reporters. The space station astronauts  two of them, including Kelly, deep into a one-year mission  have gone without American shipments since April. Two private companies contracted for more than $3.5 billion by NASA to replenish the 250-mile-high lab are stuck on Earth with grounded rockets. Orbital ATK bought the United Launch Alliances rocket, the veteran Atlas V, for this supply mission. Orbitals previous grocery run, its fourth, ended in a fiery explosion seconds after liftoff in October 2014. SpaceX, the other supplier, suffered a launch failure in June on its eighth trip. Russia also lost a supply ship earlier this year. But it picked up the slack and has another resupply mission scheduled just before Christmas; Japan has chipped in as well. Much-needed food is inside Orbitals cargo carrier, named Cygnus after the swan constellation. NASA normally likes to have a six-month stash of food aboard the space station, but its down a couple months because of the three failed flights. Space station program manager Kirk Shireman expects it will take another year to get the pantry full again  provided there are no more accidents. Also aboard the newest Cygnus capsule: clothes, toiletries, spacewalking gear, air-supply tanks and science experiments. This is the first time that the United Launch Alliances Atlas V has served the space station. Normally used for hefty satellite launches, it is the mighty successor to the Atlas used to put John Glenn into orbit in 1962. Boeing intends to use the Atlas V to boost the Starliner capsules its building to ferry astronauts to the space station beginning in 2017. Orbital plans to use another Atlas rocket for a supply run in March, then return its own Antares rocket to flight from Virginia in May. SpaceX  also part of NASAs commercial crew effort  aims to restart station deliveries in January with its Falcon rockets. While acknowledging 2015 has been a difficult year because of the disrupted supply chain, Shireman said commercial space is inevitable and will drive down launch costs. NASAs 30-year shuttle program proved expensive and complicated, and, on two flights, deadly. It is our future, Shireman stressed last week. The Cygnus launched Sunday is named after Mercury 7 astronaut Deke Slayton, a pioneer in commercial spaceflight before his death in 1993. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/liftoff-1st-us-shipment-in-months-flying-to-space-station-144cc34035b94600be4703f2108f44b4,science
NASA Want Ad: Astronauts needed to help get to Mars,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Need more office space? How about outer space? NASA opened its astronaut-application website Monday. Its accepting applications through Feb. 18. Contenders need to be U.S. citizens with a bachelors degree in science, math or engineering. Expect intense competition: More than 6,000 applied for NASAs last astronaut class in 2013, with only eight picked. Its an elite club, numbering only in the 300s since the original Mercury 7 chosen in 1959. Future astronauts will have four spacecraft at their disposal: the International Space Station, two commercial crew capsules to get there, and NASAs Orion spacecraft for eventual Mars trips. Pay is between $66,000 and $145,000 a year, and youll have to move to Houston. Astronaut criteria have changed over the years, said Brian Kelly, director of flight operations at Johnson Space Center. Some people would be surprised to learn they might have what it takes, Kelly said in a statement. We want and need a diverse mix of individuals to ensure we have the best astronaut corps possible. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, a member of the Astronaut Class of 1980, said this next group will help blaze the trail to Mars. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/",https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-bdf86691bff741ef8d57b9e90501a5b6,science
SpaceX conducts rocket-firing test; aims for Sunday launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX is aiming for a Sunday launch, its first since a summer accident grounded its Falcon line of rockets. The company conducted a test-firing of its rocket at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Friday. It took three days for SpaceX to complete the test. But in the end, chief executive Elon Musk said the engine firing appeared to go well and that, pending a review, a launch attempt would occur Sunday night. SpaceXs rockets have been grounded since one failed during liftoff in June. The accident occurred on a space station supply run for NASA. The upcoming flight will involve a satellite delivery for OrbComm. If it goes well, flights for NASA could resume in February. The company will attempt, again, to land the spent first-stage booster. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-general-news-31ddf3e93def4016be06bb9f8e078f15,science
"SpaceX launches rocket 6 months after accident, then lands","SpaceX sent a Falcon rocket soaring toward orbit Monday night with 11 small satellites, its first mission since an accident last summer. Then in an even more astounding feat, it landed the 15-story leftover booster back on Earth safely. It was the first time an unmanned rocket returned to land vertically at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and represented a tremendous success for SpaceX. The company led by billionaire Elon Musk is striving for reusability to drive launch costs down and open up space to more people. Welcome back, baby! Musk tweeted after touchdown. Its a revolutionary moment, Musk later told reporters. No one has ever brought a booster, an orbital-class booster, back intact. Whats significant is that this was a useful mission, Musk noted, not merely a practice flight. We achieved recovery of the rocket in a mission that actually deployed 11 satellites, he said. SpaceX employees broke into cheers and chants, some of them jumping up and down, following the smooth touchdown nine minutes after liftoff. Previous landing attempts ended in fiery blasts, but those aimed for an ocean platform. Musk said he ran outside and heard the sonic boom of the returning booster just as it landed; he assumed it had exploded. He learned the happy truth when he went back into Launch Control and saw video of the standing rocket. I cant quite believe it, he said. Its quite shocking. 
        
     Musk said the landing appeared close to perfect and the company could not have asked for a better mission or a better day. The top officer at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, noted that the returning booster placed the exclamation mark on 2015. This was a first for us at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and I cant even begin to describe the excitement the team feels right now having been a part of this historic first-stage rocket landing, Monteith said in a statement. Across the country, SpaceX employees jammed company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, anxiously awaiting success. They cheered at full throttle when the first stage separated cleanly two minutes into flight and reoriented itself for an unprecedented return to Cape Canaveral. Then the roar became deafening, as TV cameras showed the first-stage booster landing on extended legs at its new, dedicated landing zone. SpaceX commentators called it incredibly exciting and were visibly moved by the feat. This has been a wildly successful return to flight for SpaceX, said one SpaceX launch commentator. We made history today. Blue Origin, another billionaires rocket company, successfully landed a booster last month in West Texas. That rocket, though, had been used for a suborbital flight. The SpaceX booster was more powerful and flying faster in order to put satellites into orbit. The touchdown was a secondary objective for SpaceX. The first was hoisting the satellites for OrbComm, a New Jersey-based communication company. All 11 were successfully deployed. OrbComm chief executive officer Marc Eisenberg seemed just as excited about the booster landing as his satellites reaching orbit. Here she comes back, Eisenberg said via Twitter, sharing a photo of the returning booster. Then: Bullseye. The booster-landing zone, a former Atlas missile-launching site, is about six miles from the launch pad. SpaceX is leasing the touchdown area  marked by a giant X  from the Air Force. The reinforced concrete provides a stable surface, unlike the barges used for the initial attempts, primarily for increased safety. On its previous flight back in June, SpaceXs Falcon 9 rocket failed shortly after liftoff, destroying a supply ship intended for the International Space Station. A snapped strut in the upper stage was to blame. SpaceX spent months correcting the problem and improving the unmanned rocket. It hopes to resume supply runs for NASA in February. Musk, who also runs the Tesla electric car company, said he can drastically reduce launch costs by reusing rocket parts. Three tries at vertical landings of the first-stage boosters earlier this year failed; in each case, the segment aimed for a modified barge off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. This time, Musk opted for a true land landing. Musk said it will take a few more years to iron everything out, for actual reusability of his rockets. In the meantime, hes working to transform the SpaceX Dragon capsules from cargo ships into real spaceships for crews traveling to and from the orbiting station. His ultimate goal, for human missions, is Mars. This was a critical step along the way to being able to establish a city on Mars, he said. Thats what all this is about. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-b6826e637b664905829df3e5b04a08ea,science
"1-year space crewmen will miss weather, nature while gone","CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  The American astronaut and Russian cosmonaut about to embark on a one-year flight are similar in many ways: born in the 1960s, fathers of daughters, military backgrounds. But there are differences, too. Scott Kelley, a divorced dad of two, still has a school-age daughter. Mikhail Kornienko is married to an OB-GYN, his daughter is grown, and hes a new grandfather. Kelly and Kornienko leave the world behind this week for a year at the International Space Station. Theyve lived there before, although for only half that long and at separate times. More on the crewmates: Scott Kelly This will be the fourth spaceflight for Kelly, 51, a former NASA shuttle commander and Navy test pilot whose identical twin brother, Mark, also was chosen as an astronaut in 1996. The two will conduct many of the same medical experiments over the coming year so scientists can compare the results. Scott Kellys first two flights were aboard shuttles. He spent more than five months on the space station in 2010-2011. It was during that mission that his sister-in-law, then Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, nearly died after being shot in the head in a mass shooting in Arizona. Once hes back home in Houston, Kelly imagines it will be hard to walk away from spaceflight. Hed love to pilot one of the new U.S. spacecraft in development. But he figures if he cuts in front of other astronauts awaiting assignments, someone will run me over with their car. 
        
     What will Kelly miss the most, besides his loved ones? The weather. It never changes on the space station, he said. Even though its a pretty nice environment, I guess its like living in Southern California, people get sick of it ... after a while. ___ Mikhail Kornienko It will be the second space mission for Kornienko, 54, a former paratrooper whose helicopter-pilot father was part of the search and rescue team for the first Soviet cosmonauts back in the 1960s. His father brought back souvenirs from the returning Soyuz capsules: uneaten food rations and pieces of the orange silky parachutes used for the final descent. Mom made gorgeous skirts out of them, he said. I still have a small piece of one of those parachutes. I cherish it as if it were something sacred. A religious man, Kornienko is taking into orbit a folding icon depicting the Madonna and Child. His previous station stay was in 2010, 12 years after his selection as a cosmonaut. He figures hell miss the same things he dreamed about last time he flew: water not in the form of blobs as in space, but water you can swim in, as well as grass, forests and fields. Kornienko already says hed take on another one-year mission  after a break, of course. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew/ Kelly on Twitter: https://twitter.com/StationCDRKelly/",https://apnews.com/1-year-space-crewmen-will-miss-weather-nature-while-gone-7084fed0f252478bbffc08ed5b3fbf5a,science
Twin fools NASA at brothers launch on 1-year flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  Astronaut Scott Kellys identical twin pulled a fast one on NASA right before his brother blasted off on a one-year space station mission. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told Kelly on Monday that he almost had a heart attack when his brother showed up launch morning without his usual mustache late last week. He fooled all of us, Bolden said. Mark Kellys mustache was the only way I can tell you two apart. Mark, a former space shuttle commander, was still clean shaven as of Monday afternoon, as he chatted with Bolden about the unprecedented medical experiments planned on the twins over the coming year. Doctors want to see how the space twins body compares with his genetic double on the ground. Scott Kelly arrived at the International Space Station on Friday night following a launch from Kazakhstan. He will remain on board until next March, as will Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. It will be NASAs longest spaceflight ever. Its like coming to my old home, said Kelly, who spent five months at the space station in 2010-2011. The White House, meanwhile, sent congratulations Monday. President Barack Obamas science adviser, John Holdren, wished Kelly, Kornienko and the rest of the crew the best of luck and noted that the yearlong mission is an important milestone on the path to sending humans to Mars in the mid-2030s. 
        
     You guys are all heroes up there, and were depending on you, Holdren said in a phone hookup. Mark Kelly, meanwhile, paid tribute to the brothers father, who stayed behind in Houston for last weeks launch. Richard Kelly, a retired and widowed police officer, is the only parent to endure a childs rocket launch so many times  eight between the two.

Caffeine High: Space station getting Italian espresso maker,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The next space station grocery run will carry caffeine to a whole new level: Aboard the SpaceX supply ship is an authentic espresso machine straight from Italy. SpaceX is scheduled to launch its unmanned rocket with the espresso maker  and 4,000 pounds of food, science research and other equipment  Monday afternoon. The experimental espresso machine is intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. It was supposed to arrive in January, shortly after her arrival, so she could get some relief from the stations instant coffee. But it ended up on the back burner after a station shipment from Virginia was lost in a launch explosion. The espresso maker is dubbed ISSpresso  ISS standing for International Space Station. Italian coffee giant Lavazza joined forces with the Turin-based engineering company Argotec and the Italian Space Agency to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet. NASA certified its safety. NASAs space station program deputy manager, Dan Hartman, said its all part of making astronauts feel at home as they spend months  and even up to a year  in orbit. Already, Mission Control gives astronauts full access to email, phone calls, private video hookups, and live news and sports broadcasts. The psychological support is very, very important, Hartman told reporters Sunday. If an espresso machine comes back and we get a lot of great comments from the crew ... Its kind of like the ice cream thing, right, when we fly ice cream every now and then. Its just to boost spirits. Maybe some rough day, a scoop of ice cream gets them over that hump kind of thing. 
        
     The SpaceX Dragon supply ship also holds experiments for NASAs one-year space station resident Scott Kelly, who moved in a couple weeks ago. Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko also will remain on board until March 2016. This will be the California-based SpaceX companys seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. For the third time, SpaceX will attempt to land its leftover booster vertically on an ocean barge. Both previous tests failed. Improvements to the first-stage booster and floating platform  based on lessons learned from the January and February attempts  should boost the odds of success this time to 75 percent or maybe 80 percent, said Hans Koenigsmann, vice president of mission assurance for SpaceX. SpaceXs billionaire founder Elon Musk wants to save time and money by reusing the boosters normally discarded in the Atlantic. In fact, the company is transforming a former missile-launching site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station into a landing pad for its revolutionary flyback boosters. Mondays launch time is 4:33 p.m. Forecasters put the odds of good weather at 60 percent. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-28618039f72146eea69e3504b584e82a,science
"SpaceX launches cargo capsule, fails to nail rocket landing","CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  SpaceX launched a shipment of groceries to the International Space Station on Tuesday, including the first espresso maker bound for orbit. But the private companys third attempt to land the leftover booster on an ocean platform failed. The first-stage booster rocket apparently landed too hard on the barge and tipped over. SpaceX chief Elon Musk wants to reuse the rockets rather than discard them in the ocean to reduce launch costs. The company will try again in June on the next supply run for NASA. Its not quite clear what happened, said Hans Koenigsmann, a SpaceX vice president. But certainly it needs more work in the next couple missions. Despite improvements to the booster and landing platform, Musk still had predicted a less than 50 percent chance of success for the latest effort. He and other company officials repeatedly stressed that the landing test was secondary to getting the Dragon capsule filled with supplies into orbit. Indeed, NASA congratulated SpaceX on Tuesdays spectacular launch, delayed a day by stormy weather. Unprecedented images beamed down from orbit showed the protective covering popping off the Dragon and the two solar wings unfolding, like a newborn chick. Even SpaceX officials were impressed. That is such a phenomenal picture, Koenigsmann told reporters. The supply ship holds more than 4,000 pounds (1,800 kilograms) of food, science experiments and equipment for the six space station astronauts. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery should arrive Friday. 
        
     We watched live! Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said in a tweet. Amazing to think that in 3 days #Dragon will be knocking on our door. The specially designed espresso machine is for Cristoforetti, who has been stuck with American instant coffee since she arrived at the space station in November. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionize coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hopes to transform the rocket business by eventually landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Floridas northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. The ultimate landing site, once the operation is perfected, will be a former missile-launching site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The 14-story booster was programmed, following separation 2 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and from an altitude of about 78 miles (126 kilometers) fly to the platform dubbed Just Read the Instructions. Tuesdays data looked good at a quick glance, including the engine firings to slow the booster, which made the mishap all the more puzzling. Until a boat with crew arrives at the scene, SpaceX wont know what if anything can be recovered, Koenigsmann said. The goal, a vertical touchdown, also eluded SpaceX in January and February. The steering fins ran out of hydraulic fluid on the first try, and the booster slammed into the platform and exploded. Rough seas scrapped the second shot. Improvements to both the booster and platform followed, but apparently were not enough. This was the seventh supply run by the California-based company for NASA. The Dragon  the only supply ship capable of returning items intact  will remain at the space station until around May 21. NASA is eager to get the Dragons contents to the space station. The agency still has a month-or-two backlog for food and equipment in the wake of the October loss of an Orbital Sciences Corp. cargo carrier. The unmanned rocket exploded at liftoff. The espresso maker was among the items delayed by the accident. It should have arrived in January, two months after Cristoforetti moved into the space station. With her departure coming up in just one month, she wont have much time to waste unpacking the Dragon and cranking out the espresso. Twenty coffee packets are included. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main",https://apnews.com/general-news-b480b31f77a342d7963fc50c4198cdc4,science
Spacecraft circling Mercury will crash into planet April 30,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

But instead of mourning, scientists and engineers celebrated the success of this first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to our sun. Messenger is expected to slam into Mercury on April 30, succumbing to gravity after running out of fuel. It will be traveling more than 8,700 mph at the time of impact, and create a crater about 52 feet across. The impact will occur on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth, out of view of telescopes. Scientists expect to collect data until almost the bitter end.

Hubble Space Telescope marking 25th anniversary in orbit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  One of NASAs crowning glories, the Hubble Space Telescope, marks its 25th anniversary this week. With 1 million-plus observations, including those of some of the farthest and oldest galaxies ever beheld by humanity, no man-made satellite has touched as many minds or hearts as Hubble. NASA is celebrating Fridays anniversary with ceremonies this week at the Smithsonian Institution and Newseum in Washington. Hubble has become part of our culture  very much, said NASAs science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who flew on the final three Hubble repair missions. A look at Hubbles quarter-century in orbit about 350 miles above Earth: A BLURRY START A full decade in the making, Hubble rocketed into orbit on April 24, 1990, aboard space shuttle Discovery. NASA wanted an observatory free of the atmospheres distortion and, in some cases, absorption of light. Stars, for example, do not appear to twinkle when seen from space. The telescope was named for American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who in the 1920s determined that the universe is expanding. Sky-high excitement turned into bottomless agony when it quickly became apparent that the telescopes primary mirror had been botched during manufacturing, resulting in blurry eyesight. Three years later, with NASAs reputation and entire future on the line, a team of astronauts managed to restore Hubbles promised vision with replacement parts. OVERHAULS AND TUNEUPS 
        
     Shuttle astronauts visited Hubble five times, from 1993 to 2009, to make improvements and repairs to the 43-foot-long observatory, about the size of a school bus. That last mission almost didnt happen: NASA canceled it for safety reasons in the wake of the 2003 shuttle Columbia disaster. But public uproar and changing NASA administration, along with detailed crew-rescue plans just in case, led to the flights reinstatement. By the time Atlantis blasted off on the last servicing mission, NASA put the investment in Hubble at $10 billion. Three-time Hubble mechanic Grunsfeld was the last person to lay hands on the orbiting observatory. He recalls giving Hubble a little pat and a salute, and telling it, Good travels, Hubble. IMPRESSIVE STATS Hubble has traveled 3.4 billion miles, circling Earth nearly 137,000 times and making more than 1.2 million observations of more than 38,000 celestial objects, according to the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. The most distant objects spotted by Hubble  primitive galaxies  are some 13 billion light-years away and date to within 400 million or so years of the universes origin, known as the Big Bang. Hubble provides an average of 829 gigabytes of archival data every month, according to the institute. Altogether, Hubble has produced more than 100 terabytes of data. DISCOVERIES Early on, Hubble proved the existence of super-massive black holes  and found theyre located at the center of most galaxies. It also helped to pinpoint the age of the universe at 13.8 billion years old, by determining the current rate of expansion of the universe with an uncertainty of just 3 percent, according to the Mario Livio, an astrophysicist at the space telescope institute. Thanks to Hubble, he noted this week, astronomers now know that cosmic expansion is accelerating because of mysterious dark energy. The space telescope has shown that the birth rate of stars hit a peak in the universe about 10 billion years ago and has been declining ever since, Livio said. Astronomers have published 12,800 scientific papers based on data from Hubble. Some of the research on supernovas, or exploding stars, contributed to a Nobel Prize in physics in 2011. FUTURE NASAs Grunsfeld said theres pretty high probability that Hubble will keep working until at least 2020. Gravity is slowly lowering the telescopes approximately 350-mile-high orbit, but the good news is that low solar activity is keeping the atmosphere thinner, which in turn should keep Hubble up until the 2030s. On the last Hubble mission in 2009, Grunsfeld installed a docking adaptor on the bottom of the telescope. The plan was  and still is  to one day launch an unmanned rocket to Hubble so a motor can be installed to guide the telescope toward a Pacific re-entry. The 8-foot primary mirror is the main concern: Its expected to survive the atmospheric plunge. Thats why NASA does not want Hubble coming down, uncontrolled, over populated areas. SUCCESSOR NASAs James Webb Space Telescope is due to be launched in 2018 to a vantage point 1 million miles away. The Webb will specialize in the infrared wavelength, allowing it to peer into some of the faintest, most distant recesses of the universe. This should enable the telescope  named after the late NASA administrator who guided the Mercury and Gemini programs, and set the stage for the Apollo moon landings  to look back even farther in time than Hubble and detect galaxies formed a mere 200 million years following the Big Bang. By 2019, Webb should be up and running with the Hubble still in action and powerful, new ground telescopes pointing skyward. It will just be absolutely the most capability we will have ever had to look at the cosmos and try and understand it, Grunsfeld said. Im convinced there are going to be some big discoveries. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble Space Telescope Science Institute: http://www.stsci.edu/portal/",https://apnews.com/general-news-2a70394c939849b6aaeaae1d120fb566,science
NASA releases picture of starry fireworks for Hubbles 25th,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  What better way to celebrate the Hubble Space Telescopes quarter-century in orbit than with cosmic fireworks? On Thursday  one day before the 25th anniversary of Hubbles launch  NASA released an image taken by the space telescope showing a brilliant breeding ground for stars. This stellar nursery is 20,000 light-years from Earth in the Constellation Carina. NASAs science mission chief John Grunsfeld told the crowd gathered for the unveiling at the Newseum in Washington that the fact its taken thousands of years for the light from these bright, young stars to reach us means they planned really far in advance. Grunsfeld was among five former shuttle astronauts who flew on Hubble missions who attended the ceremony. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden also was there; he helped deliver Hubble to orbit on April 24, 1990 aboard space shuttle Discovery. Bolden said neither he nor anyone else back then expected the space telescope to work much beyond 15 years  or accomplish so much. From its approximately 350-mile-high perch, Hubble has made more than 1.2 observations of more than 38,000 celestial objects. A quarter-century later, Hubble has fundamentally changed our human understanding of our universe and our place in it, Bolden said Noted Grunsfeld: Hubble inspires the world. NASA expects Hubble to keep producing first-class science for at least five more years. The observations for the anniversary picture were collected in 2013 and 2014. Another NASA ceremony will take place Friday night at the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/ Space Telescope Science Institute: http://www.stsci.edu/portal/",https://apnews.com/nasa-releases-picture-of-starry-fireworks-for-hubbles-25th-f4c4f33a007348a1ba7dfb7a00676736,science
Russias spinning cargo capsule for space station total loss,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A Russian supply capsule that went into an uncontrollable spin after launch was declared a total loss Wednesday, but astronauts at the International Space Station said they will get by without the delivery of fresh food, water, clothes and equipment. We should be OK, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly assured The Associated Press. I think were going to be in good shape. Kelly and Russian Mikhail Kornienko, the space stations one-year crew members, told the AP during an interview that flight controllers had given up trying to command the cargo carrier. NASA and the Russian Space Agency later confirmed the news. The unmanned Progress vessel, bearing 3 tons of goods, began tumbling when it reached orbit Tuesday, following launch from Kazakhstan. The head of Roscosmos, Russias space agency, Igor Komarov, cited a lack of pressure in the main block of the propulsion system in the decision to abort the mission. Kelly said the craft will fall out of orbit and re-enter the atmosphere. Russian reports indicated a re-entry possibly next week. The capsule is expected to burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere, as is the case for all Progress carriers, once they have delivered their shipments and are filled with trash. The program plans for these kinds of things to happen. Theyre very unfortunate when they do, said Kelly, one month into a yearlong mission, which will be a record for NASA. 
        
     He added: The important thing is hardware can be replaced. Kornienko called it a big concern. But he expressed 100 percent confidence that operations will continue as planned until the next shipment arrives. Supplying the space station is mostly handled by the United States and Russia. NASA hired SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corp. to provide regular shipments, once the shuttle program ended in 2011. SpaceX plans to send up a load of supplies in June; its most recent shipment arrived less than two weeks ago. This is the second cargo ship lost in the past half year. In October, Orbital Sciences suffered a launch explosion in Virginia that destroyed a station supply ship. NASA officials want a six-month supply of food on the space station, but because of the Orbital Sciences accident, the reserves are down a month or so. The Japanese Space Agency also periodically sends up cargo; it is aiming for a summer shipment Six people currently live at the space station: two Americans, one Italian and three Russians. Just days before Tuesdays launch, Roscosmos announced that the cargo ship held a copy of the Banner of Victory, the red flag with the Soviet hammer and sickle that was raised over the Reichstag in Berlin by victorious Soviet soldiers in 1945. It is a highly revered symbol of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.

Doomsday at Mercury: NASA craft falls from orbit into planet,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The only spacecraft ever to orbit Mercury ended its four-year tour with a crash landing Thursday NASAs Messenger plunged from orbit as planned and slammed into the suns closest planet at about 8,750 mph (14,081 kph), creating a crater an estimated 52 feet (16 meters) across. Messenger became the first spacecraft to orbit hot, little Mercury, in 2011. It circled the solar systems innermost planet 4,105 times and collected more than 277,000 images. Today we bid a fond farewell to one of the most resilient and accomplished spacecraft ever to have explored our neighboring planets, said lead scientist Sean Solomon, director of Columbia Universitys Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Solomon noted in a statement that Messenger set a record for planetary flybys  once past Earth, twice past Venus and three times past Mercury before entering Mercurys orbit  and survived both punishing heat and extreme doses of radiation to surpass expectations. Flight controllers managed to keep the spacecraft going a few extra weeks by using helium gas not originally intended as fuel. But the gas tank finally emptied and gravitys relentless tug did Messenger in. Mercury is the last of the rocky inner planets in our solar system  also counting Mars and Venus  to be littered by mankind. Thursdays crash occurred on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth and telescopes. Several minutes passed before NASA received confirmation. Controllers received no signal from Messenger when it was supposed to be back in the coverage zone  a sign that the spacecraft, measuring 10 feet solar wingtip to wingtip, had, indeed, succumbed to gravity. 
        
     Well I guess it is time to say goodbye, the Messenger Twitter feed stated as the end drew near. Then after the impact: On behalf of Messenger, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it. Astronomers who used Messenger to detect Mercurys frozen water-covered poles and significantly off-center magnetic field called it an end of an era. Other discoveries: volcanic deposits that are evidence of the planets eruptive past, and noticeable global shrinkage. It has been an amazing journey of discovery, said the University of British Columbias Catherine Johnson, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute. Data analyses will continue for at least another year. Messengers $427 million mission began with a launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2004. Johns Hopkins University handled everything for NASA. Until Messenger, the only spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASAs Mariner 10 back in the 1970s. That was only a fly-by mission. The Europeans and Japanese are teaming up for Mercurys next guests, a pair of satellites known as BepiColombo. Theyre scheduled for launch in 2017 and arrival in Mercurys orbit in 2024. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/ Johns Hopkins University: http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/",https://apnews.com/doomsday-at-mercury-nasa-craft-falls-from-orbit-into-planet-e6c4d26b8d5c43ee8a2a93e42471417d,science
"Italian astronaut brews, sips first fresh espresso in space","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The first Italian woman in space is now the worlds first orbiting barista. Over the weekend, astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti fired up the first espresso machine in space. She posted a photo of herself on Twitter from the International Space Station on Sunday, sipping from a cup designed for use in zero-gravity. For the special occasion, she put on her Star Trek uniform top. Coffee: the finest organic suspension ever devised, Cristoforetti said via Twitter, quoting from the old TV series, Star Trek: Voyager.  Fresh espresso in the new Zero-G cup! To boldly brew..., she added. Cristoforetti, who returns to Earth next week following a half-year mission, almost didnt get any space espresso. The experimental, Italian-made espresso maker, dubbed ISSpresso using the International Space Station initials, was supposed to arrive in January, but didnt get to orbit until April because of a shipment backlog. How did she like the space brew? She didnt say on Twitter, but she was all smiles for the cameras and gave a thumbs-up. It had to beat NASAs instant coffee, drunk by straw from a pouch. The espresso actually is brewed in a clear pouch, behind the closed door of the boxy coffee maker, and thats how Cristoforetti and NASA crewmate Scott Kelly first sampled it. Cristoforetti later switched to the small, pitcher-like zero-g cup, a new American-made item. Italys 120-year-old coffee maestro Lavazza and the Turin-based engineering firm Argotec, which teamed up on the space espresso project with the Italian Space Agency, were thrilled to see their 260-mile-high results. 
        
     Today the International Space Station feels a little more like home, Lavazza said via Twitter. The space espresso maker uses small capsules, or pods, of espresso coffee. Fifteen coffee capsules flew up with the machine aboard a SpaceX cargo carrier, as well as five capsules for flushing out the system. More coffee capsules are available for launch if requested by the six-person crew. ___ Online: Cristoforetti on Twitter: https://twitter.com/astrosamantha Italian Space Agency video: http://www.asitv.it/",https://apnews.com/italian-astronaut-brews-sips-first-fresh-espresso-in-space-b59426a022b5498f84eb7487757a6186,science
SpaceX capsule soars with dummy in 1st test of crew escape,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX chalked up another big test flight Wednesday, firing a capsule into the air to try out its new, super-streamlined launch escape system for astronauts. No humans were on board, just a life-size dummy, for the first-of-its-kind flight. The whole thing lasted just 1 minutes, but represented a huge milestone in SpaceXs effort to get America back to the business of launching astronauts from U.S. soil. SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk called it a great outcome, and NASA offered congratulations. Had there been people on board, they would have been in great shape, Musk said by phone from California, where his company is based. This bodes quite well for the future of the program, he said, quickly adding, I dont want to jinx it. The Dragon capsule shot off a test stand, not a rocket, and flew up and then out over the Atlantic. Eight rocket engines on the capsule provided the thrust. Red and white parachutes popped open and lowered the capsule into the ocean, just offshore. This flight test unlike any seen in Florida since the days of Apollo, NASA spokesman Mike Curie, the TV commentator for the test, said after the capsule plopped into the Atlantic. Recovery boats and a barge moved in to retrieve the craft. SpaceX already hauls cargo to the International Space Station in a Dragon capsule for NASA; another supply run is set for next month. Determined from the start to crack the human spaceflight arena and put people on Mars, Musk aims to launch U.S. astronauts to the orbiting lab as early as 2017, allowing NASA to reduce its reliance on Russia to ferry crews. The last manned launch from Cape Canaveral was in 2011 when the shuttle program ended. 
        
     Boeing also is developing a crew capsule for NASA. The space agency wants to make sure the commercial crew flights will be safe in an emergency, and is insisting on reliable escape systems. Addressing reporters two hours after the test, Musk said he did not have specifics on how high or how far offshore the capsule flew. The anticipated altitude was a mile, and the splashdown zone a mile offshore. He said all eight engines fired  although one was slightly off the mark  and that the capsule went from zero to 100 mph in 1.2 seconds. Thats pretty zippy, Musk said. Top speed was 345 mph. In the days leading up to the trial run, SpaceX officials had cautioned something might go wrong. The capsule could have been lost at sea or smashed down onto the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, from where it took off. A two-mile area was cleared before the test, just in case. SpaceX said its revolutionary abort system, once perfected, will provide an escape for astronauts throughout their climb to orbit, something even NASAs early manned spacecraft could not do. The pointy launch-escape towers atop the Mercury and Apollo capsules were good for just the initial part of liftoff; the same is true of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The two-man Gemini capsules relied on ejection seats, as did the first four space shuttle flights. Only the Russians ever used their escape system during a real manned launch  back in 1983  and it saved two cosmonauts lives. The seven Challenger astronauts might have survived their 1986 accident with a decent escape system; that launch disaster, along with the 2003 loss of Columbia and seven astronauts during re-entry at flights end, showed NASA just how valuable an abort system can be. SpaceX plans to use the capsule again later this year for an abort test following an actual rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The company also wants to send an empty crew Dragon to the space station before putting astronauts on board. Up until late last week, SpaceX was calling its flight dummy Buster. But the company noted on its website this week that, Buster the Dummy already works for a great show you may have heard of called MythBusters. Our dummy prefers to remain anonymous for the time being. Musk said the dummy fared well during Wednesdays test. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/",https://apnews.com/spacex-capsule-soars-with-dummy-in-1st-test-of-crew-escape-510af59e8ca14f04ba55368ef5e55280,science
Air Force launches hush-hush mini-shuttle into space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A mysterious space plane rocketed into orbit Wednesday, carrying no crew but a full load of technology experiments. The Air Force launched its unmanned mini-shuttle late Wednesday morning. An Atlas V rocket lifted it up and out over the Atlantic. This is the fourth flight for the military research program, which is shrouded in secrecy. The last X-37B mission lasted 674 days and ended with a California touchdown. Altogether, the first three X-37B flights spanned 1,367 days. Thats 3 years. The Air Force wont say how long this particular mission will last or where it will end. Public commentary about the launch ended barely five minutes after liftoff, well before the space plane was supposed to settle into a relatively low orbit. The X-37B looks like a miniature version of a NASA space shuttle. It is 29 feet long  about one-quarter the length of a space shuttle  and its wingspan is about 15 feet. Like the old shuttle, the Boeing-built X-37B launches vertically and lands horizontally, is reusable, and has lots of room for experiments. But no one flies on them; they are operated robotically. This X-37B  also known as OTV, or orbital test vehicle  has a materials-sample experiment on board for NASA, as well as an experimental electric-propulsion thruster for the Air Force. But perhaps the most intriguing payload, at least from the public point of view, is a solar-sail demo sponsored by the Planetary Society. 
        
     The societys chief executive officer, Bill Nye, better known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, said a large, light, shiny Mylar sail measuring 32 square meters (344 square feet) was tucked into a small box for liftoff. The intent is for sunlight to propel it, once it is released and deployed in orbit. The sail hitched a ride on the upper-stage rocket for a test flight. Such technology could be useful for future missions to monitor solar weather and keep a lookout for possible asteroids headed our way. Were very hopeful that the thing will deploy properly, sunlight will hit it and get a push, Nye said after liftoff. A similar experiment by the group was lost in a Russian launch accident 10 years ago. This time, it turned to United Launch Alliance, a venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. ULA called the liftoff a success. The groups members are very happy to be aboard a U.S.-built, high-reliability big-time rocket, Nye told Atlas launch control, So thank you guys. ___ Online: Planetary Society: http://planetarysociety.org/ United Launch Alliance: http://www.ulalaunch.com/",https://apnews.com/fl-state-wire-ca-state-wire-0f7f3ae097754227bb68ef77971fd335,science
"Launch commentator for Apollo 11 moon shot, Jack King, dies","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Jack King, a NASA public affairs official who became the voice of the Apollo moon shots, died Thursday. He was 84. King counted down the historic launch of Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969. He also did the countdown for hundreds of the early rocket launches, including the two-man Gemini missions and many other Apollo missions King died at a hospice facility, not far from Kennedy Space Center, said Hugh Harris, retired director of public affairs at Kennedy. King had been diagnosed early this year with heart failure. In 2009, on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, King said that he still enjoyed hearing recordings of himself from that big launch day. I wish I had a penny for every time it was used, he told The Associated Press. For just over a year, from 1958 to 1959, King ran the new AP office in Cape Canaveral. He first joined the news agency in 1951 in Boston, his hometown, and returned after graduating from Boston College and serving two years in the Army. King moved over to NASA and went on to head its public information office at Cape Canaveral during the Mercury program, the job he still held when astronauts first flew to the moon. Twelve, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start. Six, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, zero, all engine running. Liftoff! We have a liftoff, 32 minutes past the hour. Liftoff on Apollo 11. 
        
     King later said he was so excited, he said engine instead of engines. He had no script and stuck to the bare facts, he said in 2009. Former space shuttle commander Robert Cabana, now director of Kennedy Space Center, called King a great communicator and said he will be missed. All of us watching on television will never forget his calm, reassuring demeanor, Cabana said in a statement. Jack was a true professional and helped us understand in common English the complexities of space flight.  King left for NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston after Apollo 11 and was a member of the three-man team that negotiated an information plan for the joint U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz flight in 1975. It resulted in the first live TV coverage of a Soviet rocket launch, Harris said. He went to Washington in 1975 to direct public relations for the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration. He left government in 1977 to work for Armand Hammer and Occidental International Corp. and others, before trying out retirement in 1996. He moved to Cocoa Beach, Florida, near the space center, and became a spokesman for United Space Alliance, a Lockheed Martin and Boeing venture to prepare the space shuttles for flight. He retired in 2010. He was a pioneer in the public relations business for NASA, Harris said, And he worked out many of the protocols for working with the news media here at the launch site. He loved space, right up to the end. On May 30, Harris said he took King and Kings daughter to the space center for the annual induction ceremony for the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame. But upon arriving, King collapsed and was taken to the hospital. He lived and breathed the space program; he loved it from the beginning, said his daughter, Beth King Post of Cocoa Beach. King is also survived by a son, Harold Chip King of Bluffton, South Carolina, and five grandchildren. ___ Online: NASA: http://tinyurl.com/pyyhu6e",https://apnews.com/general-news-2a65d1e4766040ffad3c3fb60e45bd8a,science
"Pluto just 4 weeks, 20 million miles away for spacecraft","CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  NASAs New Horizons spacecraft is at Plutos doorstep, following an incredible journey of nine years and 3 billion miles (4.83 billion kilometers). Four weeks from Tuesday  on July 14  New Horizons will make its closest approach to Pluto. The spacecraft will fly within 7,750 miles, inside the orbits of Plutos five known moons. Thats the approximate distance between Seattle and Sydney. It will be the first spacecraft to explore the tiny, icy world once considered a full-fledged planet. As of Tuesday, New Horizons was just over 20 million miles (32.2 million kilometers) from Pluto. Thats closer than Earth is to neighbor Venus, at their closest point. Flight controllers fired a thruster on the spacecraft over the weekend to fine-tune its path. This is one charged-up team, principal investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado said last week. They know that theyre getting to do something very special because nothing like this has happened since Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune in 1989. NASAs first interplanetary success was at Venus, with Mariner 2 in 1962. Stern added: Were going to turn a point of light into a planet and its moons overnight in the next month. The Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, is operating the spacecraft for NASA. The lab also designed and built the relatively lightweight craft, about the size of a baby grand piano. It carries seven science instruments; the cameras have been photographing the planet since January. 
        
     The latest pictures, taken at the end of May and beginning of June, show large dark regions toward the bottom of Pluto. Scientists are eager to learn the size and shape of these dark spots, as well as their exact location. Images will keep improving with every step closer to Pluto. Its very fascinating to see this level of detail, deputy project scientist Cathy Olkin said during an update broadcast Tuesday. Pluto was discovered by the late American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. Its moons, the fifth unmasked as recently as 2012, also bear names related to the mythological underworld: big moon Charon and mini-moons Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. More moons could be out there. Were going to write the textbook. We know very little about the Pluto system now, Stern said. Its really a mission of raw exploration, flying into the unknown to see whats there. New Horizons $700 million mission began with a 2006 launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. ___ Online: Johns Hopkins: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/",https://apnews.com/pluto-just-4-weeks-20-million-miles-away-for-spacecraft-f2f770115b424f4bbd4446c77d49ddf7,science
"SpaceX rocket destroyed on way to space station, cargo lost","An unmanned SpaceX rocket carrying supplies to the International Space Station broke apart Sunday shortly after liftoff. It was a severe blow to NASA, the third cargo mission to fail in eight months. The accident happened about 2 minutes into the flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida. A billowing white cloud emerged in the sky, growing bigger and bigger, then fiery plumes shot out. Pieces of the rocket could be seen falling into the Atlantic like a fireworks display gone wrong. More than 5,200 pounds of space station cargo were on board, including the first docking port designed for future commercial crew capsules, a new spacesuit and a water filtration system. NASA officials said they have enough supplies for the three-person crew on board the station to last till October and still plan to send three more crewmembers up in a late July launch. NASA likes to have a six-month cushion of food and water, but is now down to four months. Were good from a food and water standpoint, NASAs top spaceflight official, William Gerstenmaier said at a press conference. This puts added pressure on another resupply launch scheduled for Friday by Russia, its first attempt since losing a supply capsule in April. SpaceXs Falcon 9 rocket shattered while traveling at 2,900 mph, about 27 miles up. Everything seemed to be going well until the rocket went supersonic. We appear to have had a launch vehicle failure, announced NASA commentator George Diller. 
        
     Data stopped flowing from the Falcon 9 rocket around 2 minutes and 19 seconds, he said. SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk later said that the pressure got too high in the liquid-oxygen tank of the rockets upper stage. Thats all we can say with confidence right now, Musk said via Twitter. The private company is in charge of the accident investigation, with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration, which licensed the flight. The Dragon capsule, which is designed to eventually carry people, still sent signals to the ground after the rocket broke apart, said SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell. Had astronauts been on board, a still-being tested abort system, would have whisked them away to safety in such a mishap, she said. SpaceX hopes to launch astronauts from U.S. soil again aboard the Falcon-Dragon combination in December 2017. They still can make that target, Shotwell said. Now NASA buys seats from Russia to get astronauts to the orbiting lab. Shotwell assured reporters that the California-based company will fix the problem  and get back to flight. Losing this shipment  which included replacements for items lost in the two earlier failed supply flights  was a huge setback for NASA. This is a blow to us, Gerstenmaier said, citing the docking port, a spacesuit and considerable scientific research that had been on board. He said there was nothing common among the three accidents, other than its space and its difficult to go fly. In April, a Russian cargo ship spun out of control and burned up upon re-entry. And last October, an Orbital Sciences Corp. capsule was destroyed in a launch accident in Virginia. Orbital Sciences and SpaceX have NASA contracts to ship cargo. Three failures on three different vehicles is unusual, but it would be even more worrisome if we had only one means of access, former NASA associate administrator Scott Pace wrote in an email to The Associated Press. In addition to Fridays scheduled Russian launch, Orbital Sciences may be able to launch their supply ship at the end of this year, using another companys rocket. And a Japanese resupply ship is scheduled for August, Gerstenmaier said. The seven previous SpaceX supply runs, dating back to 2012, had gone exceedingly well. For a group of students from North Charleston, S.C., the failure was a second dose of disappointment. Their student experiment on soldering circuit boards had been on the Orbital launch. The explosion was so strong and they were so close they could feel the heat on their faces back in October, student Rachel Lindbergh said. This time, they were in Florida. They high fived each other after the rocket soared off the pad. Were not going to let this deter us, said Lindbergh. Disappointing, sure. But this happens in spaceflight. You cant let things stop you. The three space station residents were watching the launch live from orbit, including astronaut Scott Kelly. Sadly failed, Kelly said via Twitter. Space is hard. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and other officials stressed that the space station crew is in no immediate trouble. NASA space station program manager Mike Suffredini said the water filtration system is nearing the point where it cant function much longer, but there is still enough stored water to make it to October or so. Gerstenmaier said the loss shouldnt postpone plans to send three more men to join the crew on July 22, a flight already delayed two months. Along with SpaceX, Boeing is also developing crew capsules for NASA. Boeing designed the new docking system that was lost on the SpaceX flight, but a second version is still available to send up, officials said. Shotwell said the first stage of the rocket seemed to work well. The company had planned to try to land the discarded booster on an ocean platform. Kellys identical twin, Mark, a former space shuttle commander who is taking part in medical studies on the ground, pointed out that SpaceX, until now, had a great record with its Falcon 9 rockets. These things happen, he said in a tweet. They will figure this out. Launch spectators lining the beaches near Cape Canaveral were confused, at first, by the unexpected plumes in the sky. It looked fine until it was almost out of sight. And then, a poof of smoke, said Whitney Jackson of Palm Beach, Florida, watching with her family. Everyone was cheering and clapping. No one knew it meant failure. The Air Force later warned people along the Florida coast not to handle any debris washing ashore. Sunday was Musks 44th birthday. The SpaceX founder also runs his electric car company, Tesla. Yeah, not the best birthday, Musk tweeted. ___ AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein in Washington and reporter Alex Sanz in Atlanta contributed to this report. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-29bf226917954d6e9358b01e83d3a6f5,science
Its showtime for Pluto; prepare to be amazed by NASA flyby,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Pluto, reveal thyself, and Earthlings, enjoy the show. On Tuesday, NASAs New Horizons spacecraft will sweep past Pluto and present the previously unexplored world in all its icy glory. It promises to be the biggest planetary unveiling in a quarter-century. The curtain hasnt been pulled back like this since NASAs Voyager 2 shed light on Neptune in 1989. Now its little Plutos turn to shine way out on the frigid fringes of our solar system. New Horizons has traveled 3 billion miles over 9 years to get to this historic point. The fastest spacecraft ever launched, it carries the most powerful suite of science instruments ever sent on a scouting and reconnaissance mission of a new, unfamiliar world. Guarantees principal scientist Alan Stern, Were going to knock your socks off. The size of a baby grand piano, the spacecraft will come closest to Pluto on Tuesday morning  at 7:49 a.m. EDT. Thats when New Horizons is predicted to pass within 7,767 miles of Pluto. Fourteen minutes later, the spacecraft will zoom within 17,931 miles of Charon, Plutos jumbo moon. For the plutophiles among us, it will be cause to celebrate, especially for those gathered at the operations center at Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. The lab designed and built the spacecraft for NASA, and has been managing its roundabout route through the solar system. What NASAs doing with New Horizons is unprecedented in our time and probably something close to the last train to Clarksville, the last picture show, for a very, very long time, says Stern, a planetary scientist with the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. 
        
     It is the last stop in NASAs quest to explore every planet in our solar system, starting with Venus in 1962. And in a cosmic coincidence, the Pluto visit falls on the 50th anniversary of the first-ever flyby of Mars, by Mariner 4. Yes, we all know Pluto is no longer an official planet, merely a dwarf, but it still enjoyed full planet status when New Horizons rocketed from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Jan. 19, 2006. Plutos demotion came just seven months later, a sore subject still for many. Were kind of running the anchor leg with Pluto to finish the relay, Stern says. The sneak peeks of Pluto in recent weeks are getting juicier and juicier, says Johns Hopkins project scientist Hal Weaver. The science team is just drooling over these pictures. The Hubble Space Telescope previously captured the best pictures of Pluto. If the pixelated blobs of pictures had been of Earth, though, not even the continents would have been visible. The New Horizons team is turning a point of light into a planet, Stern says. An image released last week shows a copper-colored Pluto bearing, a large, bright spot in the shape of a heart. Scientists expect image resolution to improve dramatically by Tuesday. The 7,767-mile span at closest approach is about the distance between Seattle and Sydney. New Horizons, weighing less than 1,000 pounds including fuel, has seven instruments that will be going full force during the encounter. Its expected to collect 5,000 times as much data, for instance, as Mariner 4. Were going to rewrite the book, Weaver says. This is it  this is our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see it. The team gets one crack at this. Were trying to hit a very small box, relatively speaking, says Mark Holdridge, the encounter mission manager. Its 60 by 90 miles, and were going 30,000 mph, and were trying to hit that box within a plus or minus 100 seconds. The only planet in our solar system discovered by an American, Pluto actually is a mini solar system unto itself. Pluto  just two-thirds the size of our own moon  has big moon Charon thats just over half its size, as well as baby moons Styx, Nix, Hydra and Kerberos. The names are associated with the underworld in which the mythological god, Pluto, reigned. New Horizons will observe each known moon and keep a lookout for more. Scientists involved in the $700 million effort want to get a good look at Pluto and Charon, and get a handle on their surfaces and chemical composition. They also plan to measure the temperature and pressure in Plutos nitrogen-rich atmosphere and determine how much gas is escaping into space. Temperatures can plunge to nearly minus-400 degrees. Bill McKinnon, a New Horizons team member from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, expects to see craters and possible volcanic remnants. A liquid ocean and a rocky core may lie beneath the icy shell. Anybody who thinks that when we go to Pluto, were going to find cold, dead ice balls is in for a rude shock, McKinnon says. Im really hoping to see a very active and dynamic world. Pluto has tantalized astronomers since its 1930 discovery by Clyde Tombaugh using the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Some of Tombaughs ashes are aboard New Horizons. His two children, now in their 70s, plan to be at Johns Hopkins for the encounter. With its tilted, elongated 248-year orbit, Pluto has made it only a third of the way around the sun since its discovery. The amount of sunlight that reaches Pluto is so dim that at high noon it looks like twilight here on Earth. The massive surrounding Kuiper Belt, in fact, is called the Twilight Zone. The New Horizons team has its eyes on a few much smaller objects in the Kuiper Belt, and is hoping for a mission extension as the spacecraft continues toward the solar system exit on the heels of NASAs Voyagers 1 and 2 and Pioneers 10 and 11. For now, signals take 4 hours to travel one-way between New Horizons and flight controllers in Maryland. New Horizons science instruments will be cranked up to collect maximum data Tuesday, leaving no time to send back data. In fact, scientists wont be absolutely certain of success until Tuesday night, 13 hours following New Horizons closest approach, when it phones home. It will be Wednesday before the closest of Plutos close-ups are available for release. And it will be well into next year  October 2016  before all the anticipated data are transmitted to Earth. Were all going to have to be patient, urges deputy project scientist Cathy Olkin. For everyone involved, this is a mission of delayed gratification. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/ Johns Hopkins University: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/",https://apnews.com/general-news-b20fa27e7f084bb58497a817cc92939c,science
Little Pluto bigger than scientists thought as flyby looms,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Little Pluto is a little bigger than anyone imagined. On the eve of NASAs historic flyby of Pluto, scientists announced Monday the New Horizons spacecraft has nailed the size of the faraway icy world. Measurements by the spacecraft set to sweep past Pluto on Tuesday indicate the diameter of the dwarf planet is 1,473 miles, plus or minus 12 miles. Thats about 50 miles bigger than previous estimates in the low range. Principal scientist Alan Stern said this means Pluto has a lower density than thought, which could mean an icier and less rocky interior. New Horizons 3 billion-mile, 9-year journey from Cape Canaveral, Florida, culminates Tuesday morning when the spacecraft zooms within 7,767 miles of Pluto at 31,000 mph. Mission managers said theres only one chance in 10,000 something could go wrong, like a debilitating debris strike, this late in the game. But Stern cautioned: Were flying into the unknown. This is the risk we take with all kinds of exploration. It sounds like science fiction, but its not, Stern said as he opened a news conference at mission headquarters in Maryland. Tomorrow morning a United States spacecraft will fly by the Pluto system and make history. Discovered in 1930, Pluto is the last planet in our solar system to be explored. It was a full-fledged planet when New Horizons rocketed away in 2006, only to become demoted to dwarf status later that year. 
        
     New Horizons has already beamed back the best-ever images of Pluto and big moon Charon on the far fringes of the solar system. The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness, its alien beauty, said Stern, a planetary scientist at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. With the encounter finally at hand, it all seems surreal for the New Horizons team gathered at Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory. The energy there Monday was described as electric. Project manager Glen Fountain said New Horizons, at long last, is like a freight train barreling down the track, and youre seeing this light coming at you and you know its not going to stop, you cant slow it down. Of course, the light is Pluto, and were all excited, Fountain said. Three new discoveries were revealed Monday, a tantalizing sneak preview as the countdown to closest approach reached the 21-hour mark. Besides the revised size of Pluto  still a solar system runt, not even one-fifth the size of Earth  scientists have confirmed that Plutos north pole is indeed icy as had been suspected. Its packed with methane and nitrogen ice. And traces of Plutos nitrogen-rich atmosphere have been found farther from the dwarf planet than anticipated. New Horizons detected lost nitrogen nearly a week ago. As for pictures, the resolution is going to increase dramatically. Until New Horizons, the best pictures of Pluto came from the Hubble Space Telescope. Hubble did its best from Earth orbit, but managed to produce only crude pixelated blobs of the minuscule world. The New Horizons spacecraft is the size of a baby grand piano with a salad bowl  the dish antenna  on top. It will come closest to Pluto at 7:49 a.m. EDT Tuesday. Thirteen hours later, around 9 p.m. EDT, flight controllers will learn if everything went well. The spacecraft will have sent the confirmation signal 4 hours earlier; thats the one-way, speed-of-light, data-transit time between New Horizons and Earth. Stern expects a little bit of drama during closest approach, when the spacecraft is out of touch with ground controllers. New Horizons cannot make observations and send back data at the same time, so scientists opted for maximum science during those most critical hours. Pluto is the largest object in the so-called Kuiper Belt, considered the third zone of the solar system after the inner rocky planets and outer gaseous ones. This unknown territory is a shooting gallery of comets and other small bodies; every time one of these wayward objects smack one of Plutos five known moons, the ejected material ends up in orbit around Pluto, thus the debris concern. An extension of the $720 million mission, not yet approved, could have New Horizons flying past another much smaller Kuiper Belt object, before departing the solar system. Stern expects two opportunities to celebrate Tuesday: one at the time of closest approach and the other once confirmation is received that New Horizons stayed safe and accomplished its long-awaited mission. There is that element of exploration and theres that small element of danger, he said, so I think were all going to breathe the final sigh of relief at 9 p.m. and thats when we can really call it a successful flyby. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/ Johns Hopkins University: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/",https://apnews.com/little-pluto-bigger-than-scientists-thought-as-flyby-looms-2e33de5717ff4c59b5729e5e04bdfc2d,science
Spotlight shining on Pluto on cold outskirts of solar system,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The spotlight is bright enough to thaw even Pluto. Well, not quite, but the tiny, icy world is getting front-page, prime-time attention as NASAs New Horizons spacecraft zooms closer. Tuesday mornings 31,000-mph flyby  with closest approach at 7,767 miles  is expected to open up new ground on the last unexplored planetary territory of our solar system. Turning little dots, little points of light into planets, is what New Horizons, on the road for 9 years and 3 billion miles, is all about, principal scientist Alan Stern said Monday. Heres a rundown on Pluto, a 20th-century discovery about to become the 21st-century darling of astronomers: DISCOVERY: Pluto is the only planet (OK, now former planet) in our solar system discovered by an American. Astronomer Clyde Tombaugh spotted the dot in 1930 from Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. The name Pluto came from a British schoolgirl, Venetia Burney, then 11, based on the mythological god of the underworld. Tombaugh died at age 90 in 1997, nine years before New Horizons took flight. A smidgen of his ashes is on board. Burney died in 2009, also at age 90. A student-built dust counter aboard New Horizons  from the University of Colorado at Boulder  is named after her. FIVE MOONS: Big moon Charon was discovered in 1978 by Americans using the U.S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff, followed by little moons Nix and Hydra in 2005, Kerberos in 2011 and Styx in 2012. The Hubble Space Telescope revealed all four baby moons. Astronomers stuck to underworld undertones when it came to the names. 
        
     New Horizons will hunt for more moons, but at this point, they would have to be pretty elusive  scientists guess probably less than a mile across. The Pluto empire, complete with six bodies, at least for now, is like its own mini solar system. FORGET THE SUNGLASSES: Pluto is so far from the sun  between 2.8 billion and 4.6 billion miles  that twilight reigns. At high noon on Pluto, it looks as though it would be dawn or dusk on Earth. And lets not forget the frigid weather, given its distance from the sun. Temperatures can plunge to minus-400 degrees. Plutos orbit is extremely oblong, plus its tilted. It takes 248 years for Pluto to orbit the sun. Thus, its only made it about one-third of the way around the sun since its discovery in 1930. Every so often, Neptunes orbit exceeds Plutos, putting Neptune slightly farther out. FIRST A PLANET, THEN ITS NOT: Pluto is the only planet to get kicked out of the solar system club. Just seven months after New Horizons rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the International Astronomical Union declassified Pluto as the ninth planet for technical reasons. Instead, it became a dwarf planet. The decision left the solar system with eight full-fledged planets, with Mercury replacing Pluto as the smallest. On Monday, scientists said measurements by New Horizons showed Pluto to be 1,473 miles in diameter, a little bigger than earlier estimates. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: Pluto is the biggest object in the icy Kuiper Belt, also known as the third zone after the inner rocky planets and outer gaseous giants. Its also called the Twilight Zone because of its great distance from the sun. The Kuiper Belt (pronounced KIE-per) is full of comets and other small frosty objects. Its named after the late Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who proposed a bevy of small bodies beyond Neptune back in the 1950s. The New Horizons team hopes to go after a smaller Kuiper Belt object following the Pluto flyby, provided a mission extension is approved. ___ Online: Johns Hopkins University: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/",https://apnews.com/spotlight-shining-on-pluto-on-cold-outskirts-of-solar-system-ccb002d33db1464fad1eca16531e3da1,science
NASA scrubs Orion launch; will try again Friday,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Wind gusts and sluggish fuel valves conspired to keep NASAs new Orion spacecraft on the launch pad Thursday, delaying a crucial test flight meant to revitalize human exploration. NASA aimed for another shot Friday morning as tens of thousands of disappointed and weary launch guests hustled out. The weather report was iffy  forecasters expected higher winds, clouds and rain  but managers were optimistic the wind direction would shift in their favor. United Launch Alliances Dan Collins, whos in charge of the unmanned Delta IV rocket, said he was confident the valve trouble, seen before on a previous mission, could be quickly overcome. The team was absolutely on their game, listening to everything the rocket was telling us, and it ultimately told us it wasnt ready to go today, Collins told reporters. And so well go make sure weve got a happy rocket ... and send Orion off to a very, very successful test flight. Orion is how NASA hopes to send astronauts on round trips to Mars in the decades ahead. This inaugural flight, while just 4 1/2 hours, will send the unmanned capsule 3,600 miles into space. Its the first attempt to send a spacecraft capable of carrying humans beyond a couple hundred miles of Earth since the Apollo moon program. NASAs new countdown clock  making its debut alongside Orion  got a workout as problem after problem cropped up in the final four minutes Thursday. 
        
     The initial launch was delayed by excessive wind and a cargo ship believed to be in the launch-danger zone; it later turned out the ship was in a safe spot. Then the valve trouble cropped up in the rockets first-stage boosters. It was a roller coaster: Were going, were not going, said Sarah McNulty, a space educator who was helping NASA escort the several-hundred news media on hand. Im running on no hours of sleep, zero, zero hours. An estimated 27,000 guests gathered for the historic send-off  roads leading into Kennedy Space Center were packed well before dawn  and the atmosphere was reminiscent of the shuttle-flying days. Go Orion!! urged a hotel billboard in nearby Cocoa Beach. Astronauts in attendance included Anna Fischer, one of NASAs original spacewomen, and now assigned to the Orion program. She too was disappointed by the delay, but said Its way more important to have a successful flight. It was so much fun to come out here and have that same atmosphere as before a shuttle launch, Fisher said. We really miss that. Thats why were here. This is what we love. Orion is aiming for two orbits on this inaugural run, reaching a peak altitude of 3,600 miles, high enough to ensure a 20,000 mph re-entry at a scorching 4,000 degrees. Splashdown will be in the Pacific off the Mexican Baja coast, where Navy ships are waiting. The $370 million test flight  excluding the price of the capsule, which will be reused in a launch abort test  covers all delay-associated costs for the near term, according to officials. The spacecraft is rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge everything from heat to vibration to radiation. At 11 feet tall with a 16.5-foot base, Orion is bigger than the old-time Apollo capsules and, obviously, more advanced. NASA deliberately kept astronauts off this first Orion. Managers want to test the riskiest parts of the spacecraft  the heat shield, parachutes, various jettisoning components  before committing to a crew. The earliest Orion might carry passengers is 2021; asteroids are on the space agencys radar sometime in the 2020s and Mars, the grand prize, in the 2030s. Lockheed Martin Corp., which is handling the test flight for NASA, opted for the powerful Delta IV rocket this time around. Future Orion missions will rely on NASAs still-in-development megarocket known as SLS, or Space Launch System. The first Orion-SLS combo launch is targeted for 2018. NASAs last trip beyond low-Earth orbit in a vessel built for people was Apollo 17 in December 1972, the last time men set foot on the moon. Its a thrilling prospect when you think about actually exploring the solar system, space station commander Butch Wilmore said from orbit before the delay. Who knows where it will take us? ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/orion/ Lockheed Martin: http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/ssc/orion-eft1.html",https://apnews.com/nasa-scrubs-orion-launch-will-try-again-friday-08feffc76f804182aa6ffcc8ccdc2ae6,science
"Mars mountain may have formed from big, wet lake","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Curiosity rover is helping scientists close in on a Martian mystery: Why does a mountain jut out of a barren crater? Scientists said Monday that rock images indicate that 3-mile-high Mount Sharp may have formed in a big lake bed over a million or even tens of millions of years. Deposits of sediment seem to have shaped the mountain. That begs the question as to whether microbial life may have existed there in those wet ancient times. This lake was large enough, it could have lasted millions of years  sufficient time for life to get started and thrive, sufficient time for lake sediment to build up to form Mount Sharp, said Michael Meyer, lead scientist of NASAs Mars exploration program. Curiositys latest observations could mean Mars warm, wet period occurred about 3.5 billion years ago, more recent than had been thought. In addition, Martian lakes could have lasted longer than previously suspected. Scientists are uncertain whether this wet period was continuous or interrupted by dry spells. Meyer acknowledged that even here on Earth, we dont have a very good handle on how long it takes life to originate and how long a conducive environment needs to be in place beforehand. So addressing the possibility of whether life once existed on other planets is made all the more complicated. Curiosity has been exploring Gale Crater since its arrival on Mars two years ago; the rover reached the base of Mount Sharp a few months ago. The crater, 96 miles across, was caused by an asteroid impact. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/",https://apnews.com/mars-mountain-may-have-formed-from-big-wet-lake-4869b8aed224435cb9a6fbe0bdcf7965,science
2 astronauts will expand envelope with 1-year spaceflight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The two men assigned to a one-year spaceflight said Thursday that their upcoming mission will allow the world to push deeper into space. NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will rocket into orbit from Kazakhstan in March and move into the International Space Station for an entire year. For NASA, it will represent a space endurance record; for Russia, it will fall two months shy of its world record. At a news conference Thursday at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, Kelly and Kornienko said they anticipate many scientific gains from their mission. Researchers need to know more about the prolonged effects of space on humans, before astronauts embark on Mars expeditions lasting three years, round trip, they said. What makes this exciting for me, this one-year flight, is about the science and everything were going to learn from expanding the envelope on the space station, Kelly said. If were ever going to go to Mars someday, the International Space Station is really a great platform to learn much more about having people live and work in space for longer durations. Its close to the Earth, and its a great orbiting facility. Kelly and Kornienko have been training for this mission since their selection two years ago. Both already have spent a half-year aboard the orbiting lab, on separate flights, and have been advised by previous yearlong space fliers to pace yourself. The 50-year-old Kelly, a former Navy fighter pilot, said his goals are the same as they are every time he flies in space: No one gets hurt, we dont break anything and we leave as friends. 
        
     Kelly noted that his first spaceflight, back in 1999, lasted eight days. At the time, it seemed like that was a long time. His second flight, also on a space shuttle, lasted 13 days, and his space station visit in 2010 lasted 159 days. Theyre getting longer, he told reporters. I think if I fly again, it just goes on forever and I never come home. Kornienko, 54, a former Soviet paratrooper, said the support of his family has helped him deal with the preparations and the flight itself. He had exciting personal news for those tuning in: You can congratulate me. I am becoming grandpa. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/2-astronauts-will-expand-envelope-with-1-year-spaceflight-9be22eaf171f498da68f13d39f3af726,science
"SpaceX shoots for launch to station, rocket landing on barge","CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  SpaceX is making another supply run to the International Space Station for NASA. But its the rockets return  not its takeoff  that has space fans talking. Minutes after Tuesday mornings planned launch from Cape Canaveral, the first stage of the unmanned Falcon rocket will aim for a vertical test landing on a barge in the Atlantic. The 14-story booster will soar close to 150 miles (241 kilometers) high, before flying back down and attempting to settle upright on the floating platform  close to the size of a football field. When you look at it on the ground, I think its probably a very, very big platform, a big spaceport, Hans Koenigsmann, vice president for mission assurance at SpaceX, said Monday on the eve of launch. But if you look at it from, I think, almost 150 or so miles up in suborbit, then it looks like a very, very small place to land on. Im going to be super-excited if this works, Koenigsmann noted. But he stressed that he did not want anyone losing sight of the main purpose of the Falcons mission: to deliver critical supplies to the space station and its six inhabitants. This will be the sixth flight of a supply-filled Dragon capsule to the orbiting lab. Its loaded more than usual because of an October launch explosion that wiped out another companys delivery effort in October; this Dragon is stuffed with more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms) of goods, much of it replacing items lost on the Orbital Sciences Corp. flight. 
        
     As for the audacious landing experiment, once the first-stage booster has completed its primary job of hoisting Dragon, its entirely a SpaceX operation. The California-based company has attempted two such landings before on the open sea, both of them successful, but never on a platform like this. Normally, the boosters are discarded at sea. SpaceX founder and chief Elon Musk predicts a 50-50 chance of success at best. He maintains that flying back boosters would allow them to be reused, speed up launches and save money. The ultimate goal, in years to come, is achieving a near aircraft-like operation. Theres a certain likelihood that this will not work out right, that something will go wrong, Koenigsmann told reporters. Nobody has ever tried that to our knowledge. The platform  called a drone  was described by Koenigsmann as stable even in high waves and wind. As of Monday, it was already stationed a couple hundred miles off the coast of northeastern Florida, the target touchdown spot. On its website, SpaceX described the effort to stabilize the booster, traveling at nearly 1 mile per second, like trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm. Automatic engine firings will control the descent  while big, the booster will be lightweight by this point  with touchdown occurring nine minutes after liftoff. Its doubtful flight controllers will have instant confirmation. No one will be on the platform. A ship with SpaceX crew, positioned at least 10 miles (16 kilometers) away, would assist with recovery. Regardless of the outcome, the California-based company intends to try for more experimental landings on the barge and demonstrate safety before coming in for ground landings. Air Force staff will have the ability to destroy the first stage, as always, if it veers seriously off course, according to Koenigsmann. NASAs previous delivery attempt, by Orbital Sciences, ended with the launch explosion just seconds after liftoff from Wallops Island, Virginia. Researchers who lost experiments in the accident  many of them children  hustled to get replacements on this flight. NASA also had to make sure necessary equipment for spacewalking and other crew activity was on board the Dragon, as well as extra food. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-9558aaff6a234088819acbd9ce878aa9,science
Rocket problem postpones SpaceX launch to space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  SpaceX called off a supply flight to the International Space Station on Tuesday because of rocket trouble, another delay in the delivery of groceries and overdue Christmas presents. The countdown was halted just over a minute before launch when a steering mechanism in the rocket malfunctioned  behaving strangely, as SpaceX chief Elon Musk noted via Twitter. The soonest SpaceX can try again to launch the unmanned Falcon rocket is Friday morning, provided it can quickly fix the problem. NASA took the latest shipment delay in stride, while the company faced three more days of anxious waiting for its unprecedented rocket-landing test  attempting to fly back the main booster to a platform in the ocean. The Dragon capsule is loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2,270 kilograms) of food, science experiments and equipment for an upcoming series of spacewalks, as well as belated holiday surprises for the six station astronauts. The station pantry took a hit when another companys supply ship was destroyed in a launch explosion a few months ago. Space station commander Butch Wilmore said the six crew members ran out of condiments a month ago, and hes yearning for some yellow mustard to spice up the food. He and his crewmates were watching the launch countdown just before sunrise live via a video feed from Mission Control in Houston. Certainly, theres a little bit of disappointment because it had fresh fruit and those types of things that were all interested in getting, Wilmore said in an interview with The Associated Press after the postponement. But theyll get off the ground here in a couple of days and it will all be great. 
        
     SpaceX officials said one of two motors needed for rocket thrust steering of the second stage was moving when it should have been still. If controllers had not aborted the launch, computers likely would have done so closer to flight time, officials said. Once the Dragon is on its way, the California-based company will try to fly the first-stage booster rocket to a platform in the Atlantic. No one has ever pulled off such a touchdown. Normally, the boosters are discarded at sea. SpaceXs founder, Musk, said recovering and reusing rockets could speed up launches and drive down costs. The delivery was supposed to occur before Christmas, but was delayed twice in mid-December, once because of a flawed test firing of the rocket engines. The test was repeated successfully, paving the way for Tuesdays try  the sixth supply run by SpaceX since 2012. NASA is using SpaceX and another private company  Orbital Sciences Corp.  to help keep the space station stocked. The last shipment attempt  by Orbital  ended in an explosion seconds after the October liftoff from Virginia. Orbital has grounded its rocket fleet until next year.

"SpaceX tries again to launch station supplies, land rocket","CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  SpaceX is taking another crack at delivering supplies to the International Space Station and landing the rocket on an ocean barge. The companys unmanned Falcon rocket is set to blast off before dawn Saturday from Cape Canaveral, Florida. On Tuesday, steering-system trouble halted the countdown at the last minute. A suspect motor was replaced. The rocket holds more than 5,000 pounds (2,267 kilograms) of space station supplies. NASA needs the shipment more than ever because of a launch explosion last fall that destroyed another companys supply ship. Good weather is forecast for the 4:47 a.m. (947 GMT) launch. Once Dragon is headed to the station, SpaceX will attempt to fly the first-stage booster to a platform in the Atlantic for a vertical landing.

"SpaceX launches for NASA, no luck with rocket landing at sea","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX sent a supply ship soaring flawlessly toward the International Space Station on Saturday, but the booster rocket ended up in pieces in the Atlantic following a failed attempt to land on a barge. Close, but no cigar this time, the companys billionaire founder, Elon Musk, announced via Twitter shortly after the unprecedented touchdown effort. Despite the high-profile flop in the dark ocean, Musk said he was encouraged. The 14-story booster managed, at least, to fly back to the floating platform from an altitude dozens of miles high. Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard, he said in a tweet. Bodes well for the future tho. Hes already planning another landing test next month. Musk, who also runs electric car maker Tesla Motors, maintains that recovering and reusing rockets is essential for bringing down launch costs and speeding up operations. Until Saturday, no one had ever tried anything like this before. The modified barge  nearly the size of a football field  was positioned a couple hundred miles off Floridas northeastern coast. The uncrewed platform was spared serious damage from the impact, although some equipment on deck will need to be replaced, according to Musk. A recovery ship with SpaceX staff was a safe 10 miles away. SpaceXs primary mission was delivering more than 5,000 pounds of station supplies ordered up by NASA, including hasty replacements for experiments and equipment lost in the destruction of another companys cargo ship last fall, as well as extra groceries. Belated Christmas presents were also on board for the six station astronauts. 
        
     Hurrah! A #Dragon is coming to visit bringing gifts, Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said in a tweet from orbit. Without interfering with the $133 million delivery, Musk had fins for guidance and landing legs installed on the first stage of the unmanned Falcon rocket. Once separated from the upper stage of the rocket, the main booster reignited as planned for the flyback. Automatic engine firings maneuvered the booster down toward the autonomous, modified barge. The Air Force maintained the ability, as always, to destroy the booster if it strayed off course. There was no good video of the landing/impact, Musk said, noting the pitch dark and foggy conditions. Brief TV images from booster cameras, broadcast by NASA, showed only water bubbles. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces, said Musk, one of the co-founders of PayPal. Later in the day, Musk said the fins on the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid right before touchdown. Regardless, he praised his team for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month, he said. In the weeks preceding the test, Musk had estimated there was a 50-50 chance, at best, that the Falcons first-stage booster would land vertically on the platform. A pair of attempts last year to bring boosters down vertically on the open ocean went well, but company officials conceded before Saturdays try that a platform touchdown was considerably more challenging. The platform measures 300 feet by 100 feet, with wings stretching the width to 170 feet  a relatively puny spaceport in the vastness of the sea. NASA watched the post-launch drama with keen interest, but its primary focus was on the Dragon racing toward the space station. The capsule is due to arrive there Monday. The shipment  the sixth by SpaceX since 2012  is especially crucial given the recent loss of another companys supply ship. Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Antares rocket exploded seconds after liftoff in October, destroying the entire payload and damaging the Virginia launch complex. That rocket is grounded until 2016. Orbital Sciences plans to shift some of the backlog to an Atlas rocket later this year. This SpaceX delivery was supposed to occur before Christmas, but was delayed by a flawed test-firing of the rocket. Then a problem with the rockets steering system cropped up at the last minute during Tuesdays initial launch attempt. NASA is paying SpaceX and Orbital Sciences to keep the space station stocked in the wake of the retired shuttle program. The $1.6 billion contract with SpaceX calls for 12 flights; the $1.9 billion contract with Orbital calls for eight. SpaceX also returns items to Earth; Orbital cannot. Russia and Japan will make their own supply runs this year. SpaceX, headquartered in Hawthorne, California, also has been contracted by NASA to develop beefed-up Dragons for astronaut rides to the space station, beginning as early as 2017. Boeing also is hard at work on a manned capsule. In the meantime, NASA is paying tens of millions of dollars to Russia for each U.S. astronaut launched aboard the Soyuz spacecraft. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-79093bf8a5994d0385e4927dc685e309,science
SpaceX supply ship arrives at space station with groceries,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A shipment of much-needed groceries and belated Christmas presents finally arrived Monday morning at the International Space Station. The SpaceX companys supply ship, Dragon, pulled up at the orbiting lab two days after its liftoff from Florida. Station commander Butch Wilmore used a robot arm to grab the capsule and its 5,000 pounds of cargo, as the craft soared more than 260 miles above the Mediterranean. The space stations six astronauts were getting a little low on supplies. Thats because the previous supply ship  owned by another company  was destroyed in an October launch explosion. NASA scrambled to get equipment lost in the blast aboard Dragon, as did school children who rustled up new science projects. Then Dragon was stalled a month by rocket snags; it should have gotten to the space station well before Christmas. Mission Control joked about missing not only the December shipment date, but Eastern Orthodox Christmas on Jan. 7 as well for the three Russian crew member. There are also two Americans and an Italian on board. Were excited to have it on board, said U.S. astronaut Wilmore said. Well be digging in soon. Hes especially eager to get more mustard. The stations condiment cabinet is empty. NASA is paying SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corp. for shipments. Orbitals rockets are grounded until next year, however, because of its launch accident. SpaceX  the only supplier capable of returning items to Earth  is picking up as much slack as it can. Russian and Japan also plan deliveries this year. 
        
     SpaceX is still poring over data from Saturdays attempt to land the rocket on a floating barge, the first test of its kind. After the first stage of the Falcon rocket peeled away as planned following liftoff, it flew back to a giant platform floating off the Florida coast. The guidance fins on the booster ran out of hydraulic fluid, however, right before touchdown, and it landed hard and broke into pieces. The California companys billionaire founder, Elon Musk, was encouraged nonetheless and plans another rocket-landing test next month. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/spacex-supply-ship-arrives-at-space-station-with-groceries-73eb980762df4e25a16f3b284bf4e994,science
Astronauts close to moving into space station for year,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  An American astronaut and Russian cosmonaut are just two months from launching to the International Space Station for an entire year. Scientists already are clamoring for additional long-term subjects. Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko will rocket into orbit in late March from Kazakhstan. It will be the first time NASA sends someone into space for 12 months. Two people are not enough from a scientific perspective, NASAs space station program scientist, Julie Robinson, said Thursday. The space agency wants to start collecting data from Kelly and Kornienko before making decisions on further one-year missions, she said. Before committing to lengthy trips to Mars and elsewhere, NASA wants to learn how the body fares after a year in space. NASA space station stints typically last six months. NASA and its partners  Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada  are considering as many as 12 one-year test subjects at the space station. All but Russia are new to such long orbital hauls. Medical and technological breakthroughs since Russias yearlong missions from the 1980s and 1990s means even more will be learned this time around, according to Robinson. The two sides will collaborate on many of the experiments. Kelly will provide an especially unique set of data. His blood and urine samples, as well as other measurements, will be compared with those from his identical twin brother, Mark, a retired astronaut. 
        
     Last week, space station program manager Mike Suffredini said NASA may wait until commercially developed crew capsules are ready to launch astronauts from U.S. soil before building on Kelly and Kornienkos flight. That wont happen before 2017 or 2018. SpaceX and Boeing are the two chosen contractors. Since the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle fleet in 2011, Russian Soyuz spacecraft have served as the only means to ferry crew to and from the space station. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew/",https://apnews.com/article/66d12d566f67469f95a4428853073c45,science
"Asteroid 1,800 feet across to whip past Earth on Monday","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An asteroid up to 1,800 feet across is headed Earths way. But dont worry: It will miss us by 745,000 miles, about three times the distance between Earth and the moon. Still, thats close for such a large rock. NASA scientists say asteroid 2004 BL86 will come closest Monday. That will be the nearest the asteroid gets for another 200 years. And it will be the closest known encounter by such a giant space rock until another mega-asteroid flies by in 2027. It was discovered in 2004 and is estimated to be about one-third of a mile in size, or between 1,600 and 1,800 feet. Amateur astronomers across North America should be able to see it with telescopes and binoculars. ___ Online: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroidwatch/",https://apnews.com/asteroid-1-800-feet-across-to-whip-past-earth-on-monday-7fef949858b84a488073becf5e8dcc44,science
NASA spacecraft almost to Pluto: Smile for the camera!,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Its showtime for Pluto. NASAs New Horizons spacecraft has traveled 3 billion miles and is nearing the end of its nine-year journey to Pluto. Sunday, it begins photographing the mysterious, unexplored, icy world once deemed a planet. The first pictures will reveal little more than bright dots  New Horizons is still more than 100 million miles from Pluto. But the images, taken against star fields, will help scientists gauge the remaining distance and keep the baby grand piano-sized robot on track for a July flyby. It is humanitys first trip to Pluto, and scientists are eager to start exploring. New Horizons has been a mission of delayed gratification in many respects, and its finally happening now, said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory. Its going to be a sprint for the next seven months, basically, to the finish line, he said Friday. We cant wait to turn Pluto into a real world, instead of just a little pixelated blob. Launched from Cape Canaveral in January 2006 on a $700 million mission, New Horizons awoke from its last hibernation period early last month. Flight controllers have spent the past several weeks getting the spacecraft ready for the final but most important leg of its journey. We have been working on this project, some people, for over a quarter of their careers, to make this mission happen, said project manager Glen Fountain of the Applied Physics Lab, and now were about to hit the mother lode. 
        
     The spacecrafts long-range reconnaissance imager will take hundreds of pictures of Pluto over the coming months. It snapped pictures last summer, before going into hibernation, but these new ones should be considerably brighter. It will be a few days before the new images are beamed back to Earth; scientists expect to release them publicly in early February. By May, New Horizons photos should equal and then surpass the ones taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, with pictures of the plutoid and its moons improving with each passing day. The real payoff will come when New Horizons flies by Pluto on July 14 at a distance of 7,700 miles and speed of nearly 31,000 mph. It will whip past Charon, Plutos largest moon, from 18,000 miles out. Scientists have no idea, really, what Pluto looks like way out in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptunes orbit, home to little icy objects galore. Pluto is the biggest object in the Kuiper Belt. Together with mega-moon, Charon, roughly half Plutos size, the two orbs could fit inside the United States with room to spare. Five moons have been found so far around Pluto. More could be lurking out there, awaiting discovery by New Horizons. The Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, designed and built New Horizons, and is now managing the mission for NASA. Pluto was still officially a planet, No. 9 in the solar system lineup, when New Horizons departed Earth. It was the only planet in our solar system yet to be explored. But seven months later, the International Astronomical Union stripped Pluto of its planethood, classifying it instead as a dwarf planet. Later came the term, plutoid. Some scientists are hoping Plutos upcoming close-up  and expected cosmic buzz  may prompt the group to reverse its decision. The nature of science, after all, is fluid, as even the astronomical union maintains. Streator, Illinois,  hometown of Plutos discoverer, the late astronomer Clyde Tombaugh  already has declared 2015 the Year of Pluto. Tombaugh spotted Pluto in 1930. New Horizons may, indeed, turn the tide in some peoples opinions into the other camp, Weaver said. But thats not really so important. More important, he said, is finding out what does Pluto really look like. ___ Online: Johns Hopkins University: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/ International Astronomical Union: http://www.iau.org/",https://apnews.com/nasa-spacecraft-almost-to-pluto-smile-for-the-camera-7524647dfaf04c8bbeb19c945b813b59,science

"Boeing, SpaceX will beat Russia on price for astronaut rides","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA expects to save millions of dollars sending astronauts to the International Space Station, once its commercial crew program starts flying in a couple of years. SpaceX and Boeing said Monday that they are on track to carry out their first manned test flights to the space station in 2017. NASA chose the two private companies last September to transport American astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. U.S. manned launches ended with the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. Until SpaceX and Boeing begin flying crews from Cape Canaveral, NASA astronauts must continue to hitch rocket rides with Russia. NASAs commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders, said the average price for a seat aboard the SpaceX Dragon and Boeing CST-100 capsules will be $58 million. That compares with $71 million a seat charged by Russia under its latest NASA contract. I dont ever want to have to write another check to the Russian Space Agency after 2017, said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, a former shuttle commander. If we can make that date, he said, referring to 2017, Im a happy camper. Unlike the Russian charge, the $58 million per-person cost estimate includes a fair amount of cargo to be flown aboard the SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft, along with four crew members. That price tag is based on a five-year period, Lueders said. The Russian Soyuz holds a maximum of three people, with at least one a Russian to pilot the craft. 
        
     SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the future enhanced Dragon capsule could carry five astronauts  one more than NASAs stipulated four  and still meet all the cargo requirements. The Hawthorne, California, company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, was the space stations first commercial shipper. Its been successfully delivering supplies since 2012 with the Dragon. Virginias Orbital Sciences Corp., NASAs other contracted supplier, has grounded its rocket fleet following a launch explosion last fall. Lueders said the plan is to have two robust providers for crew transport, in case one of them ends up grounded by technical problems. NASA awarded SpaceX $2.6 billion for crew transport, while Boeing got $4.2 billion. Each is to provide two to six missions. Boeings vice president and general manager for Houston-based space exploration, John Elbon, said an unmanned test flight of the CST-100 capsule in 2017 will be followed a few months later by the first crewed test flight. That first manned mission will include one Boeing test pilot and one NASA astronaut, he said. Shotwell said the SpaceX unmanned test flight could occur as early as 2016, followed by a crewed flight in 2017. She said the company is still working on the number and makeup of the first crew. It was the first in-depth public description of the commercial crew effort by NASA and winners SpaceX and Boeing; discussion had been stalled because of a protest lodged by losing competitor Sierra Nevada Corp., developer of the mini-shuttle Dream Chaser. The Government Accountability Office dismissed Sierra Nevadas challenge earlier this month. Some of NASAs 40-something-member astronaut corps turned out for the event at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Bolden urged they better start smiling. While the current astronauts will be the ones flying to the space station on Dragons and CST-100s, it will be the younger, future crop that ends up bound for Mars, he noted. NASA conducted a successful orbital test flight of its new Orion spacecraft last month. Thats the capsule that, along with linked habitats, would get crews to and from Mars in the 2030s under NASAs current plan. Bolden said NASA wouldnt be able to do deep-space exploration if it was still saddled with getting supplies and people to low-Earth orbit. Were about going to Mars, he said. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/ SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ Boeing: http://www.boeing.com/boeing/defense-space/space/ccts/index.page?",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-ca-state-wire-64aa7fbb07304fb497eeda3b253f50ae,science
Astronomers find solar system more than double ours in age,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  A newly discovered solar system  with five small rocky planets  makes ours look like a baby. An international team of astronomers announced Tuesday that this extrasolar system is 11.2 billion years old. With the age of the universe pegged at 13.8 billion years, this is the oldest star with close-to-Earth-size planets ever found. By comparison, our solar system is 4.5 billion years old. The five planets are smaller than Earth, with the largest about the size of Venus and the smallest just bigger than Mercury. These planets orbit their star in less than 10 days at less than one-tenth the Earths distance from the sun, which makes them too close for habitation, said the University of Sydneys Daniel Huber, part of the team. Weve never seen anything like this  it is such an old star and the large number of small planets make it very special, Huber said in a statement. It is extraordinary that such an ancient system of terrestrial-sized planets formed when the universe was just starting out, at a fifth its current age. Lead researcher Tiago Campante of the University of Birmingham in England noted in a statement that by now knowing close-to-Earth-size planets formed so long ago, that could provide scope for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy. Campante, an asteroseismologist, measured oscillations from the star to determine the age and size of this compact system. 
        
     NASAs Kepler planet-hunting spacecraft was used to make the observations over a four-year period. Thus, the bright sunlike star at the heart of this system is named Kepler-444. Its in the Constellation Lyre. The team represented scientists from Europe, Australia and the United States. Their findings were reported in the latest edition of the Astrophysical Journal. Kepler has discovered more than 1,000 confirmed exoplanets  planets outside our solar system  and nearly 4,200 candidates since its launch in 2009 and its revitalization in last year following a breakdown in its pointing system. It reached the 1,000-mark earlier this month. ___ Online: NASA: http://kepler.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/general-news-1b42cd9c22fa48a6b57fcbe1dccbd617,science
Rocket booster aiming for ocean barge in redo of SpaceX test,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  A space weather satellite is poised to blast off Sunday for a destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, but its the rockets ocean landing that is stealing the spotlight. The SpaceX company will take a second stab at landing a booster on a platform floating off the Florida coast; last months experiment ended in a fireball. The near miss on Jan. 10 was caused by an insufficient amount of hydraulic fluid. SpaceX added extra fluid for Sundays sunset landing attempt. But the booster will fly back faster this time given its particular course, and company officials are less certain of success in this attempt to demonstrate rocket reusability. So on one side we fixed the problem, on the other side this trajectory is a lot more aggressive and a lot more difficult, SpaceX vice president Hans Koenigsmann said Saturday. He stressed that the test is secondary and entirely separate from the primary mission of launching the Deep Space Climate Observatory for NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. Excellent weather is forecast for the 6:10 p.m. (2310 GMT) launch. The Deep Space Climate Observatory is the revitalized version of the Earth-observing spacecraft conceived in the late 1990s by then Vice President Al Gore. It was called Triana back then, after the sailor who first spotted land on Christopher Columbus famed voyage. 
        
     The Triana program was suspended, however, and the spacecraft put in storage in 2001. The spacecraft was tested seven years later and refurbished for this new $340 million mission known as DSCOVR, pronounced discover, a joint effort by NASA, NOAA and the Air Force. DSCOVR will travel to the so-called Lagrange point, or L1, a spot 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth and 92 million miles (148 million kilometers) from the sun, where the gravity fields are neutralized. The spacecraft will observe Earth from this ideal vantage point  scientists expect wow pictures of the home planet  but its primary objective will be to monitor outbursts from the sun that could disrupt communications and power back on Earth. Once DSCOVR is on its way, the main booster of the SpaceX Falcon rocket will aim for the ocean platform and attempt a vertical landing within nine to 10 minutes after liftoff. The smaller-than-a-football field platform  dubbed Just Read the Instructions by SpaceXs billionaire founder and chief executive Elon Musk  will be stationed about 370 miles (595 kilometers) offshore. No one will be on this autonomous drone ship; SpaceX staff will be a safe 25 miles (40 kilometers) away aboard a recovery boat. During a space station cargo run for NASA on Jan. 10, the Falcons leftover booster ran out of hydraulic fluid for its guidance fins, but still managed to hit the platform. The booster landed hard, tumbled and exploded, causing minor damage to the platform. Musk termed the attempt close, but no cigar. At a news conference Saturday, Koenigsmann said the company came away pleased. Officials originally pegged the odds of success at 50-50, the same again this time, more or less. Personally, I feel this last time was really an enormous accomplishment on the way to refurbishing and reusing rockets, Koenigsmann said. I dont see this as a failure at all. To me, its just a development step. By reusing rockets, SpaceX hopes to lower launch costs and speed up flights. SpaceX regularly hauls cargo to and from the International Space Station for NASA, and is working to develop a capsule that could carry American astronauts to the orbiting lab in another couple of years. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NOAA: http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/DSCOVR/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/general-news-ae2930f630f542b7b4abd5c49550dd79,science
SpaceX calls off launch of space weather satellite,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX called off Sundays planned launch of a deep-space observatory  and a revolutionary rocket-landing attempt  after a critical radar-tracking system failed. Former Vice President Al Gore, who first envisioned the observatory two decades ago, was on hand for the attempt. The SpaceX company halted the countdown at the 2-minute mark following the loss of the Air Force radar system for tracking the rocket in flight. Chief executive officer Elon Musk said via Twitter that the company would try again Monday and that the delay probably was for the best. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter, the companys billionaire founder wrote, adding that it was not needed for launch, but nice to have. Besides launching its first deep space mission  an observatory that will shoot to a spot 1 million miles from Earth to monitor solar outbursts  SpaceX will attempt its second landing of a leftover booster on an ocean platform. Its part of the companys plan to eventually reuse rockets. The Deep Space Climate Observatory is refashioned from the Earth-observing satellite conceived in the late 1990s by Gore when he was vice president. It was canceled before ever flying and packed away until several years ago, when NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Air Force decided to resurrect it as a space weather sentinel. Gore arrived at Cape Canaveral well in advance of the sunset liftoff, eager to see his brainchild finally soar. He told reporters an hour before the planned launch time that he was grateful to the scientists and others who kept his dream alive. The measurements will help measure global warming, he noted, and the steady stream of pictures of Earth may help mobilize the public to put pressure on the worlds government leaders to take action to save the future of human civilization. 
        
     The constant ability to see the Earth whole, fully sunlit, every single day ... can add to our way of thinking about our relationship to the Earth, said Gore. He was accompanied by Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who flew on the space shuttle as a congressman in 1986. The $340 million mission is meant to provide a heads-up on intense solar activity that can disrupt communications, power and air travel. Thats why the spacecraft is to be stationed 1 million miles from Earth and 92 million miles from the sun, the so-called Lagrange point where the gravity fields are neutralized. NOAAs director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, Tom Berger, likened it to a tsunami buoy. The observatory originally was called Triana, after the sailor who first spotted land on Christopher Columbus historic voyage. Now its dubbed DSCOVR, short for Deep Space Climate Observatory. Gores presence added to the excitement at the launch site. Also contributing to the buzz, though, was the experimental landing planned by SpaceX. Musk wants to eventually reuse his rockets to cut down costs and speed up flights. It will be the second such landing test for SpaceX. Last months effort ended in flames. SpaceX loaded more hydraulic fluid into the first-stage booster this time for the guidance fins; the fluid ran out too soon on Jan. 10, and the booster landed hard and tumbled over. But the path of the unmanned Falcon 9 rocket this time will see the booster descending faster than before, making it harder to nail the vertical landing. SpaceX officials repeatedly stressed that the landing test is a secondary objective, and that the main job is to make sure the observatory gets a good ride to space. Launching our 1st deep space mission today, Musk wrote via Twitter. He noted that the observatory will end up 4X further than moon. Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission, he added. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho. The modified barge that will serve as the landing zone nearly 400 miles off the Florida coast is almost as big as a football field, but thats small against the backdrop of the Atlantic. The 14-story booster will descend from an altitude of about 80 miles, with touchdown expected nine to 10 minutes after liftoff. Last months effort resulted in minor damage to the platform. SpaceX not only patched everything up, but added a name to the platform, painted in large white letters on deck: Just Read the Instructions. Thats the name of a ship from the Culture science fiction series written by the late Scottish author Iain M. Banks. Musk, a Banks fan, already has his company delivering cargo to the International Space Station for NASA and working on a capsule to fly American astronauts there. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NOAA: http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/DSCOVR/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/general-news-b185f13dde9c487d8fc4864e2de6070c,science
"Full lunar eclipse delights Americas, 1st of year","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Sky-gazers in North and South America were treated to a full lunar eclipse  at least those fortunate enough to have clear skies. The moon was eclipsed by the Earths shadow early Tuesday, beginning around 1 a.m. EDT for 5 hours. The total phase of the eclipse lasted just 78 minutes. For some, the moon appeared red-orange because of all the sunsets and sunrises shimmering from Earth, thus the name blood moon. Its the first of four eclipses this year and the first of four total lunar eclipses this year and next. The latter is a rare lineup; the next so-called tetrad of total lunar eclipses wont occur until 2032-2033. In the meantime, get ready for a solar eclipse in two weeks. NASA got good news Tuesday: Its moon-orbiting spacecraft, LADEE (LA'-dee) survived the eclipse. Scientists had feared LADEE might freeze up in the cold darkness. Keep little LADEE in your prayers as you gaze up at the beautiful eclipsing moon late Monday night! NASA wrote on its LADEE website prior to the eclipse. The end is near, however, for plucky, little LADEE. The spacecraft is circling the moon ever lower and, by Monday, is expected to crash as planned into the back side of the moon, far from any historic artifacts from the Apollo era. LADEE  short for Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer  was not designed to withstand a prolonged eclipse. It completed its science-collecting mission in March and has been on overtime ever since. NASA launched LADEE last September from Virginia. ___ Online: http://www.nasa.gov/LADEE/",https://apnews.com/full-lunar-eclipse-delights-americas-1st-of-year-ab78a8968e094b1ba81f6c963199ca79,science
SpaceX will try again Fri. to launch station cargo,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  SpaceX is shooting for another launch attempt Friday to deliver supplies to the International Space Station. NASA confirmed the launch date Wednesday, two days after a last-minute rocket leak delayed the mission. Stormy weather, however, is forecast for Friday. Saturday is the backup launch date. Mission Control has rescheduled urgent spacewalking repairs because of the new launch time. Two U.S. astronauts, Rick Mastracchio and Steven Swanson, had been aiming for a Tuesday spacewalk to replace a backup computer that failed late last week. The prime computer has been working fine, but NASA wants to get a new backup installed outside the station as soon as possible. These computers control the pointing of the radiators and solar wings, among other things. The spacewalk will be either Easter Sunday or next Wednesday, depending on when  or if  the cargo ship flies. The Dragon contains more than 2 tons of supplies, including material that would prove useful for the repair, but is not essential. Former space station astronaut Christopher Cassidy, whos helping from Houston, said the spacewalk job should be pretty straightforward and involve the manual turning of just three bolts on the computer box. We anticipate it to go quickly, but as with anything in space ... you never know whats going to be thrown at you, said Cassidy, who served on the space station last year. 
        
     A bad valve resulted in Mondays helium leak in the unmanned Falcon rocket, SpaceX reported Wednesday. The valve is in the system used to separate the rockets first stage. Although a backup valve was working properly and could have supported the flight, SpaceX followed its own policy of canceling a launch in the event of equipment problems such as this. The faulty valve is being replaced, the private company said in a statement, and inspections are underway to see if anything else might be wrong. NASA is eager to get these supplies to the orbiting lab as soon as possible. The flight has been on hold since mid-March for various reasons. Much of the cargo is considered critical, including food, a new spacesuit and replacement parts for existing spacesuits. The SpaceX Dragon and Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Cygnus cargo ship, which launches from Virginia, are NASAs prime means of shipment. Russia, Japan and Europe also make periodic deliveries. NASAs space shuttles carried most of the resupply load until their retirement in 2011; thats when the space agency turned to private industry to fill the gap. NASA is hoping private companies will do the same for launching astronauts in another few years. SpaceX is among the U.S. companies vying for that job. Until then, Americans will be forced to continue riding Russian rockets to and from the space station at steep cost. If SpaceX isnt flying by Saturday, then Orbital Sciences will move to the front of the launch line, with a shipment in early May, officials said. That would push SpaceX into June.",https://apnews.com/spacex-will-try-again-fri-to-launch-station-cargo-2ee15aef8ce94cadbbf256fda73c8d58,science
NASAs moon-orbiting robot crashes down as planned,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  NASAs robotic moon explorer, LADEE, is no more. Flight controllers confirmed that the orbiting spacecraft crashed into the back side of the moon Friday as planned, avoiding the precious historic artifacts left behind by moonwalkers. LADEEs annihilation occurred just three days after it survived a full lunar eclipse, something it was never designed to do. Researchers believe LADEE likely vaporized when it hit because of its extreme orbiting speed of (5,800 kph), possibly smacking into a mountain or side of a crater. No debris would have been left behind. Its bound to make a dent, project scientist Rick Elphic predicted Thursday. By Thursday evening, the spacecraft had been skimming the lunar surface at an incredibly low altitude of 300 feet (100 meters). Its orbit had been lowered on purpose last week to ensure a crash by Monday following an extraordinarily successful science mission. LADEE  short for Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer  was launched in September from Virginia. From the outset, NASA planned to crash the spacecraft into the back side of the moon, far from the Apollo artifacts from the moonwalking days of 1969 to 1972. Scattered over the near side of the moon: the landing portions of six lunar modules, flags, plaques, rovers and more, not to mention those memorable first footprints by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Apollo 12 had been projected to be closest  by several hundred miles. 
        
     The last thing the LADEE team wanted was to plow into any of the historic sites, said project manager Butler Hine. LADEE completed its primary 100-day science mission last month and was on overtime. The extension had LADEE flying during Tuesday mornings lunar eclipse; its instruments were not designed to endure such prolonged darkness and cold. But the small spacecraft survived  its about the size of a vending machine  with just a couple pressure sensors acting up. The mood in the control center at NASAs Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, was upbeat late Thursday afternoon, according to Hine. Having flown through the eclipse and survived, the team is actually feeling very good, Hine told The Associated Press in a phone interview. But the uncertainty of the timing of LADEEs demise had the flight controllers on edge, he said. As it turns out, LADEE succumbed within several hours of Hines comments. NASA announced its end early Friday morning. It will be at least a day or two before NASA knows precisely where the spacecraft ended up; the data cutoff indicates it smashed into the far side of the moon, although just barely. LADEE did not have enough fuel to remain in lunar orbit much beyond the end of its mission. It joined dozens if not scores of science satellites and Apollo program spacecraft parts that have slammed into the moons surface, on purpose, over the decades, officials said. Until LADEE, the most recent man-made impacts were the LCROSS crater-observing satellite that went down in 2009 and the twin Grail spacecraft in 2012. During its $280 million mission, LADEE identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere  neon, magnesium and titanium, among others  and studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon, created by all the surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites. LADEEs science cup really overfloweth, Elphic said earlier this month. LADEE, by going to the moon, has actually allowed us to visit other worlds with similar tenuous atmospheres and dusty environments.",https://apnews.com/nasas-moon-orbiting-robot-crashes-down-as-planned-79331207679b4e48be378a3934984b56,science

From the outset, NASA planned to crash the spacecraft into the back side of the moon, far from the Apollo artifacts from the moonwalking days of 1969 to 1972. Scattered over the near side of the moon: the landing portions of six lunar modules, flags, plaques, rovers and more, not to mention those memorable first footprints by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Apollo 12 had been projected to be closest  by several hundred miles. 
        
     The last thing the LADEE team wanted was to plow into any of the historic sites, said project manager Butler Hine. LADEE completed its primary 100-day science mission last month and was on overtime. The extension had LADEE flying during Tuesday mornings lunar eclipse; its instruments were not designed to endure such prolonged darkness and cold. But the small spacecraft survived  its about the size of a vending machine  with just a couple pressure sensors acting up. The mood in the control center at NASAs Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., was upbeat late Thursday afternoon, according to Hine. Having flown through the eclipse and survived, the team is actually feeling very good, Hine told The Associated Press in a phone interview. But the uncertainty of the timing of LADEEs demise had the flight controllers on edge, he said. As it turns out, LADEE succumbed within several hours of Hines comments. NASA announced its end early Friday morning. It will be at least a day or two before NASA knows precisely where the spacecraft ended up; the data cutoff indicates it smashed into the far side of the moon, although just barely. LADEE did not have enough fuel to remain in lunar orbit much beyond the end of its mission. It joined dozens if not scores of science satellites and Apollo program spacecraft parts that have slammed into the moons surface, on purpose, over the decades, officials said. Until LADEE, the most recent man-made impacts were the LCROSS crater-observing satellite that went down in 2009 and the twin Grail spacecraft in 2012. During its $280 million mission, LADEE identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere  neon, magnesium and titanium, among others  and studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon, created by all the surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites. LADEEs science cup really overfloweth, Elphic said earlier this month. LADEE, by going to the moon, has actually allowed us to visit other worlds with similar tenuous atmospheres and dusty environments. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ladee/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/nasas-moon-orbiting-robot-crashes-down-as-planned-fe8e158f09794780aa0e37239b352b89,science
SpaceX making Easter delivery of station supplies,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  A SpaceX supply ship rocketed toward the International Space Station on Friday, setting the stage for an Easter morning delivery and urgent spacewalking repairs later in the week. Following its midday launch through cloudy skies, the Dragon cargo carrier was shown drifting away in the blackness of space, against the blue backdrop of Earth. Its transporting 2 tons of goods, including a new spacesuit, spacesuit replacement parts, much-needed food, legs for NASAs humanoid, Robonaut, a bevy of mating flies, and germs gathered from sports arenas and historic sites across the U.S. Neither NASA nor SpaceX packed any Easter goodies, but the families of the six astronauts sent private care packages. It will be a surprise for all of us when they open the hatch, said NASAs human exploration chief, Bill Gerstenmaier. The Dragon will reach the orbiting lab on Sunday morning. That pushes urgent spacewalking repairs to Wednesday; NASA wants a bad backup computer replaced before something else breaks. This was the second launch attempt this week for SpaceX after a months delay. On Monday, NASAs commercial supplier was foiled by a leaky rocket valve. The valve was replaced, and the company aimed for a Friday liftoff despite a dismal forecast. Storms cleared out of Cape Canaveral just in time. SpaceXs billionaire chief executive officer, Elon Musk, was delighted with the successful launch for NASA, the customer. This was a happy day, he told reporters from company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. 
        
     Last Friday, a critical backup computer failed outside the space station, and NASA considered postponing the SpaceX flight. The primary computer is working fine, but numerous systems would be seriously compromised if it broke, too. A double failure also would hinder visits by the Dragon and other vessels. Its imperative that we maintain backups for these external command-routing computer boxes, also called multiplexer-demultiplexers, or MDMs, said flight director Brian Smith said Friday. Right now, we dont have that. NASA decided late this week to use the gasket-like material already on board the space station for the repair, instead of waiting for the Dragon and the new, precision-cut material that NASA rushed on board for the computer swap. Astronauts trimmed their own thermal material Friday to fit the bottom of the replacement computer, and inserted a fresh circuit card. The space stations crew watched the launch via a live TV hookup; the outpost was soaring 260 miles (418 kilometers) above Turkey at the time of ignition. Video beamed down from Dragon showed the solar wings unfurling. The shipment is close to five weeks late. Initially set for mid-March, the launch was delayed by extra prepping, then damage to an Air Force radar and, finally on Monday, the rocket leak. Earlier, as the countdown entered its final few hours, NASAs space station program manager Mike Suffredini said an investigation continues into the reason for last summers spacesuit failure. The helmet worn by an Italian astronaut filled with water from the suits cooling system, and he nearly drowned during a spacewalk. Routine U.S. spacewalks are on hold until engineers are certain what caused the water leak. The upcoming spacewalk by the two Americans on board is considered an exception because of its urgent nature; it will include no unnecessary tasks, just the 2-hour computer swap. NASA is paying SpaceX  Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  and Virginias Orbital Sciences Corp. to keep the orbiting lab well stocked. It was SpaceXs fourth trip to the space station. Russia, Japan and Europe also make periodic deliveries. Unlike the other cargo carriers, the Dragon can bring items back for analysis. Among the science samples going up on the Dragon and slated to return with it in a month: 200 fruit flies and their expected progeny, and germs collected from stadiums and sports arenas, as well as such notables as Americas Liberty Bell and Sue, the T. rex fossil skeleton at Chicagos Field Museum. Scientists will study the hearts of the returning flies  as many as 3,000 are expected for the trip home. The germ samples, once back on Earth, will be compared with duplicate cultures on the ground. Staying up there  for as long as the space station lives  will be new legs for NASAs humanoid, Robonaut. The indoor robot has been in orbit for three years, but only from the waist up.",https://apnews.com/general-news-47e0399b13fb4c22ae3f5d30153fa1a0,science
NASAs space station Robonaut finally getting legs,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  Robonaut, the first out-of-this-world humanoid, is finally getting its space legs. For three years, Robonaut has had to manage from the waist up. This new pair of legs means the experimental robot  now stuck on a pedestal  is going mobile at the International Space Station. Legs are going to really kind of open up the robots horizons, said Robert Ambrose from NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston. Its the next big step in NASAs quest to develop robotic helpers for astronauts. With legs, the 8-foot (2.4-meter) Robonaut will be able to climb throughout the 260-mile (420-kilometer)-high outpost, performing mundane cleaning chores and fetching things for the human crew. The robots gangly, contortionist-bending legs are packed aboard a SpaceX supply ship that launched Friday, more than a month late. It was the private companys fourth shipment to the space station for NASA and is due to arrive Easter Sunday morning. Robonaut 2  R2 for short  has been counting down the days. Legs are on the way! read a message Friday on its Twitter account, @AstroRobonaut. (OK, so its actually a Johnson Space Center spokesman whos doing the tweeting.) Space Exploration Technologies Corp.'s unmanned capsule, Dragon, holds about 2 tons of space station supplies and experiments, including Robonauts legs. Until a battery backpack arrives on another supply ship later this year, the multimillion-dollar robot will need a power extension cord to stretch its legs, limiting its testing area to the U.S. side of the space station. Testing should start in a few months. 
        
     Each leg  4 feet, 8 inches (142 centimeters) long  has seven joints. Instead of feet, there are grippers, each with a light, camera and sensor for building 3-D maps. Imagine monkey feet with eyes in the palm of each foot, Ambrose said. NASA engineers based the design on the tether attachments used by spacewalking astronauts. The legs cost $6 million to develop and another $8 million to build and certify for flight. The torso with head and arms delivered by space shuttle Discovery in 2011 on its final flight cost $2.5 million, not counting the untold millions of dollars spent on development and testing. Ambrose acknowledges the legs are a little creepy when they move because of the number of joints and the range of motion. I hope my knee never bends that many degrees, but Robonaut has no problems at all, said Ambrose, chief of software, robotics and simulation division at Johnson. The grippers will latch onto handrails inside the space station, keeping Robonauts hands free for working and carrying things. Expect slow going: just inches a second. If Robonaut bumps into something, it will pause. A good shove will shut it down. The robots not going to have as much fun as the astronauts, Ambrose said. No jumping, no somersaults, no flying. Robonaut already has demonstrated it can measure the flow on air filters, a really crummy job for humans, Ambrose said. Once mobile, it can take over that job around the station. How about cleaning the space station toilets? I have a feeling thats in Robonauts future, Ambrose said. This robot will stay indoors as it learns how to climb. The next-generation model, currently in development and targeted for a 2017 launch, will venture outside on spacewalks. Thats where the real payoff lies. A robot doesnt need oxygen tanks and fancy spacesuits. A robot never tires or gets bored. Why, a robot could stay out in the vacuum of space for days, weeks or even months, clinging to the station. Human spacewalkers are limited to eight or nine hours. Now imagine base camps on the moon, Mars or beyond staffed by a team of robotic caretakers. Future Robonauts could be deployed in advance and get everything running before the humans arrive  and stay behind when they leave. And if theres a chore too risky for humans we could let the machine go out and sacrifice itself, Ambrose said, and thats OK. Its not human. We can build another one. Well build one even better. NASAs space station program manager, Mike Suffredini, cautioned Friday that theres still quite a ways to go before future Robonauts make spacewalk repairs like the computer replacement job coming up Wednesday for the two U.S. space station astronauts. Software is the biggest challenge, he said, but these are great first steps. They wont ever replace the crews, but they could do a lot of the jobs, Suffredini said.",https://apnews.com/article/space-exploration-technology-science-business-florida-bc5918cc1e1f4d079443b6bd44702da2,science
Easter morning delivery for space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Space station astronauts got a special Easter treat: a cargo ship full of supplies. The shipment arrived Sunday morning via a Dragon, versus a bunny. Gentlemen, the Easter Dragon is knocking at the door, NASAs Mission Control said as the capsule was bolted into place. The SpaceX companys cargo ship, Dragon, spent two days chasing the International Space Station following its launch from Cape Canaveral. Astronauts used a robot arm to capture the capsule 260 miles above Egypt. More than 2 tons of food, spacewalking gear and experiments fill the Dragon, including mating fruit flies, a little veggie hothouse and legs for the resident robot. NASA also packed family care packages for the six spacemen. On Wednesday, the stakes will be even higher when the two Americans on board conduct a spacewalk to replace a dead computer. NASA wants a reliable backup in place as soon as possible, even though the primary computer is working fine. The backup failed April 11. The SpaceX delivery wasnt exactly express. The launch was delayed more than a month. A minor communication problem cropped up during Sundays rendezvous, but the capture still took place on time and with success. SpaceX flight controllers, at company headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., exchanged high-fives, shook hands, applauded and embraced once Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata snared the Dragon with the stations hefty robot arm. 
        
     Great work catching the Dragon, NASAs Mission Control radioed from Houston. Thanks for getting her on board. The capsule was solid and stable for grabbing, Wakata reported, making the job easy. He congratulated the SpaceX team and added, Were excited. A few hours later, the Dragon was secured to the space station. The capsule will remain attached until mid-May. It will be filled with science samples  including the flies  for return to Earth. NASA is paying SpaceX as well as Virginias Orbital Sciences Corp. to regularly stock the orbiting lab. These commercial shipments stemmed from the 2011 retirement of the space shuttles. This was the fourth station delivery for SpaceX. Russia, Japan and Europe also make occasional deliveries. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-domestic-news-domestic-news-6829791550ad4296becf4d32a059093f,science
SpaceX Dragon returns to Earth from space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  The commercial cargo ship Dragon returned to Earth from the International Space Station on Sunday, bringing back nearly two tons of science experiments and old equipment for NASA. SpaceXs Dragon splashed into the Pacific, just five hours after leaving the orbiting lab. Welcome home, Dragon! the California-based company said via Twitter. After a one-month visit, the SpaceX cargo ship was set loose Sunday morning. Astronaut Steven Swanson, the station commander, released it using the big robot arm as the craft zoomed more than 260 miles (418 kilometers) above the South Pacific. Very nice to have a vehicle that can take your science, equipment and maybe someday even humans back to Earth, Swanson told Mission Control. The SpaceX Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items to Earth. The others burn up on re-entry. This was the fourth Dragon to bring back space station goods, with 3,500 pounds (1,600 kilograms) aboard; it came down off Mexicos Baja California coast. NASA is paying SpaceX and Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp. to make station deliveries. Orbital is next up, next month. Russia, Europe and Japan also make occasional shipments. SpaceX also is competing for the right to ferry station astronauts, perhaps as early as 2017. The Dragon rocketed to the space station on April 18 with a full load and arrived at the orbiting lab two days later.",https://apnews.com/general-news-808e94b7d2ae4b6a86d635dc5f002c72,science
Spacewalkers complete tiring work at space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A pair of spacewalking astronauts managed to install a new antenna and complete other work Thursday outside the International Space Station, despite stubborn equipment. Russians Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemiev spent more than seven hours outside, longer than expected, and put in an order for hot tea as the tiring work wrapped up. The two struggled with balky clamps and latches on the antenna as the spacewalk got underway. Mission Control outside Moscow urged them to take frequent breaks, as they panted and sighed. Resting is most important, Mission Control radioed in Russian. Two of the three locks clicked into place on the antenna. But the third would not work right, and the astronauts had to use a wire tie instead. Each spacewalker tugged on the tie to tighten it. With that finally complete, the two successfully made a series of connections, eliciting a Hurrah! Slowly but surely, one of the astronauts said as he worked with the connectors. The first-time spacewalkers also struggled to remove an old frame from the Russian side of the space station, once used to hold experiments. Stiff bolts slowed the men down. Once the frame was free, Artemiev let go of it with a gentle push, aiming away from the orbiting outpost. The gray-and-white striped frame  large and unwieldy  could be seen tumbling out of sight, the newest piece of space junk. 
        
     With the frame gone, Skvortsov and Artemiev attached a boom in its place for experiments. I would like to have a third arm, noted one of the spacewalkers as the work wrapped up. Mission Control urged Skvortsov and Artemiev to hurry as they wiped down their suits before going back inside. Im hungry and thirsty, one spacewalker radioed. They also said their hands were tired. A plastic handle, part of a push rod, got away from them right before they closed the hatch. The four astronauts inside kept tabs on the 260-mile-high action, while doing their own work. Pretty neat up here right now, U.S. astronaut Reid Wiseman said via Twitter. Two Russian crew mates are spacewalking but business as usual for me and @astro_alex, he said, referring to German Alexander Gerst. The crew includes three Russians, two Americans and the one German. The Americans are supposed to venture out on NASA-led spacewalks in August. Skvortsov and Artemiev also have another spacewalk scheduled for August. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-c6aa62f06c1e4080a6c8da74f6526a85,science
Buzz Aldrin: Where were you when I walked on moon?,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  On July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin was out of town when the world united and rejoiced in a way never seen before or since. He and Neil Armstrong were on the moon. They missed the whole celebration 45 years ago this Sunday. So did Michael Collins, orbiting solo around the moon in the mother ship. Now, on this Apollo 11 milestone  just five years shy of the golden anniversary  Aldrin is asking everyone to remember where they were when he and Armstrong became the first humans to step onto another heavenly body, and to share their memories online. Too young? You can also share how the moonwalkers inspired you. Celebrities, public figures, and other astronauts and scientists are happily obliging with videos. What a day that was, said actor Tom Hanks, sipping from an Apollo 11 commemorative cup. He starred in the 1995 film Apollo 13, another gripping moon story. Going to space is a big deal. Walking on the moon is, literally, walking on the moon, said singer-songwriter Pharrell Williams, born four years afterward. And from London Mayor Boris Johnson, who watched the event unfold on an a little black-and-white TV at an English farmhouse: I knew immediately it was the most exciting thing that Id ever seen. I was only 5 at the time. And it still is just about the most exciting thing Ive ever seen. In all, 12 men explored the moon in six landings through 1972. But that first moonwalk, by Armstrong and Aldrin, is what clinched Americas place as space leader supreme following a string of crushing losses to the Soviet Union, which claimed title to first satellite, first spaceman, first spacewoman and first spacewalker. 
        
     U.S. 1, Sputnik nothing, actor Louis Gossett Jr. said with a laugh in his video. Its the first big anniversary of mans first moon landing without Armstrong, whose one small step ... one giant leap immortalized the moment. Armstrong, long known for his reticence, died in 2012 at age 82. As Apollo 11s commander, Armstrong was first out the lunar module, Eagle, onto the dusty surface of Tranquility Base. Aldrin followed. Collins, now 83, the command module pilot who stayed behind in lunar orbit as the gatekeeper, also spent decades sidestepping the spotlight. Hes making an exception for the 45th anniversary  he plans to take part in a NASA ceremony at Kennedy Space Center on Monday to add Armstrongs name to the historic Operations and Checkout Building. That leaves Aldrin, 84, as the perennial spokesman for Apollo 11. He will also be at Mondays ceremony. I consider myself a global statesman for space, Aldrin says in a YouTube video. So I spend most of my time traveling the country and the world to remind people what NASA and our space program have accomplished, and what is still in our future at Mars. I feel we need to remind the world about the Apollo missions and that we can still do impossible things. The whole world celebrated our moon landing. But we missed the whole thing because we were out of town. So now I invite you to share with me  and the world  your story or your familys story of where you were on July 20th, 1969. Or feel free to tell me how the Apollo missions inspired you. Aldrin used to keep a little black book to list peoples whereabouts on July 20, 1969. Everyone wanted to share that with him. Now hes using social media and asking people to post a video to YouTube using the hashtag #Apollo45. And the stories are pouring in. Peter Alyward, a self-professed space geek from Melbourne, Australia, recalls his parents waking him to see the Saturn V launch from what then was called Cape Kennedy, Florida, on July 16, 1969  45 years ago Wednesday  around the middle of the night Down Under. Its the first major Apollo 11 anniversary one divisible by five  that actually falls on the days of the week that the events occurred. Liftoff was, indeed, on a Wednesday, Eastern time; the moon landing was on a Sunday, Eastern time. More than any other time in history, with the technology that became available then, all the people of the world truly did experience it and were able to share it. Not just as an American feat, but as a really global event, said Aylward, 56, a business developer for a software company. Actor Tim Allen watched the moon landing from his boyhood Michigan home. To this day, its the most exciting thing in my life, just to think what you saw and what you experienced ... "" Allen said. Some of videos urge a return to the moon. President Barack Obama scrapped that idea in 2010 in favor of sending astronauts to an asteroid and then Mars. From one frontier to another, lets go back, Alaskas lieutenant governor, Mead Treadwell, said in his video. Well done, Buzz Aldrin, added Johnson, Londons mayor.

Celebrate 45 years since mans first steps on moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Nows the time to get moonstruck. Forty-five years ago Sunday, Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on another world. Armstrongs one small step ... one giant leap on the dusty lunar surface July 20, 1969, still stirs hearts. You can join the celebration, without needing to travel to the launch site at Floridas Kennedy Space Center, where NASA will honor Armstrong on Monday with a renaming ceremony of the historic Operations and Checkout Building. Both Aldrin and Michael Collins, the Apollo 11 command module pilot who orbited the moon, will be there. At the very least, walk out and wink at the moon this weekend. For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request, the Armstrong family said in a statement after his death in 2012. Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.

The space agency will broadcast restored footage of Armstrong and Aldrins lunar footsteps, beginning at 10:39 p.m. EDT, the exact time Armstrong opened the Eagles hatch 45 years ago. Take pleasure in knowing this is the first major Apollo 11 anniversary in which the events fall on the same day of the week as they did in 1969. 
        
     Check out your local science museum or planetarium for anniversary events. The Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York City, for example, has a bevy of astronauts on tap as part of its space and science festival. Aldrin is the featured speaker Friday. The five-day festival runs through Sunday. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex will have an appearance Sunday by former astronaut Bruce McCandless, who served as the Mission Control capsule communicator, or capcom, in Houston as Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon. Its his voice that the moonwalkers heard. McCandless later went on to his own fame as the free-flying, untethered spaceman who tested NASAs manned maneuvering unit, or jetpack, during a shuttle flight in 1984. The USS Hornet Museum in Alameda, California, also has nabbed Aldrin for its 45th anniversary festivities  Splashdown 45  next Saturday, July 26. The aircraft carrier recovered the Apollo 11 crew and capsule, the Columbia, from the Pacific following splashdown. President Richard Nixon was on board to welcome Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins home.

Spacewalking astronauts release baby satellite,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts launched a tiny Peruvian research satellite Monday, setting it loose on a mission to observe Earth. Russian Oleg Artemiev cast the 4-inch (10.1-centimeter) box off with his gloved right hand as the International Space Station sailed 260 miles (418 kilometers) above the cloud-flecked planet. The nanosatellite gently tumbled as it cleared the vicinity of the orbiting complex, precisely as planned. One, two, three, someone called out in Russian as Artemiev let go of the satellite. Cameras watched as the nanosatellite  named Chasqui after the Inca messengers who were fleet of foot  increased its distance and grew smaller. Artemievs Russian spacewalking partner, Alexander Skvortsov, tried to keep his helmet camera aimed at the satellite as it floated away. The satellite  barely 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms)  holds instruments to measure temperature and pressure, and cameras that will photograph Earth. Its a technological learning experience for the National University of Engineering in Lima. A Russian cargo ship delivered the device earlier this year. Less than a half-hour into the spacewalk, the satellite was on its way, flying freely. With that completed, Artemiev and Skvortsov set about installing fresh science experiments outside the Russian portion of the space station and retrieving old ones. Be careful, Russian Mission Control outside Moscow warned as the astronauts made their way to their next work site. They also collected samples from a window of the main Russian living compartment; engineers want to check for any engine residue from visiting spacecraft. 
        
     The spacewalkers wrapped up their work early. Flight controllers thanked them for their five-hour effort. The two conducted a spacewalk in June, a few months after moving into the space station. Four other men live there: another Russian, two Americans and one German. U.S. spacewalks, meanwhile, remain on hold. NASA hoped to resume them this month after a yearlong investigation but delayed the activity until autumn to get fresh spacesuit batteries on board. The SpaceX company will deliver the batteries on a Dragon supply ship next month. Engineers are concerned about the fuses of the on-board batteries. Before the battery issue, NASA was stymied by a spacesuit problem that nearly cost an Italian astronaut his life last summer. Luca Parmitanos helmet flooded with water from the suits cooling system, and he barely made it back inside. The investigation into that incident is now complete, with safety improvements made to the U.S. spacesuits. ____ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-fbdc4566ecbe40ca9384d8cd5c081d96,science

NASAs newest human spacecraft on the move,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is one step closer to launching its newest spacecraft designed for humans. Workers at Kennedy Space Center gathered to watch as the Orion capsule emerged from its assembly hangar Thursday morning, less than three months from its first test flight. The capsule  sealed for protection  slowly made its way to its fueling depot atop a 36-wheel platform. The capsule and its attached service module and adapter ring stretched 40 feet high. Isnt this awesome? said Kennedys director, Robert Cabana, a former space shuttle commander. This is our step to the future, the exploration of establishing a presence in the solar system. Space center employees lined up along the rope barricade to snap pictures of Orion, NASAs lofty follow-on to the now-retired space shuttle program. During its Dec. 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space and take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. The entire mission will last 4 hours. The second Orion flight wont occur until around 2018 when another unmanned capsule soars atop NASAs new megarocket, still under development, called SLS for Space Launch System. NASA intends to put astronauts aboard Orion in 2021 for deep space exploration; each capsule can accommodate up to four. 
        
     The plan is to use Orion for getting humans to asteroids and Mars  no space station ferry trips for Orion. A handful of private U.S. companies are competing for these short taxi flights; NASA expects in the next week or so to pick one or two candidates for funding. While Orion may resemble an oversize Apollo capsule on the outside, everything inside and out is modern and top-of-the-line, officials noted Thursday. Im as excited as can be, said NASAs Orion production operations manager, Scott Wilson. For Orions dry run, the Lockheed Martin Corp.-built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. A Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting. When asked by a reporter, Cabana said he wishes Orions flight pace was quicker. But it is what it is, he said. Given the budget that we have, I think weve got the best program that you could imagine. Orion has its roots in the post-Columbia shuttle era; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low Earth orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the Constellation moon project. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/mpcv/ Lockheed Martin: http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/orion.html",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-3b3a36aef17b45588cbca52d4216443e,science
NASA picks Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is a giant step closer to launching Americans again from U.S. soil. On Tuesday, the space agency picked Boeing and SpaceX to transport astronauts to the International Space Station in the next few years. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden named the winners of the competition at Kennedy Space Center, next door to where the launches should occur in a few years. The wall behind him was emblazoned with the words Launch America and Commercial crew transportation/The mission is in sight. I want you to look behind me, Bolden said, pointing both thumbs to the big, bright logos. Im giddy today, I will admit. The deal will end NASAs expensive reliance on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. NASA has set a goal of 2017 for the first launch from Cape Canaveral, but stressed it will not sacrifice safety to meet that date. NASA ended up going with a blend of old and new space: big traditional Boeing, which helped build the space station and prepped the space shuttles, and smaller, scrappier upstart SpaceX. Just 12 years old, the California-based SpaceX already is delivering supplies to the space station  its crew capsule is a version of its cargo carrier. NASA will pay Boeing $4.2 billion and SpaceX $2.6 billion to certify, test and fly their crew capsules. The two contracts call for at least two and as many as six missions for a crew of four as well as supplies and scientific experiments, said NASAs Kathy Lueders, commercial crew program manager. The spacecraft will double as emergency lifeboats at the orbiting outpost. 
        
     SpaceX billionaire founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, was elated by Tuesdays news, as were Boeings top managers. Deeply honored and appreciative of the trust that NASA has placed in SpaceX for the future of human spaceflight, Musk said in a tweet. Noted Boeings John Elbon, vice president and general manager of space exploration: Boeing has been part of every American human space flight program, and were honored that NASA has chosen us to continue that legacy. The third major contender, Sierra Nevada Corp., had the most novel entry, a mini-shuttle named Dream Chaser that it was developing in Colorado. NASA officials declined to elaborate on the decision and why Sierra Nevada lost out. In a statement, Sierra Nevada said it would wait to hear NASAs rationale before commenting further on the options for its spacecraft. While disappointed that it wasnt selected, the company said it commends NASA for initiating the effort. U.S. astronauts have been riding Russian rockets ever since NASAs space shuttles retired in 2011. The latest price tag is $71 million per seat; NASA puts at least four of its astronauts on a Russian Soyuz every year. SpaceX has indicated its seats will cost $20 million apiece. From day one, the Obama administration has made it very clear that the greatest nation on Earth should not be dependent on any other nation to get into space, Bolden told reporters. The commercial crew program follows the successful cargo delivery effort underway for the past two years, also under NASA contract. The objective, for years, has been for NASA to hand space station flights to private companies and focus on getting astronauts into true outer space, with destinations such as asteroids and Mars. NASA is prepping its first-ever Orion deep-space exploration capsule for an unmanned test flight in December. Musks Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  SpaceX for short  became the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and retrieve it in 2010.

Its known as Dragon v2  version two. Orbital Sciences Corp. of Virginia, which also makes unmanned space station shipments, did not vie for crew-carrying privileges. Boeings entry was also a capsule, called CST-100. The letters stand for Crew Space Transportation, and the number refers to 100 kilometers or 62 miles, the official start of space. Boeing will use a former shuttle hangar at Kennedy to build the capsules. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said Boeing alone will add 550 jobs to Cape Canaveral, welcome news for a region still struggling economically from the shuttle shutdown. Both spacecraft will meet rigorous safety standards for the astronauts who will fly on them, officials stressed. CST-100 will fly atop an Atlas V rocket, while SpaceX will use its own Falcon 9 rocket. NASA astronaut Mike Fincke noted that while the capsules may be small, theyre carrying big expectations. NASA paid each of these three major contenders hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to spur development. The differing amounts of these two new contracts were based on each companys proposal, Lueders said.

2 Russians turn cable guys in record spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  In a record-long spacewalk, Russian cosmonauts rigged cable outside the International Space Station on Friday for a new lab thats due to arrive in a few months. Fyodor Yurchikhin and Aleksandr Misurkin spent almost the entire seven-hour-plus spacewalk routing 120 feet (36 meters) of power and Ethernet cable. The cable had to be unreeled, then meticulously secured to handrails and hooks. Today we are the cable people, one of the spacewalkers commented in Russian as the work drew to a close. The spacewalk lasted seven hours and 29 minutes, a full hour longer than originally planned in order for the two to get a jump on work awaiting them in yet another outing next Thursday. It was the longest spacewalk ever by a pair of Russians, surpassing the former record of seven hours and 16 minutes set at the old Mir space station in 1990. Americans hold the overall record: a nearly nine-hour spacewalk in 2001. Fridays spacewalk occurred exactly one month after an Italian astronaut almost drowned when leaking water flooded his helmet during a spacewalk. Luca Parmitanos spacesuit was provided by NASA. Fridays spacewalkers wore Russian-made suits that differ from the U.S. version. NASA is still investigating last months close call. The problem appears to be in the life-support backpack. The spacesuit will be sent back for analysis early next year. Until the trouble is identified and resolved, U.S. spacewalks are on hold. 
        
     To reach the cable work site on Friday, Yurchikhin hitched a ride on the end of a 46-foot (14-meter) boom operated by Misurkin. When Yurchikhin asked if he was positioned properly on the boom, Misurkin assured him, You look great. You look perfect. Thank you, Yurchikhin replied. I dont want to blush. It just looks like youre in space, Misurkin said. Everything is black around you. The Russian Space Agency plans to launch a new science lab by years end. Its the last major piece due at the orbiting outpost, active since 1998, and will replace a 12-year-old Russian docking compartment that doubles as an air lock. Fridays excursion was the third of six Russian spacewalks planned for this year. The four other space station residents  two Americans, another Russian and Italys Parmitano  monitored Fridays spacewalk from inside.

Astronaut recounts near-drowning on spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Italian astronaut who nearly drowned in his helmet during a spacewalk last month is sharing more details about the terrifying experience, revealing how he felt all alone and frantically tried to come up with a plan to save himself. Luca Parmitano wrote in his online blog, posted Tuesday, that he could no longer see as the water sloshed around in his helmet outside the International Space Station. But worse than that, the water covers my nose  a really awful sensation that I make worse by my vain attempts to move the water by shaking my head, the former test pilot wrote. By now, the upper part of the helmet is full of water and I cant even be sure that the next time I breathe I will fill my lungs with air and not liquid. Parmitano, 36, a major in the Italian Air Force making just his second spacewalk, wasnt sure which direction to head to reach the stations hatch. He tried to contact his spacewalking partner, American Christopher Cassidy, and Mission Control. Their voices grew faint, and no one could hear him. Im alone. I frantically think of a plan. Its vital that I get inside as quickly as possible, he wrote. Parmitano realized Cassidy  making his way back to the air lock by a different route  could come get him. But how much time do I have? Its impossible to know, he said. Thats when Parmitano remembered his safety cable. He used the cable recoil mechanism, and its 3 pounds of force, to pull him back to the hatch. On the way back, he pondered what he would do if water reached his mouth. The only idea he came up with, he said, was to open the safety valve on his helmet and let out some of the water. 
        
     But making a hole in my spacesuit really would be a last resort, he wrote. Parmitano said it seemed like an eternity  not just a few minutes  until he peered through the curtain of water before my eyes and spotted the hatch. Cassidy was close behind. The astronauts inside quickly began repressurizing the air lock, to get to the spacewalkers. The water is now inside my ears and Im completely cut off, he said. He tried to stay as still as possible to keep the water from moving inside his helmet. He knew that because of the repressurization, he could always open his helmet if the water overwhelmed him. Ill probably lose consciousness, but in any case, that would be better than drowning inside the helmet, he wrote. Cassidy squeezed his glove. Parmitano managed to give the universal OK sign. Finally, with an unexpected wave of relief, Parmitano saw the internal door open, and the crew pulled him out and his helmet off. He remembers thanking his crewmates without hearing their words because my ears and nose will still be full of water for a few minutes more. NASA has traced the problem to his spacesuit backpack which is full of life-support equipment. But the precise cause is still unknown as the investigation continues into quite possibly the closest call ever during an American-led spacewalk. NASA has suspended all U.S. spacewalks until the problem is resolved. The Russians, meanwhile, will stage their second spacewalk in under a week, this Thursday, to prepare for the arrival of a new lab by the end of this year. The two countries suits are completely different. More than a month has passed since the July 16 spacewalk, and its given Parmitano time to reflect on the dangers surrounding him. The first-time space flier will return to Earth in November. Space is a harsh, inhospitable frontier and we are explorers, not colonisers, he wrote. The skills of our engineers and the technology surrounding us make things appear simple when they are not, and perhaps we forget this sometimes.

Russian spacewalkers encounter faulty equipment,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A pair of spacewalking cosmonauts installed a new telescope mount on the International Space Station on Thursday despite a flaw in the device. Russians Fyodor Yurchikhin and Aleksandr Misurkin  making their second spacewalk in under a week  initially were told to give up trying to plug in the 6-foot platform for a yet-to-be-launched telescope. But after more than an hour of discussion at Russian Mission Control outside Moscow, the decision was reversed and the cosmonauts installed it. Yurchikhin and Misurkin reported that the base of the platform appeared to be misaligned because it wasnt assembled properly on the ground. The problem could prevent the future telescope from pointing in the right direction. We cannot spend a lot of time here, one of the cosmonauts complained as they struggled with the equipment. They hauled the platform back to the hatch and went to work inspecting antenna covers; one of the protective shields came loose Monday and floated off. But engineers determined the 90-degree misalignment could be overcome at a later date. So the cosmonauts lugged the telescope platform back to the work site and secured it. They had removed a laser communication experiment from that spot earlier, even though it was tough working in that location. Tight quarters up here as far as anything to grab onto, one of the cosmonauts commented in Russian. You got that right, replied the other. (The English translation does not identify the speakers.) 
        
     The spacewalkers also unfurled and waved a Russian flag that they took out in honor of Russias Flag Day. Now we can see the flag of our Motherland, one of the cosmonauts said in an impromptu speech. Earlier, the cosmonauts ran into some difficulty tightening the antenna covers. Because of the flyaway cover, the cosmonauts double-checked the remaining protective shields to make sure they were secure. At least two were loose, one by a lot. NASA said the lost cover posed no risk to the 260-mile-high outpost. NASA, meanwhile, has suspended all U.S. spacewalks while the investigation into last months near-drowning continues. An Italian astronauts helmet filled with water during a spacewalk on July 16. He barely made it back inside. The water is believed to have originated from the suits cooling system. The spacesuits used by the Russians are different. The two cosmonauts had smoother sailing during last Fridays spacewalk, performing cable hookups for a new Russian lab that is supposed to lift off from Kazakhstan sometime next year. The launch had been targeted for December, but recently was delayed until at least spring. Several times during Thursdays six-hour spacewalk, the radio lines screeched so loudly that the cosmonauts voices could not be heard by Russian Mission Control. We should be wearing ear plugs here, someone commented in Russian. Before returning inside, the crew gathered samples from the surface of a hatch for eventual analysis on Earth. There is evidence, a NASA commentator said, of possible biological growth surviving in the harsh environment of space. I think the windows are clean. We should wrap it up. What do you think? Misurkin said. This was the 173rd spacewalk at the space station, coming up on the 15th anniversary of the launch of its first part. The four other space station residents  two Americans, one Italian and another Russian  kept tabs on the spacewalk from inside. The swiveling platform will hold an optical telescope that will be launched in November and installed by spacewalking cosmonauts a month later. As for the defective spacesuit of Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, NASA said it will return part or all of the outfit early next year on a commercial SpaceX capsule. That will be the first opportunity to get cargo back on Earth. The three-person Russian Soyuz spacecraft used to ferry astronauts are too small for big extra pieces, and the Russian supply ships burn up upon re-entry, doubling as trash cans. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/russian-spacewalkers-encounter-faulty-equipment-ac7b705ba2db4046bc8afa9ddfa8b122,science
Astronauts recreate waterworks in leaky spacesuit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  The mystery of NASAs leaky spacesuit continues. On Tuesday, International Space Station astronauts turned on the suit that leaked water last month and almost led to the first-ever drowning in orbit. This time, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano was safely outside his suit. Its a good thing: Big jiggly blobs of water sloshed around inside the empty helmet during the test, just as it did on his July 16 spacewalk. NASA says its good the problem reappeared. That should make it easier for engineers to determine the cause. The astronauts will remove suspect pieces and, possibly, return them on the next three-man Soyuz spacecraft bound for Earth next month. Engineers are zeroing in on the backpack that contains life-support equipment, including water for suit cooling.",https://apnews.com/astronauts-recreate-waterworks-in-leaky-spacesuit-2ac18ed334b84985a958e8d5f2c9e318,science
"NASA aiming for moon again, this time from Va.","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is headed back to the moon, this time to explore its thin atmosphere and rough dust. The robotic spacecraft LADEE (pronounced LA'-dee), will fly to the moon by way of Virginias Eastern Shore. Liftoff is set for late Friday night from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility. Weather permitting, the soaring Minotaur rocket should be visible along much of the East Coast  as far south as South Carolina, as far north as Maine and as far west as Pittsburgh. LADEE  short for Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer  will be the first spacecraft to be launched into outer space from Wallops. And it will be the first moonshot ever from Virginia in 54 years of lunar missions. The unmanned Minotaur rocket consists of converted intercontinental ballistic missile motors. A peace treaty between the United States and Russia specifies the acceptable launch sites for those missile parts; Wallops is on that short list. All but one of NASAs approximately 40 moon missions  most memorably the manned Apollo flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s  originated from Cape Canaveral. The most recent were the twin Grail spacecraft launched two years ago this weekend. The lone exception, Clementine, a military-NASA venture, rocketed away from Southern California in 1994. Scientists involved in the $280 million, moon-orbiting mission want to examine the lunar atmosphere  yes, thats right, the moons atmosphere. 
        
     Sometimes, people are a little taken aback when we start talking about the lunar atmosphere because, right, we were told in school that the moon doesnt have an atmosphere, said Sarah Noble, NASA program scientist. It does. Its just really, really thin. The atmosphere is so thin and delicate, in fact, that spacecraft landings can disturb it. So now is the time to go, Noble said, before other countries and even private companies start bombarding the moon and fouling up the atmosphere. Just last week, China announced plans to launch a lunar lander by years end. Theres evidence Mercury also has a tenuous atmosphere, where, like our moon, the atmospheric molecules are so sparse that they never collide. Some moons of other planets also fall into that category, as do some big asteroids. Earths moon is relatively close, and by studying its atmosphere, scientists will learn about similar atmospheres in places farther afield, Noble said. Scientists also are eager to measure the lunar dust and see whether the abrasive, equipment-clogging particles actually levitate right off the surface. None of the previous moon missions focused exclusively on the atmosphere and dust. It will take LADEE  the size of a small car coming in under 1,000 pounds  one month to get close enough to the moon to go into lunar orbit, followed by another month to check its three scientific instruments. Then the spacecraft will be maneuvered from 30 miles to 90 miles above the lunar surface, where it will collect data for just over three months. The mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon. NASA is inviting amateur astronomers to keep an eye out for any meteoric impacts on the moon once LADEE arrives there on Oct. 6. Such information will help scientists understand the effect of impacts on the lunar atmosphere and dust environment. Hitching a ride on LADEE is an experimental laser communication system designed to handle higher data rates than currently available. NASA hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which uses less power and requires smaller transmitters and receivers, while providing lightning-fast bandwidth. NASA was hot on the lunar trail when it announced the LADEE mission in 2008. But the effort to return astronauts to the moon was canceled by President Barack Obama in 2010. The latest target destinations for human explorers: an asteroid, then Mars. The debate continues as to whether the moon is a more practical starting point. The Air Force Minotaur V rocket was built by Orbital Sciences Corp. The Virginia-based company is scheduled to make its first-ever supply run to the International Space Station in just two weeks, using its own Antares rocket. Wallops will host that launch as well. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ladee/main/index.html Orbital Sciences Corp.: http://tinyurl.com/n6jtpcm Lunar and Planetary Institute: http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/",https://apnews.com/general-news-4e402356cdee413ba3c01017d36c2da9,science
Chocolate coming on next space station delivery,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A Virginia company makes its debut this week as a space station delivery service, and the lone American aboard the orbiting lab is counting on a fresh stash of chocolate. In an interview Monday with The Associated Press, NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg said she cant wait for this weekends arrival of a new cargo ship named Cygnus. It will be the first shipment by Orbital Sciences Corp. to the International Space Station. You know that theres something packed away in that vehicle, something special for you ... Were human beings and we get very excited about the packages from home and some of the treats that we might get, said Nyberg. Orbital Sciences is scheduled to launch an unmanned Antares rocket containing Cygnus on Wednesday morning from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility on Virginias eastern shore. Its where NASA launched a moon spacecraft 1 weeks ago. NASA is paying Orbital Sciences and the California-based SpaceX company to keep the space station well stocked in the shuttle-less era. Orbital Sciences conducted a practice Antares launch in April with a mock payload. This will be its first space station run, coming more than a year after the initial SpaceX delivery. Because this is considered a test flight, the Cygnus will carry up mostly food and other nonessential items. That suits Nyberg and her two male crewmates  an Italian and a Russian. They have been in orbit since the end of May, with two more months to go. Three more residents arrive later next week. 
        
     Nybergs husband  NASA astronaut Douglas Hurley  put together the care package thats already stowed on the Cygnus capsule. They have one child, 3-year-old Jack. It would be really nice to have some fresh home-baked goods, but the fresh part doesnt work very well when it takes a couple days to get here, Nyberg said. So anything chocolate usually does it for me. Given a Wednesday launch, the Cygnus should arrive at the space station on Sunday. Unlike the SpaceX Earth-returning Dragon, it will be filled with trash and, once cut loose, burn up during descent. Russia, Europe and Japan also send up supplies. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital Sciences Corp.: http://www.orbital.com/",https://apnews.com/chocolate-coming-on-next-space-station-delivery-d871d9c950a5449a995127dfb0b55865,science

US company about to make first space station run,"A Virginia company is all set to make its first-ever supply run to the International Space Station. On the eve of its premiere rendezvous mission, Orbital Sciences Corp. said everything looked good for Wednesdays launch from Virginias Eastern Shore. An unmanned Antares rocket was scheduled to blast off from NASAs Wallops Island Facility at 10:50 a.m. EDT, carrying 1,300 pounds (590 kilograms) of food, clothes and other items as part of a test flight. A Sunday delivery is planned. A launch demo of the rocket in April went well. If this latest mission succeeds, Orbital Sciences will start launching more Cygnus cargo ships under a $1.9 billion contract with NASA. The commercial effort began more than five years ago. The California-based SpaceX already is shipping goods from Cape Canaveral, Florida, under a separate $1.6 billion contract. Its first trip was in May last year. Formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the company founded by billionaire Elon Musk of PayPal fame has the only unmanned vessel capable of returning space station items to Earth. The SpaceX Dragon parachutes into the Pacific off the Southern California coast. The smaller Cygnus capsule will be filled with space station trash following its monthlong visit and burn up upon descent. Thats the same fate as the Russian, European and Japanese supply ships. NASA is looking to private U.S. industry to keep the space station stocked in the post-shuttle era. Its also putting seed money into SpaceX and other companies for development of a manned capsule. Thats still years away, so NASA will continue to buy rides for its astronauts on Russian rockets. One American will be aboard the Soyuz capsule due to take off next week from Kazakhstan, along with two Russians. The trio will double the station population to its normal six. 
        
     Wallops was in the spotlight earlier this month. On Sept. 6, NASA launched a robotic explorer, named LADEE, to the moon. Its still en route. Orbital Sciences provided the Minotaur V rocket used in the moonshot, which was widely seen in the night sky along the East Coast. Wednesdays daytime launch wont be nearly as visible. Frank Culbertson, the companys executive vice president and a former space shuttle commander, said Tuesday that the excitement level is high. This is one of the most exciting things that is happening in the middle of a very exciting month for Orbital, for NASA and for space programs around the world, Culbertson said at a news conference, referring to all the various launches and re-entries.",https://apnews.com/general-news-0bf2c9b118034dae8dbc6fc101c8af38,science
Longer delay for space station delivery mission,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A new commercial spaceship will wait all week before aiming again for the International Space Station. Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Cygnus capsule was supposed to arrive Sunday, four days after its launch. But the rendezvous was aborted because of a discrepancy in navigation data between the two vessels. The Virginia company has developed and tested a software repair to sync up the two sets of GPS data. Different formats inadvertently were used for reporting time, said company spokesman Barron Beneski. NASAs Bruce Manners, a commercial space project executive, called it a very small, simple fix. Despite the quick remedy, NASA and Orbital Sciences agreed Monday to delay this second delivery attempt until at least Saturday. Thats because of an impending manned mission from Kazakhstan; it would have cut it too close and created too big a workload to squeeze in the Cygnus before then. Three astronauts are scheduled to blast off on a Russian rocket Wednesday and arrive at the space station later in the day. That will round out the crew to the normal six. This is the maiden voyage of the Cygnus and therefore considered a test flight. Only one other private company has attempted space station shipments: Space Exploration Technologies Corp. of California, good for three deliveries over the past 1 years. SpaceX launches from Cape Canaveral, while Orbital Sciences flies from Wallops Island, Va. 
        
     NASA is contracting with the two companies to keep the 260-mile-high outpost stocked. Space shuttles used to ferry U.S. supplies. Russia, Japan and Europe launch their own cargo. Manners said the Cygnus has plenty of fuel and opportunities for numerous approaches. A firm delivery date will be chosen following the Soyuz arrival late Wednesday. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital Sciences Corp.: http://www.orbital.com/Antares-Cygnus/",https://apnews.com/longer-delay-for-space-station-delivery-mission-f6bfbc98ab8b4bccbd5ea0a2054bc6ee,science
Earth-size planet found with rocky core like ours,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  Scientists have found a planet way out in the cosmos thats close in size and content to Earth  an astronomical first. But this rocky world is so close to its sun that its almost certainly too hot for life. Astrophysicists reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that the exoplanet Kepler-78b appears to be made of rock and iron, just like Earth. They measured the planets mass to determine its density and content. Its actually a little bigger than Earth and nearly double its mass, or weight. Kepler-78b is located in the Cygnus constellation hundreds of light-years away. Incredibly, it orbits its sun every 8 hours, a mystery to astronomers who doubt it could have formed or moved that close to a star. They agree the planet will be sucked up by the sun in a few billion years, so its time remaining, astronomically speaking, is short. More than 1,000 exoplanets  worlds outside our solar system  have been confirmed so far. NASAs Kepler Space Telescope, used to discover Kepler-78b, has identified 3,500 more potential candidates. The telescope lost its precise pointing ability earlier this year, and NASA has given up trying to fix it. Scientific teams in the United States and Switzerland used ground observatories to measure Kepler-78b.",https://apnews.com/earth-size-planet-found-with-rocky-core-like-ours-a48b836c340141b786cd6e38e19c5613,science
NASAs newest Mars flyer will explore atmosphere,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA hopes its newest Mars spacecraft lives up to its know-it-all name. The robotic explorer called Maven is due to blast off Monday on a 10-month journey to the red planet. There, it will orbit Mars and study the atmosphere to try to understand how the planet morphed from warm and wet to cold and dry. A maven is a trusted expert, noted NASAs space science chief, John Grunsfeld. Maven will help scientists build a story of the Mars atmosphere and help future human explorers who journey to Mars. The $671 million mission is NASAs 21st crack at Earths most enticing neighbor, coming on the heels of the Curiosity rover, still rolling strong a year after its grand Martian arrival. When Maven reaches Mars next September, it will join three functioning spacecraft, two U.S. and one European. An Indian orbiter also will be arriving about the same time. Maven will be the 10th orbiter to be launched to Mars by NASA; three have failed, testimony to the difficulty of the task. No other planet, other than perhaps Earth, has held the attention of people around the world than Mars, Grunsfeld said. Early Mars had an atmosphere thick enough to hold water and moist clouds, said chief investigator Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorados Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder. Indeed, water flowed once upon a time on Mars, and microbial life might have existed. 
        
     But somehow that atmosphere changed over time to the cold, dry environment that we see today, Jakosky said. What we dont know is what the driver of that change has been. Maven  short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, with a capital N in EvolutioN  is the first spacecraft devoted entirely to studying Mars upper atmosphere. Indias orbiter will also study the atmosphere but go a step further, seeking out methane, a possible indicator of life. Scientists theorize that some of the early atmospheric water and carbon dioxide went down into the crust of the Martian surface  there is evidence of carbonate minerals on Mars. Gases also may have gone up and become lost to space, stripped away by the sun, molecule by molecule, Jakosky said. Maven holds eight scientific instruments to measure the upper atmosphere for an entire Earth year  half a Martian year. The boxy, solar-winged craft  as long as a school bus and as hefty as a 5,400-pound SUV  will dip as low as 78 miles above the surface for atmospheric sampling, and its orbit will stretch as high as 3,864 miles. Understanding the makeup and dynamics of Mars present atmosphere will help guide humans more safely to the planets surface, especially if the ship takes advantage of the atmosphere for braking, Jakosky said. NASA targets the 2030s for the first manned expedition. The spacecraft also holds an antenna and radio to serve as a communications relay for NASAs two active Martian rovers, Curiosity and Opportunity, as well as the next pair of landers to be launched in 2016 and 2020. Maven is considered so important that launch preparations were allowed to resume a couple of days after the start of the 16-day government shutdown. Maven has one month to launch; Earth and Mars line up just so, just every 26 months. So if Maven isnt flying by mid to late December, the spacecraft will be grounded until the beginning of 2016. The red planet is a notoriously tricky target. The worlds overall success rate since the 1960s for a Mars mission is less than 50-50. NASA has attempted the most, 20 launches so far, and has the best success rate: 70 percent. Russia, in second place with 18 Mars launches, has a dismal 14 percent success rate. China collaborated on one of the Russian flops. Europe and Japan have attempted one Martian mission apiece; the European Mars Express has had mixed results, while the Japanese effort fizzled. Were never a success until were at Mars and were taking data and getting the science that these folks envisioned back in 2003, when the idea arose, observed NASA project manager David Mitchell. Theres a light side to Maven. Attached to one of Mavens solar wings is a DVD containing more than 100,000 names submitted by the public earlier this year, as well as more than 1,000 Japanese-style haiku verses, also penned by the public, and 377 student art contest entries. The Maven team liked this haiku from an anonymous contributor: Amidst sand and stars/We scan a lifeless planet/To escape its fate. But this haiku was the No. 1 public vote-getter, submitted by British blogger Benedict Smith: Its funny, they named/Mars after the God of War/Have a look at Earth. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/maven University of Colorado: http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/",https://apnews.com/national-national-general-news-ba1d5e69cc1f4d66b90576be91d0794f,science
NASA launches robotic explorer to Mars,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  NASAs newest robotic explorer, Maven, rocketed toward Mars on Monday on a quest to unravel the ancient mystery of the red planets radical climate change. The Maven spacecraft is due at Mars next fall following a journey of more than 440 million miles (700 million kilometers). Scientists want to know why Mars went from being warm and wet during its first billion year to cold and dry today. The early Martian atmosphere was thick enough to hold water and possibly support microbial life. But much of that atmosphere may have been lost to space, eroded by the sun. Maven set off through a cloudy sky Monday afternoon in its effort to provide answers. An unmanned Atlas V rocket put the spacecraft on the proper course for Mars, and launch controllers applauded and shook hands over the success. An estimated 10,000 NASA guests gathered for the launch, the most exciting one of the year from Cape Canaveral. The University of Colorado at Boulder, which is leading the Maven effort, was represented by a couple thousand people. Were just excited right now and hoping for the best, said the universitys Bruce Jakosky, principal scientist for Maven. To help solve this environmental puzzle at the neighboring planet, Maven will spend an entire Earth year measuring atmospheric gases once it reaches Mars on Sept. 22, 2014. This is NASAs 21st mission to Mars since the 1960s. But its the first one devoted to studying the Martian upper atmosphere. 
        
     The mission costs $671 million. Maven  short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, with a capital N in EvolutioN  bears eight science instruments. The spacecraft, at 5,410 pounds (2,450 kilograms), weighs as much as an SUV. From solar wingtip to wingtip, it stretches 37.5 feet (11.4 meters), about the length of a school bus. A question underlying all of NASAs Mars missions to date is whether life could have started on what now seems to be a barren world. We dont have that answer yet, and thats all part of our quest for trying to answer, Are we alone in the universe? in a much broader sense, said John Grunsfeld, NASAs science mission director. Unlike the 2011-launched Curiosity rover, Maven will conduct its experiments from orbit around Mars. Maven will dip as low as 78 miles (125 kilometers) above the Martian surface, sampling the atmosphere. The lopsided orbit will stretch as high as 3,864 miles (6,218 kilometers). Curiositys odometer reads 2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers) after more than a year of roving the red planet. An astronaut could accomplish that distance in about a day on the Martian surface, Grunsfeld noted. Grunsfeld, a former astronaut, said considerable technology is needed, however, before humans can fly to Mars in the 2030s, NASAs ultimate objective. Mars remains an intimidating target even for robotic craft, more than 50 years after the worlds first shot at the red planet. Fourteen of NASAs previous 20 missions to Mars have succeeded, beginning with the 1964-launched Mariner 4, a Martian flyby. The U.S. hasnt logged a Mars failure, in fact, since the late 1990s. Thats a U.S. success rate of 70 percent. No other country comes close. Russia has a poor track record involving Mars, despite repeated attempts dating to 1960. India became the newest entry to the Martian market two weeks ago with its first launch to Mars. If all goes well, Maven will cruise past Indias Mars voyager, called Mangalyaan, or Mars craft in Hindi. Maven should beat Mangalyaan to Mars by two days next September, said NASA project manager David Mitchell. Its kind of a neat race, and we wish them all the best, Mitchell said. Earth and Mars line up properly for a Mars flight every two years, occasionally resulting in just this sort of traffic jam. The two planets are constantly on the move, thus the 440 million-mile-plus chase by Maven to Mars over the next 10 months. Mavens science instruments will be turned on in the next few weeks. The University of Colorados ultraviolet spectrograph will try to observe Comet ISON, now visible and brightening in the night sky as it speeds toward the sun. ISON will zip within 730,000 miles (1,174,766.66 kilometers) of the sun on Thanksgiving Day. Astronomers are uncertain whether the comet will survive that blisteringly close encounter.",https://apnews.com/nasa-launches-robotic-explorer-to-mars-f112163ec1634f1da8b0aa435a0fc1f3,science
Astronaut exits space station with music video,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  In a high-flying, perfectly pitched first, an astronaut on the International Space Station is bowing out of orbit with a musical video: his own custom version of David Bowies Space Oddity. Its believed to be the first music video made in space, according to NASA. Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfields personalized rendition of Space Oddity was posted on YouTube on Sunday, one day before his departure from the orbiting lab. Hes wrapping up a five-month mission that began last December. He returned aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule, along with American Thomas Marshburn and Russian Roman Romanenko, late Monday to Kazakhstan. Hadfield, 53, a longtime guitarist who played in an astronaut rock n roll band, recorded the video throughout the space station. He had some down-to-Earth help from a Canadian music team. With deference to the genius of David Bowie, heres Space Oddity, recorded on Station. A last glimpse of the World, Hadfield said via Twitter. The spaceman altered some of the lyrics of Bowies 1969 version, singing Planet Earth is blue and theres nothing left to do. The Bowie version goes ""... and theres nothing I can do. And instead of Take your protein pills and put your helmet on, it became, Lock your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on. Planet Earth provided a stunning backdrop for many of the scenes. Its just been an extremely fulfilling and amazing experience end to end, Hadfield told Mission Control on Monday. Were, of course, focusing very much on flying the Soyuz home now and looking forward to seeing everybody face to face. But from this Canadian to all the rest of them, I offer an enormous debt of thanks. He was referring to all those in the Canadian Space Agency who helped make his flight possible. 
        
     Hadfield, an engineer and former test pilot from Milton, Ontario, was Canadas first professional astronaut to live aboard the space station and became the first Canadian in charge of a spacecraft. He relinquished command of the space station on Sunday. He sang often in orbit, using a guitar already aboard the complex, and even took part in a live, Canadian coast-to-coast concert in February that included the Barenaked Ladies Ed Robertson and a youth choir, and featured the song I.S.S., Is Somebody Singing? I.S.S. is NASAs acronym for the International Space Station. Also last February, Hadfield joined the Irish band The Chieftains and two ground-bound astronauts in a Houston concert, singing the lead on Moondance. The five-minute video posted Sunday drew a salute from Bowies official Facebook page: Its possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created. NASA broadcast the video on its daily space station update late Monday morning. One of the video collaborators was piano arranger Emm Gryner, part of the Bowie band in 1999 and 2000. Planet Earth IS blue, she said in her online blog, and theres nothing left for Chris Hadfield to do. Right.

"New HIV infections in US hold steady at 50,000","NEW YORK (AP)  The number of Americans newly infected with the AIDS virus each year has been holding steady at about 50,000, according to a government report released Wednesday. But a U.S. health official said just keeping the number stable was unacceptable, noting a dramatic increase in new HIV cases among young gay and bisexual black men. Weve made accomplishments in driving down the rate of new infections, said Dr. Kevin Fenton, the AIDS prevention chief for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The charge now is to continue that trajectory and take that 50,000 down further. The annual number of new infections peaked at 130,000 in the mid-1980s, he said. Gay and bisexual men account for the majority of the new cases  nearly two-thirds in 2009. Heterosexuals accounted for 27 percent and injection drug users represented 9 percent of new infections. The only increase over the four years was in young gay and bisexual men, driven by a 48 percent increase among blacks ages 13 to 29. Fenton said thats one of the areas where prevention efforts need to be focused. The reality is that we just cannot allow another generation of gay men to be lost to what is essentially a preventable disease, he said. For many years, U.S. health officials put the annual number of new HIV infections at 40,000. But three years ago, they said their estimate had been too low. Using new methods and a better blood test, the CDC revised their estimate higher, to roughly 56,300 new infections in 2006. 
        
     The latest CDC report used the new methods to look at trends over four years, and found that there were about 50,000 new infections each year from 2006-2009. The CDC report was published Wednesday in the journal PLoS One. The figures were calculated from data in 16 states and two cities. Estimating new infections is complicated; it can take many years for an infection to cause symptoms and illness. The new blood test can tell how recent an infection occurred. People with HIV are living longer and healthier lives now, bringing the number of Americans living with the virus to about 1.1 million. So the fact that the number of infections didnt increase is a bit of good news, Fenton said. In a sense, we are holding HIV incidence at bay, he said. __ Online: CDC report on HIV: http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/incidence.htm",https://apnews.com/article/health-f55e2e84caa6475b98fa78c770f9926f,science
Deaths from painkiller overdose triple in decade,"NEW YORK (AP)  The number of overdose deaths from powerful painkillers more than tripled over a decade, the government reported Tuesday  a trend that a U.S. health official called an epidemic, but one that can be stopped. Prescription painkillers such as OxyContin, Vicodin and methadone led to the deaths of almost 15,000 people in 2008, including actor Heath Ledger. Thats more than three times the 4,000 deaths from narcotics in 1999. Such painkillers are meant to help people who have severe pain, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which issued the report. They are, however, highly addictive. The report shows nearly 5 percent of Americans ages 12 and older said theyve abused painkillers in the past year  using them without a prescription or just for the high. In 2008-09 surveys, Oklahomans reported the highest rate of abuse; the lowest was in Nebraska and Iowa. The overdose deaths reflect the spike in the number of narcotic painkillers prescribed every year  enough to give every American a one-month supply, Frieden said. Prescriptions rose as doctors aimed to better treat pain and as new painkillers hit the market. Frieden and White House drug czar Gil Kerlikowske, who joined him at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, said states need to take sharp actions to reverse the long-running trend. States oversee prescription practices and can rigorously monitor prescriptions and crack down on pill mills and doctor shopping by patients, Frieden said. 
        
     Doctors should limit prescriptions  giving only a three-day supply for acute pain, for example  and look for alternative treatments, he said. For chronic pain, narcotics should be the last resort, he added. A federal drug plan announced this year calls for state programs to track prescriptions. All but two states  Missouri and New Hampshire  have approved them, said Kerlikowske. But a number of states dont have them in place yet or doctors arent using them enough to check on their patients past prescriptions, he said. Americas prescription drug abuse epidemic is not a problem thats going to be solved overnight, but at the same time, were not powerless, said Kerlikowske, who urged parents to get rid of unneeded or expired painkillers so they arent misused. Some states are taking action. Earlier this month, a doctor in Southern California was sentenced to prison for illegally selling tens of thousands of prescriptions for painkillers and sedative. Ohio now requires pain clinics to be licensed by the state, and limits the amount of pills that can be dispensed at clinics. Florida also has cracked down on so-called pill mills. Overall, there were 36,450 fatal overdoses in 2008, including accidental cases and suicides involving illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine along with prescription medicines. About three-quarters of the deaths from prescriptions involved narcotic painkillers. Thats the year Ledger died from an accidental overdose of painkillers and sedatives. A few months later, a 12-year-old girl from suburban New York overdosed on methadone she bought from a 15-year-old boy. Narcotics also played a role in the recent deaths of a 27-year-old model at the mansion of an Anheuser-Busch heir and of former hockey player Derek Boogaard. Other findings of the CDC report:  New Mexico had the highest overdose death rate (27 per 100,000) and Nebraska had the lowest (5.5). The national rate was 11.9.  Fatal overdoses were more likely in men, middle-aged adults and whites and American Indians.  Sales of prescription painkillers are highest in the Southeast and Northwest. Frieden noted the wide differences between overdose death rates among states. For example, West Virginias rate is about 26 per 100,000 while neighboring Virginias rate is only 9. This highlights the importance of states getting policies right on preventing drug abuse, he said. __ Online: CDC report: http://cdc.gov/mmwr/",https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-health-780d9ccbe9fb4e329f7b21b4d1f71bc7,science
New European pill works against uterine fibroids,"NEW YORK (AP)  New research offers hope for the first pill to treat a common problem in young women: fibroids in the uterus. The growths can cause pain, heavy bleeding and fertility problems, and they are the leading cause of hysterectomies. In two studies, a lower dose of a morning after contraceptive pill stopped the bleeding and shrank the fibroids. It worked as well as shots of a hormone-blocking drug that has unpleasant side effects. This is very, very good news. The results are better than we expected, said research leader Dr. Jacques Donnez, of Saint-Luc hospital at the Catholic University of Louvain in Brussels. Hes now testing intermittent long-term use of the pill to see if that could help women avoid surgery. The pill is called Esmya, and it is awaiting marketing approval in Europe. Its a low-dose version of an emergency birth control pill called ella that came on the market in the United States about a year ago. The new fibroid pill still needs to be tested in the U.S. and wont be available anytime soon. Fibroids are benign growths in the uterus that are common in women during their childbearing years, mostly in their late 30s and 40s. They usually go away after menopause. Treating fibroids isnt easy. Removing the uterus is the only cure; other treatments include surgery to remove them or procedures to shrink them with ultrasound or pellets that cut off their blood supply. With the discovery that the hormone progesterone, as well as estrogen, promotes fibroid growth, scientists have been looking at a class of drugs that can block progesterones effect on the uterus. 
        
     Donnez and his colleagues in several European countries tested Esmya, made by Swiss-based PregLem. Their findings are in Thursdays New England Journal of Medicine. The two studies involved about 550 premenopausal women whose fibroid symptoms were serious enough that surgery was planned. One study compared two doses of Esmya with a dummy pill for three months. The second tested Esmya against a monthly hormone-blocking shot that shrinks fibroids but causes hot flashes and, with long-term use, can thin bones.. Women in that study got a daily Esmya pill and a dummy shot each month, or a hormone shot and a dummy pill. In both studies, Esmya stopped the bleeding and shrank fibroids in most patients and worked as well as the shot, but with fewer side effects. Menstrual bleeding was controlled in over 90 percent of the women on Esmya  many within a week, compared to 19 percent of those who took a dummy pill. At the end of the three months, only about half of the participants went ahead with any kind of fibroid surgery. That allowed the researchers to observe whether improvements lasted over the next six months. They did for many of the Esmya patients, while fibroids started growing after a month in the group that got the hormone shot. Donnez is now studying whether Esmya could be used long-term, given periodically if symptoms return, until menopause, when fibroids usually disappear. That means some women, depending on their age, might avoid having surgery at all, said Donnez. He does between six and 10 hysterectomies a week for fibroids. Despite newer, less invasive alternatives, the rate of hysterectomies remains high, Dr. Elizabeth Stewart, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mayo Clinic, wrote in an editorial in the journal. Theres a need for good medical treatments and the new research represents an important step in that direction. Its amazing to me that so many women have uterine fibroids and yet the treatments we have available are pretty few and far between, she said. The new pill is awaiting final European approval as a treatment before surgery, following a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in December. In the U.S. and Canada, Esmya will be developed by Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., which also sells prescription ella, the contraception pill that helps prevent pregnancy for up to five days after sex. Watson spokesman Charlie Mayr said the company will soon start a study of the fibroids pill in the United States, but it will be several years before it is ready for government review. It will seek approval in Canada early this year, he said. Drugmaker PregLem paid for the latest studies. The researchers included company employees; Donnez and others have been on its scientific advisory board. ___ Online: Journal: http://www.nejm.org",https://apnews.com/new-european-pill-works-against-uterine-fibroids-da9ae31791ec45309a36a41b7675659e,science
"2 skydivers, 52 years apart, same lofty goal","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The advice from master to student over the past three years has been simple: Be prepared. Know what to do and how to do it. Fearless Felix Baumgartner heeded Joe Kittingers advice and followed it. In the desert surrounding Roswell, N.M., on Sunday, Baumgartner broke Kittingers world record for the highest and fastest free fall. Baumgartner jumped from 128,100 feet, or about 24 miles, for the highest skydive  more than four miles higher than Kittingers jump in 1960, which was from 102,800 feet or 19.5 miles. He broke the sound barrier and more, achieving Mach 1.24. A brief comparison of the two men and their endeavors: ___ Baumgartner is 43 and a former Austrian military parachutist with more than 2,500 jumps behind him. Kittinger was 32 and a captain in the U.S. Air Force. Hes now 84 and lives near Orlando, Fla. His record jump was his 33rd skydive. Baumgartner accelerated to 833.9 mph to break the sound barrier, or Mach 1. He went beyond that, achieving Mach 1.24, according to preliminary data that must be confirmed with international aeronautic authorities. Kittinger was clocked at a maximum 614 mph, equivalent at that altitude to Mach 0.9. Baumgartner ascended in a pressurized capsule hoisted by a 30 million-cubic-foot helium balloon, 335 feet tall when inflated. Kittinger rode an open, unpressurized gondola that was lifted by a 3 million-cubic-foot balloon, 184 feet tall when inflated. 
        
     Baumgartner wore a custom-made full-pressure suit. Kittinger wore an Air Force standard partial-pressure suit. He was initially claustrophobic in his suit and had counseling to overcome his anxiety. When you close your visor, its your own little world. You dont hear anything from the outside anymore. The only thing that you hear is yourself breathing all the time. Then you start thinking about bad things and its getting worse in a very short amount of time, Baumgartner said days before the jump. Your brain sometimes does fancy things. Kittinger, by contrast, was a test pilot and used to pressure suits. In 1972, his fighter jet was shot down and he ended up a Vietnam POW, surviving 11 months of torture at the Hanoi Hilton prison. In the next cell was Sen. John McCain. Kittingers Project Excelsior was Air Force. Baumgartners Red Bull Stratos effort is sponsored by the energy drink maker. Both men had two test jumps before the grand finale. ___ Online: Red Bull Stratos: http://www.redbullstratos.com National Museum of the U.S. Air Force: http://tinyurl.com/2dsnn6",https://apnews.com/article/science-us-air-force-ba9d39a983c64ca2809c99fabe139417,science
Supersonic skydiver reached 844 mph in record jump,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Supersonic skydiver Felix Baumgartner was faster than he or anyone else thought during his record-setting jump last October from 24 miles up. The Austrian parachutist known as Fearless Felix reached 843.6 mph, according to official numbers released Monday. Thats equivalent to Mach 1.25, or 1.25 times the speed of sound. His top speed initially was estimated at 10 mph slower at 834 mph, or Mach 1.24. Either way, he became the first human to break the sound barrier with only his body. He wore a pressurized suit and hopped from a capsule hoisted by a giant helium balloon over New Mexico. Baumgartner was supersonic for a half-minute  quite remarkable, according to Brian Utley, the record-keeping official who was present for the Oct. 14 feat. The 43-year-olds heart rate remained below 185 beats a minute, and his breathing was fairly steady. The leap was from an altitude of 127,852 feet. Thats 248 feet lower than original estimates, but still stratospheric. He jumped from a little bit lower, but he actually went a little bit faster, which was pretty exciting, said Art Thompson, technical project director for the Red Bull-sponsored project. Its fun for us to see reaching Mach speeds and proving out a lot of the safety systems, Thompson said in a phone interview from his aerospace company in Lancaster, Calif. Thompson said everything pretty much unfolded as anticipated, with no big surprises in the final report. The updated records were provided by Utley, official observer for the National Aeronautic Associations contest and records board. Utley was in Roswell, N.M., for Baumgartners grand finale following two test jumps. 
        
     Based on all the data collected from sensors on Baumgartners suit, Utley determined that Baumgartner was 34 seconds into his jump when he reached Mach 1. The speed for breaking the sound barrier depends on the temperature at a given altitude; for Baumgartner, that came together just shy of 110,000 feet. He reached peak speed by the time he was at 91,300 feet, 50 seconds into the jump, and was back to subsonic by 75,300 feet, give or take, 64 seconds into his free fall. His entire free fall lasted four minutes, 20 seconds. He used a parachute to cover the final 5,000 feet, landing on his feet in the desert outside Roswell. Not everything went well. Baumgartner went into a dreaded flat spin while still supersonic. He spun for 13 seconds at approximately 60 revolutions per minute, making 14 to 16 spins before using his body to regain control, Thompson said. The skydiver was well within safety limits the entire time, he noted. Baumgartners brain remained under 2G, or two times the force of gravity, during the spin. If the flat spin had lasted longer and been more severe  exceeding six continuous seconds at 3.5 G  Baumgartners drogue, or stabilizing, parachute would have deployed automatically. Doctors worried about him blacking out and suffering a stroke or, in the case of a suit tear, his blood boiling at such an extreme altitude. The outside temperature registered as low as minus 96 Fahrenheit. In the foreword of the 71-page report, Baumgartner said he never imagined how many people would share in his dream to make a supersonic free fall from so high. Some 52 million people watched YouTubes live stream of the exploit. The scientific and engineering experts who helped bring him back alive broke boundaries in their own fields just as surely as I broke the sound barrier, Baumgartner wrote. Baumgartner shattered the previous record set by Joe Kittinger, an Air Force officer, in 1960. Kittinger did not quite reach supersonic speed during his jump from 19.5 miles up. Kittinger noted in the Red Bull Stratos report (Stratos for stratosphere) that future work is needed to test a stabilizing parachute for use at extreme altitudes. The private project was aimed, from the start, at helping future space crews  whether NASA or commercial  survive high-altitude accidents. If a highly trained jumper like Baumgartner with 2,500 jumps couldnt prevent a flat spin, an astronaut, pilot or space tourist could not overcome this spinning probability, Kittinger wrote. Thompson agreed, noting that given the right safety gear and the right conditions, theres a remote possibility a space crew could survive even under such harsh circumstances as were faced by the space shuttle Columbia astronauts. All seven astronauts perished as Columbia returned to Earth on Feb. 1, 2003. One of the crew, Laurel Clark, was married to the former NASA flight surgeon who led Baumgartners medical team, Dr. Jonathan Clark. You never know what the possibilities are ... thats the direction we need to look at, Thompson said. ___ Online: http://www.redbullstratos.com/",https://apnews.com/article/science-new-mexico-felix-baumgartner-6de58aab5b0e45de82b1f7e700d9d3c4,science
2 space rocks hours apart point up the danger,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A space rock even bigger than the meteor that exploded like an atom bomb over Russia could drop out of the sky unannounced at any time and wreak havoc on a city. And Hollywood to the contrary, there isnt much the worlds scientists and generals can do about it. But some former astronauts want to give the world a fighting chance. Theyre hopeful Fridays cosmic coincidence  Earths close brush with a 150-foot asteroid, hours after the 49-foot meteor struck in Russia  will draw attention to the dangers lurking in outer space and lead to action, such as better detection and tracking of asteroids. After today, a lot of people will be paying attention, said Rusty Schweickart, who flew on Apollo 9 in 1969, helped establish the planet-protecting B612 Foundation and has been warning NASA for years to put more muscle and money into a heightened asteroid alert. Earth is menaced all the time by meteors, which are chunks of asteroids or comets that enter Earths atmosphere. But many if not most of them are simply too small to detect from afar with the tools now available to astronomers. The meteor that shattered over the Ural Mountains was estimated to be 20 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II. It blew out thousands of windows and left more than 1,000 people injured in Chelyabinsk, a city of 1 million. And yet no one saw it coming; it was about the size of a bus. 
        
     This is a tiny asteroid, said astronomer Paul Chodas, who works in NASAs Near-Earth Object program in Pasadena, Calif. It would be very faint and difficult to detect  not impossible, but difficult. As for the three-times-longer asteroid that hurtled by Earth later in the day Friday, passing closer to the planet than some communications satellites, astronomers in Spain did not even discover it until a year ago. That would have been too late for pre-emptive action  such as the launch of a deflecting spacecraft  if it had been on a collision course with Earth. Asteroid 2012 DA14, as it is known, passed harmlessly within 17,150 miles of Earth, zooming by at 17,400 mph, or 5 miles per second. Scientists believe there are anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million near-Earth asteroids comparable in size to DA14 or bigger out there. But less than 1 percent have actually been spotted. Astronomers have catalogued only 9,600 of them, of which nearly 1,300 are bigger than 0.6 miles. Earths atmosphere gets hit with 100 tons of junk every day, most of it the size of sand, and most of it burning up before it reaches the ground, according to NASA. These fireballs happen about once a day or so, but we just dont see them because many of them fall over the ocean or in remote areas. This one was an exception, NASAs Jim Green, director of planetary science, said of the meteor in Russia. A 100- to 130-foot asteroid exploded over Siberia in 1908 and flattened 825 square miles of forest, while the rock that is believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago was a monster 6 miles across. The chances of Earth getting hit without warning by one of the big ones are extremely low, so low that its ridiculous. But the smaller ones are quite different, Schweickart said. He warned: If we get hit by one of them, its most likely we wouldnt have known anything about it before it hit. Chodas said the meteor strike in Russia is like Mother Nature is showing us what a small one  a tiny one, really  can do. All this points up the need for more money for tracking of near-Earth objects, according to Schweickart and the former space shuttle and station astronaut who now heads up the B612 Foundation, Ed Lu. A few years ago, Schweickart and others recommended NASA launch a $250 million-a-year program to survey asteroids and work up a deflection plan. After 10 years of cataloging, the annual price tag could drop to $75 million, they said. Unfortunately, NASA never acted on any of our recommendations, he lamented. So the result of it is that instead of having $250 million a year and working on this actively, NASA now has $20 million. ... Its peanuts. Congress immediately weighed in on Friday. Todays events are a stark reminder of the need to invest in space science, said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House science, space and technology committee. He called for a hearing in the coming weeks. Bill Cooke, head of the Meteoroid Environments Office at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the space agency takes asteroid threats seriously and has poured money into looking for ways to better spot them. Annual spending on asteroid-detection at NASA has gone from $4 million a few years ago to $20 million now. NASA has recognized that asteroids and meteoroids and orbital debris pose a bigger problem than anybody anticipated decades ago, Cooke said. Schweickarts B612 Foundation  named after the asteroid in Antoine de Saint-Exuperys Le Petit Prince  has been unwilling to wait on the sidelines and is putting together a privately funded mission to launch an infrared telescope that would orbit the sun to hunt and track asteroids. Its need cannot be underestimated, Schweickart warned. Real life is unlike movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact. Scientists will need to know 15, 20 or 30 years in advance of a killer rocks approach to undertake an effective asteroid-deflection campaign, he said, because it would take a long time for the spacecraft to reach the asteroid for a good nudge. Thats why we want to find them now, he said. As Chodas observed Friday, Its like a shooting gallery here. ___ Associated Press writer Alicia Chang in Los Angeles contributed to this story. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/asteroidflyby.html B612 Foundation: http://b612foundation.org",https://apnews.com/general-news-4ce2cf5e598a4b13bdb14a963c7af74b,science
SpaceX on verge of 3rd supply run to space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station is about to get another commercial shipment. The California company known as SpaceX is set to launch its unmanned Falcon rocket on Friday morning, hoisting a Dragon capsule containing more than a ton of food, tools, computer hardware and science experiments. There wont be any ice cream, though, for the six-man station crew. The freezers going up are filled with mouse stem cells, protein crystals and other research items. On the previous Dragon delivery in October, chocolate-vanilla swirl was tucked inside. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said snacks straight from the orchard of an employees father are on board  and not just apples. Its a little bit healthier, I think, than the one that NASA sent last time, she told reporters on the eve of the flight. Forecasters put the odds of good weather at 80 percent. Launch time is 10:10 a.m. This will be the third space station visit for SpaceX, or more formally Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the creation of Elon Musk of PayPal and Tesla electric carmaker fame. NASA is paying the company to supply the orbiting lab; the contract is worth $1.6 billion for 12 delivery runs. If launched Friday, the Dragon should arrive at the space station on Saturday morning. Astronauts will use the stations robot arm to grab the Dragon and attach it to the orbiting complex. 
        
     A variety of plant life is going up, including 640 seeds of mouse-ear cress, a small flowering weed used in research. Other experiments involve paint; high school students want to see how it will adhere and dry in space. Russia, Europe and Japan also provide delivery services to the space station, but none of those cargo craft can return goods like the SpaceX Dragon. This latest Dragon will spend more than three weeks at the space station before departing and parachuting into the Pacific with a full load of medical specimens, fish, plants and old equipment. NASAs shuttles used to be the main haulers up and down, but retired two years ago. Orbital Sciences Corp., a cargo-flying competitor, hopes to launch its first orbital test flight from Wallops Island, Va., in April, followed by an actual demo mission to the space station in early summer. SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, Calif., is working to modify its Dragon capsules to transport astronauts to the station in another few years. A handful of U.S. companies are vying for the job. Until then, NASA is buying seats for its astronauts on Russian Soyuz rockets to get to the station. As is his custom, Musk will monitor the launch from SpaceX Mission Control in California. The company said its resolved the problem that caused one of the nine first-stage engines to shut down prematurely shortly after liftoff last October. A private Orbcomm satellite that was also on the rocket ended up in a lower-than-desired orbit and burned up upon re-entry. A flaw in the engine jacket was to blame, Shotwell said, declining to provide further details. The main payload, the Dragon capsule, had no trouble reaching the space station; it was even a little early. Shotwell stressed that the rocket is built to withstand an engine loss, and though you never necessarily want to see it happen, its nice that weve demonstrated the vehicle as it was designed. NASA space station program manager Mike Suffredini said hes satisfied with the engineering analysis by SpaceX. This Falcon is not carrying a commercial satellite. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacex-on-verge-of-3rd-supply-run-to-space-station-5c9a36c82cb84a80a56447caa7eeedb9,science
SpaceX company fixes Dragon capsule problem,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A commercial craft carrying a ton of supplies for the International Space Station ran into thruster trouble shortly after liftoff Friday. Flight controllers managed to gain control, but were forced to delay its arrival at the orbiting lab. The earliest the Dragon capsule could show up is Sunday, a full day late, said top officials for NASA and the private company SpaceX. Were definitely not going to rush it, said SpaceXs billionaire founder Elon Musk. We want to make sure first and foremost that things are safe before proceeding. The Dragon, owned and operated by SpaceX, holds considerable science experiments for the space station as well as food and spare parts. Musk said six hours into the flight that all four sets of thrusters finally were working. All systems green, he reported via Twitter. The problem may have been caused by a stuck valve or a line blockage. The thrusters are small rockets used for maneuvering the capsule. An hour later, the Dragon was raised with the thrusters to a safe altitude. Dragon back on track, he said in a tweet. It was the first serious trouble to strike a Dragon in orbit. None of the four previous unmanned flights had any thruster issues, Musk told reporters by phone from company headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. He said it appeared to be a glitch versus a major concern. SpaceX has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to make a dozen deliveries to restock the space station. This is the third trip by a Dragon capsule to the station; the first Dragon flight, in 2010, was a solo test. 
        
     NASA space station program manager Mike Suffredini said at least three groups of thrusters on the Dragon need to work before the capsule can come close to the complex. Thats a safety rule that will not be waived, Suffredini said. Engineers for both SpaceX and NASA plan an exhaustive study before allowing the rendezvous to take place. The Dragon could hang around at least a month before linking up with the station, Musk said. Its supposed to spend more than three weeks there, in large part to accommodate science samples that will be on the return trip. SpaceX is in charge of the flight until it gets near the space station. Then NASA calls the shots. If we can convince ourselves the datas good, I suspect we can find an opportunity on Sunday, but again, we have to go look at it, Suffredini said. The fresh apples aboard Dragon  straight from the family orchard of a SpaceX employee  will be applesauce or worse the longer the delay. Theres other fresh fruit as well for the six station astronauts. Musk acknowledged it was scary for a while. Yes, absolutely, it was a little frightening there, said Musk, whose fortune came from co-creating PayPay. He stressed that the companys Falcon 9 rocket performed really perfectly and that the thruster problem was isolated to the Dragon. On the previous flight in October, one of nine first-stage engines on the Falcon rocket shut down too soon. A communication satellite hitching a ride was lost. SpaceX hopes the resupply venture will lead to transporting astronauts to the space station in the Dragon capsule in just a couple years. If thrusters stalled like this on a manned mission, Musk said, the outcome wouldnt necessarily be grim. The capsule is designed to return to Earth with just two good sets of thrusters and, in a super worst case situation, conceivably just one although it would be a bit of a wobbly trip. The space station was orbiting 250 miles above the Atlantic, just off the New England coast, when the Falcon soared. Astronauts will use a hefty robot arm to draw the Dragon in and dock it to the station. Also on board with the fruit: 640 seeds of a flowering weed used for research, mouse stems cells, protein crystals, astronaut meals and clothing, trash bags, air-purifying devices, computer parts and other gear. NASAs deputy administrator, Lori Garver, said using commercial providers is more efficient for the space agency. Its part of a long-term program, she noted, that has NASA spending less money on low-Earth orbit and investing more in deep-space missions. Thats one reason why the space shuttles were retired in 2011 after the station was completed. The goal is to have SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies Corp., and other private firms take over the job of ferrying astronauts to and from the space station. Russia does that now  for a steep price. Competitor Orbital Sciences Corp. has yet to get off its Virginia launch pad. The company plans to launch a free-flying test of its Antares rocket and Cygnus supply ship in April, followed by a demo run to the space station in early summer. Russia, Japan and Europe regularly make station deliveries as well. But only the Dragon is designed to bring back substantial amounts of research and used goods. The other supply ships burn up upon re-entry. The newest Dragon is scheduled to spend more than three weeks at the space station before being cut loose by the crew. It will parachute into the Pacific with more than a ton of medical samples, plant and cell specimens, Japanese fish and old machinery, and used spacewalking gloves and other items. SpaceX plans to launch its next Dragon to the station in late fall. More than 2,000 guests jammed the Cape Canaveral launch site Friday morning to watch the Falcon take flight. It wasnt much of a show because of all the clouds. The successful separation of the Dragon from the rocket was broadcast live on NASA TV; on-board cameras provided the unique views nine minutes into the flight. Then the trouble struck, and the coverage ended. Its looking like were going to be back on track here, Musk later assured everyone. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/launch/index.html SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-8365e30474de4f32bebe7ff3bdef316b,science
Supply ship meets space station after shaky start,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A private Earth-to-orbit delivery service made good on its latest shipment to the International Space Station on Sunday, overcoming mechanical difficulty and delivering a ton of supplies with high-flying finesse. To NASAs relief, the SpaceX companys Dragon capsule pulled up to the orbiting lab with all of its systems in perfect order. Station astronauts used a hefty robot arm to snare the unmanned Dragon, and three hours later, it was bolted into place. The Dragons arrival couldnt have been sweeter  and not because of the fresh fruit on board for the six-man station crew. Coming a full day late, the 250-mile-high linkup above Ukraine culminated a two-day chase that got off to a shaky, almost dead-ending start. Moments after the Dragon reached orbit Friday, a clogged pressure line or stuck valve prevented the timely release of the solar panels and the crucial firing of small maneuvering rockets. SpaceX flight controllers struggled for several hours before gaining control of the capsule and salvaging the mission. As they say, its not where you start, but where you finish that counts, space station commander Kevin Ford said after capturing the Dragon, and you guys really finished this one on the mark. He added: Weve got lots of science on there to bring aboard and get done. So congratulations to all of you. Among the items on board: 640 seeds of a flowering weed used for research, mouse stem cells, food and clothes for the six men on board the space station, trash bags, computer equipment, air purifiers, spacewalking tools and batteries. The company also tucked away apples and other fresh treats from an employees family orchard. 
        
     The Dragon will remain at the space station for most of March before returning to Earth with science samples, empty food containers and old equipment. The California-based SpaceX run by billionaire Elon Musk has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to keep the station well stocked. The contract calls for 12 supply runs; this was the second in that series. This is the third time, however, that a Dragon has visited the space station. The previous capsules had no trouble reaching their destination. Company officials promise a thorough investigation into what went wrong this time; if the maneuvering thrusters had not been activated, the capsule would have been lost. Ford said everything about Sundays rendezvous ended up being fantastic. There sure were some big smiles all around here, NASAs Mission Control replied from Houston. Proclaimed SpaceX on its web site: Happy Berth Day. In a tweet following Fridays nerve-racking drama, Musk said, Just want to say thanks to (at)NASA for being the worlds coolest customer. Looking forward to delivering the goods! Musk, who helped create PayPal, acknowledged Friday that the problem  the first ever for an orbiting Dragon  was frightening. But he believed it was a one-time glitch and nothing so serious as to imperil future missions. The 41-year-old entrepreneur, who also runs the electric car maker Tesla, oversaw the entire operation from Hawthorne, Calif., home to SpaceX and the companys Mission Control. The Dragons splashdown in the Pacific, off the Southern California coast, remains on schedule for March 25. NASA is counting on the commercial sector to supply the space station for the rest of this decade; its supposed to keep running until at least 2020. Russia, Europe and Japan are doing their part, periodically launching their own cargo ships. But none of those craft can return items like the Dragon can; they burn up on re-entry. Russia also is providing rides for astronauts  the only game in town since the retirement of NASAs space shuttles in 2011. SpaceX, or more formally Space Exploration Technologies Corp., leads the commercial pack that is working toward launching astronauts in another few years. Musk said he can have people flying on a modified Dragon by 2015. NASAs shuttles used to be the main haulers for the space station. At the White House direction, the space agency opted out of the Earth-to-orbit transportation business in order to focus on deep space exploration. Mars is the ultimate destination. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/launch/index.html SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-87bf1de825b6457f93eba32a37b2513a,science
SpaceX Dragon cargo ship splashes into Pacific,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The SpaceX Dragon capsule returned to Earth on Tuesday with a full science load from the International Space Station  and a bunch of well-used childrens Legos. The privately owned cargo ship splashed down in the Pacific right on target, 250 miles off the coast of Mexicos Baja Peninsula, five hours after leaving the orbiting lab. The California-based SpaceX confirmed the Dragons safe arrival via Twitter. Special delivery! Dragon now being recovered in the Pacific, the company said in a tweet. The capsule brought back more than 1 ton of science experiments and old station equipment, as well as 13 toy sets of Lego building blocks that were used by space station crews over the past couple years to teach children about science. Its the only supply ship capable of two-way delivery. With the space shuttles retired, NASA is paying SpaceX more than $1 billion for a dozen resupply missions. The unmanned capsule will be shipped to Los Angeles  arriving Wednesday night  and then trucked to Texas for unloading. Earlier in the day, astronauts released the unmanned capsule from the end of the space stations giant robot arm. The 250-mile-high parting was a poignant moment for the three space stations residents, who helped to snare the Dragon three weeks earlier. Sad to see the Dragon go, astronaut Thomas Marshburn told Mission Control. Performed her job beautifully. Heading back to her lair. Wish her all the best for the splashdown today. 
        
     The Dragon used old-NASA-style parachutes to plop into the ocean; company officials indicated all appeared to go well during the re-entry. SpaceX launched the capsule from Cape Canaveral at the beginning of March. Mechanical trouble delayed the capsules arrival at the space station by a day. SpaceX flight controllers at company headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., managed to fix the problem within hours. Bad weather at missions end in the Pacific recovery zone kept it in orbit an extra day. Once the Dragon pulls into port, NASA will retrieve the science samples meticulously collected over the weeks and months by space station astronauts, as well as experiments that flew up with Dragon, including hundreds of flowering weeds. Mouse stem cells stayed behind on the space station, at the request of the Japanese researchers. Old space station equipment and other items aboard the Dragon will be removed by SpaceX in McGregor, Texas. In all, more than 1 ton of gear  2,668 pounds  was loaded into the capsule. SpaceX  Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  is run by billionaire Elon Musk, who made his fortune as a co-creator of PayPal. He also owns the electric car maker Tesla Motors. This was the second flight of a Dragon to the space station under the $1.6 billion contract with NASA, and the third delivery mission altogether for SpaceX. The next flight is slated for late fall. A competitor, Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Va., plans a test flight of its Antares rocket and a dummy payload next month. That launch will be conducted from Wallops Island, Va. Orbital, too, has a NASA contract to deliver supplies. Russia, Japan and Europe also periodically send up supplies, but SpaceX has the only craft capable of returning goods. All the others burn up upon re-entry. Three astronauts are aboard the space station right now. They will be joined by three more following Thursdays Soyuz launch from Kazakhstan. With its space shuttles now museum pieces, NASA is paying Russia to launch U.S. astronauts until SpaceX or another American company comes up with spaceships than can safely fly crews. Musk anticipates that happening by 2015 with a modified Dragon. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/national-national-ada7470b79eb44e39921719065a57646,science
Russian becomes worlds oldest spacewalker at 59,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A 59-year-old Russian cosmonaut became the worlds oldest spacewalker Friday, joining a much younger cosmonauts son for maintenance work outside the International Space Station. Pavel Vinogradov, a cosmonaut for two decades, claimed the honor as he emerged from the hatch with Roman Romanenko. But he inadvertently added to the booming population of space junk when he lost his grip on an experiment tray that he was retrieving toward the end of the 6-hour spacewalk. The lost aluminum panel  18 inches by 12 inches and about 6 pounds  contained metal samples. Scientists wanted to see how the samples had fared after a year out in the vacuum of space. Otherwise, the spacewalk had gone well, with the spacewalkers installing new science equipment and replacing a navigation device needed for the June arrival of a European cargo ship. Collecting the experiment tray was Vinogradovs last task outside. The tray drifted toward the solar panels of the main Russian space station compartment, called Zvezda, Russian for Star. Flight controllers did not believe it struck anything, and the object was not thought to pose a safety hazard in the hours and days ahead. Thats unfortunate, someone radioed in Russian. Another panel of similar experiments will be collected on a future spacewalk. This is the first of eight spacewalks to be conducted this year, most of them by Russians. Two will be led by NASA this summer. 
        
     Until Friday, the oldest spacewalker was retired NASA astronaut Story Musgrave, who was 58 when he helped fix the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993. Romanenko, 41, is a second-generation spaceman whos following in his fathers bootsteps. Retired cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko performed spacewalks back in the 1970s and 1980s. This is the sons first experience out in the vacuum of space. Vinogradov made his seventh spacewalk; he ventured into a dark, ruptured chamber at Russias old Mir space station in 1997 following a cargo ship collision. He arrived late last month for a six-month stay at the space station; hell turn 60 aboard the orbiting complex in August. The spacewalkers joked as they toiled 260 miles above the planet. Im afraid of the darkness, one of them said in Russian as the space station passed over the night side of Earth. Russian flight controllers outside Moscow oversaw Fridays action. The four other space station residents monitored the activity from inside; Canadian commander Chris Hadfield drew the short straw and had to work on a balky toilet. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-7a67af03fbb14538b04a7b2f6f1cefe7,science
Spacewalking repair halts station leak - for now,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronauts making a rare, hastily planned spacewalk replaced a pump outside the International Space Station on Saturday in hopes of plugging a serious ammonia leak. The prospects of success grew as the minutes, then hours passed and no frozen flecks of ammonia appeared. Mission Control said it appeared as though the leak may have been plugged, although additional monitoring over the coming weeks will be needed before declaring a victory. I will tell you that were happy. Were very happy, said Joel Montalbano, NASAs deputy space station program manager. We didnt see any obvious signs of a leak, but its going to take some time ... for us to look at the system, evaluate the system and make sure we did, indeed, stop the leak. Montalbano expects it will take a good four weeks, five weeks, maybe even a few weeks longer. Obviously, the longer you go, the more confidence you get, he told reporters. Christopher Cassidy and Thomas Marshburn installed the new pump after removing the old one suspected of spewing flakes of frozen ammonia coolant two days earlier. They uncovered no smoking guns responsible for the leak and consequently kept a sharp lookout for any icy flecks that might appear from the massive frame that holds the solar panels on the left side. Let us know if you see anything, Mission Control urged as the fresh pump was cranked up. Thirty minutes later, all was still well. No snow, the astronauts radioed. 
        
     We have our eyes on it and havent seen a thing, Marshburn said. NASA said the leak, while significant, never jeopardized crew safety. But managers wanted to deal with the trouble now, while its fresh and before Marshburn returns to Earth in just a few days. The space agency never before staged such a fast, impromptu spacewalk for a station crew. Even during the shuttle program, unplanned spacewalks were uncommon. The ammonia pump was the chief suspect going into Saturdays spacewalk. So it was disheartening for NASA, at first, as Cassidy and Marshburn reported nothing amiss on or around the old pump. All the pipes look shiny clean, no crud, Cassidy said as he used a long, dentist-like mirror to peer into tight, deep openings. I cant give you any good data other than nominal, unfortunately. No smoking guns. Engineers determined there was nothing to lose by installing a new pump, despite the lack of visible damage to the old one. The entire team  weary and stressed by the frantic pace of the past two days  gained more and more confidence as the 5 1/2-hour spacewalk drew to a close with no flecks of ammonia popping up. Gloved fingers crossed, space station commander Chris Hadfield said in a tweet from inside. No leaks! he wrote a half-hour later. Flight controllers in Houston worked furiously to get ready for Saturdays operation, completing all the required preparation in under 48 hours. The astronauts trained for just such an emergency scenario before they rocketed into orbit. This area on the space station is prone to leaks. The ammonia coursing through the plumbing is used to cool the space stations electronic equipment. There are eight of these power channels, and all seven others are operating normally. Life for the six space station residents has been pretty much unaffected since Thursdays ammonia shower. The loss of an additional power channel, however, could threaten science experiments and backup equipment. We may not have found exactly the smoking gun, Cassidy said, but to pull off what this team did yesterday and today, working practically 48 straight hours, it was a remarkable effort on everybodys behalf. NASA officials remain mystified as to why the leak erupted. Ammonia already had been seeping ever so slightly from the location, but the flow increased dramatically Thursday. Montalbano did not know, as of Saturday evening, how much ammonia was lost. Another spacewalk will be needed to replenish the supply. With the repair work behind them, the astronauts and ground controllers turned their attention to the impending departure of three of the six crewmen. Marshburn has been on the space station since December and is set to return to Earth late Monday, along with Hadfield, a Canadian, and Russian Roman Romanenko. Cassidy is a new arrival, on board for just 1 months. By coincidence, the two Americans performed a spacewalk at this troublesome spot before, during a shuttle visit in 2009. This type of event is what the years of training were for, Hadfield said in a tweet Friday. A happy, busy crew, working hard, loving life in space. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-b3d0bdb48d1041f283f83123c1d46ca9,science
"NASA picks 8 new astronauts, 4 of them women","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA has eight new astronauts  its first new batch in four years. Among the lucky candidates: the first female fighter pilot to become an astronaut in nearly two decades. A female helicopter pilot also is in the group. In fact, four of the eight are women, the highest percentage of female astronaut candidates ever selected by NASA. Mondays announcement came on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the launch of the first American woman in space, Sally Ride. She died last summer. The eight  all in their 30s  were chosen from more than 6,000 applications received early last year, the second largest number ever received. They will report for duty in August at Johnson Space Center in Houston and join 49 astronauts currently at NASA. The number has dwindled ever since the space shuttles stopped flying in 2011. Many astronauts quit rather than get in a lengthy line for relatively few slots for long-term missions aboard the International Space Station. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said these new candidates will help lead the first human mission to an asteroid in the 2020s, and then Mars, sometime in the following decade. They also may be among the first to fly to the space station aboard commercial spacecraft launched from the U.S., he noted. Russia ferries the astronauts now. These new space explorers asked to join NASA because they know were doing big, bold things here  developing missions to go farther into space than ever before, Bolden said in a statement.

Astronauts tackle chore backlog on spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Two spacewalking astronauts tackled a backlog of outdoor work at the International Space Station on Tuesday. It was the first spacewalk for Italy  a major contributor to the orbiting lab  as Luca Parmitano handled a variety of maintenance chores. He was accompanied by American Christopher Cassidy, a veteran spacewalker. Cassidy encountered a stubborn bolt, eating up precious minutes, as he got started on the first of two planned spacewalks just a week apart. A slim gap of just one-eighth of an inch stalled the installation of a new space-to-ground radio transmitter. The old one failed in December. Nothing jumps out at me, Cassidy reported to Mission Control. I can see a little wear on the bolt. Finally, the former Navy SEAL managed to attach the transmitter. Mission Control said it appeared to be a tight fit. It was smoother going for Parmitano as he collected science experiments for return to Earth later this year aboard a commercial SpaceX capsule. Any curve balls over there, Luca? Cassidy asked. Nope, came the reply. The spacewalkers made up for lost time as they went through the hodgepodge of chores, removing a bad camera and relocating radiator grapple bars. Some of the work was done to make it easier to swap out bad parts if theres ever a breakdown. They hustled through cable work in preparation for a new Russian lab due to arrive in December, and took pictures of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a $2 billion cosmic ray detector launched on NASAs next-to-last shuttle mission in 2011. Scientists noticed unusual discoloration on its radiators and requested photos of the instrument, which is anchored to the station. 
        
     Parmitano found it awkward to secure a protective cover over a docking port used by NASAs space shuttles until their retirement two years ago. The cover is meant to shield against micrometeorite strikes. Its kind of like when youre trying to make your bed by yourself. One side is a little bit shorter than the other, Parmitano said. Before ending their six-hour excursion, the astronauts got a jump on work intended for a second spacewalk next Tuesday. A really great day, Mission Control radioed up. NASA said the tasks had been piling up over the past couple of years. Managers wanted to wait until the to-do list was long before committing to the time-consuming spacewalks. Parmitano, 36, a major in the Italian Air Force, arrived at the space station at the end of May for a six-month stay. Cassidy, 43, will wrap up his half-year mission in September. The rest of the space station crew  one American and three Russians  assisted the spacewalkers from inside. This was the fourth spacewalk this year with five more planned, mostly by Russians. In all, 170 spacewalks have been performed over the past 15 years at the space station, totaling nearly 1,074 hours or 45 days. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/astronauts-tackle-chore-backlog-on-spacewalk-1e779b48c418458f8dad84780668c8cf,science
NASA still perplexed by astronauts flooded helmet,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  The spacewalking astronaut who came close to drowning in a flooded helmet searched for clues in his spacesuit Wednesday, in hopes of understanding the unprecedented water leak. Engineers in Houston, meanwhile, conducted their own investigation into what should have been a routine, yet still risky, maintenance job outside the International Space Station. But a day after one of NASAs most harrowing spacewalks in decades, answers eluded the experts. There still is no smoking gun or definite cause of what happened or why that water ended up inside Luca Parmitanos spacesuit, said NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries. Parmitano, Italys first and only spacewalker, could not hear or speak by the time he re-entered the space station on Tuesday, 1 hours after stepping out. He also had difficulty seeing because of the big globs of water in his helmet and elsewhere in his suit. Hed worn the same suit on a spacewalk a week earlier, without mishap. NASA aborted the second spacewalk because of the deluge and later acknowledged it was a serious situation in which Parmitano could have choked or even drowned. He looked all right, although wet, when his crewmates pulled off his helmet, and was reported to be in fine shape. Back to normality on the ISS - Cupola is still a fantastic sight, even after a (very short) EVA, Parmitano wrote Wednesday in a tweet. EVA is NASA shorthand for spacewalk: extravehicular activity. He followed with photos of Italys Lake Como, the Italian Alps and the Rimini sea resort that he snapped from the stations cupola, or observation deck. 
        
     NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg, a crewmate, added via Twitter: Just happy Lucas safe! On Wednesday, Parmitano shined a long flashlight through the ring collar of his suit, while his colleague, American Christopher Cassidy, examined other equipment used Tuesday. Nothing suspicious popped up, Humphries said. There are only two sources of water in the suit: a 32-ounce drink bag and a 1-gallon cooling system embedded in long underwear. NASA has pretty much ruled out the drink pouch. That leaves the cooling system. Specialists detected a higher than normal usage of water from the systems tanks, which could be consistent with Tuesdays leakage, Humphries said. No real theory yet on exactly where this water came from or why, but they are doing a very deliberate step by step process of troubleshooting to try to identify whats going on, he said. Tuesdays close call points out the ever-present dangers of spacewalking, Mission Control managers acknowledged to reporters following the episode. The next NASA astronaut set to fly to the space station, Michael Hopkins, said the important thing is that the spacewalkers got back in safe, thanks to everyones quick, appropriate reactions. While certainly concerned by Tuesdays events, he said hes confident the mystery will be solved before NASA sends anyone else out the hatch. We still dont know what happened, and so in terms of how thats going to impact our flight, we still dont know, Hopkins told reporters. But he added: Were ready for whatever might get thrown our way. NASA plans no spacewalks during Hopkins half-year mission, scheduled to begin in September. Hopkins two Russian crewmates, on the other hand, are aiming for seven spacewalks before and after Decembers launch of a new Russian lab. Russian spacesuits are entirely different than their American counterparts. Barring an emergency, no further NASA spacewalks are planned anytime soon. The work left undone Tuesday involved a variety of minor chores that had piled up over the past couple of years. Officials said theres no hurry to finish the job. Spare U.S. spacesuits are on board and could be used in an emergency. The leak problem appears to be limited to Parmitanos suit since Cassidys outfit worked fine, Humphries said.

Astronaut with flooded helmet felt like goldfish,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Now he knows what its like to be a goldfish in a fishbowl. Two days after his helmet flooded during a spacewalk, astronaut Luca Parmitano relived the experience Thursday, describing how water kept trickling into his helmet until big globs covered his eyes, then his nose. It was hard to see, he said, and he could not hear. For a couple of minutes there, maybe more than a couple of minutes, I experienced what its like to be a goldfish in a fishbowl  from the point of view of the goldfish, Parmitano said in a TV interview from the International Space Station. Parmitano said he used his memory to make his way back into the space station. His spacewalking partner, Christopher Cassidy, was a big help. The 36-year-old Italian Air Force officer said he was miserable but OK as Tuesdays spacewalk came to an abrupt end. Imagine walking around with your eyes closed in a fishbowl. Really, thats what was going on ... Its just a very uncomfortable feeling to be with your face underwater for all that time, he said. Parmitano, a former test pilot, said he was lucky to get back inside so quickly. He figures there was 3 pounds of water floating inside his helmet when his crewmates yanked it off; thats nearly a half-gallon. NASA managers have said Parmitano could have choked or drowned, and praised his calmness during the ordeal. Parmitanos colleagues grabbed towels to mop his bald head once the 1-hour spacewalk ended. Some water bubbles escaped and floated away. 
        
     The astronauts as well as engineers in Houston are still trying to figure out what went wrong. Parmitanos drink bag has been ruled out. The only other possibility is the cooling system for his suit. Parmitano said his long underwear, containing water tubes, appears to be fine. Im sure that they will find both the problem and the solution, Parmitano said. Parmitano became Italys first spacewalker last week. His spacesuit functioned perfectly the first time around. Tuesdays excursion was a continuation of the maintenance work, none of which was urgent. The trouble began barely an hour into Spacewalk 2. Parmitano said he felt cold water on the back of his head. Within a few minutes, he felt it covering his ears. The water kept trickling until it completely covered my eyes and my nose, Parmitano said. The sun was setting as the spacewalkers made their way back, making it harder to maneuver in the darkness. All those things sort of came together at the perfect storm, so to speak, for us to deal with, Cassidy told TV reporters. Cassidy said the space station crew reviewed the spacewalk procedures in advance and discussed possible emergencies. But lo and behold, what happened was not one of those items that we discussed, said Cassidy, 43, a former Navy SEAL. My own gut feeling, Cassidy said, I knew it was time to end it when I saw the water creeping around his communications cap, kind of right by his eyelid. I knew that was a significant amount of water to be in a helmet, and it was time to go in. Parmitano was low key as he recounted the experience. Once the helmet came off, he said, that was the end of it. Spare spacesuits are on board in the event of a space station emergency.

China lands a spacecraft on the moons far side to collect rocks for study,"BEIJING (AP)  A Chinese spacecraft landed on the far side of the moon Sunday to collect soil and rock samples that could provide insights into differences between the less-explored region and the better-known near side. The landing module touched down at 6:23 a.m. Beijing time in a huge crater known as the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the China National Space Administration said. The mission is the sixth in the Change moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Change 5, which did so from the near side in 2020. The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S.  still the leader in space exploration  and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there.  The emerging global power aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon again  for the first time in more than 50 years  though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year. U.S. efforts to use private-sector rockets to launch spacecraft have been repeatedly delayed. Last-minute computer trouble nixed the planned launch of Boeings first astronaut flight Saturday.  Earlier Saturday, a Japanese billionaire called off his plan to orbit the moon because of uncertainty over the development of a mega rocket by SpaceX. NASA is planning to use the rocket to send its astronauts to the moon. In Chinas current mission, the lander is to use a mechanical arm and a drill to gather up to 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of surface and underground material over about two days. 
        
     An ascender atop the lander will then take the samples in a metal vacuum container back to another module that is orbiting the moon. The container will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the deserts of Chinas Inner Mongolia region about June 25. Missions to the moons far side are more difficult because it doesnt face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications. The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land. The South Pole-Aitken Basin, an impact crater created more than 4 billion years ago, is 13 kilometers (8 miles) deep and has a diameter of 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles), according to a report by Chinas Xinhua News Agency. It is the oldest and largest of such craters on the moon, so may provide the earliest information about it, Xinhua said, adding that the huge impact may have ejected materials from deep below the surface.",https://apnews.com/article/china-space-moon-lander-446770171c61cdc27b2a307f51940300,science
Craft unfurls Chinas flag on the far side of the moon and lifts off with lunar rocks to bring home,"BEIJING (AP)  China said its lunar spacecraft unfurled the countrys red and gold flag for the first time on the far side of the moon before part of the vehicle blasted off early Tuesday with rock and soil samples to bring back to Earth. The mission was hailed as a success in China, which has made significant advances in a space program that aims to put a person on the moon before the end of this decade.  The Change-6 probe was launched last month and its lander touched down on the far side of the moon Sunday. Its ascender lifted off Tuesday morning at 7:38 a.m. Beijing time, with its engine burning for about six minutes as it entered a preset orbit around the moon, the China National Space Administration said.  The agency said the spacecraft withstood a high temperature test on the lunar surface, and acquired the samples using both drilling and surface collection before stowing them in a container inside the ascender of the probe as planned. The container will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the deserts of Chinas Inner Mongolia region about June 25. The small flag, which the agency said was made of special composite materials, emerged on a retractable arm deployed from the side of the lunar lander and was not placed onto the lunar soil, according to an animation of the mission released by the agency.

The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land. Xinhua said the probes landing site was the South Pole-Aitken Basin, an impact crater created more than 4 billion years ago that is 13 kilometers (8 miles) deep and has a diameter of 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles). It is the oldest and largest of such craters on the moon, so may provide the earliest information about it, Xinhua said, adding that the huge impact may have ejected materials from deep below the surface. The mission is the sixth in the Change moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Change 5, which did so from the near side in 2020. The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S.  still the leader in space exploration  and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there.  China aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon again  for the first time in more than 50 years  though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year.",https://apnews.com/article/china-far-side-of-moon-probe-4f140a9c2bef8a5e5e919f1967080858,science
"A Russian cosmonaut becomes the first person to spend 1,000 days in space","A 59-year-old Russian cosmonaut has become the first person to spend 1,000 days in space, Russian space agency Roscosmos said Wednesday. Oleg Kononenko achieved the milestone on Tuesday, having made five journeys to the International Space Station dating back to 2008. His current trip to the ISS began Sept. 15, 2023, when he launched alongside NASA astronaut Loral OHara and compatriot Nikolai Chub.  Kononenko first took the cumulative space time record in February 2024, when he surpassed the total of 878 days, 11 hours, 29 minutes, and 48 seconds set by fellow Russian Gennady Padalka in 2015. If Kononenkos mission ends as scheduled Sept. 23, 2024, he will have spent a total of 1,110 days in orbit. Theres this awareness that you have achieved something new and important, that youve overcome a certain milestone, touched the unknown, Kononenko told Russian state news agency TASS. It gives you confidence, and pride in the work youve done. He also told TASS that his American colleagues on the ISS were among the first to congratulate him on his achievement. The International Space Station is one of the few areas in which the United States and Russia still cooperate closely following Moscows invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022. Roscosmos announced in December that its cross-flight program with NASA transporting astronauts to the ISS had been extended until 2025.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-space-record-kononenko-cca8a62a269422db37a1653d78d15388,science
NASA launches robotic explorer to Mars,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs newest robotic explorer, Maven, rocketed toward Mars on Monday on a quest to unravel the ancient mystery of the red planets radical climate change. The Maven spacecraft is due at Mars next fall following a journey of more than 440 million miles. Hey, guys, were going to Mars! Mavens principal scientist, Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado at Boulder, told reporters after liftoff. Jakosky and others want to know why Mars went from being warm and wet during its first billion years to cold and dry today. The early Martian atmosphere was thick enough to hold water and possibly support microbial life. But much of that atmosphere may have been lost to space, eroded by the sun. Maven set off through a cloudy afternoon sky in its bid to provide answers. An unmanned Atlas V rocket put the spacecraft on the proper course for Mars, and launch controllers applauded and shook hands over the success. What a Monday at the office, NASA project manager David Mitchell said. Maybe Im not showing it, but Im euphoric. Ten years in the making, Maven had Nov. 18, 2013, as its original launch date, and we hit it, Mitchell said. I just want to say, Safe travels, Maven. Were with you all the way. Jakosky, Mavens mastermind, said he was anxious and even shaking as the final seconds of the countdown ticked away. An estimated 10,000 NASA guests gathered for the liftoff  the most exciting one of the year from Cape Canaveral  including a couple thousand representing the University of Colorado. 
        
     Surviving liftoff was the first big hurdle, Jakosky said. The next huge milestone will be Mavens insertion into orbit around Mars on Sept. 22, 2014. To help solve Mars environmental puzzle, Maven will spend an entire Earth year measuring atmospheric gases. This is NASAs 21st mission to Mars since the 1960s. But its the first one devoted to studying the Martian upper atmosphere. The mission costs $671 million. Maven  short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, with a capital N in EvolutioN  bears eight science instruments. The spacecraft, at 5,410 pounds, weighs as much as an SUV. From solar wingtip to wingtip, it stretches 37.5 feet, about the length of a school bus. A question underlying all of NASAs Mars missions to date is whether life could have started on what now seems to be a barren world. We dont have that answer yet, and thats all part of our quest for trying to answer, Are we alone in the universe? in a much broader sense, said John Grunsfeld, NASAs science mission director. Unlike the 2011-launched Curiosity rover, Maven will conduct its experiments from orbit around Mars. Maven will dip as low as 78 miles above the Martian surface, sampling the atmosphere. The lopsided orbit will stretch as high as 3,864 miles. Curiositys odometer reads 2.6 miles after more than a year of roving the red planet. An astronaut could accomplish that distance in about a day on the Martian surface, Grunsfeld noted. Grunsfeld, a former astronaut, said considerable technology is needed, however, before humans can fly to Mars in the 2030s, NASAs ultimate objective. Mars remains an intimidating target even for robotic craft, more than 50 years after the worlds first shot at the red planet. Fourteen of NASAs previous 20 missions to Mars have succeeded, beginning with the 1964-launched Mariner 4, a Martian flyby. The U.S. hasnt logged a Mars failure, in fact, since the late 1990s. Thats a U.S. success rate of 70 percent. No other country comes close. Russia has a poor track record involving Mars, despite repeated attempts dating to 1960. India became the newest entry to the Martian market two weeks ago with its first launch to Mars. If all goes well, Maven will cruise past Indias Mars voyager, called Mangalyaan, or Mars craft in Hindi. Maven should beat Mangalyaan to Mars by two days next September, Mitchell said. Its kind of a neat race, and we wish them all the best, Mitchell said. Earth and Mars line up properly for a Mars flight every two years, occasionally resulting in just this sort of traffic jam. The two planets are constantly on the move, thus the 440 million-mile-plus chase by Maven to Mars over the next 10 months. Mavens science instruments will be turned on in the next few weeks. During the second week of December, the University of Colorados ultraviolet spectrograph will try to observe Comet ISON, now visible and brightening in the night sky as it speeds toward the sun. ISON will zip within 730,000 miles of the sun on Thanksgiving Day. Astronomers are uncertain whether the comet will survive that blisteringly close encounter. Comets have many of the same gases as the Martian atmosphere, observed the chief scientist for Mavens ultraviolet instrument, Nick Schneider. What an ideal opportunity for us to try out our instrument and do some good science along the way, Schneider said. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/maven University of Colorado: http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/",https://apnews.com/general-news-e0273dd707444b8d9d899c1306c9e5e3,science
Hubble Telescope best shot at learning comet fate,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Its all up to Hubble. NASA said Monday that the Hubble Space Telescope is the best bet for figuring out whether Comet ISON disintegrated during its brush with the sun last week. A pair of solar observatories saw something emerge from around the sun following ISONs close approach on Thanksgiving Day. But scientists dont know whether the spot of light was merely the comets shattered remains or whats left of its icy nucleus. Either way, by now, they say it may be just dust. Over the coming week or two, scientists will keep a lookout for any brightening, which could indicate what, if anything is left. Hubble should put the matter to rest in mid-December, when the comets remains are far enough from the sun for safe viewing. As for us earthlings, there appears to be little chance of spotting whats left of the comet with the naked eye. Whatever is left will pass closest to Earth on Dec. 26; it will keep a safe 40 million miles away. ISON was making its first visit to the inner solar system, after traveling from the Oort cloud on the fringes of the solar system, home to countless icy bodies, most notably the frozen balls of dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets It was discovered by Russian astronomers last year and, early on, was predicted to become the comet of the century because of its brightness. Indeed, ISON would have wowed observers if it had survived the suns fury. 
        
     NASA turned all its space eyes on the sun-grazing comet throughout the year, watching as ISON advanced ever closer. Even scientists were left wondering whether the comet would survive its encounter with the sun from just 730,000 miles out. In an online blog, the Naval Research Laboratorys Karl Battams paid tribute Monday to ISON and suggested that donations be made to astronomy clubs, observatories or charities supporting science and math education for children. Never one to follow convention, ISON lived a dynamic and unpredictable life, alternating between periods of quiet reflection and violent outburst, Battams, an astrophysicist, wrote. Comet ISON leaves behind an unprecedented legacy for astronomers, and the eternal gratitude of an enthralled global audience. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/ison ISON Observing Campaign: http://www.isoncampaign.org/ .",https://apnews.com/hubble-telescope-best-shot-at-learning-comet-fate-477d60b0ce6b411eaa01723f21ead45d,science

Between 100 and 120 meteors are expected every hour at peak time. But scientists say the bright moon will interfere and reduce the number of visible meteors by half. Thats why the best shot for viewing will be closer to dawn on Saturday. The Geminids come from a small asteroid named 3200 Phaethon, which passes quite close to the sun.

Space suit issue prompts delay of second spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronauts removed an old space station pump Saturday, sailing through the first of a series of urgent repair spacewalks to revive a crippled cooling line. The two Americans on the crew, Rick Mastracchio and Michael Hopkins, successfully pulled out the ammonia pump with a bad valve __ well ahead of schedule. That task had been planned for the next spacewalk, originally scheduled for Monday but now delayed until Tuesday, Christmas Eve, because of the need for a suit swap. An early Christmas, observed Mission Control as Mastracchio tugged the refrigerator-size pump away from its nesting spot. If Mastracchio and Hopkins keep up the quick work, two spacewalks may be enough to complete the installation of a spare pump and a third spacewalk will not be needed as originally anticipated. Several hours after Saturdays spacewalk ended, Mission Control bumped spacewalk 2 to Tuesday to give Mastracchio enough time to prepare a spare suit. His original suit was compromised when he inadvertently turned on a water switch in the air lock at the end of Saturdays excursion. NASA officials said Saturday night that its unclear whether a third spacewalk will be needed and when it might occur, if required. A third spacewalk had been slated for Christmas Day before the latest turn of events. NASA requires a day off between spacewalks for astronaut rest. The space station breakdown 10 days earlier left one of two identical cooling loops too cold and forced the astronauts to turn off all nonessential equipment inside the orbiting lab, bringing scientific research to a near-halt and leaving the station in a vulnerable state. Mission Control wanted to keep the spacewalkers out even longer Saturday to get even further ahead, but a cold and uncomfortable Mastracchio requested to go back. The spacewalk ended after 5 hours, an hour short on time but satisfyingly long on content. 
        
     Earlier, Mastracchio managed to unhook all the ammonia fluid and electrical lines on the pump with relative ease, occasionally releasing a flurry of frozen ammonia flakes that brushed against his suit. A small O-ring floated away, but he managed to retrieve it. I got it, I got it, I got it. Barely, Mastracchio said as he stretched out his hand. Dont let that go, thats a stocking stuffer, Mission Control replied. Dont tell my wife, Mastracchio said, chuckling, as he put it in a small pouch for trash. Mastracchio, a seven-time spacewalker, and Hopkins, making his first, wore extra safety gear as they worked outside. NASA wanted to prevent a recurrence of the helmet flooding that nearly drowned an Italian astronaut last summer, so Saturdays spacewalkers had snorkels in their suits and water-absorbent pads in their helmets. To everyones relief, the spacewalkers remained dry while outside. But midway through the excursion, Mastracchios toes were so cold that he had to crank up the heat in his boots. Mission Control worried aloud whether it was wise to extend the spacewalk to get ahead, given Mastracchios discomfort. Not quite two hours later, Mastracchio had enough as he clutched the old pump. When Mission Control suggested even more get-ahead chores, he replied, Id like to stow this old module and kind of clean up and call it a day. He said a couple of things were bothering him, not just temperature, and declined to elaborate when asked by Mission Control what was wrong. Flight controllers obliged him. Once the old pump was secured to a temporary location, the spacewalkers started gathering up their tools to go in. Adding to the excitement 260 miles (418 kilometers) up, a smoke alarm went off in the space station as the astronauts toiled outside. It was quickly found to be a false alarm. The pump replacement is a huge undertaking attempted only once before, back in 2010 on this very unit. The two astronauts who tackled the job three years ago were in Mission Control, offering guidance. Mastracchio promised to bring back a wire tie installed on the pump by the previous spacewalkers. Oh, awesome, thanks Rick, replied the astronaut in Mission Control who put it on. The 780-pound (354-kilogram) pump is about the size of a double-door refrigerator and extremely cumbersome to handle, with plumbing full of toxic ammonia. Any traces of ammonia on the spacesuits were dissipated before the astronauts went back inside, to avoid further contamination. NASAs plan initially called for the pump to be disconnected in the first spacewalk, pulled out on the second spacewalk and a fresh spare put in, and then all the hookups of the new pump completed in the third outing. In the days following the Dec. 11 breakdown, flight controllers attempted in vain to fix the bad valve through remote commanding. Then they tried using a different valve to regulate the temperature of the overly cold loop, with some success. But last Tuesday, NASA decided the situation was severe enough to press ahead with the spacewalks. Although the astronauts were safe and comfortable, NASA did not want to risk another failure and a potential loss of the entire cooling system, needed to radiate the heat generated by on-board equipment. NASA delayed a delivery mission from Wallops Island, Virginia, to accommodate the spacewalks. That flight by the private firm Orbital Sciences Corp., which should have occurred this past week, is now targeted for Jan. 7. Until Saturday, U.S. spacewalks had been on hold since July, when an Italian astronauts helmet was flooded with water from the cooling system of his suit. Luca Parmitano barely got back inside alive. Engineers traced the problem to a device in the suit that turned out to be contaminated  how and why, no one yet knows. For Saturdays spacewalk, Hopkins wore Parmitanos suit, albeit with newly installed and thoroughly tested components. Just in case, NASA had Mastracchio and Hopkins build snorkels out of plastic tubing from their suits, before going out. The snorkels will be used in case water starts building up in their helmets. They also put absorbent pads in their helmets; the pads were launched from Earth following the July scare. None of the precautions were needed, in the end. Besides the two Americans, three Russian and one Japanese astronaut are living on the space station, all men.",https://apnews.com/general-news-b918621d35314668bd06cb7bbc23b524,science
Astronauts complete rare Christmas Eve spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  Space station astronauts repaired a crippled cooling system during a rare Christmas Eve spacewalk Tuesday, braving a mini blizzard of noxious ammonia as they popped in a new pump. It was the second spacewalk in four days for U.S. astronauts Rick Mastracchio and Michael Hopkins, and only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk ever. NASA ordered up the spacewalks to revive a critical cooling loop at the International Space Station. All nonessential equipment had to be turned off when the line conked out Dec. 11, and many science experiments halted. With Tuesdays success, the cooling system should be restored and all equipment back up and running by this weekend, according to NASA. Its the best Christmas ever, Mission Control radioed as the 7-hour spacewalk came to a close. Merry Christmas to everybody, replied Hopkins. It took a couple weeks to get her done, but we got it. Mastracchio and Hopkins removed the faulty ammonia pump during Saturdays spacewalk. On Tuesday, they installed the fresh pump. Standing on the end of the stations main robotic arm, Hopkins clutched the 780-pound (353.8-kilogram), refrigerator-size pump with both hands as he headed toward its installation spot, and then slid it in. An astronaut working inside, Japans Koichi Wakata, gingerly steered the arm and its precious load. Mike Hopkins taking a special sleigh ride on this Christmas Eve, Mission Control commentator Rob Navias said as the space station soared over the Pacific. 
        
     It was slow going because of a balky ammonia fluid line that sent frozen flakes of the extremely toxic substance straight at the men  a mini blizzard, as Mission Control called it. The spacewalkers reported being surrounded by big chunks of the stuff that bounced off equipment and, in all probability, their suits. The ammonia needed to dissipate from their suits before the pair returned inside, to avoid further contamination. Wow, Hopkins sighed after the fourth and final fluid line was hooked to the new pump. The electrical hookups went more smoothly, and six hours into the spacewalk, Hopkins finally called down, Houston, youve got yourself a new pump module. Christmas references filled the radio waves as the action unfolded 260 miles (418 kilometers) above the planet. Its like Christmas morning opening up a little present here, Mastracchio said as he checked his toolkit. Later, as he worked to remove the spare pump from its storage shelf, he commented: Now it really feels like Im unwrapping a present. Mission Control in Houston was in a festive mood, despite the gravity of the situation. Tabletop Christmas trees, Santa dolls and red Santa caps decorated the desks. NASAs only previous Christmas Eve spacewalk occurred in 1999 during a Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. But NASAs most memorable Christmas Eve was back on Dec. 24, 1968. Apollo 8 astronauts read from Genesis, the first book of the Bible, as they orbited the moon on mankinds first lunar flight. A bad valve in the ammonia pump caused the latest breakdown. Another team of spacewalking astronauts installed that pump just three years ago, and engineers are perplexed as to why it didnt last longer. NASA hopes to salvage it in the years ahead. The 2010 replacement required three spacewalks because of the difficulty in removing pressurized ammonia fluid lines. But this time, the astronauts managed to squeeze everything into two after NASA reduced the pressure and simplified the task. Mission Control planned to wait until Tuesday evening before fully activating the new pump, but initial testing showed everything working well. The two-line external cooling system uses ammonia to dispel heat generated by on-board equipment; only one loop was disabled by the breakdown. The second spacewalk was supposed to take place Monday but was delayed a day to give Mastracchio time to switch to another suit. He inadvertently hit a water switch in the air lock at the end of Saturdays excursion, and a bit of water encroached on a cooling device in the backpack of his suit, making it unusable. Otherwise, the suits remained dry during both spacewalks. Last July, an astronaut almost drowned when water from his suits cooling system flooded his helmet. Makeshift snorkels and absorbent pads were added to the suits as a precaution. A Moscow-led spacewalk, meanwhile, is set for Friday.

Supply ship departs space station after 5 weeks,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station has one fewer capsule and a lot less trash. A commercial cargo ship ended its five-week visit Tuesday morning. NASA astronaut Michael Hopkins used the space stations big robot arm to release the capsule, called Cygnus, as the orbiting lab sailed 260 miles above the South Atlantic. Cygnus is filled with garbage and will burn up Wednesday when it plunges through the atmosphere, over the Pacific. Orbital Sciences Corp. launched the capsule last month from Virginia under a $1.9 billion contract with NASA. The Cygnus delivered 3,000 pounds of goods, including belated Christmas gifts for the six-man crew and hundreds of ants for a student experiment. The ants are still aboard the space station. Theyll return to Earth aboard another companys cargo ship, the SpaceX Dragon. SpaceX  or Space Exploration Technologies Corp., based in Southern California  will launch its next Dragon from Cape Canaveral on March 16 with a fresh load of supplies. NASA is paying Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked. Russia, Japan and Europe also take turns making deliveries. The SpaceX Dragon is the only craft capable of safely returning a pile of items, now that NASAs space shuttles are retired. The Russian Soyuz crew capsule has just enough room for three astronauts and a few odds and ends. A handful of American companies, including SpaceX, are working to develop craft to carry space station crews. Until that happens, NASA must continue to buy Soyuz seats for its astronauts. Americans have not launched from U.S. soil since the last shuttle flight in 2011. NASA expects it will be 2017 before U.S. astronauts rocket into orbit from their homeland. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital Sciences: http://www.orbital.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-b1ffbc19a5684670a765678fed266b1d,science
NASA could have prevented spacewalkers close call,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  NASA could have prevented last summers near-drowning of a spacewalking astronaut at the International Space Station, an investigation panel concluded Wednesday. Italian astronaut Luca Parmitanos helmet filled with water July 16 during his second spacewalk in a week. He barely made it back inside alive. But according to the panels report, his helmet also had leaked at the end of his first spacewalk a week earlier. The panel said the space station team misdiagnosed the first failure and should have delayed the second spacewalk until the problem was understood. This event was not properly investigated, said Chris Hansen, NASAs chief space station engineer and chairman of the investigation board created by the space agency after the close call. There was a lack of understanding in the severity of the event, Hansen said during a news conference. Space station officials  even the astronauts themselves  presumed the leak was from a water drink bag in the suit when, in fact, that was not the culprit, he noted. Investigators said Parmitanos calm demeanor during the incident quite possibly saved his life. It was fortunate he was relatively close to the space station entrance when the helmet flooded, Hansen noted. Now 37, Parmitano is a former test pilot and an officer in the Italian Air Force who was making his first space mission. He returned to Earth in November. 
        
     The precise cause of the water leakage is still under review. Debris clogged a pump mechanism inside Parmitanos spacesuit, part of its cooling system, and water ended up in the helmet, Hansen noted. Engineers do not yet know the source of the aluminum silicate contamination. NASA almost ended up with another disaster following Parmitanos close call. The day after his near-drowning, the astronauts used a vacuum cleaner to dry the spacesuit and accidentally sucked oxygen out of a tank. The hazardous mix of electricity and pure O2"" could have sparked a fire, the report stated. Mission Control had aborted the spacewalk once the water began to rise to alarming levels in Parmitanos helmet; the spacewalk by Parmitano and American astronaut Chris Cassidy lasted 1 hours, versus the anticipated six hours. So much water filled Parmitanos helmet  an estimated 1 liters  that he could barely see and could not hear or speak. He said he made his way back into the space station by relying on the position of his safety tether. NASA was contrite following the release of the 222-page report, saying it could and would do better. Were taking it very seriously, said space station program manager Mike Suffredini. He expects the engineering investigation wraps up by years end. Bill Gerstenmaier, head of NASAs human exploration and operations mission, said the spacewalk probably should have ended sooner on July 16. We can all improve and do better, Gerstenmaier said. The spacesuit failure  an unexpected problem initially given short shrift  has overtones of the 1986 Challenger and 2003 Columbia disasters. Both shuttle accidents were caused by misunderstood technical problems and miscommunication. In all, 14 astronauts died. Gerstenmaier stressed that Parmitanos close call is an excellent reminder for us. The message to all of us is to be really vigilant, right, and to really communicate, he told reporters. I think its a tribute to the agency that were not hiding this stuff, that were actually out trying to describe these things, describe where we can get better. Thats how we prevent Columbias and Challengers. A former NASA associate administrator said the incident is an all too familiar problem: Engineers think they know everything that can go wrong with complicated technology and often dont. When things go wrong, the machinery is talking to you. The equipment is trying to tell you something, said Scott Pace, space policy director at George Washington University. The question is whether or not you are listening. U.S. spacewalks were put on hold after the incident. An exception was made right before Christmas so two U.S. astronauts could repair a crippled cooling system at the orbiting outpost. As a precaution, they had makeshift snorkels and water-absorbent pads in their helmets, but there were no problems.

Space station moves away from space junk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station had to sidestep a piece of space junk. NASA said Monday the space station had to dodge part of an old satellite. Sunday nights firing of on-board thrusters pushed the orbiting lab up a half-mile. Experts arent sure how big the junk is. Its from a Russian weather satellite launched in 1979. After the maneuver, it was determined the debris would have posed no threat. NASA says it preferred playing it safe. Mission Control says the change in space station altitude will not affect next weeks launch of a new three-man crew from Kazakhstan. A SpaceX resupply mission from Cape Canaveral, meanwhile, has been delayed until the end of the month. The unmanned Falcon rocket was supposed to blast off Sunday. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/space-station-moves-away-from-space-junk-2754a804e4cb42eba877c14764195a55,science
Vast ocean found beneath ice of Saturn moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Scientists have uncovered a vast ocean beneath the icy surface of Saturns little moon Enceladus. Italian and American researchers made the discovery using Cassini, a NASA-European spacecraft still exploring Saturn and its rings 17 years after its launch from Cape Canaveral. Their findings were announced Thursday. This new ocean of liquid water  as big as or even bigger than North Americas Lake Superior  is centered at the south pole of Enceladus and could encompass much if not most of the moon. Enceladus (ehn-SEHL'-uh-duhs) is about 310 miles across. The data do not show if the ocean extends to the north pole, said the lead researcher, Luciano Iess of Sapienza University of Rome. At the very least, its a regional sea some 25 miles deep under miles-thick ice. On Earth, it would stretch from our South Pole up to New Zealand  at the very least. Cassinis rudimentary instruments also cannot determine whether the moons ocean harbors any form of life. Another mission using more sophisticated instruments is needed to make that search. This latest discovery makes the interior of Enceladus a very attractive potential place to look for life, said Cornell University planetary scientist Jonathan Lunine, who took part in the study. Back in 2005, Cassini detected a plume streaming from cracks in the south polar region. Scientists suspected these jets of salty water vapor and ice  containing some light organic molecules like methane  might come from a subsurface ocean. On Thursday, they confirmed its presence. Their findings appear in the journal Science. 
        
     Cassini provided gravity measurements from three close fly-bys of Enceladus from 2010 to 2012. The Doppler data indicated a dense material beneath the surface of the south pole, most likely liquid water. The ocean is believed to be sandwiched between miles of surface ice and a rocky core. Its extraordinary what Cassini has been able to do for this small moon, California Institute of Technologys David Stevenson, part of the research team, told reporters this week. But this is not like mapping the surface of the Earth or mapping the surface of the moon, its nothing like that. Its much cruder, and its amazing that weve been able to do as much as we can. Enceladus is hardly the only moon in the solar system with a subsurface sea. Titan, the largest of Saturns dozens of moons, is believed to have a global ocean. Evidence points to oceans inside the giant Jupiter moons of Callisto and Ganymede. And Jupiters Europa also has a hidden reservoir similar to that of Enceladus, complete with plumes and a rocky bottom. Cassini, already exceeding its life expectancy, is to make three more fly-bys of Enceladus before the mission ends in 2017.",https://apnews.com/vast-ocean-found-beneath-ice-of-saturn-moon-d4e9e28823f54d18a68284ecf7d8fee7,science

The moon will be rising in the western Pacific, and so only the last half of the eclipse will be visible. In much of Europe and Africa, the moon will be setting, so there wont much, if anything, to see. On April 29, the Southern Hemisphere will be treated to a rare type of solar eclipse.

"SpaceX launches 3-D printer, other station gear","CAPE CANAVERAL (AP)  A SpaceX cargo ship rocketed toward the International Space Station on Sunday, carrying the first 3-D printer for astronauts in orbit. In all, the unmanned Dragon capsule is delivering more than 5,000 pounds of space station supplies for NASA. Dragon should reach the space station Tuesday. Its the fifth station shipment for the California-based SpaceX, one of two new commercial winners in the race to start launching Americans again from home soil. The space station was soaring over the South Pacific when the SpaceX Falcon 9 thundered into Floridas pre-dawn sky. Sundays weather was ideal for flying, unlike Saturday, when rain forced a delay. The rocket was visible for nearly three minutes as it sped out over the Atlantic, with the Orion constellation as a backdrop. What a beautiful morning it was, said Sam Scimemi, NASAs space station division director. Sunday was a red-letter day for NASA in more ways than one. Besides the flawless launch, the space agencys Maven spacecraft was on the verge of reaching Mars. The robotic explorer was scheduled to go into orbit around Mars late Sunday night. The space station-bound 3-D printer was developed by Made in Space, another California company. Its sturdier than Earthly models to withstand the stresses of launch, and meets NASAs strict safety standards. The space agency envisions astronauts one day cranking out spare parts as needed. For now, its a technology demonstrator, with a bigger and better model to follow next year. 
        
     A $30 million device for measuring ocean winds is also flying up on Dragon, along with 20 mice and 30 fruit flies for biological research and metal samples for a golf club manufacturer looking to improve its products. Much-needed spacesuit batteries are on board as well, along with the usual stash of food, clothes and electronic gear. Routine U.S. spacewalks were put on hold following last years close call with an astronauts flooded helmet. That problem was solved, then the battery fuses were called into question. NASA hopes to resume spacewalks next month. NASA is paying SpaceX and Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp. to make regular station deliveries. The SpaceX service began two years ago. Just this past week, SpaceX  led by billionaire Elon Musk  won an even bigger and more prestigious contract to transport U.S. astronauts to the orbiting outpost, along with Boeing. Dragon rides could begin as early as 2016 or 2017. NASAs ability to launch its own crews ended with the shuttle program in 2011. Russia has been providing rides on its Soyuz spacecraft for a hefty price. Another American astronaut is scheduled to blast off from Kazakhstan aboard a Russian Soyuz later this week, along with two Russians, one of them a woman, a rarity for Russia. They will join the one American, one Russian and one German already in orbit. SpaceX was delighted with Sundays success and the road ahead, and could hardly wait for the party to begin. Nothing like a good launch, observed Hans Koenigsmann, vice president of mission assurance for SpaceX. Its just fantastic. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: htttp://www.nasa.gov Made in Space: http://www.madeinspace.us/",https://apnews.com/spacex-launches-3-d-printer-other-station-gear-0c43e98a398b4ba8bd6eef00512cbb4d,science
NASAs Maven explorer arrives at Mars after a year,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Maven spacecraft arrived at Mars late Sunday after a 442 million-mile journey that began nearly a year ago. The robotic explorer fired its brakes and successfully slipped into orbit around the red planet, officials confirmed. I think my hearts about ready to start again, said Mavens chief investigator, Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado. All I can say at this point is, Were in orbit at Mars, guys! Now the real work begins for the $671 million mission, the first dedicated to studying Mars upper atmosphere. Flight controllers in Colorado will spend the next six weeks adjusting Mavens altitude and checking its science instruments, and observing a comet streaking by. Then in early November, Maven will start probing the upper atmosphere of Mars. The spacecraft will conduct its observations from orbit; its not meant to land. Scientists believe the Martian atmosphere holds clues as to how Earths neighbor went from being warm and wet billions of years ago to cold and dry. That early wet world may have harbored microbial life, a tantalizing question yet to be answered. NASA launched Maven last November from Cape Canaveral, the 10th U.S. mission sent to orbit the red planet. Three earlier ones failed, and until the official word came of success late Sunday night, the entire team was on edge. I dont have any fingernails any more, but weve made it, said Colleen Hartman, deputy director for science at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Its incredible. 
        
     The spacecraft was clocking more than 10,000 mph when it hit the brakes for the so-called orbital insertion, a half-hour process. The world had to wait 12 minutes to learn the outcome, once it occurred, because of the lag in spacecraft signals given the 138 million miles between the two planets on Sunday. Based on observed navigation data, congratulations, Maven is now in Mars orbit, came the official announcement. Flight controllers applauded the news and shook hands; laughter filled the previously tension-filled room. Noted NASA project manager David Mitchell: Wow, what a night. You get one shot with Mars orbit insertion, and Maven nailed it tonight. Maven joins three spacecraft already circling Mars, two American and one European. And the traffic jam isnt over: Indias first interplanetary probe, Mangalyaan, will reach Mars in two days and also aim for orbit. Jakosky wished the team well. Jakosky, whos with the University of Colorados Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder, hopes to learn where all the water on Mars went, along with the carbon dioxide that once comprised an atmosphere thick enough to hold moist clouds. The gases may have been stripped away by the sun early in Mars existence, escaping into the upper atmosphere and out into space. Mavens observations should be able to extrapolate back in time, Jakosky said. Maven  short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission  will spend at least a year collecting data. Thats a full Earth year, half a Martian one. Its orbit will dip as low as 78 miles above the Martian surface as its eight instruments make measurements. The craft is as long as a school bus, from solar wingtip to tip, and as hefty as an SUV. Maven will have a rare brush with a comet next month. The nucleus of newly discovered Comet Siding Spring will pass 82,000 miles from Mars on Oct. 19. The risk of comet dust damaging Maven is low, officials said, and the spacecraft should be able to observe Siding Spring as a science bonus. Lockheed Martin Corp., Mavens maker, is operating the mission from its control center at Littleton, Colorado. This is NASAs 21st shot at Mars and the first since the Curiosity rover landed on the red planet in 2012. Just this month, Curiosity arrived at its prime science target, a mountain named Sharp, ripe for drilling. The Opportunity rover is also still active a decade after landing. All these robotic scouts are paving the way for the human explorers that NASA hopes to send in the 2030s. ___ Online: NASA: http://mars.nasa.gov/maven/ University of Colorado: http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/",https://apnews.com/general-news-4b3c8ee2a6dd43eba0b55218059ab104,science
Book Review: Challenger is definitive account of shuttle disaster and missteps that led to tragedy,"When the Challenger space shuttle exploded a little over a minute after its launch in 1986, it pierced the dreams of millions about who watched the tragedy unfold live on television. It also eventually exposed the weaknesses of a space program that had been revered by many. In Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space, Adam Higginbotham provides the most definitive account of the explosion that took the lives of the seven-person crew. He also meticulously explores the missteps and negligence that allowed the tragedy to occur. Bookmarked between two other tragedies that struck NASA  the 1967 Apollo launchpad fire that killed three astronauts and the 2003 Columbia shuttle disaster that killed seven  Higginbothams book traces the history of the nations shuttle program leading up to the Challenger explosion. Higginbotham manages to temper his account of the excitement the shuttle program generated  recounting how everyday life seemed to come to a standstill during the launch of the Columbia shuttle in 1981  with the warning signs of technical flaws that were overlooked or outright ignored over the years.  In clear and accessible language, Higginbotham explains the mechanics of the shuttle and its problems without sacrificing any of the pace that carries readers forward. The pace is so brisk that readers will be surprised when they realize the vivid account of the Challenger launch doesnt occur until well after halfway through the book. 
        
     Higginbotham provides just as dramatic of a retelling of the aftermath of the shuttles crash, from the search for the wreckage and astronaut remains to the investigation and hearings on the disaster.  The book delivers a compelling, comprehensive history of the disaster that exposed, as Higginbotham writes, how the nations smartest minds had unwittingly sent seven men and women to their deaths.  ___ AP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",https://apnews.com/article/challenger-nasa-shuttle-book-review-b15f6e77f622d7e22af9c73ae1b604e5,science
"US spacecraft enters Mars orbit, India probe next","CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  With NASAs Maven spacecraft safely in orbit around Mars, the spotlight shifts to Indias first mission to the red planet. The Indian spacecraft is due to slip into Martian orbit Tuesday night (Wednesday morning in India). Its Indias first interplanetary mission, and no nation has been fully successful getting to the red planet on its first try. There have been more than three dozen attempts, and more than half of them have failed. So U.S. scientists were relieved when Maven reached its destination after a 442 million mile (711 million kilometer) journey that began nearly a year ago. It joined three spacecraft, two American and one European, orbiting Mars. I think my hearts about ready to start again, Mavens chief investigator, Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado, said early Monday. All I can say at this point is, Were in orbit at Mars, guys! Now the real work begins for the $671 million mission, the first dedicated to studying the Martian upper atmosphere and the latest step in NASAs bid to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s.

India would become the fourth space program to reach Mars after the Soviet Union, the U.S. and Europe. Were hoping for their success, he said. Were sending them the best wishes from the entire Maven team. Indian officials have said the mission is chiefly a demonstration of technology. The spacecrafts instruments will gather data to help scientists study Martian weather systems and what happened to the ancient water. It will also look for methane, a key chemical in life processes on Earth that could also come from geological processes. Maven, meanwhile, will have a rare brush with a comet next month.

Dragon arrives at space station with 3-D printer,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station accepted another SpaceX shipment Tuesday, this one containing the first 3-D printer ever launched into orbit. Two days after blasting off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the SpaceX cargo ship, Dragon, arrived at the space station. German astronaut Alexander Gerst used the robot arm to grab the capsule. Well done capturing that Dragon, Mission Control radioed. Two hours later, the capsule was bolted into place. The Dragon is delivering more than 5,000 pounds of supplies. The 3-D printer  an experimental model  is the headliner payload. Also on board: mice and flies for biological research, fresh spacesuit batteries so NASA can resume routine spacewalks, and a $30 million instrument to measure ocean wind, along with the usual assortment of food and clothes. NASA is paying SpaceX to stock the space station. Last week, the California-based company won the right to transport astronauts, too. Thats still a few years off. The Dragon will remain at the orbiting outpost for about a month. It will be filled with science experiments for return to Earth. The Dragon is the only unmanned cargo capsule capable of returning items. This was the fifth Dragon to visit the space station. Were happy to have a new vehicle on board, Gerst said. Another spacecraft is due to arrive in a couple days. Russia is poised to launch a Soyuz spacecraft from Kazakhstan on Thursday with a three-person crew. That will bring the number of astronauts at the space station to the usual six. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov",https://apnews.com/dragon-arrives-at-space-station-with-3-d-printer-068f505436234c75bd4273d688339e54,science
Astronauts resume routine spacewalks for NASA,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  Two spacewalking astronauts moved an old, broken pump into permanent storage Tuesday, NASAs first routine maintenance outside the International Space Station in more than a year. American Reid Wiseman and German Alexander Gerst, both first-time spacewalkers, cheerfully completed the long overdue job 260 miles (418.41 kilometers) up. I cant wait to see these pictures, Gerst said. U.S.-based spacewalks were curtailed in July 2013 after an Italian astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. NASA solved the problem with the suits water-cooling system. Then concern arose over the spacesuit batteries. New batteries arrived late last month, clearing the way for Tuesdays spacewalk and another one scheduled for next week. Gerst clutched the 780-pound pump  about the size of a double-door refrigerator  as he rode on the end of the stations big robot arm. The crane swung him from the pumps temporary location to the new permanent spot in about 12 minutes. You should see my view right now, Gerst said, referring to the sprawling space station, lit up like gold in the darkness. The pump ended up in short-term storage during urgent spacewalking repairs to the stations ammonia-cooling system last December. NASA did not want to waste time back then parking the pump in its long-term garage, given all the spacesuit worries. So the job was deferred  until now. 
        
     With Wiseman looking on, Gerst slid the pump into its permanent slot, a large rectangular sheath formed by white protective blankets, and then bolted it down. Nice work, Mission Control radioed. The spacewalkers hustled through their other chores  replacing a camera light and installing a power-relay device for the stations robot-arm railcar  before calling it quits. As the six-hour excursion drew to a close, Wiseman thanked the hundreds if not thousands of people who worked on NASAs spacewalk recovery team over the past year. Alex and I, wed like to express just our huge gratitude for getting us back into planned EVAs (spacewalks), safely outside, safely back in, Wiseman said. EVA is NASA talk for extra-vehicular activity. Its a good day for NASA and the European Space Agency, he added. A follow-up spacewalk is scheduled for Oct. 15 to further whittle down NASAs lengthy to-do list, on hold since the 2013 close call. That spacewalk will be conducted by Wiseman and fellow American Butch Wilmore, a newcomer. A week after that, two of the three Russians on board will perform a spacewalk on their countrys side of the orbiting outpost. The Moscow-led spacewalks were unaffected by NASAs spacesuit troubles. NASA considered Decembers U.S. spacewalks  to replace the failed ammonia pump and thereby restore full cooling to the space station  too important to wait. The same went for a critical spacewalk by Americans in April to replace a dead computer. The helmets used by Wiseman and Gerst contained absorbent pads and makeshift snorkels in case of water leakage. The items became mandatory following last years close call experienced by Italian spacewalker Luca Parmitano, safely back on Earth for nearly a year now. As for the spacesuit batteries, NASA sent up replacements on the latest SpaceX cargo ship and Russian Soyuz capsule. Ground testing uncovered a potential fuse problem earlier this year, and NASA opted to switch out the batteries on board. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-332635506c184f1996bb117e53320859,science
Success for 2nd station spacewalk in 2 weeks,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts replaced a failed electrical unit at the International Space Station on Wednesday, restoring full power to the orbiting lab. The space station had been operating since spring with only seven of its eight solar-power channels. Wednesdays work by Reid Wiseman and Butch Wilmore  NASAs second spacewalk in two weeks  brought the energy capability back up to 100 percent. The spacewalkers encountered balky bolts but still managed to complete the job in the allotted time, with less than two minutes to spare. Yoo-hoo! they cheered as NASA declared victory. The voltage regulator shorted out in May but could not be replaced until now because of a yearlong hiatus in nonemergency spacewalks by NASA. The stoppage was caused by spacesuit problems, most notably a flooded helmet that nearly cost an astronauts life in 2013. Wiseman took part in the Oct. 7 spacewalk that jump-started NASAs outside maintenance, accompanied by a German. This time, Wiseman was joined by Wilmore, who made his first spacewalk. To avoid an electrical shock, the two spacewalkers waited until darkness before attempting to remove the old voltage regulator, so there would be no discharge. They took in the view 260 miles below as they waited for the space station to fly into the night side of Earth. I see Cairo! Wiseman said. Cant quite make out the pyramids, though. 
        
     Sunset came over Kazakhstan and China, and Wiseman began to undo the bolt holding down the bad regulator. His pistol grip tool failed to loosen the bolt. I can feel it binding up, he said. A ratchet wrench  along with some muscle  did the trick. Wiseman removed the 330-pound boxy regulator from its slot and, with Wilmores help, popped in the new one. But once again, they ran into bolt trouble, this time in securing the new device. The minutes ticked away as Mission Control debated how much longer to keep up the effort, before stopping for the next orbital sunrise. With less than 10 minutes remaining, flight controllers advised Wiseman to try tightening the bolt with the ratchet wrench. It worked. Outstanding news, Mission Control radioed. Flight controllers immediately checked out the newly installed system, with less than three minutes to go. Success was declared with one minute and 45 seconds remaining. The voltage regulator  officially called a sequential shunt unit or SSU  is needed to keep excess power from its designated solar wing, from overloading the station system. Power is regulated at about 160 volts. After the May breakdown, NASA transferred space station systems dependent on the failed power channel to a backup. No operations were hampered, but NASA wanted that channel operating again for full capability and redundancy. It should be back up and running normally again by Thursday. With their main job completed, the spacewalkers installed a new camera, and moved around various camera and wireless radio systems. The relocations are needed to get ready for the eventual arrival of new commercial crew vehicles. Thats still a few years away. Its been a very successful day, Mission Control said as the 6 -hour spacewalk drew to a close. A Russian spacewalk, meanwhile, is on tap for next Wednesday. ____ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/success-for-2nd-station-spacewalk-in-2-weeks-952a65f5ba40454e9e2811ec00e299e9,science
Space station supply launch called off in Virginia,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A space station delivery mission was called off Monday, just hours after the orbiting lab had to sidestep a piece of treacherous junk. Orbital Sciences Corp. got to within the 10-minute mark for the Virginia launch of its unmanned Cygnus capsule. But a sailboat ended up in the restricted danger zone, and controllers halted the evening countdown. The Virginia-based company will try again Tuesday evening. Early Monday afternoon, space station flight controllers steered the complex and its six inhabitants away from satellite wreckage. The debris  part of an old, destroyed Russian satellite  would have passed within two-tenths of a mile of the station if not for the maneuver. Mission Control was informed of the space junk over the weekend. It is wreckage from a Kosmos satellite that was launched in 1993 and collided with an Iridium spacecraft in 2009. Orbital Sciences Corp.'s unmanned Cygnus capsule  on the pad at Wallops Island, Virginia  holds 5,000 pounds of cargo for NASA, including 32 mini research satellites, a meteor tracker, and a tank of high-pressure nitrogen to replenish a vestibule used by spacewalking astronauts. Traffic is heavy these days 260 miles up. Just this past Saturday, a Dragon cargo ship supplied by the California-based SpaceX company  its fifth  departed the space station after a monthlong visit and splashed into the Pacific with a load of precious science samples. 
        
     On Wednesday, a Russian cargo ship is set to rocket into orbit from Kazakhstan and arrive at the space station the same day. Given all the traffic thats coming and going ... we might want to send up some of those red and green wands they use on the deck of an aircraft carrier, said Orbital Sciences executive vice president Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who lived on the space station more than a decade ago. This is the fourth space station delivery for the Virginia-based Orbital Sciences. Each one honors a deceased person linked to the company or commercial spaceflight; this one pays tribute to Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton, who led a rocket company until his death in 1993. As a retro-style homage, Orbital Sciences flight controllers wore short-sleeved white shirts and skinny black ties. Orbital Sciences tucked in some treats for a post-Halloween celebration by the two Americans, three Russians and one German on board. Culbertson did not want to divulge the type of goodies and spoil the surprise. They might be watching he said, smiling, at Sundays prelaunch news conference.

No injuries were reported following the first catastrophic launch in NASAs commercial spaceflight effort. The accident was sure to draw criticism over the space agencys growing reliance on private U.S. companies in this post-shuttle era. NASA is paying billions of dollars to Orbital Sciences and the SpaceX company to make station deliveries, and its counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start flying U.S. astronauts to the orbiting lab as early as 2017. This was the fourth flight by Orbital Sciences to the orbiting lab. The Orbital Sciences Antares rocket blew up over the beachside launch complex at Wallops Island. The company said everyone at the site had been accounted for, and the damage appeared to be limited to the facilities. And nothing on the lost flight was urgently needed by the six people living on the 260-mile-high space station, officials said. Flames could be seen shooting into the sky as the sun set. Orbital Sciences executive vice president Frank Culbertson said things began to go wrong 10 to 12 seconds into the flight and it was all over in 20 seconds when what was left of the rocket came crashing down. He said he believes the range-safety staff sent a destruct signal before it hit the ground. 
        
     Bill Wrobel, director of NASAs Wallops Flight Facility, said crews were letting the fires burn out late Tuesday and set up a perimeter to contain them in the darkness. This was the second launch attempt for the mission. Monday evenings try was thwarted by a stray sailboat in the rockets danger zone. The restrictions are in case of just such an accident that occurred Tuesday. Culbertson said the top priority will be repairing the launch pad as quickly and safely as possible. He said he could not guess how long it will take to determine the cause of the accident and to make repairs. Culbertson said the company carried insurance on the mission, which he valued at more than $200 million, not counting repair costs. He stressed that it was too soon to know whether the Russian-built engines, modified for the Antares and extensively tested, were to blame. We will understand what happened  hopefully soon  and well get things back on track, Culbertson assured his devastated team. Weve all seen this happen in our business before, and weve all seen the teams recover from this, and we will do the same. The Wallops facility is small compared to NASAs major centers like those in Florida, Texas and California, but vaulted into the public spotlight in September 2013 with a NASA moonshot and the first Cygnus launch to the space station. Michelle Murphy, an innkeeper at the Garden and Sea Inn, New Church, Virginia, where launches are visible across a bay about 16 miles away, witnessed the explosion. It was scary. Everything rattled, she said. There were two explosions. The first one we were ready for. The second one we werent. It shook the inn, like an earthquake. Culbertson advised people not to touch any potentially hazardous rocket or spacecraft debris that came down on their property or might wash ashore. Immediately after the explosion, the launch team was ordered to maintain all computer data for the ensuing investigation. Culbertson advised his staff not to talk to news reporters and to refrain from speculating among themselves. Definitely do not talk outside of our family, said Culbertson, a former astronaut who once served on the space station. This newest Cygnus cargo ship  named for the swan constellation  had held 5,000 pounds of space station experiments and equipment for NASA, as well as prepackaged meals and eagerly awaited crab cakes, freeze-dried for safe eating. It had been due to arrive at the orbiting lab Sunday. By coincidence, the Russian Space Agency was proceeding with its own supply run on Wednesday, planned well before the U.S. mishap. And SpaceX is scheduled to launch another Dragon supply ship from Cape Canaveral in December; some items may be changed out to replace what was lost on the Cygnus. NASA space station program manager Mike Suffredini told reporters that the station and its crew have plenty of supplies on board  about five months worth  even without the upcoming launches. Among the science instruments that were lost: a meteor tracker and 32 mini research satellites, along with numerous experiments compiled by schoolchildren. Suffredini promised the experimenters would get a chance to refly their work. The two Americans, three Russians and one German aboard the space station were watching a live video feed from Mission Control and saw the whole thing unfold before their eyes. Until Tuesday, all of the supply missions by the Virginia-based Orbital Sciences and California-based SpaceX had been near-flawless. President Barack Obama has long championed this commercial space effort, well before NASAs space shuttles were retired in 2011. Hes urged that NASA focus its human spaceflight effort less on nearby orbit and more on destinations like asteroids and Mars. He was informed of the accident while on a campaign trip in Wisconsin. SpaceXs billionaire founder and chief officer Elon Musk  whose company is the face, in many ways, of the commercial effort  said he was sorry to learn about the failure. Hope they recover soon, he said in a tweet. Support poured in from elsewhere in the space community late Tuesday night. Very sorry to see the Antares rocket launch failure, said Chris Hadfield, a former Canadian astronaut who served as space station commander last year. Spaceflight is hard. Very glad that no one was hurt. John Logdson, former space policy director at George Washington University, said it was unlikely to be a major setback to NASAs commercial space plans. But he noted it could derail Orbital Sciences for a while given the company has just one launch pad and the accident occurred right above it. The explosion hit Orbital Sciences stock, which fell more than 15 percent in after-hours trading. ___ Dunn reported from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Rocket explosion setback for commercial space,"CHINCOTEAGUE, Va. (AP)  Crews searched for scorched wreckage along the Virginia coast Wednesday in hopes of figuring out why an unmanned commercial rocket exploded in a blow to NASAs strategy of using private companies to fly supplies and, eventually, astronauts to the International Space Station. The 140-foot Antares rocket, operated by Orbital Sciences Corp., blew up 15 seconds after lifting off for the space station Tuesday, lighting up the night sky and raining flaming debris on the launch site. No one was injured, but the $200 million-plus mission was a total loss. The blast not only incinerated the cargo  2 tons of space station food, clothes, equipment and science experiments dreamed up by schoolchildren  but dealt a setback to the commercial spaceflight effort championed by NASA and the White House even before the shuttle was retired. It was the first failure after an unbroken string of successful commercial cargo flights to the space station since 2012  three by Orbital and five by SpaceX, the other U.S. company hired by NASA to deliver supplies. Although the cause of the blast is still unknown, several outside experts cast suspicion on the 1960s-era Russian-built engines used in the rockets first stage. Orbital Sciences chairman David Thompson himself said the Russian engines had presented some serious technical and supply challenges in the past. He said he expects the investigation to zero in on the cause within a week or so. The launch pad on Wallops Island appeared to have been spared major damage. 
        
     As for launching again, Thompson said he expects a delay of at least three months in the companys next flight to the space station, which had been set for April. We are certainly disappointed by this failure, but in no way are we discouraged or dissuaded from our objectives, he told investors in a phone conference. Former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, who helped spearhead the commercial cargo effort, noted that the Antares rocket was still in development. He and others associated with the space agency went into the program knowing that failures were likely. Its obviously tragic and upsetting, but well move on, Griffin told The Associated Press. In another few years, NASA hopes to launch astronauts again from U.S. soil  aboard commercially supplied spacecraft. Orbital Sciences has never intended to fly anything more for NASA than cargo. The political fallout from the blast is more likely to affect SpaceX and Boeing, both of which are under NASA contract to fly Americans to the space station by 2017. We cant allow the one incident of the Antares vehicle loss to smear space commercialization in Washington and on the Hill, Boston-based space analyst Charles Lurio said in an email. The mood was somber 260 miles up, according to space station astronaut Butch Wilmore. He and his five crewmates were watching a live video feed of the launch and saw the whole thing. Its a great loss, Wilmore said, quickly adding that the station pantry contains four to six months worth of food and that there is plenty of research to go around. Debris  potentially hazardous because of fuel  plummeted into the Atlantic and onto the launch site, igniting fires. Helicopters took to the air at first light Wednesday to track down remnants. Authorities warned people to avoid touching any debris that might wash ashore. Ash and other debris covered Chrissy Mullens house, patio and yard on Chincoteague Island a few miles away. She spent the morning cleaning up. We thought it was raining, but then were getting particles out of our hair, she said. The ash, the debris that was hitting our head was a little freaky. Carolyn Dalton watched the launch from the mainland while chaperoning four middle-school students from Colleton County, South Carolina, who had a milk-spoiling experiment aboard the rocket. People were screaming, people were crying, people were in shock, Dalton said. Just hours after the accident, Russia launched a supply ship from Kazakhstan on a previously scheduled flight to the space station, and it docked smoothly. Another load of supplies should be on the way in December, delivered by SpaceX from Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA is paying $1.9 billion to Dulles, Virginia-based Orbital Sciences for eight cargo hauls and $1.6 billion to Californias SpaceX for 12 shipments. Tuesdays flight was insured. Even before Tuesdays failure, Orbital Sciences had been reviewing alternatives to the Russian-made engines, Thompson said. The company recently had selected a different main propulsion system for use in a couple of years, and the switch may be accelerated if the Russian engines prove to be the culprit, he said. The AJ26 engines  modified and tested in the U.S.  originally were designed for the massive Soviet rockets meant to take cosmonauts to the moon during the late 1960s. Three years ago, an AJ26 leaked kerosene fuel and ignited on the test stand at a NASA center in Mississippi. Just this past May, another of the engines exploded during a test firing there. In 2012, SpaceXs billionaire founder and CEO, Elon Musk, called the Antares rocket a punchline to a joke because of the Russian engines. SpaceX, by contrast, makes its own rocket parts. I mean they start with engines that were literally made in the 60s and, like, packed away in Siberia somewhere, Musk said in an interview with Wired magazine. ___ Associated Press writer Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this story.

Half of all stars may lie outside galaxies,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The universe may be full of reclusive stars  not washed-up Hollywood stars, but the kind lurking deep in the cosmos. Scientists reported Thursday that as many as half of all stars may lie outside galaxies. Individually, these lonesome stars are too faint to detect. But together, they create a hazy background of fluctuating near-infrared light. A team of astronomers from the U.S., Japan and Korea say the diffuse glow appears to be from stars booted out of their galaxies by mergers and collisions. The measurements by Michael Zemcov of the California Institute of Technology and his colleagues were made on two suborbital rocket flights, launched in 2010 and 2012 from New Mexico, and validated by NASAs Spitzer Space Telescope. NASA program scientist Michael Garcia said this diffuse glow between galaxies is as bright as all the known galaxies combined, and is redefining galaxies. Instead of having sharp edges, galaxies may spread out like a starry web, connecting all the galaxies together. Traditionally, weve talked about galaxies as disks or sometimes spheroids that have a finite extent. They run out of stars and gas at a certain radius, Zemcov told reporters. While scientists previously have known about these halos around galaxies, these halos seem to be extending farther out than we thought and is responsible for more light than we thought. Details of this Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment  CIBER for short  appear in Fridays issue of the journal Science. More CIBER flights are planned for better measurements; there have been four to date. ___ Online: California Institute of Technology: http://ciber.caltech.edu/ Science: http://www.sciencemag.org/",https://apnews.com/half-of-all-stars-may-lie-outside-galaxies-2e84167d24ce48eba2430b03c8dc6f8d,science
Space stations 3-D printer pops out 1st creation,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The first 3-D printer in space has popped out its first creation. The 3-D printer delivered to the International Space Station two months ago made a sample replacement part for itself this week. It churned out a new faceplate for the print head casing. Space station commander Butch Wilmore removed the small plastic creation from the printer Tuesday, a day after its manufacture. Some of the plastic piece stuck to the print tray, said NASA spokesman Dan Huot. He noted its part of the learning process and will be further investigated. About 20 objects will be printed in the next few weeks, all for return to Earth for analysis, NASA said. The space agency hopes to one day use 3-D printing to make parts for broken equipment in space  an on-demand machine shop, according to project manager Niki Werkheiser. Made in Space, the Northern California company that supplied the space stations 3-D printer, called it a transformative moment. The newly created, rectangular faceplate  considered functional by the company  includes the Made in Space name, as well as NASAs. When the first human fashioned a tool from a rock, it couldnt have been conceived that one day wed be replicating the same fundamental idea in space, Aaron Kemmer, chief executive officer, said in a statement. Similar 3-D items will be duplicated at the companys offices in Mountain View for comparison. 
        
     The stronger-than-expected adhesion to the print tray could mean that the layer-by-layer bonding process is different in weightlessness, NASA noted. The company will replace the orbiting demo machine with a much bigger commercial printer next year. The European Space Agency, meanwhile, plans to fly its own 3-D printer in 2015. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Made in Space: http://www.madeinspace.us/",https://apnews.com/space-stations-3-d-printer-pops-out-1st-creation-318733192c08451287666ea636fd9508,science
Launch of new Orion spaceship has NASA flying high,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  With the imminent debut of its Orion spacecraft, NASA is on a high not felt since the space shuttle days. Shuttle veterans, in fact, are leading the charge in Thursday mornings two-orbit, 4-hour test flight, meant to shake out the capsule before astronauts climb aboard  eventually, perhaps, to visit Mars. We havent had this feeling in a while, since the end of the shuttle program, said Mike Sarafin, the lead flight director stationed at Mission Control in Houston. Launching an American spacecraft from American soil and beginning something new, in this case exploring deep space. Orion is set to fly farther than any human-rated spacecraft since the Apollo moon program, aiming for a distance of 3,600 miles, more than 14 times higher than the International Space Station. That peak altitude will provide the necessary momentum for a 20,000-mph, 4,000-degree entry over the Pacific. Those 11 short minutes to splashdown is what NASA calls the trial by fire, arguably the most critical part of the entire test flight. The heat shield at Orions base, at 16.5 feet across, is the largest of its kind ever built. Navy ships were stationed near the recovery zone off the Mexican Baja coast. Its an exciting time, Jeff Angermeier, ground support mission manager, said from Floridas Kennedy Space Center. You can feel the buzz. An estimated 26,000 guests were expected to jam Kennedy for the sunrise launch, as well as 650 journalists. (Actually, the unmanned rocket will blast off from the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.) The space center press site was packed Wednesday with out-of-town reporters not seen here since the last shuttle flight in 2011. 
        
     NASAs Orion program manager, Mark Geyer, puts the capsules inaugural run on a par with the formative steps of Apollo and the space shuttles. In the sense that we are beginning a new mission, it is, I think, consistent with ... the beginning of shuttle, the beginning of Apollo, Geyer said. Its a new mission for us, starting in the region of the moon and then beyond. Noted NASA Administrator Charles Bolden Jr.: For the first time in more than 40 years, this nation is going to launch a spacecraft intended to carry humans beyond low-Earth orbit. Thats a big deal. Unlike the first space shuttle flight in 1981  helmed by two pilots  Orion will not carry astronauts before 2021. NASA wants to test the most critical parts of the capsule on this $370 million shakedown cruise, including the heat shield, parachutes and all the sections jettisoned during ascent and entry. The capsule also will travel through the high-radiation Van Allen belts surrounding Earth; engineers want to gauge the effects on the on-board computers. A Delta IV rocket is hoisting Orion this time around. For Orions next flight, around 2018, the capsule will fly atop the megarocket still in development by NASA  SLS, short for Space Launch System. Only after that will humans climb aboard; NASA hopes to send an Orion crew to an asteroid corralled in lunar orbit in the 2020s and to Mars in the 2030s. Flying this one without humans on board took some of the edge off NASAs first-flight jitters. Still fresh in everyones minds is Octobers explosion moments after liftoff of a commercial rocket carrying supplies for the International Space Station. No one was on board that flight, either, and no one on the ground was hurt. Its important its unmanned because we actually structured the test to fly the riskiest pieces of the flight, Geyer told reporters. This is the time to do it, when its unmanned, and so we intend to stress the systems and make sure they behave as we designed them. Lockheed Martin Corp. is handling the test flight for NASA, much the way NASA has contracted out the development of two manned capsules meant for space station ferry trips. Even so, the shuttle ties run deep. Sarafins entire team at Johnson Space Center in Houston is comprised of former shuttle flight controllers. A special VIP, on hand in Mission Control on Thursday, will be Gene Kranz, the legendary flight director of Apollo 11 and 13 fame, and more. The mission director for Thursdays flight, based at Kennedy, is Lockheed Martins Bryan Austin, a former shuttle flight director like Sarafin. Kennedys director, Robert Cabana, is a former shuttle commander. So is Bolden, NASAs top guy. Getting the band back together, Sarafin said. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/orion/ Lockheed Martin: http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/ssc/orion-eft1.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-70ae6fb690924707b84738f33f496217,science
NASA scrubs Orion launch; will try again Friday,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  Wind gusts and sticky fuel valves conspired to keep NASAs new Orion spacecraft on the launch pad Thursday, delaying a crucial test flight meant to revitalize human exploration. NASA promised to try again Friday morning, as tens of thousands of disappointed and weary launch guests hustled out. Im running on no hours of sleep, zero, zero hours, said Sarah McNulty, a space educator who was helping NASA escort the several-hundred news media on hand. She said shed be back again by sunrise, bright and early. NASAs new countdown clock got a workout as problem after problem cropped up in the final four minutes, and the count switched back and forth. The space agencys new countdown clock got a workout as problem after problem cropped up in the final four minutes, and the count switched back and forth. A stray boat in the launch-danger zone kicked things off badly. Then excessive wind twice halted the countdown, followed by valve trouble on the unmanned Delta IV rocket that could not be fixed in time. Declining battery power in the rockets video camera system reinforced the decision to quit for the day. It was a roller coaster: Were going, were not going, McNulty said. But thats how the launch business is. Orion is how NASA hopes to one day send astronauts to Mars. This inaugural flight, while just 4 hours, will send the unmanned capsule 3,600 miles (5,800 kilometers) into space. 
        
     Its the first attempt to send a spacecraft capable of carrying humans beyond a couple hundred miles of Earth since the Apollo moon program. The ultimate goal, in the decades ahead, is to use Orion to carry people to Mars and back. An estimated 27,000 guests gathered for the historic send-off  roads leading into Kennedy Space Center were packed well before dawn  and the atmosphere was reminiscent of the shuttle-flying days. Go Orion!! urged a hotel billboard in nearby Cocoa Beach. A Thursday launch would have been special for another reason: NASA launch commentator Mike Curie noted that it was the 16th anniversary of the launch of the first U.S. piece of the International Space Station, by shuttle Endeavour. That was the beginning of the space station, and today is the dawn of Orion, he said. Orion is aiming for two orbits on this inaugural run. On the second lap around the home planet, the spacecraft should reach a peak altitude of 3,600 miles, high enough to ensure a re-entry speed of 20,000 mph (32,200 kph)and an environment of 4,000 degrees (2,200 Celsius). Splashdown will be in the Pacific off the Mexican Baja coast, where Navy ships already are waiting. NASAs Mission Control in Houston was all set to oversee the entire 4-hour operation once the rocket was in flight. The flight program was loaded into Orions computers well in advance, allowing the spacecraft to fly essentially on autopilot. Flight controllers could intervene in the event of an emergency breakdown. The spacecraft is rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge everything from heat to vibration to radiation. At 11 feet (3.4 meters) tall with a 16.5-foot (5-meter) base, Orion is bigger than the old-time Apollo capsules and, obviously, more advanced. As NASAs program manager Mark Geyer noted, The inside of the capsule is totally different. NASA deliberately kept astronauts off this first Orion. Managers want to test the riskiest parts of the spacecraft  the heat shield, parachutes, various jettisoning components  before committing to a crew. The earliest Orion might carry passengers is 2021; asteroids are on the space agencys radar sometime in the 2020s and Mars, the grand prize, in the 2030s. Lockheed Martin Corp., which is handling the $370 million test flight for NASA, opted for the powerful Delta IV rocket this time around. Future Orion missions will rely on NASAs still-in-development megarocket known as SLS, or Space Launch System. The first Orion-SLS combo launch is targeted for 2018. NASAs last trip beyond low-Earth orbit in a vessel built for people was Apollo 17 in December 1972. Its a thrilling prospect when you think about actually exploring the solar system, space station commander Butch Wilmore said from orbit as the Orion countdown entered its final hour. Who knows where it will take us, who knows where it will go. Well find out as time goes forward, but this first step is a huge one. NASAs new countdown clock got a workout Thursday morning. First a stray boat in the danger zone halted the countdown, then gusty winds held everything up with less than four minutes to go. A new launch time was set nearly an hour later, only to be held up again by winds. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/orion/ Lockheed Martin: http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/ssc/orion-eft1.html",https://apnews.com/nasa-scrubs-orion-launch-will-try-again-friday-6b4bea62e8ae4f7da66a7fa13037bb06,science
A Chinese lunar probe returns to Earth with the worlds first samples from the far side of the moon,"BANGKOK (AP)  Chinas Change 6 probe returned on Earth with rock and soil samples from the little-explored far side of the moon in a global first. The probe landed in the Inner Mongolian region in northern China on Tuesday afternoon.  I now declare that the Change 6 Lunar Exploration Mission achieved complete success, Zhang Kejian, Director of the China National Space Administration, said in a televised news conference after the landing.  Chinese scientists anticipate the returned samples will include 2.5 million-year-old volcanic rock and other material that scientists hope will answer questions about geographic differences on the moons two sides.  The near side is what is seen from Earth, and the far side faces outer space. The far side is also known to have mountains and impact craters, contrasting with the relatively flat expanses visible on the near side. The probe had landed in the moons South Pole-Aitken Basin, an impact crater created more than 4 billion years ago. The samples scientists are expecting will likely come from different layers of the basin, which will bear traces of the different geological events across its long chronology, such as when the moon was younger and had an active inside that could produce volcanic rock.  While past U.S. and Soviet missions have collected samples from the moons near side, the Chinese mission was the first that has collected samples from the far side. 
        
     This is a global first in the sense that its the first time anyone has been able to take off from the far side of the moon and bring back samples, said Richard de Grijs, a professor of astrophysics at Macquarie University in Australia. The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S.  still the leader in space exploration  and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there. Chinas leader Xi Jinping sent a message of congratulations to the Change team, saying that it was a landmark achievement in our countrys efforts at becoming a space and technological power. The probe left earth on May 3, and its journey lasted 53 days. The probe has drilled into the core and scooped rocks from the surface. The samples are expected to answer one of the most fundamental scientific questions in lunar science research: what geologic activity is responsible for the differences between the two sides? said Zongyu Yue, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in a statement issued in the Innovation Monday, a journal published in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. China in recent years has launched multiple successful missions to the moon, collecting samples from the moons near side with the Change 5 probe previously. They are also hoping that the probe will return with material that bear traces of meteorite strikes from the moons past. That material could shed light on the solar systems early days. Theres a theory that the moon acted as a vaccum cleaner of sorts, attracting all the meteorites and debris in the systems earlier era so that they didnt hit Earth, said de Grijs, who is also executive director at the International Space Science Institute  Beijing.  China has said it plans to share the samples with international scientists, although it did not say exactly in which countries.  ___ AP video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/china-far-side-of-moon-probe-samples-c2dd59505402c07f9382bbca14eed4cf,science
NASA taps Elon Musks SpaceX to bring International Space Station out of orbit in a few more years,"WASHINGTON (AP)  NASA has awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to build the vehicle that will bring the International Space Station out of its longtime orbit of Earth when its operating lifespan ends in a few more years. SpaceX, a privately held company controlled by technology mogul Elon Musk, will build the vehicle that will bring down the space station, but NASA will still oversee the eventual mission.  The International Space Station, launched in 1998, is expected to be needed to be brought out of orbit by 2030. The station is operated by space agencies from the U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada and Russia. All the countries involved have pledged to operate the station until 2030 except Russia, which has only committed to participate until 2028. Crews of astronauts have been occupying the space station since 2000. The orbital laboratory remains a blueprint for science, exploration, and partnerships in space for the benefit of all, said Ken Bowersox, NASAs associate administrator for space operations mission directorate.  The contract is another vote of confidence in the technological prowess of SpaceX, a rocket maker based in Hawthorne, California, that Musk founded in 2002 to explore new frontiers in space. Musk, 52, then became the driving force behind in Tesla, the electric car maker that accounts for most of his estimated fortune of $220 billion.",https://apnews.com/article/nasa-spacex-contract-international-space-station-339c0b8313073fdf4d9fe22056f3d51c,science
"SpaceX launch of observatory, landing test off until Tuesday","CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  A deep-space observatory has to wait yet another day before flying. SpaceX called off Sunday evenings launch attempt because of trouble with the Air Force rocket-tracking radar. The company targeted Monday, but decided to wait until Tuesday for better weather. That gives SpaceX time to replace a video transmitter on the first-stage booster of the Falcon 9 rocket. Following liftoff, the leftover booster is supposed to flip around and aim for a platform floating off the Florida coast. The landing test has been tried once before, without success. Former Vice President Al Gore was present for Sundays try. Gore came up with the idea for a spacecraft that constantly observes Earth back in the 1990s, but the program was canceled and the satellite shelved. The Deep Space Climate Observatory is a refurbished version through the combined effort of NASA, the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration, or NOAA, and the Air Force. Gore noted the launch delay on Twitter, and quipped, After 17 years, thats nothing. The $340 million mission dubbed DSCOVR (pronounced discover) involves sending the observatory to a point 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth, and 92 million miles (148 million kilometers) from the sun, where the gravity field is stabilized. From there, the spacecraft will monitor solar outbursts and provide advance warnings to protect orbiting craft, airplanes and power stations from incoming geomagnetic storms. That position also will allow the observatory to continuously view the sunlit portion of Earth in its entirety. A steady stream of images will be available online to the public. 
        
     SpaceX has a platform stationed 370 miles (nearly 600 kilometers) offshore that will serve as the landing pad for the fly-back booster. The barge had to be repaired after the first touchdown attempt, on Jan. 10, ended in a fireball. SpaceX chief Elon Musk wants to eventually refurbish and reuse his companys rockets to save money and time. The California-based company has a contract with NASA to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and, in another couple years, astronauts as well. ___ Online: NOAA: http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/DSCOVR/ SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/spacex-launch-of-observatory-landing-test-off-until-tuesday-e08df239446f45b3b24d3c56923d3125,science
"High wind scraps SpaceX observatory launch, rocket landing","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Dangerously high winds kept a deep-space observatory grounded Tuesday and put off a radically new landing test of the booster rocket. SpaceX called off its sunset launch with just 12 minutes remaining in the countdown because of gusts of 115 mph several miles up  strong enough to damage the rocket in flight. It was the private companys second attempt in three days to launch the spacecraft first envisioned by former Vice President Al Gore and resuscitated by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Air Force. Last-minute radar trouble foiled Sundays launch effort, then SpaceX skipped Monday because of heavy rain. Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral, SpaceXs founder and chief executive Elon Musk warned via Twitter a few hours before Tuesdays try. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes. It didnt, and SpaceX decided it was too risky to fly. SpaceX must launch the observatory by Wednesday or face a delay until Feb. 20. The moon  lunar gravity to be more precise  would be in the way of the spacecraft during that eight-day blackout. Excellent weather was forecast for Wednesdays 6:03 p.m. try. Also on tap will be a bid by SpaceX to land its leftover first-stage booster on an ocean platform. Last months inaugural test ended in flames after the launch of a supply run to the International Space Station.

SpaceX added extra hydraulic fluid for this second test, intended to demonstrate money-saving rocket reusability. But company officials warned the booster would be coming in faster this time from about 80 miles up, making it harder to nail the vertical touchdown. The odds of success remained no better than 50-50, officials said. Musk intends to land boosters back on firm soil, once the operation is perfected. On Tuesday, officials at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station announced that SpaceX will lease a launch complex once used to shoot off Atlas missiles, and convert it into its first-ever booster-landing pad.

"High wind scraps SpaceX observatory launch, rocket landing","CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  Dangerously high winds kept a deep-space observatory grounded Tuesday and put off a radically new landing test of the booster rocket. SpaceX called off its sunset launch with just 12 minutes remaining in the countdown because of gusts of 115 mph (185 kph) several miles up  strong enough to damage the rocket in flight. It was the private companys second attempt in three days to launch the spacecraft first envisioned by former Vice President Al Gore and resuscitated by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Air Force. Last-minute radar trouble foiled Sundays launch effort, then SpaceX skipped Monday because of heavy rain. Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral, SpaceXs founder and chief executive Elon Musk warned via Twitter a few hours before Tuesdays try. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes. It didnt, and SpaceX decided it was too risky to fly. SpaceX must launch the observatory by Wednesday or face a delay until Feb. 20. The moon  lunar gravity to be more precise  would be in the way of the spacecraft during that eight-day blackout. Excellent weather was forecast for Wednesdays 6:03 p.m. try. Also on tap will be a bid by SpaceX to land its leftover first-stage booster on an ocean platform. Last months inaugural test ended in flames after the launch of a supply run to the International Space Station.

NASA delays space station spacewalk because of suit issue,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  A series of upcoming spacewalks at the International Space Station will begin a day late. The first spacewalk by a pair of U.S. astronauts was supposed to occur Friday. But on Thursday, NASA bumped it to Saturday to complete a spacesuit investigation. The second spacewalk is now Wednesday; the third is March 1. The extensive, outdoor cable-routing work will prepare for the arrival of new commercial crew capsules in 2017. Two critical fan and pump units for the astronauts spacesuits failed recently during routine maintenance in orbit. Engineers suspect water seeped into the bearings, causing them to corrode and seize up. Both units were returned to Earth on the Dragon capsule last week. The spacesuits that will be used for the spacewalks have check out fine. NASA says a pump failure would cut short a spacewalk, but not endanger anyone. An unrelated problem with the same component led to an astronauts near-drowning in 2013. Kenny Todd, a space station manager, said earlier this week that the corrosion is likely the result of frequent water sampling put in place after the 2013 episode. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts are the designated spacewalkers. The space agency would like to pull off all three spacewalks before Wilmore leaves the orbiting lab in mid-March. Private companies SpaceX and Boeing are working on crew capsules  under NASA contract  to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. NASA lost the ability to launch its own crews when the space shuttles retired in 2011, and is paying Russia for crew transportation. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/nasa-delays-space-station-spacewalk-because-of-suit-issue-4e74d257d2b34f9a8a5db727841cc592,science
Spacewalking astronauts turn cable guys in 1st of 3 jobs,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts routed more than 300 feet of cable outside the International Space Station on Saturday, tricky and tiring advance work for the arrival of new American-made crew capsules. It was the first of three spacewalks planned for NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts over the coming week. Altogether, Wilmore and Virts have 764 feet of cable to run outside the space station. They got off to a strong start Saturday, rigging eight power and data lines, or about 340 feet. Broadening my resume, Virts observed. NASA considers this the most complicated cable-routing job in the 16-year history of the space station. Equally difficult will be running cable on the inside of the complex. The extensive rewiring is needed to prepare for NASAs next phase 260 miles up: the 2017 arrival of the first commercial spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the orbiting lab. NASA is paying Boeing and SpaceX to build the capsules and fly them from Cape Canaveral, which hasnt seen a manned launch since the shuttles retired in 2011. Instead, Russia is doing all the taxi work  for a steep price. The first of two docking ports for the Boeing and SpaceX vessels  still under development  is due to arrive in June. Even more spacewalks will be needed to set everything up. There were so many cables that NASA color-coded them. That helped the spacewalkers only so much; they expected a lighter blue for one of the lines. 
        
     I worked up a lather on that one, Wilmore informed Mission Control. After successfully attaching the first four cables, he added, Ive got to cool down. Mission Control left two cables  or about 24 feet worth  for the next spacewalk coming up Wednesday. Four hundred feet of additional cable will be installed March 1 on spacewalk No. 3. Weve got a lot of work still, Mission Control said as Saturdays 6 -hour spacewalk drew to a close. We want to make sure we look after your health and get you back inside now, so were going to claim victory here. It was the first spacewalk for Virts, who arrived at the space station in late November. He savored the moment as he floated out high above the South Pacific. Pretty cool, he said. Spacesuit concerns stalled the work by a day. NASA wanted to make certain that the suits worn by Wilmore and Virts had reliable fan and pump assemblies. Two other fan-pump units failed aboard the space station in recent months and were returned to Earth earlier this month for analysis. Corrosion was discovered, the result of water intrusion from testing. Their suits appeared to work fine Saturday. I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for their hard work and diligence, Wilmore, the stations commander, said once he was safely back inside. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/general-news-1d1a46522b054fb69fb03e6a4778a126,science
"After 2nd spacewalk, astronaut reports water in helmet","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts breezed through a lube and cable job outside the International Space Station. But afterward, one of the men reported water in his helmet, scarily reminiscent of a near-drowning in orbit two years ago. Astronaut Terry Virts reported the water while he waited in the air lock for Wednesdays spacewalk to formally conclude. The amount of water increased slightly, but he appeared to be in no immediate danger, said Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, who helped to remove his suit. In 2013, another Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk. The water escaped from his suits cooling system.

NASA approves Sunday spacewalk despite water leak in helmet,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  American astronauts will venture back out for a spacewalk this weekend, despite a helmet water leak on their previous trip outside the International Space Station. NASA on Friday cleared astronaut Terry Virts spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks to install cable. Mission managers believe they understand the quirks with this older suit and insist it is safe to use for Sundays spacewalk. In 2013, another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. On Wednesday, the amount of water seepage in Virts helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when Virts was already inside. Theyre very different occurrences, said Alex Kanelakos, a spacewalk officer in Mission Control. Kanelakos said the latest leak was the result of condensation that occurred during the air lock repressurization. There have been seven other similar instances on this particular suit, he said. Its a known feature, Kanelakos said during a NASA broadcast Friday. Virts estimated the amount of water in his helmet Wednesday at one-half of an ounce. That did not include the water that moistened the absorbent pad at the back of his head, or that might have escaped when his helmet was removed. As much as 2 ounces of water could condense like this and get into the helmet without causing a problem, Kanelakos said. Astronaut Butch Wilmores suit  which is new  functioned perfectly. 
        
     Virts and Wilmore are in the process of routing hundreds of feet of cable, needed before the arrival of new docking ports later this year that will be used by crew capsules still under development by Boeing and SpaceX. NASA expects these commercial capsules to start ferrying station astronauts in 2017. During Sundays spacewalk, the astronauts will install another 400 feet of cable as well as two antennas. About 364 feet of power and data lines were laid during the first two spacewalks, last Saturday and Wednesday. Kanelakos noted that this series of complicated spacewalks is the most that weve ever done in a row since space shuttle. NASA wants to wrap up the work as soon as possible; thats because Wilmores 5 -month mission ends March 11. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-39d96acec0824c0593fa6fd1bd10528a,science

It was the third spacewalk in just over a week for Americans Terry Virts and Butch Wilmore, and the quickest succession of spacewalks since NASAs former shuttle days. The advance work was needed for the manned spacecraft under development by Boeing and SpaceX. A pair of docking ports will fly up later this year, followed by the capsules themselves, with astronauts aboard, in 2017. Once safely back inside, Virts reported a bit of water in his helmet again for the second time in as many spacewalks. He stressed it was not a big deal and said there was no need to hurry out of his suit. Virts and Wilmore installed two sets of antennas Sunday, as well as 400 feet of cable for this new communication system. They unreeled 364 feet of cable on Feb. 21 and last Wednesday. It was complicated, hand-intensive work, yet the astronauts managed to wrap up more than an hour early Sunday, for a 5 -hour spacewalk. Their three outings spanned 19 hours.

On Sunday  just like Wednesday  a little water got into Virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurized. Virts said it seemed to be about the same amount of water, maybe slightly more, but dried quickly. He didnt need any towels this time when his helmet came off. I couldnt feel it on my skin. I could just see the thin film on the visor, he told Mission Control. Engineers concluded last week it was the result of condensation during the repressurization of the air lock, and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit. Virts was never in danger either day, according to NASA, and no water leaked into his helmet while he was outdoors. Wilmores much newer suit functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks, but on Sunday morning, a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out.

NASA launches 4 spacecraft to solve magnetic mystery,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA launched four identical spacecraft Thursday on a billion-dollar mission to study the explosive give-and-take of the Earth and suns magnetic fields. The unmanned Atlas rocket  and NASAs Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft  soared into a clear late-night sky, right on time. Within two hours, all four observatories were flying free. Just picture-perfect, launch manager Omar Baez said early Friday. Everybodys cheering. ... Cant ask for any more. The quartet of observatories is being placed into an oblong orbit stretching tens of thousands of miles into the magnetosphere  nearly halfway to the moon at one point. They will fly in pyramid formation, between 6 miles and 250 miles apart, to provide 3-D views of magnetic reconnection on the smallest of scales. Magnetic reconnection is what happens when magnetic fields like those around Earth and the sun come together, break apart, then come together again, releasing vast energy. This repeated process drives the aurora, as well as solar storms that can disrupt communications and power on Earth. Data from this two-year mission should help scientists better understand so-called space weather. Each observatory resembles a giant octagonal wheel, stretching more than 11 feet across and 4 feet high, and weighing 3,000 pounds apiece. Numbered and stacked like tires on top of the rocket for launch, No. 4 popped free first more than an hour after liftoff, followed every five minutes by another. Theyre all healthy and turned on. Essentially, were all green and headed into our mission, said NASA project manager Craig Tooley. 
        
     Once the long, sensor-laden booms are extended in a few days, each spacecraft could span a baseball field. Principal investigator Jim Burch from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio said measurements will be made down to the electron scale, significantly smaller than previous heliophysics missions. In all, there are 100 science sensors. Primary science-gathering will begin this summer, following a five-month checkout. The findings from the $1.1 billion mission will be useful in understanding magnetic reconnection throughout the universe. Closer to home, space weather scientists along with everyone on Earth hopefully will benefit. Were not setting out here to solve space weather, Burch said. Were setting out to learn the fundamental features of magnetic reconnection because thats what drives space weather. ___ Online: NASA: http://mms.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html Southwest Research Institute: http://www.swri.org",https://apnews.com/md-state-wire-tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-59f7e3e3fd2b46348c09b53abd1df934,science
"1-year space crewmen will miss weather, nature while gone","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The American astronaut and Russian cosmonaut about to embark on a one-year flight are similar in many ways: born in the 1960s, fathers of daughters, military backgrounds. But there are differences, too. Scott Kelley, a divorced dad of two, still has a school-age daughter. Mikhail Kornienko is married to an OB-GYN, his daughter is grown, and hes a new grandfather. Kelly and Kornienko leave the world behind this week for a year at the International Space Station. Theyve lived there before, although for only half that long and at separate times. More on the crewmates: Scott Kelly This will be the fourth spaceflight for Kelly, 51, a former NASA shuttle commander and Navy test pilot whose identical twin brother, Mark, also was chosen as an astronaut in 1996. The two will conduct many of the same medical experiments over the coming year so scientists can compare the results. Scott Kellys first two flights were aboard shuttles. He spent more than five months on the space station in 2010-2011. It was during that mission that his sister-in-law, then Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, nearly died after being shot in the head in Tucson, Arizona. Once hes back home in Houston, Kelly imagines it will be hard to walk away from spaceflight. Hed love to pilot one of the new U.S. spacecraft in development. But he figures if he cuts in front of other astronauts awaiting assignments, someone will run me over with their car. 
        
     What will Kelly miss the most, besides his loved ones? The weather. It never changes on the space station, he said. Even though its a pretty nice environment, I guess its like living in Southern California, people get sick of it ... after a while. ___ Mikhail Kornienko It will be the second space mission for Kornienko, 54, a former paratrooper whose helicopter-pilot father was part of the search and rescue team for the first Soviet cosmonauts back in the 1960s.

"Flying objects and shrunken heads: World UFO Day feted amid surge in sightings, government denials","NORFOLK, Va. (AP)  For those of you who dont celebrate World UFO Day, consider this:  A former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer told Congress last summer about a government program that retrieves and reverse engineers unidentified flying objects. The Mexican Congress held an unprecedented session in September during which supposed mummies were presented as nonhuman beings that are not part of our terrestrial evolution.  And NASA now has a director of research for unidentified flying objects, or what it calls unidentified anomalous phenomena. Never mind that the Pentagon denied the former intelligence officers claims; that Mexican researchers said the mummies made no sense; and that a NASA study found no evidence of extraterrestrials.  Theres still never been a better time to mark World UFO Day.  A look at the history of World UFO Day: 
        
     World UFO Day has its roots in the so-called Roswell Incident on July 2, 1947. On that date, something crashed at what was then the J.B. Foster ranch in New Mexico. There were reports that the U.S. military had recovered a flying disc. But officials later said the debris was merely the remnants of a high-altitude weather balloon. The Air Force investigated the incident in 1994 amid charges that it was covering up the truth. It concluded that the supposed alien spacecraft was likely a secret Army Air Force balloon designed to monitor Soviet nuclear testing. The material found near Roswell consisted of foil-wrapped fabric, wooden sticks, rubber pieces, and small I-beams with strange markings on them. A local newspaper headline described the find dramatically and unequivocally: Air Force Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch. The Air Force research did not locate or develop any information that the Roswell Incident was a UFO event, wrote Col. Richard Weaver, author of the report. The Air Force released another report addressing UFO claims in 1997, stating that alleged alien bodies found near Roswell were just dummies used in parachute tests. Some UFO researchers pushed back against that explanation, noting that such dummies werent used until 10 years after the Roswell Incident. And they said it would be a stretch for people who claimed to see alien bodies to mix up their dates so badly.  The life-size dummies were used in high-altitude parachute drops from 1954 to 1959. The majority landed outside the confines of military bases in eastern New Mexico, near Roswell, according to the Air Force report. The dummies had a skeleton of aluminum or steel, skin of latex or plastic, a cast aluminum skull, and an instrument cavity in the torso and head. The Air Force said the existence of such dummies was not widely known outside of scientific circles and easily could have been mistaken for something they were not. In 2022, Congress held its first hearing on UFOs in half a century as the Pentagon investigated hundreds of unexplained sightings in the sky. The spotted objects appeared to be aircraft flying without any discernible means of propulsion. They have been reported near military bases and coastlines, raising the prospect that what witnesses actually spotted was secret Chinese or Russian technology.  A 2021 government report reviewed 144 sightings of aircraft or other devices that were apparently flying at mysterious speeds or trajectories. It found no extraterrestrial links but drew few other conclusions and called for better data collection. Lawmakers from both parties have said the UFOs are a national security concern. But the sightings are usually fleeting. Some appear for no more than an instant on camera  and then sometimes end up distorted by the camera lens.  Ronald Moultrie, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, said during a 2022 hearing that the Pentagon was trying to destigmatize the issue and encourage pilots and other military personnel to report anything unusual they see. Then things got a little strange last year.  During a congressional hearing in late July, retired Air Force Maj. David Grusch testified that the U.S. is concealing a longstanding program that retrieves and reverse engineers unidentified flying objects.  Asked whether the U.S. government had information about extraterrestrial life, Grusch said the U.S. likely has been aware of nonhuman activity since the 1930s.  The Pentagon denied Gruschs claims of a cover-up and denied the existence of any such program.  Unlike the hearings in the U.S., the testimony before lawmakers in the Mexican Congress included alleged evidence of aliens.  During an unprecedented session in September, Mexican journalist Jos Jaime Maussan presented two boxes containing shriveled bodies with shrunken, warped heads  supposed mummies found in Peru. Its the queen of all evidence, Maussan claimed. That is, if the DNA is showing us that they are nonhuman beings and that there is nothing that looks like this in the world, we should take it as such. The apparently desiccated bodies date back to 2017 and were found deep underground in the sandy Peruvian coastal desert of Nazca. Most attribute the famous Nazca Lines to ancient Indigenous communities.  Julieta Fierro, researcher at the Institute of Astronomy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, was among those to express skepticism, saying that many details about the figures made no sense. She noted that scientists would need more advanced technology than the X-rays they claimed to use to determine if the allegedly calcified bodies were nonhuman. At another hearing in November, Maussan made the case again, citing a nonhuman that did not have lungs or ribs. The Pentagon released a study in March that had examined the many UFO sightings over nearly the past century and found no evidence of aliens or extraterrestrial intelligence.  The report analyzed U.S. government investigations since 1945. It also found no evidence that the U.S. or private companies had reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology. The Pentagons report arrived about six months after NASA released a report on UFOs, which also found no evidence of extraterrestrials.  But NASA Administrator Bill Nelson did acknowledge that another Earth-like planet could exist within the billions of galaxies in the universe. If you ask me, do I believe theres life in a universe that is so vast that its hard for me to comprehend how big it is? My personal answer is yes, Nelson said at a news conference. When pressed by reporters on whether the U.S. or other governments are hiding aliens or otherworldly spaceships, Nelson said: Show me the evidence.",https://apnews.com/article/world-ufo-day-aliens-july-2-roswell-1ab567d13e17afee7577139b58f600cf,science
Crew of NASAs earthbound simulated Mars habitat emerge after a year,"The crew of a NASA mission to Mars emerged from their craft after a yearlong voyage that never left Earth. The four volunteer crew members spent more than 12 months inside NASAs first simulated Mars environment at Johnson Space Center in Houston, coming out of the artificial alien enviroment Saturday around 5 p.m. Kelly Haston, Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell and Nathan Jones entered the 3D-printed habitat on June 25, 2023, as the maiden crew of the space agencys Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog project. Haston, the mission commander, began with a simple, Hello. Its actually just so wonderful to be able to say hello to you all, she said.  Jones, a physician and the mission medical officer, said their 378 days in confinement went by quickly. The quartet lived and worked inside the space of 1,700 square feet (157 square meters) to simulate a mission to the red planet, the fourth from the sun and a frequent focus of discussion among scientists and sci-fi fans alike concerning a possible voyage taking humans beyond our moon. The first CHAPEA crew focused on establishing possible conditions for future Mars operations through simulated spacewalks, dubbed Marswalks, as well as growing and harvesting vegetables to supplement their provisions and maintaining the habitat and their equipment.  They also worked through challenges a real Mars crew would be expected to experience including limited resources, isolation and delays in communication of up to 22 minutes with their home planet on the other side of the habitats walls, NASA said. 
        
     Two additional CHAPEA missions are planned and crews will continue conducting simulated spacewalks and gathering data on factors related to physical and behavioral health and performance, NASA said. Steve Koerner, deputy director of Johnson Space Center, said most of the first crews experimentation focused on nutrition and how that affected their performance. The work was crucial science as we prepare to send people on to the red planet, he said. Theyve been separated from their families, placed on a carefully prescribed meal plan and undergone a lot of observation, Koerner said.  Mars is our goal, he said, calling the project an important step in Americas intent to be a leader in the global space exploration effort. Emerging after a knock on the habitats door by Kjell Lindgren, an astronaut and the deputy director of flight operations, the four volunteers spoke of the gratitude they had for each other and those who waited patiently outside, as well as lessons learned about a prospective manned mission to Mars and life on Earth. Brockwell, the crews flight engineer, said the mission showed him the importance of living sustainably for the benefit of everyone on Earth. Im very grateful to have had this incredible opportunity to live for a year within the spirit of planetary adventure towards an exciting future, and Im grateful for the chance to live the idea that we must utilise resources no faster than they can be replenished and produce waste no faster than they can be processed back into resources, Brockwell said.  We cannot live, dream, create or explore on any significant timeframe if we dont live these principles, but if we do, we can achieve and sustain amazing and inspiring things like exploring other worlds, he said. Science officer Anca Selariu said she had been asked many times why there is a fixation on Mars. Why go to Mars? Because its possible, she said. Because space can unite and bring out the best in us. Because its one defining step that Earthlings will take to light the way into the next centuries. ____ This story has been updated to correct that the crew members lived in 1,700 square feet of space, not 17,000.",https://apnews.com/article/nasa-simulated-mars-habitat-exit-7fd7d511ca22016793d504b1a47f97ee,science
"Pluto up close: Spacecraft achieves flyby, then calls home","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs New Horizons spacecraft got humanitys first up-close look at Pluto on Tuesday, sending word of its triumph across 3 billion miles to scientists waiting breathlessly back home. Confirmation of mission success came 13 hours after the actual flyby and, after a day of both jubilation and tension, allowed the New Horizons team to finally celebrate in full force. This is a tremendous moment in human history, John Grunsfeld, NASAs science mission chief, said at a news conference. Principal scientist Alan Stern asked the entire New Horizons team in the audience to stand: We did it! Take a bow! The unprecedented encounter was the last stop on NASAs grand tour of our solar-systems planets over the past half-century. The journey began 9 years ago, back when Pluto was still considered a full-fledged planet. Tuesday morning, a cheering, flag-waving celebration swept over the mission operations center in Maryland at the time of closest approach. But until New Horizons phoned home Tuesday night, there was no guarantee the spacecraft had buzzed the small, icy, faraway  but no longer unknown  world. NASA said the spacecraft  the size of a baby grand piano  swept to within 7,700 miles of Pluto at 31,000 mph. It was programmed to then go past the dwarf planet and begin studying its far side. To commemorate the moment of closest approach, scientists released the best picture yet of Pluto, taken on the eve of the flyby. 
        
     Even better images will start raining down on Earth beginning Wednesday, promised principal scientist Alan Stern. But he had cautioned everyone to stay tuned until New Horizons contacted home. It takes 4 hours for signals to travel one-way between New Horizons and Earth. The message went out late in the afternoon during a brief break in the spacecrafts data-gathering frenzy. The New Horizons team kept up a confirmation countdown, noting via Twitter when the signal should have passed the halfway point, then Jupiters orbit. The uncertainty added to the drama. This is true exploration, cautioned Stern, a Southwest Research Institute planetary scientist. Among the possible dangers: cosmic debris that could destroy the mission. But with the chances of a problem considered extremely low, scientists and hundreds of others assembled at Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory erupted in jubilation when the moment of closest approach occurred at 7:49 a.m. EDT. The lab is the spacecrafts developer and manager. The scene repeated itself a little before 9 p.m. EDT. This time, the flight control room was packed compared with earlier, when it was empty because New Horizons was out of touch and operating on autopilot. We have a healthy spacecraft, announced mission operations director Alice Bowman. She was drowned out by cheers and applause; Stern ran over to give her a hug. Later, Grunsfeld told reporters, The spacecraft is full of images. We cant wait. Weve opened up a new realm of the solar system. Added NASA Administrator Charles Bolden: What a phenomenal day. Joining in the daylong hoopla were the two children of the American astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930, Clyde Tombaugh. (Some of his ashes are aboard the spacecraft.) Other celestial-minded VIPs included James Christy, discoverer of Plutos big moon Charon, and Sylvia Kuiper des Tombe, daughter of Dutch-American Gerard Kuiper for whom the mysterious zone surrounding Pluto is named. Some Pluto Children  born Jan. 19, 2006, the very day New Horizons departed Earth  also were in the audience. Throughout the day  coincidentally the 50th anniversary of the first close-up pictures of Mars from Mariner 4  the White House and Congress offered congratulations, and physicist Stephen Hawking was among the scientists weighing in. President Barack Obama sent his best Tuesday night with a tweet: Pluto just had its first visitor! Hey, people of the world! Are you paying attention? planetary scientist Carolyn Porco, part of the New Horizons imaging team, said on Twitter. We have reached Pluto. We are exploring the hinterlands of the solar system. Rejoice! The U.S. is now the only nation to visit every planet in the solar system. Pluto was No. 9 in the lineup when New Horizons left Cape Canaveral, Florida, but was demoted seven months later to dwarf status. Scientists in charge of the $720 million mission hope the new observations will restore Plutos honor. Stern and other so-called plutophiles posed for the cameras giving nine-fingers-up Pluto Salute. And in a nod to that other Pluto, a team member carried a yellow stuffed dog on her shoulder Tuesday night. The picture of Pluto taken Monday showed a frozen, pockmarked world, peach-colored with a heart-shaped bright spot and darker areas around the equator. It drew oohs and aahs. To see Pluto be revealed just before our eyes, its just fantastic, said Bowman. The Hubble Space Telescope had offered up the best pre-New Horizons pictures of Pluto, but they were essentially pixelated blobs of light. Flight controllers held off on having New Horizons send back flyby photos until well after the maneuver was complete; they wanted the seven science instruments to take full advantage of the encounter. After turning toward Earth to send down a snippet of engineering data acknowledging everything was fine, the spacecraft was going to get right back to science work. New Horizons is also expected to beam back photos of Plutos big moon, Charon, and observe its four little moons. It will take until late 2016 for all the data to reach Earth. New Horizons already has confirmed that Pluto is, indeed, the King of the Kuiper Belt. New measurements it made show that Pluto is 1,473 miles in diameter, or about 50 miles bigger than estimated. Thats still puny by solar-system standards. Pluto is just two-thirds the size of Earths moon. But it is big enough to be the largest object in the Kuiper Belt, a zone rife with comets and tens of thousands of other small bodies. Stern and his colleagues wasted no time pressing the U.S. Postal Service for a new stamp of Pluto. The last one, issued in 1991, consisted of an artists rendering of the faraway world and the words: Pluto Not Yet Explored. The words not yet were crossed out in a poster held high Tuesday for the cameras. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/ Johns Hopkins University: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu",https://apnews.com/pluto-up-close-spacecraft-achieves-flyby-then-calls-home-750ae529c6fa4e188e3c29b6f66f7012,science
"Blowing my mind': Peaks on Pluto, canyons on Charon","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Mankinds first close-up look at Pluto did not disappoint Wednesday: The pictures showed ice mountains on Pluto about as high as the Rockies and chasms on its big moon Charon that appear six times deeper than the Grand Canyon. Especially astonishing to scientists was the total absence of impact craters in a zoom-in shot of one otherwise rugged slice of Pluto. That suggests that Pluto is not the dead ice ball many people think, but is instead geologically active even now, its surface sculpted not by collisions with cosmic debris but by its internal heat, the scientific team reported. Breathtaking in their clarity, the long-awaited images were unveiled in Laurel, Maryland, home to mission operations for NASAs New Horizons, the unmanned spacecraft that paid a history-making flyby visit to the dwarf planet on Tuesday after a journey of 9 years and 3 billion miles. I dont think any one of us could have imagined that it was this good of a toy store, principal scientist Alan Stern said at a news conference. He marveled: I think the whole system is amazing. ... The Pluto system IS something wonderful. As a tribute to Plutos discoverer, Stern and his team named the bright heart-shaped area on the surface of Pluto the Tombaugh Reggio. American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh spied the frozen, faraway world on the edge of the solar system in 1930. 
        
     Thanks to New Horizons, scientists now know Pluto is a bit bigger than thought, with a diameter of 1,473 miles, but still just two-thirds the size of Earths moon. And it is most certainly not frozen in time. The zoom-in of Pluto, showing an approximately 150-mile swath of the dwarf planet, reveals a mountain range about 11,000 feet high and tens of miles wide. Scientists said the peaks  seemingly pushed up from Plutos subterranean bed of ice  appeared to be a mere 100 million years old. Pluto itself is 4.5 billion years old. Who would have supposed that there were ice mountains? project scientist Hal Weaver said. Its just blowing my mind. John Spencer, like Stern a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute, called it just astonishing that the first close-up picture of Pluto didnt have a single impact crater. Stern said the findings suggesting a geologically active interior are going to send a lot of geophysicists back to the drawing boards. It could be a game-changer in how scientists look at other frozen worlds in the Kuiper Belt on the fringes of our solar system, Spencer said. Charon, too, has a surprisingly youthful look and could be undergoing geologic activity. Weve tended to think of these midsize worlds ... as probably candy-coated lumps of ice, Spencer said. This means they could be equally diverse and be equally amazing if we ever get a spacecraft out there to see them close up. The heat that appears to be shaping Pluto may be coming from the decay of radioactive material normally found in planetary bodies, the scientists said. Or it could be coming from energy released by the gradual freezing of an underground ocean. As for Charon, which is about half the size of Pluto, its canyons look to be 3 miles to 6 miles deep and are part of a cluster of troughs and cliffs stretching 600 miles, or about twice the length of the Grand Canyon, scientists said. The Charon photo was taken Monday. The Pluto picture was shot just 1 hours before the spacecrafts moment of closest approach. New Horizons swept to within 7,700 miles of Pluto during its flyby. It is now 1 million miles beyond it. Up until this week, the best pictures of Pluto were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and they were blurry, pixelated images. Scientists promised even better pictures for the next news briefing on Friday.

Space station astronauts take shelter from space junk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A piece of space junk forced the three space station astronauts to seek emergency shelter Thursday. For nearly an hour, the American and two Russians hunkered down in their Soyuz capsule, which is docked to the International Space Station, in case they had to make a quick getaway. The fragment from an old Russian weather satellite ended up passing harmlessly, about 1 miles away. Happy there was no impact, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly said via Twitter. Great coordination with international ground teams. Excellent training. Its only the fourth time in the 16-year history of the space station that a crew has had to rush into a Russian Soyuz for protection from potentially dangerous debris. The exact size of the object was unknown, according to a NASA spokesman. Normally, NASA learns about incoming junk sooner, and the space station moves out of the way. But there wasnt time for that Thursday; the crew was notified just 1 hours in advance. The three men were already up and working when Mission Control ordered them into the Soyuz on Thursday morning. They did not need to put on their Soyuz flight suits, and there was no rush, said NASA spokesman Dan Huot. The all-clear came 1 hours after the initial alert, around 8 a.m. EDT. It took the astronauts more than an hour to get their 250-mile-high home back to normal operation, following the shelter in place, as NASA calls it. Research work that was interrupted will be rescheduled, according to Mission Control. 
        
     Kelly and his Russia roommates, Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka, are getting used to junk in their neighborhood. Twice since the trio arrived in March, the space station has had to dodge pieces of orbiting debris, in April and June. Three more men are due to arrive next week. The last time a station crew had to jump into their Soyuz for protection was in 2012. Space junk is at an all-time high because of all the clutter in orbit, the result of accidentally colliding spacecraft, exploding satellites and rocket stages, and deliberate run-ins ordered up as tests by China and the United States several years back. Just last February, a U.S. military meteorological satellite blew up, presumably because of a failed battery, scattering dozens of pieces of debris. The Defense Department is currently tracking about 22,000 dead satellites, spent rocket bodies and all other forms of orbital debris. These items are at least 4 inches across. NASA estimates there could be more than 500,000 smaller objects, nearly a half-inch and bigger, that could pack a dangerous punch to an orbiting craft like the space station, given the high orbital speed of 17,500 mph. Satellite makers now try to make their spacecraft as non-breakable as possible. Kelly and Kornienko are four months into a one-year space station mission. It will be a record for NASA, but not for the Russians, who have a history of long space flights. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/news/orbital_debris.html",https://apnews.com/tx-state-wire-fl-state-wire-dec1aaa93c034d61ad7941902ac9045c,science
Conditions on Pluto: Incredibly hazy with flowing ice,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Pluto is hazier than scientists expected and appears to be covered with flowing ice. The team responsible for the New Horizons flyby of Pluto last week released new pictures Friday of the previously unexplored world on the edge of the solar system. If youre seeing a cardiologist, you may want to leave the room, principal scientist Alan Stern teased at the opening of the news conference at NASA headquarters. There are some pretty mind-blowing discoveries. NASAs New Horizons spacecraft, now 7.5 million miles beyond Pluto, has detected layers of haze stretching 100 miles (160 kilometers) into the atmosphere, much higher than anticipated. All this haze is believed to account for the dwarf planets reddish color. If you were standing on Pluto and looking up, you probably wouldnt notice the haze, said George Mason Universitys Michael Summers. In fact, New Horizons had to wait until after its closest approach on July 14, so the sun would silhouette Pluto and the atmosphere could be measured by means of the scattered sunlight. As for the ice flows, they appear to be relatively recent: no more than a few tens of millions of years, according to William McKinnon of Washington University in St. Louis. That compares with the 4.5 billion-year age of Pluto and the rest of the solar system. To see evidence of such recent activity, he said, is simply a dream come true. 
        
     Temperatures on Pluto are minus 380 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 229 degrees Celsius), and so water ice would not move anywhere in such extreme cold. But McKinnon said the nitrogen and other ices believed to be on Pluto would be geologically soft and therefore able to flow like glaciers on Earth. Some of that plutonian ice seems to have emptied into impact craters, creating ponds of frozen nitrogen. One of those semi-filled craters is about the size of metropolitan Washington D.C., McKinnon said. These latest findings support the theory that an underground ocean might exist deep beneath Plutos icy crust, McKinnon said. These ice flows  which might still be active  are found on Plutos vast icy plain, now called Sputnik Planum after Earths first man-made satellite. The plain is about the size of Texas and occupies the left side of Plutos bright heart-shaped feature, named Tombaugh Regio after the late astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930, Clyde Tombaugh. Its evident now that the two lobes of the heart are quite different; Stern speculated that nitrogen snow could possibly be blowing from the brighter left, or western, side to the right. One of Plutos newly discovered mountain ranges now bears the name of Sir Edmund Hillary, who along with Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay conquered Mount Everest in 1953. The New Horizons team already had named another series of mountains after Norgay. The spacecraft traveled 3 billion miles over 9 years to get the first close-up look of Pluto. The New Horizons team stressed that most of the collected data are still aboard the spacecraft and will take more than a year to obtain. Over the next several weeks, much of the incoming transmissions will consist of engineering or other technical data  and only a few images. But starting in mid-September, the spigot opens again, promised Stern, a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute. From then until fall 2016, The sky will be raining presents with data from the Pluto system. Its going to be quite a ride. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/ Johns Hopkins University: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/",https://apnews.com/conditions-on-pluto-incredibly-hazy-with-flowing-ice-be83a0860bd2467cbddb2ae72df5e09d,science

As such, there are no pictures in the Forever Remembered exhibit of Challenger breaking apart in the Florida sky nearly 30 years ago or Columbia debris raining down on Texas 12 years ago. Since the tragic re-entry, Columbias scorched remains have been stashed in off-limits offices at the space center. But NASA had to pry open the underground tomb housing Challengers pieces  a pair of abandoned missile silos at neighboring Cape Canaveral Air Force Station  to retrieve the section of fuselage now on display. The exhumation was conducted in secrecy. Everything about the exhibit, in fact, was kept hush-hush during the four years it took to complete the project, out of respect to the dead astronauts families. June Scobee Rodgers had never seen an actual remnant of her husbands destroyed shuttle, Challenger, until previewing the exhibit just before its low-key opening at the end of June. 
        
     Displayed in a dimly lit room: a 12-foot section of the left side body panel of Challenger, standing vertically and bearing the gouged and scraped but still brilliantly colorful U.S. flag, and the charred frames for Columbias cockpit windows, seemingly floating at eye level. Sad, yes, to see the wreckage but it is a wonderful memorial to the shuttles, Scobee Rodgers said. The items representing the astronauts, on the other hand, are a truly fitting reminder of who they were as individuals. Challenger commander Francis Dick Scobees display case, on the left side of the exhibits main corridor, contains the leather helmet from the Starduster biplane he and June used to fly, and his blue TFNG T-shirt from the Astronaut Class of 1978, nicknamed the Thirty-Five New Guys. Across the hall on the right are Columbia commander Rick Husbands scuffed cowboy boots and well-worn Bible opened to Proverbs. Theres a display case for each astronaut, filled with personal items, although not all families contributed, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffes. Forever Remembered is a permanent exhibit, part of a larger display centered on the retired space shuttle Atlantis. NASA opted to keep Atlantis at Kennedy, the shuttle launch site, after Atlantis closed the program with the final mission in 2011. The entrance to the new exhibit is directly beneath the nose of Atlantis, which is suspended with its payload bay doors wide open as though perpetually orbiting Earth. One recent afternoon in July, tourists filled the predominantly blue hallway, pausing in front of the astronaut display cases. One woman wondered aloud which shuttle burned up and which one blew up. A few young children scampered about, their parents shushing them given the solemnity of the place. A few weeks after visiting the exhibit, Scobee Rodgers noted in a phone interview that much of the worlds population wasnt even born yet when Challenger went down in 1986. Its mostly history for the general public. Its very personal for us, she said. Amber DiSalvatore  an Apopka, Florida, resident touring the space center with her husband and two children  was 4 years old at the time of Challenger. Seeing the actual wreckage  along with Husbands Bible  brought tears to her eyes. The astronauts sacrificed their lives for exploration, said DiSalvatore, so its something that everybody  every human being  should know. In the aftermath of the Feb. 1, 2003, Columbia accident, NASA meticulously stored the 42 tons of debris in Kennedys iconic Vehicle Assembly Building and made them available for research. The space agency displayed a remnant or two of Columbia in a restricted area of the space center and, for the fifth anniversary, organized a traveling in-house exhibit. The relics were intended as safety reminders for the workforce. The three surviving shuttles  Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour, Challengers replacement  still were flying then. After Challengers accident, NASA wanted it out of sight and out of mind. The Jan. 28, 1986, launch disaster unfolded on live TV before countless schoolchildren eager to see an everyday teacher rocketing toward space. And so Challengers wreckage  all 118 tons of it, salvaged from the Atlantic  was buried in the pair of former missile silos, 90 feet deep. The chamber containing this particular fuselage section, in fact, had never been opened  until the Forever Remembered exhibit began to take shape. Determined to avoid any hint of commercialism or sensationalism, NASA took charge of the memorial effort at the visitor complex, which is run by an outside company. The job fell to Michael Ciannilli, a shuttle engineer and test director who had become responsible for the Challenger and Columbia debris. Our biggest concern the whole time was doing the right thing, Ciannilli said. Is this the right time? Is this the right thing? As the conversations unfolded over the months then years, Ciannilli entered the underground storage silos to find the proper display piece to represent Challenger. I was hoping to find something that would show the beauty of Challenger, the dignity of Challenger, the strength of Challenger, and these are words I dont use lightly, Ciannilli said. The 12-foot section of fuselage with the flag fit the bill. For Columbia, he chose the cockpit window frames. He said its like gazing into the eyes of Columbia and thus its soul. Ciannilli tapped the same preservation company that had worked on the Titanic, for the Challenger and Columbia relics. He sought out soothing, uplifting music for the exhibit. And, yes, he deliberately kept out real-time scenes of the shuttles disintegrating. Theres more to this story than those awful final moments, he said. Great pains were taken not to have anything sensationalized or exploited. Above all else, Ciannilli wanted the end result to be respectful. I cant stop thinking about it, Evelyn Husband-Thompson, the widow of Columbias commander, confided in a NASA interview.

Determined to avoid any hint of commercialism or sensationalism, NASA took charge of the memorial effort at the visitor complex, which is run by an outside company. The job fell to Michael Ciannilli, a shuttle engineer and test director who had become responsible for the Challenger and Columbia debris. Our biggest concern the whole time was doing the right thing, Ciannilli said. Is this the right time? Is this the right thing? As the conversations unfolded over the months then years, Ciannilli entered the underground storage silos to find the proper display piece to represent Challenger. I was hoping to find something that would show the beauty of Challenger, the dignity of Challenger, the strength of Challenger, and these are words I dont use lightly, Ciannilli said. The 12-foot section of fuselage with the flag fit the bill. For Columbia, he chose the cockpit window frames. He said its like gazing into the eyes of Columbia and thus its soul. Ciannilli tapped the same preservation company that had worked on the Titanic, for the Challenger and Columbia relics. He sought out soothing, uplifting music for the exhibit. And, yes, he deliberately kept out real-time scenes of the shuttles disintegrating. Theres more to this story than those awful final moments, he said. Great pains were taken not to have anything sensationalized or exploited. Above all else, Ciannilli wanted the end result to be respectful. I cant stop thinking about it, Evelyn Husband-Thompson, the widow of Columbias commander, confided in a NASA interview. As you walk in, you know that youre in a special place. ___ Online: Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex: https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-69b86cef13024ea3a0df06bdb0a67965,science
Japan delivers whiskey to space station_ for science,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spirits arrived at the International Space Station on Monday. Not the ghostly ones, but the kind you drink -- distilled spirits. The six astronauts wont be sneaking a sip. Its all for science. A Japanese company known for its whiskey and other alcoholic beverages included five types of distilled spirits in a space station cargo ship. The stations big robotic arm  operated by Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui  grabbed onto the supply craft launched Wednesday by his homeland. Flight controllers helped anchor it down. The supply ship contains nearly 10,000 pounds of cargo, including the six liquor samples. Suntory Global Innovation Center in Tokyo wants to see if alcoholic beverages mellow the same in space as they do on Earth. The samples will be used for experiments and will spend at least a year in orbit before being returned to Earth. An identical set of samples will be stored on the ground in Japan. The experiment has NASAs blessing. Spokesman Dan Huot said all research flown to the space station is agreed upon by everyone involved. Its not the first liquor-related space study. Japan also sent up 12 mice aboard the Kounotori vessel, Japanese for white stork, as part of an aging study. NASA has considerable equipment aboard the supply capsule. Many are replacements for items lost in the failed SpaceX supply run at the end of June. The Florida launch accident destroyed everything on board. The replacements include spacewalking equipment, an emergency breathing kit, toilet wiring and parts for the water recycling system. 
        
     The 250-mile-high outpost was in need of fresh supplies, after losing three shipments in eight months. SpaceX remains grounded, as does another U.S. supplier, Orbital Sciences Corp., which suffered a launch explosion last October in Virginia. A Russian cargo ship went out of control in April and was destroyed on re-entry, but the country has since corrected the problem and resumed deliveries. U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly  who last week said the delivery was very important given the circumstances  welcomed the stork. Great job by my crewmates, Kelly said via Twitter. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Japanese Space Agency: http://global.jaxa.jp/",https://apnews.com/japan-delivers-whiskey-to-space-station-for-science-ef3650d0585548619f8c9bf0b57de19a,science
"Buzz Aldrin joins university, forming master plan for Mars","MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP)  Buzz Aldrin is teaming up with Florida Institute of Technology to develop a master plan for colonizing Mars within 25 years. The second man to walk on the moon took part in a signing ceremony Thursday at the university, less than an hours drive from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. The Buzz Aldrin Space Institute is set to open this fall. The 85-year-old Aldrin, who followed Neil Armstrong onto the moons surface on July 20, 1969, will serve as a research professor of aeronautics as well as a senior faculty adviser for the institute. He said he hopes his master plan is accepted by NASA and the country, with international input. NASA already is working on the spacecraft and rockets to get astronauts to Mars by the mid-2030s. Aldrin is pushing for a Mars settlement by approximately 2040. More specifically, hes shooting for 2039, the 70th anniversary of his own Apollo 11 moon landing, although he admits the schedule is adjustable. He envisions using Mars moons, Phobos and Deimos, as preliminary stepping stones for astronauts. He said he dislikes the label one-way and imagines tours of duty lasting 10 years. The Pilgrims on the Mayflower came here to live and stay. They didnt wait around Plymouth Rock for the return trip, and neither will people building up a population and a settlement on Mars. As for Aldrin, hes recently settled in nearby Satellite Beach, right on the Atlantic Ocean, after moving from California. He told reporters he considers it a terminal assignment, using Air Force jargon. 
        
     Ive traded earthquakes and fires for hurricanes by coming to Florida, he said. The press conference made reference to Aldrins recent celebrity pursuits. Florida Techs executive vice president, T. Dwayne McCay, greeted Aldrin by noting, Everyone knows what Buzz Aldrin is most famous for, and that is being a contestant on Dancing with the Stars. Big Bang Theory, Aldrin corrected. Aldrin  who has a doctorate in science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology  joins two other space fliers on the faculty: former shuttle astronauts Winston Scott and Sam Durrance. ___ Online: Florida Tech: http://www.fit.edu/ Aldrin: http://buzzaldrin.com/",https://apnews.com/buzz-aldrin-joins-university-forming-master-plan-for-mars-a2197530b5b34ad2b5fb262999ed342a,science
"China to send three astronauts to Tiangong space station, part of its ambitious program","JIUQUAN SATELLITE LAUNCH CENTER, China (AP)  Chinas space agency is making final preparations to send a new crew to its space station on Thursday as part of its ambitious program that aims to put people on the moon by 2030. The three-member crew of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft will relieve the current team who have been manning Chinas Tiangong space station since last October.  China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to the United States concerns over the Peoples Liberation Armys  the Chinese Communist Partys military arms  involvement in the program. This year, the station is slated for two cargo spacecraft missions and two manned spaceflight missions. In a press conference on Wednesday, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) introduced the three astronauts: Commander Ye Guangfu, 43, a veteran astronaut who was part of the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021; and astronauts Li Cong, 34, and Li Guangsu, 36, who will go to space for the first time. The Shenzhou-18 crew will spend about six months on the space station. They will conduct scientific tests, install space debris protection equipment on the space station, carry out payload experiments, and popularize science education, among other things, according to Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the CMSA. Lin also said China was working toward eventually offering access to its space station to foreign astronauts and space tourists. 
        
     We will accelerate the research and promotion of the participation of foreign astronauts and space tourists in flights with Chinas space station, he said. We definitely expect to see astronauts of different identities on Chinas space station. The crew is set for lift-off at 1259 GMT from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the edge of the Gobi Desert in the countrys northwest.  China conducted its first manned space mission in 2003, becoming the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space using its own resources. The U.S. space program is believed to still hold a significant edge over Chinas due to its spending, supply chains and capabilities. However, China has broken out in some areas, bringing samples back from the lunar surface for the first time in decades and landing a rover on the less explored far side of the moon. The U.S.  the only country to have previously put astronauts on the moon  aims to put a crew back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.

The Shenzhou-18 spacecraft lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northwestern China atop a Long March 2-F rocket at 8:59 p.m. (1259 GMT).  The spacecrafts three-member crew will relieve the Shenzhou-17 team, which has been staffing Chinas Tiangong space station since last October. The China Manned Space Agency, or CMSA, held a send-off ceremony  complete with flag-waving children and patriotic music  for the Shenzhou-18 crew earlier on Thursday, as the three astronauts prepared to enter the spacecraft. The trio is made of Commander Ye Guangfu, 43, a veteran astronaut who took part in the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021, and fighter pilots Li Cong, 34, and Li Guangsu, 36, who are spaceflight rookies. They are expected to reach the space station about six-and-a-half hours after liftoff.

Chinese astronauts return to Earth after 6 months on space station,"BEIJING (AP)  A Chinese spacecraft returned to Earth on Tuesday with three astronauts who completed a six-month mission aboard the countrys orbiting space station.  The Shenzhou-17 craft carrying Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin landed at the Dongfeng site in north Chinas Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the Gobi Desert shortly before 6 p.m. It comes roughly four days after the Shenzhou-18 mission docked with the station with their three-member replacement crew.  China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely because of U.S. concerns over the Chinese militarys total control of the space program amid a sharpening competition in technology between the two geopolitical rivals. This year, the Chinese station is slated for two cargo spacecraft missions and two manned spaceflight missions. Chinas ambitious space program aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030, as well as bring back samples from Mars around the same year and launch three lunar probe missions over the next four years.  The new crew is made up of Commander Ye Guangfu, 43, a veteran astronaut who took part in the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021, and fighter pilots Li Cong, 34, and Li Guangsu, 36, who are spaceflight rookies. They will spend about six months on the three modules of the space station, the Tiangong, which can accommodate up to six astronauts at a time. During their stay, they will conduct scientific tests, install space debris protection equipment, carry out payload experiments, and beam science classes to students on Earth. 
        
     China has also said that it eventually plans to offer access to its space station to foreign astronauts and space tourists.

Boeing names its new Apollo-style spacecraft the Starliner,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeing already has the Dreamliner. Now it also has the Starliner. The aerospace giant announced the name of its future space fleet Friday. More than 200 people, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott, NASA and Boeing officials, and a bevy of former astronauts, gathered at NASAs Kennedy Space Center to celebrate the grand opening of Boeings commercial crew and cargo processing facility. Once a space shuttle hangar, the transformed building will serve as home to the Starliner. Its first launch with a crew to the International Space Station is targeted for 2017. Until Friday, Boeings still-under-development capsule was known simply as the CST-100, an abbreviation for Crew Space Transportation and 100 kilometers, the threshold of space. Boeing is one of two private U.S. companies contracted by NASA to transport space station astronauts from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX, the other company, is developing an enhanced version of its cargo-carrying Dragon capsule  a super Dragon. That work is being carried out at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California. NASA wants its astronauts launching from U.S. soil again rather than hitching expensive rides from Kazakhstan with the Russian Space Agency. That hasnt happened since the last shuttle flight in 2011. The Starliner name was revealed by the commander of the last shuttle flight, Chris Ferguson, now deputy manager of operations for Boeings commercial crew program. 
        
     We get asked a lot, When are you going to pick a name for that wonderful spacecraft? Ferguson told the crowd. Well, Ive always said, Just wait. Its coming. Well, guess what? The wait is over. Please welcome the CST-100 Starliner, Ferguson said as a temporary wall behind him rose and revealed, to dramatic music and flashing lights, spacecraft sections that will be used for testing. In choosing the name, Boeing wanted to give a nod to the next generation of space and the next 100 years of flight for Boeing, Ferguson said. The Chicago-based company will mark its 100th anniversary next summer. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden Jr., also a former shuttle skipper, talked up the space agencys plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s, with Boeing and SpaceX picking up the get-crews-to-orbit slack. If youre not excited, then theres something wrong with you, to be quite honest, Bolden said. The most senior astronaut present, Gemini and Apollos Thomas Stafford, liked what he saw. Its a great name, said Stafford, 84, who flew to the moon on Apollo 10, two months before the first manned moon landing in 1969. He said the spacecraft is reminiscent of the capsules from the Apollo moon program. NASAs commercial crew contract with Boeing to certify, test and fly the Starliner capsules totals $4.2 billion. The SpaceX contract is worth $2.6 billion. ___ Online: Boeing: http://www.boeing.com/space/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/",https://apnews.com/boeing-names-its-new-apollo-style-spacecraft-the-starliner-16a93503796e40009a6fc9aef176a898,science

Rare galaxy with 2 black holes has 1 starved of stars,"KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP)  An astrophysicist has discovered something even rarer than a double-black hole galaxy: a skinny black hole. The University of Colorado at Boulders Julie Comerford reported her findings Tuesday at the American Astronomical Societys annual meeting in Kissimmee, Florida. To date, only 12 galaxies are known to exist with two black holes in their midst, Comerford said. Normally galaxies have a single supermassive black hole at the center, equivalent to 1 million to 1 billion times the mass of our sun. But in this newly identified galaxy about 1 billion light-years away, one of the two black holes is significantly smaller than the other and apparently starved of stars. Black holes typically are surrounded by stars; this one appears naked. Comerford speculates the slim black hole lost mass in the collision of two galaxies that merged into this one "" a crash diet. Or its a rare example of an intermediate-sized black hole that likely will morph over time into a supermassive monster. Astronomers have yet to confirm an intermediate-size black hole, which makes Comerfords streamlined target extra tantalizing. Intermediate black holes are 100 to 1 million times the mass of our sun. Comerford used the Hubble Space Telescope and NASAs Chandra X-ray Observatory in her study. She discovered this latest two-black hole galaxy  her fourth  last year. Finding a potential intermediate-size black hole inside was an extra bonus, she told reporters. 
        
     The first double-black hole galaxy was found in 2003 by accident, according to Comerford. She is trying to systematically uncover more. The findings should shed light on the evolution of black holes. This particular galaxy is catalogued as SDSS J1126+2944. ___ Online: American Astronomical Society: http://aas.org/meetings/aas227",https://apnews.com/fl-state-wire-co-state-wire-044a369ef1c84360a92dc03a17891a32,science
Study: Star clusters might host intelligent civilizations,"KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP)  Densely packed clusters of stars on the fringes of our Milky Way galaxy may be home to intelligent life. Thats the word from an astrophysicist whos new to probing extraterrestrial territory. The approximately 150 globular clusters in our galaxy are old and stable, a plus for any civilization, said Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In addition, so many stars are clumped together it would be easy to hop from one place to another, keeping an advanced society going. The first step, she said, is to locate more planets in these clusters. So far, only one has been found. The sweet spot would be a habitable zone around a star where life could flourish, yet dense enough to enhance travel among inhabitants. Di Stefano presented her theory Wednesday at the American Astronomical Societys annual meeting in Kissimmee, Florida. Her paper stood out among the hundreds of research papers; an AAS official called the results provocative. A global cluster can hold a million stars in a compact ball an average 100 light-years across. This overcrowding can result in stars elbowing out other stars planetary systems. Di Stefano said smaller solar systems would be more apt to last longer; the planets would orbit closer to their home star and therefore be less of a target for encroaching neighbors. Stars in these clusters are so close, communication and travel would be relatively easy for these any space-farers out there. 
        
     We call it the globular cluster opportunity, Di Stefano explained in a statement. Sending a broadcast between the stars wouldnt take any longer than a letter from the U.S. to Europe in the 18th century. Di Stefano stressed at a news conference that her premise is scientific conjecture. I want to make this clear  we dont know, she told reporters. Nevertheless, the possibility of a long-lived civilization is fascinating, she noted, so what better place to look than these 10 billion-to-12 billion-year-old global clusters. Global clusters are good targets to spend your time on in search of extraterrestrial intelligence, she urged. ___ Online: American Astronomical Society: http://aas.org/meetings/aas227",https://apnews.com/study-star-clusters-might-host-intelligent-civilizations-b3bc54c4952041919ce54cd28f9db495,science
Spacewalk aborted after water leaks into astronauts helmet,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Two astronauts aborted their spacewalk Friday and hurried back into the International Space Station after water leaked into one of the mens helmets in a scary repeat of a near-drowning 2 years ago. The trouble cropped up after the astronauts  including Britains 1st spacewalker  successfully restored full power to the space station. NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra took everyone by surprise when he reported a small water bubble and then a film of water inside his helmet. Mindful of another spacewalkers close call in 2013, Mission Control terminated the planned six-hour spacewalk at the four-hour mark. It turns out Kopra was wearing the same spacesuit involved in the earlier incident. So far, Im OK, Kopra assured everyone. Later, he said the water bubble was 4 inches long and getting thicker. Im doing good, he repeated on his way back inside. Lead flight director Royce Renfrew, who called an early end to the spacewalk, stressed that the situation was not an emergency and insisted neither spacewalker was in danger. Indeed, Kopra took time to thank everyone for their help as the air lock was pressurized. An hour later, Kopra was safely inside his orbiting home, along with Timothy Peake, who attracted his own headlines by becoming Britains first spacewalker Friday. The astronauts waiting anxiously inside pulled off Kopras helmet, then measured the water that had leaked, presumably from the suits cooling system. That was the source of the leak last time. Space station commander Scott Kelly reported that he filled a syringe with about 15 cubic centimeters of water. 
        
     Thats nothing, NASA officials pointed out, compared with the 1 to 1 liters of water that escaped into Italian astronaut Luca Parmitanos helmet and suit in July 2013. Kopras suit was the same one Parmitano was wearing when his helmet flooded. This suit was refurbished following the 2013 incident. NASA said Kopra used the same suit for a spacewalk last month without any problem, and it had been used previously as well. Despite the considerably smaller leak, the cap that Kopra wore on his head, under his helmet, was moist, as were other parts of his suit. As for Peakes suit, a quick look showed it to be dry save for a bit of moisture around the wrists. Kopra and Peake completed their No. 1 job early on in the spacewalk. The pair quickly removed the voltage regulator that failed two months ago, slashing station power by one-eighth. The breakdown did not disrupt work 250 miles up, but NASA wanted the power grid fixed as soon as possible in case something else failed. Working in darkness to avoid electrical shock from the solar power system, the astronauts quickly removed the bad unit and popped in a spare, both about the size of a 30-gallon aquarium. They had just 31 minutes to complete the job, the amount of nighttime on that particular swing around the world. Following tests, Mission Control said the spare  dubbed Dusty for its 17-year tenure in orbit  appeared to be working properly. Engineers suspect the original electronic unit suffered an internal electrical short. In the meantime, the station relied on the seven other power channels. The action unfolded on the far reaches of the space station. The work site is about 200 feet from the astronauts exit, about as far as spacewalkers safely can go. Peake, in particular, received a bounty of well wishes  from space as well as Earth. He became the first spacewalker to wear the Union Jack on the shoulder of his suit. Were all watching, no pressure! Former Beatle Paul McCartney said via Twitter. Wishing you a happy stroll outdoors in the universe. Earlier, as Peake floated out, space station commander Scott Kelly called, Hey Tim, its really cool seeing that Union Jack go outside. Its explored all over the world. Now its explored space. Replied Peake: Its great to be wearing it, a huge privilege, a proud moment. Peake, a helicopter pilot chosen by the European Space Agency, is Britains first official astronaut. A handful of previous spacewalkers held dual U.S.-English citizenship, but flew as Americans for NASA. The first British citizen to fly in space, chemist Helen Sharman, visited Russias old Mir space station as part of a private competition in 1991. Peake and Kopra, a former Army aviator and attack helicopter platoon leader, rocketed into orbit exactly one month ago aboard a Russian spacecraft. After Parmitanos leak, NASA added absorbent pads to the helmet and put in place other precautions for future spacewalks. Those pads and safety procedures came in handy Friday. Parmitanos spacewalking partner that day, NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, was in Mission Control in Houston on Friday and offered assistance. Now chief of NASAs astronaut corps, Cassidy said at least everyone now has a good grasp of what to heed and what to do. Engineers will scour the data in the weeks ahead to figure out what happened. Unlike last time, NASA did not immediately call for a halt to non-emergency spacewalks. Parmitano was at the European Astronaut Center in Cologne, Germany, during Fridays spacewalk, answering questions about spacewalking. He had to cut the session short  for good reasons. Happy to see @astro_timpeake and @astro_tim safe inside, Parmitano said via Twitter. This is how I measure success: 1)crew-safe 2)main objective-completed. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html European Space Agency: http://m.esa.int/ESA",https://apnews.com/spacewalk-aborted-after-water-leaks-into-astronauts-helmet-b9952f0dc35a40cca3912c7e9dfa2a2f,science
"Scientists spot brightest supernova yet, outshines Milky Way","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have discovered the brightest star explosion ever, a super supernova that easily outshines our entire Milky Way. An international team revealed the most powerful supernova observed in human history Thursday in the latest Science journal. The astronomers used a network of telescopes around the world to spot the record-breaking supernova last year. Super luminous supernovas  extra bright stellar explosions  are believed to be rare. The newly discovered supernova is especially rare: It is more than twice as luminous as any supernova observed to date, including the previous record-holders. At its peak intensity, it is believed to be 20 times more luminous than the entire Milky Way. Some estimates put it at 50 times brighter. And try this statistic on for size: It is 570 billion times brighter at its peak than our sun. Lead author Subo Dong of Chinas Peking University said when he learned the magnitude of the discovery last summer, he was too excited to sleep the rest of the night. Fellow researcher Benjamin Shappee of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Pasadena, California, didnt believe the results at first, which seemed surreal. Discoveries like this are the reason I am an astronomer, Shappee said in an email. Nature is extremely clever and it is often more imaginative than we can be. Labeled ASASSN-15lh for the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae and pronounced assassin, the mega blast is located in a galaxy perhaps 3.8 billion light-years away. The precise galaxy is unknown. There are other puzzles as well. 
        
     The explosions mechanism and power source remain shrouded in mystery because all known theories meet serious challenges in explaining the immense amount of energy ASASSN-15lh has radiated, Dong said in a statement. The next step for scientists is to figure out its incredible power source. Other super supernovas, like this one, could be out there. More observatories are on the case, including some NASA spacecraft. The Hubble Space Telescope will be pressed into service this year as well. Dong said ASASSN-15lh may lead to new thinking and new observations of the whole class of super luminous supernova. ___ Online: Science: http://www.sciencemag.org/",https://apnews.com/scientists-spot-brightest-supernova-yet-outshines-milky-way-acce517aabc6420dbd1dbf7aae34e65f,science
Astronaut nurses zinnia to full bloom after mold invasion,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station now has a bright pop of orange, thanks to commander Scott Kellys green thumb. Kelly showed off his gardening results  a thriving zinnia with a beautiful orange-yellow bloom  over the weekend. He posted photos of the flower on his Twitter account. Yes, there are other life forms in space! Kelly said in a tweet. Last month, Kelly had to fight off mold that threatened to kill all the flowers in the space stations mini-greenhouse. Mission Control gave him free rein, and he managed to save some of the crop. This type of autonomous gardening will be necessary during Mars expeditions, Kelly noted. In a nod to last years blockbuster movie The Martian, Kelly said, Im going to have to channel my inner Mark Watney. Watney is the fictitious astronaut-botantist who ends up stranded alone on Mars and grows potatoes in order to survive. The space stations plant-growing experiment previously saw a bumper crop of red romaine lettuce last summer. The space station crew got to sample a few leaves. While this is the first zinnia known to bloom in space, its not the first space flower. In 2012, space station astronaut Donald Pettit memorably coaxed blooms out of a zucchini plant, blogging about his informal experiment in Diary of a Space Zucchini. He also nurtured Space Sunflower and Space Broccoli. The Russians hold claim to the first flower in space, aboard the Soviet Salyut space stations of the 1970s and 1980s. 
        
     These new space zinnias arent just for looks: NASA said theyre a good precursor to tomato plants, targeted to launch in 2018. The next hothouse crop, coming up soon on a SpaceX supply flight, will be Chinese cabbage and more lettuce. NASAs little greenhouse is known as Veggie, short for Vegetable Production System. It flew to the space station in 2014. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/ Diary of a Space Zucchini: http://tinyurl.com/h679xrj",https://apnews.com/astronaut-nurses-zinnia-to-full-bloom-after-mold-invasion-8d9dc4948f8d4592b00c2ccca19c65d2,science
New evidence points to giant 9th planet on solar system edge,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The solar system may have a ninth planet after all. This one is 5,000 times bigger than outcast Pluto and billions of miles farther away, say scientists who presented good evidence for a long-hypothesized Planet X on Wednesday. The gas giant is thought to be almost as big as its nearest planetary neighbor Neptune, quite possibly with rings and moons. Its so distant that it would take a mind-blowing 10,000 to 20,000 years to circle the sun. Planet 9, as the pair of California Institute of Technology researchers calls it, hasnt been spotted yet. They base their prediction on mathematical and computer modeling, and anticipate its discovery via telescope within five years or less. The two reported their research Wednesday in the Astronomical Journal because they want people to help them look for it. We could have stayed quiet and quietly spent the next five years searching the skies ourselves and hoping to find it. But I would rather somebody find it sooner, than me find it later, astronomer Mike Brown told The Associated Press. I want to see it. I want to see what it looks like. I want to understand where it is, and I think this will help. Brown and planetary scientist Konstantin Batygin feel certain about their prediction, which at first seemed unbelievable to even them. For the first time in more than 150 years, theres good evidence that the planetary census of the solar system is incomplete, Batygin said, referring to Neptunes discovery as Planet 8. 
        
     Once its detected, Brown insists there will be no Pluto-style planetary debate. Brown ought to know; hes the so-called Pluto killer who helped lead the charge against Plutos planetary status in 2006. (Once Planet 9, Pluto is now officially considered a dwarf planet.) THIS is what we mean when we say the word planet,  Brown said. Brown and Batygin believe its big  10 times more massive than Earth  and unlike Pluto, dominates its cosmic neighborhood. Pluto is a gravitational slave to Neptune, they pointed out. Another scientist, Alan Stern, said hes withholding judgment on the planet prediction. He is the principal scientist for NASAs New Horizons spacecraft, which buzzed Pluto last summer in the first-ever visit from Planet Earth. He still sees Pluto as a real planet  not a second-class dwarf. This kind of thing comes around every few years. To date, none of those predicts have been borne out by discoveries, Stern said in an email Wednesday. Id be very happy if the Brown-Batygin were the exception to the rule, but well have to wait and see. Prediction is not discovery. Brown and Batygin shaped their calculation on the fact that six objects in the icy Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone on the far reaches of the solar system, appear to have orbits influenced by only one thing: a real planet. The vast, mysterious Kuiper Belt is home to Pluto as well. Brown actually discovered one of these six objects more than a decade ago, Sedna, a large minor planet. What we have found is a gravitational signature of Planet 9 lurking in the outskirts of the solar system, Batygin said. The actual discovery, he noted, will be era-defining. Added Brown: We have felt a great disturbance in the force. Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington said Brown and Batygins effort takes his own findings to the next level. Two years ago, he and a colleague suggested a possible giant planet. I find this new work very exciting, Sheppard said in an email. It makes the distant Super-Earth planet in our solar system much more real. I would say the odds just went from 50 percent to 75 percent that this distant massive planet is real. Depending on where this Planet 9 is in its egg-shaped orbit, a space telescope may be needed to confirm its presence, the researchers said. Or good backyard telescopes may spot it, they noted, if the planet is relatively closer to us in its swing around the sun. Its an estimated 20 billion to 100 billion miles away. The Caltech researchers prefer calling it Planet 9, versus the historical term Planet X. The latter smacks of aliens and the imminent destruction of the Earth, according to Brown. Who knows, there could even be a Planet 10 out there well beyond No. 9, but there arent enough data at this point to guess, Brown said. The last real planet to be discovered in our solar system was Neptune in 1846. Plutos discovery came in 1930; humanity got to see the small icy world and its main moon Charon up close for the first time last July thanks to New Horizons. The spacecraft, unfortunately, is in the opposite direction of Planet 9, according to the researchers, and thus unable to help in its detection. Brown realizes skepticism will exist until the planet is actually observed. History is packed with mistaken planet-seekers, he said, and so standing up and saying were right this time makes us almost look crazy  except Im going to stand up and say were actually right this time. He couldnt resist this jab on his @plutokiller Twitter account: OK, OK, I am now willing to admit: I DO believe that the solar system has nine planets. ___ Online: Caltech: http://www.caltech.edu/",https://apnews.com/new-evidence-points-to-giant-9th-planet-on-solar-system-edge-b2d52bacb7684399b0037ab6d08c8b4d,science
30 years since Challenger: Teacher-in-Space finalists gather,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Dozens of educators who competed alongside Christa McAuliffe to become the first teacher in space gathered Thursday to remember the seven astronauts who perished aboard Challenger 30 years ago. McAuliffes son, Scott, now 39, also took part in the emotionally charged ceremony, held on a bleak, drizzly morning just six miles from where his mothers space shuttle blasted off for the final time on Jan. 28, 1986. Many of the teacher-in-space semifinalists are retired now. They have gray hair. A few limp. But they still believe strongly in what McAuliffe hoped to accomplish aboard Challenger before disaster struck during liftoff. Its really hard to be back, said William Dillon, 77, a retired teacher who represented California in the competition back in the mid-1980s. He was at Kennedy Space Center for Challengers launch and had gotten to know not only McAuliffe, but a few of the other astronauts on the doomed flight. Linda Preston, 61, also retired as a teacher, choked up as the names of the Challenger dead were read during the memorial service. The former space shuttle pilot reciting the names of all 24 astronauts killed in the line of duty over the years, Jon McBride, had to fight back tears. All of a sudden, I couldnt breathe, Preston later confided to a reporter. She represented Utah in the teacher competition. About 40 of the 113 remaining semifinalists for teacher-in-space traveled to Cape Canaveral for the anniversary commemoration, the biggest gathering ever for a NASA memorial like this. 
        
     We felt we all wanted to be part of it, said Connecticut semifinalist David Warner, 63, who still teaches science, robotics and rocketry. Like so many of his colleagues, Warner wanted to see Kennedys Forever Remembered exhibit that opened last summer. It contains the only piece of Challenger wreckage on public display, a 12-foot section of the left-side body panel complete with the U.S. flag, as well as personal belongings of the Challenger and Columbia crews. The ceremony was one of several NASA memorials that took place Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery and elsewhere around the country. At Kennedy, rain moved the ceremony indoors, directly in front of the Forever Remembered exhibit. The gathering took place beneath the suspended shuttle Atlantis, which in 2011 made the final shuttle flight. Afterward, McAuliffe and other children of the Challenger dead laid a wreath at the outdoor Space Mirror Memorial. Each guest received a rose or carnation to attach to the railing in front of the massive granite mirror. McAuliffe, who works in education technology in Maine, said having his own two sons there with him  ages 6 and 8  made it easier. Its time, he said, that his children see and learn firsthand all about astronauts and the space program. Indeed, in a nod to the second generation, June Scobee Rodgers  widow of Challenger commander Dick Scobee and longtime spokeswoman for the group  passed the torch to daughter Kathie Scobee Fulgham. Fulgham  not Scobee Rodgers  was on the stage for the ceremony and introduced guest speaker Barbara Morgan, an Idaho schoolteacher who served as Christa McAuliffes backup so long ago. Morgan recalled how Dick Scobee was a deep and poetic thinker, and how pilot Michael Smith let her push the stick during a training jet flight. She said Christa McAuliffe taught her not to worry about whats unimportant but rather work harder at what truly counts. Up until the final day before launch, Morgan noted, Christa McAuliffe took time to write college recommendations for her students. The rest of the Challenger crew, remembered fondly by Morgan: Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka and Gregory Jarvis. The crowd of about 500 included family members of astronauts killed in all three of NASAs spacecraft tragedies: Challenger; Columbias catastrophic descent on Feb. 1, 2003; and the Apollo 1 fire on Jan. 27, 1967. For the astronauts loved ones, the disasters remain fresh in their minds. Steven McAuliffe, a federal judge in Concord, New Hampshire, still declines interviews about his late wife Christa. But he noted in a statement that although 30 years have passed, Challenger will always be an event that occurred just recently. Our thoughts and memories of Christa will always be fresh and comforting. McAuliffe was presiding over a trial this week in Concord, and so Scott represented his father as well as his younger sister. The McAuliffes normally do not take part in these NASA memorials, so Scotts presence was especially noteworthy. Along with the other Challenger families, Scobee Rodgers established the Challenger Center for Space Science Education just three months after the shuttle disintegrated in the Florida sky. A leak in the right booster doomed the ship; unusually cold weather that morning left Challengers booster rockets with stiff O-ring seals. Today, there are more than 40 Challenger Learning Centers focusing on science, technology, engineering and math, mostly in the U.S. More are being built. Theyre not just a field trip for kids. Theyre actually lessons learned, said Scobee Rodgers, an educator who lives in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Thats why theyve lasted. ___ Online: Challenger Center: http://www.challenger.org/ NASA: http://www.history.nasa.gov/sts51l.html",https://apnews.com/30-years-since-challenger-teacher-in-space-finalists-gather-dd026bb4c6f5414282f2eea4a71057e4,science
"Spacewalkers collect experiment, toss flash drive overboard","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking Russians gathered seeds and spores that have been stuck outside the International Space Station for months if not years and gave a ceremonial send-off Wednesday to a flash drive containing special messages for their motherland. Cosmonaut Sergey Volkov waited for good camera views before tossing the flash drive overboard as the space station sailed 250 miles above the Pacific. The blue, cloud-specked Earth provided a stunning backdrop. The flash drive includes videos and messages pertaining to the 70th anniversary of Russias Victory Day last year. It was attached to a small bundle stuffed with towels to provide some bulk. There it goes, Volkov said in Russian as he let go of the package with his right gloved hand. Just beautiful, he noted as it spun slowly, appearing to tumble toward Earth. Spacewalking partner Yuri Malenchenko floated nearby. Thats perfect guys, Russian Mission Control radioed from outside Moscow. The job was added just a few days ago. NASA said the jettisoned package would pose no hazard to the orbiting lab. Flight controllers expect the bundle to harmlessly re-enter the atmosphere in a few weeks. With that accomplished, the spacewalkers set off to retrieve research equipment that has been outdoors since 2009. The trays include plant seeds as well as spores from fungi and bacteria; the specimens typically were replenished every year or two and returned to Earth for analysis. The cosmonauts set out fresh experiments elsewhere on the space station, then found themselves fussing over a dispenser in a surface- coating experiment. 
        
     The roll of tapelike film in the dispenser kept jamming, frustrating Malenchenko and Volkov as they tried to coat an outdoor sample board. Only one attempt appeared to succeed. It glued on so nicely. Its like a perfect sticker, one of the spacewalkers reported. Are we done? They werent, but Russian Mission Control advised them a few minutes later to wrap it up and head back in. The spacewalk lasted nearly five hours. NASA, meanwhile, is still trying to understand why water leaked into a U.S. astronauts helmet last month. The Jan. 15 spacewalk had to be cut short because of the problem, a repeat of what happened to an Italian spacewalker in 2013. That first incident was considerably more serious, involving much more leakage. The Russians use different types of suits, which functioned well Wednesday. As for U.S. spacewalks, astronauts will go out only in an emergency until the leakage is understood and corrected, according to NASA. Six men currently live at the space station: three Russians, two Americans and one Briton. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-science--97a2b3e78a684f1bb2f753664854614a,science
Space station astronauts give huge trash can the boot,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station just got a whole lot tidier. A pair of NASA astronauts released a capsule loaded with 1.5 tons of trash Friday as the space station soared over Bolivia. The capsule should re-enter the atmosphere and burn up harmlessly over the Pacific on Saturday. NASA supplier Orbital ATK launched the capsule to the space station in December, full of food, clothes and other goods. The astronauts removed the precious contents, then filled it with garbage and old equipment for incineration. Commander Scott Kelly and Timothy Kopra, the Americans on board, sent computer commands to set the Cygnus free. The stunning 250-mile-high view showed the capsule slowly backing away, its two circular solar wings looking like open umbrellas. Kelly, whos less than two weeks from wrapping up an unprecedented yearlong mission for NASA, thanked everyone who worked on the Cygnus  this great vehicle. Its been a pleasure, he noted. A beautiful release, replied Mission Control. Virginia-based Orbital ATK plans to launch another Cygnus with more supplies from Cape Canaveral, Florida, late next month. The flight was delayed a few weeks after black mold contaminated some of the cargo bags. Technicians had to disinfect everything. SpaceX, meanwhile, another commercial cargo carrier for NASA, is aiming to make a delivery in the next few months. The company is working to get back on track following a launch accident last summer. 
        
     NASA has handed off space station shipments to private business so it can focus on getting astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit, namely to Mars. It hopes to do the same with space station crews next year. For now, U.S. astronauts are hitching rides with the Russians. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/space-station-astronauts-give-huge-trash-can-the-boot-c70963097fbd4cb1863fd7d7e80d1351,science
"Record number of astronaut wannabes apply to NASA _ 18,300","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Space travel never looked so good. NASA announced Friday it received a record number of applicants  some 18,300  for its next astronaut class. Thats more than double the previous record of 8,000 for the first space shuttle astronaut class in 1978. This time, NASA hit social media hard to promote the openings. The odds of getting picked are small; only eight to 14 Americans will be chosen. NASA expects it will take 1 years to whittle down the list. Candidates need to be U.S. citizens with a bachelors degree in science, math or engineering. Its not at all surprising to me that so many Americans from diverse backgrounds want to personally contribute to blazing the trail on our journey to Mars, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, a former space shuttle commander, said in a statement. Like the eight-member Class of 2013, the future astronauts will train to fly to the International Space Station on capsules under development by SpaceX and Boeing, as well as on NASAs Orion spacecraft intended for deep-space exploration. NASA aims to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. The two-month application period closed Thursday. The first astronaut class was the Mercury 7 chosen in 1959. ___ Online: NASA: http://astronauts.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/record-number-of-astronaut-wannabes-apply-to-nasa-18-300-698cf2d660a04b66a5c9faa9a1ff51c2,science
US space-endurance champ says he could do another year,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Americas space-endurance champ, Scott Kelly, returns to Earth next week after nearly a year in orbit aboard the International Space Station. High on his to-do list when he gets back: jumping into his pool and dining at a real table. Yet he said he could hold out another year in the harsh environment of space  where nothing ever feels normal  if he had to. Yeah, I could go another 100 days. I could go another year if I had to, Kelly assured reporters Thursday in a video news conference from orbit. It would just depend on what I was doing and if it made sense, although I do look forward to getting home here next week. Going without running water for a year has made hygiene difficult, Kelly acknowledged: Its kind of like Ive been in the woods camping for a year. But the hardest part of all, he said, is being separated from his loved ones, a situation that will pose even more of a challenge for astronauts sent to Mars. Kelly took questions on Day 335 of what already is NASAs longest single spaceflight. By the time Kelly checks out Tuesday and rides a Russian capsule to a landing in Kazakhstan, his mission will have lasted 340 days. The world record for a single spaceflight is 438 days, set by a Russian cosmonaut in the 1990s. Even that will pale in comparison to a Mars expedition, expected to last two to three years round trip. 
        
     Scientists hope to learn much from Kellys mission to pave the way to Mars in two decades. They will also collect data from his Russian roommate for the year, Mikhail Kornienko. Kelly, 52, a former space shuttle commander, will undergo a battery of medical and physical tests at the landing site. He will then be hustled home to Houston for more tests and weeks if not months of rehabilitation to recover from the punishing effects of an extended stay in zero gravity, including degraded vision and the loss of bone and muscle. Awaiting his arrival in Houston will be his two daughters, his girlfriend, who works in public affairs at Johnson Space Center, and his identical twin, former astronaut Mark Kelly. The brothers have submitted to similar medical tests for more than a year and will keep it up in the months ahead. NASA hopes the research on the genetically identical brothers will illuminate some of the more extreme effects of weightlessness on the body. The Kellys talked often during the mission, more than they did before the flight, in fact. The 250-mile-high outpost has an Internet phone capable of calling anyone. Mission Control also arranges regular video conferences between astronauts and their families. For him, living in space and being so far detached from life on Earth, one of the only real lifelines you have, one of the best ones, is certainly the ability to make a phone call, Mark Kelly said from his home in Tucson, Arizona. He said he and his brother hope to go fishing in Alaska. Scott Kelly said he was more anxious to return home following his last space station stint five years ago, which lasted 159 days. That was because of the assassination attempt two months earlier on his congresswoman sister-in-law, Gabrielle Giffords, Marks wife. This time, Kelly said, he didnt focus on the end of his mission but rather on each upcoming milestone: the arrival of supplies and crews, major experiments, spacewalks, maintenance tasks. Even so, he said, events from last summer or fall seem like forever ago. He lightened things up recently by donning a gorilla suit  a gag gift from Mark  and cavorting through the station while the cameras rolled. Next milestones coming home, Kelly said with a smile. He ended the news conference with a slow-motion backflip  undoubtedly one of the pluses of space. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew",https://apnews.com/general-news-7de472cee20f4717b0ee1b44dcf36b64,science

The NASA astronaut has been living at the International Space Station since last March. By the time he lands in Kazakhstan next week, he will have spent 340 consecutive days in space, a U.S. record. Kelly will have completed 5,440 laps around the planet. Logged 143.8 million miles. Welcomed nine visiting spacecraft. Shared the place with 14 other humans, including his roommate for the long haul, Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, also returning to Earth. He drank nearly 200 gallons of recycled urine and sweat, collected from himself and everyone else on board. He snapped hundreds of breathtaking pictures of the home planet and posted them on Instagram and Twitter as StationCDRKelly, not to be confused with ShuttleCDRKelly, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, his identical twin.

NASA confirms mystery object that crashed through roof of Florida home came from space station,"NAPLES, Fla. (AP)  NASA confirmed Monday that a mystery object that crashed through the roof of a Florida home last month was a chunk of space junk from equipment discarded at the International Space Station. The cylindrical object that tore through the home in Naples on March 8 was subsequently taken to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral for analysis. The space agency said it was a metal support used to mount old batteries on a cargo pallet for disposal. The pallet was jettisoned from the space station in 2021, and the load was expected to eventually fully burn up on entry into Earths atmosphere, but one piece survived. The chunk of metal weighed 1.6 pounds (0.7 kilograms) and was 4 inches (10 centimeters) tall and roughly 1 1/2 inches (4 centimeters) wide. Homeowner Alejandro Otero told television station WINK at the time that he was on vacation when his son told him what had happened. Otero came home early to check on the house, finding the object had ripped through his ceiling and torn up the flooring. I was shaking. I was completely in disbelief. What are the chances of something landing on my house with such force to cause so much damage, Otero said.

"European Space Agency adds 5 new astronauts in only fourth class since 1978. Over 20,000 applied","COLOGNE, Germany (AP)  For the past year, five fit, academically superior men and women have been spun in centrifuges, submerged for hours, deprived temporarily of oxygen, taught to camp in the snow, and schooled in physiology, anatomy, astronomy, meteorology, robotics, and Russian.  On Monday, the five Europeans and an Australian graduated from basic training with a new title: astronaut. At a ceremony in Cologne, Germany, ESA added the five newcomers to its astronaut corps eligible for missions to the International Space Station, bringing the total to 11.  ESA has negotiated with NASA for three places on future Artemis moon missions, although those places will likely go to the more senior astronauts, according to ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher. The agency is also supplying the service module for the Orion crew capsule. ESA relies on NASA and others to get its astronauts to space. It is only the fourth astronaut class since 1978 for the 22-country agency, chosen from among 22,500 applicants. Another twelve were selected as reservists, but were not sent to basic training. Not surprisingly, the five have resumes studded with advanced scientific and medical degrees, military training, experience flying planes, helicopters, gliders and balloons, and leisure activities like rowing, scuba diving, hiking, skydiving, cycling, sailing, and kayaking,  The group formed a very good team devoid of personal rivalry, said Aschbacher. I told them, one of you will fly first and one will fly last, and they accepted that of course, but from the heart, not just lip service ... the team spirit is very pronounced. 
        
     Sophie Adenot, a French air force helicopter test pilot, said the group was a fantastic crew and a fantastic team. The moment that struck her the most was leaving the airlock for underwater space walk simulation when the instructor said, Welcome to space. And for me it was mind-blowing, I had goosebumps. ... In a few years it is going to be me in space, not in the water with safety divers. When she was a girl dreaming of space travel, I couldnt count the number of people who told me, this dream will never come true. You have unrealistic dreams, and it will never happen. ... Listen to yourself and dont listen to people who dont believe in you.  In addition to Adenot, the ESA class consists of:  Pablo Alvarez Fernandez, a Spanish aeronautical engineer who has worked on the Rosalind Franklin Mars rover intended for a joint mission with Russia that was suspended after the invasion of Ukraine;  Rosemary Coogan, a British astronomer who has researched radiation emissions from black holes;  Raphael Liegeois, a Belgian biomedical engineer and neuroscientist who has researched degenerative diseases of the nervous system, and also flies hot-air balloons and gliders;  Marco Alain Sieber, a Swiss emergency physician who achieved sergeant rank as a paratrooper during his service with the Swiss army.  The group was joined by Katherine Bennell-Pegg from Australia, who underwent training under a cooperation agreement between Australia and ESA. She remains an employee of the Australian Space Agency. Its up to the Australian agency to find a way for her to travel in space. Their yearlong basic training included preparation for the hostile environment encountered in space. They were exposed to multiple times the force of gravity in a centrifuge, and spent hours underwater using scuba gear to float around mockups of space station modules to simulate working in zero gravity. They learned how to recognize symptoms of hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, by experiencing it themselves in a low-pressure chamber. Survival training included dealing with potential splashdown in the ocean and staying warm in winter while waiting to be recovered in case a landing goes off course. On top of that came academic work on scientific topics and learning about the space stations modules and equipment. Intensive Russian language is still part of the program, even though ESA has suspended work with Russia except for the space station, where one of the working languages is Russian.",https://apnews.com/article/europe-space-astronauts-esa-722d4a59d3958f3ff3d53bcf032d034c,science
"One church, two astronauts. How a Texas congregation is supporting its members on the space station","About 10 miles from Johnson Space Center, a Houston-area church takes a moment during Wednesday Bible studies and Sunday evening services to pray for two members who cannot be there.  In fact, theres no way on Earth for NASA astronauts Barry Butch Wilmore and Tracy Dyson to show up at Providence Baptist Church. Theyre in space, orbiting the planet. More specifically, these two members are working on the International Space Station together. Like many astronauts before them, they brought along their faith when they launched into space. God uses all of us in pretty neat ways, and I think I get the most joy from what I do thinking about it in those terms, said Dyson, discussing her job on the Bible Project podcast ahead of her March launch on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.  Dysons six-month mission isnt scheduled to end until September, but Wilmore and his fellow NASA test pilot, Suni Williams, should have been back weeks ago. They are staying longer than expected following thruster failures and helium leaks on Boeings inaugural crew flight for its Starliner capsule. Wilmore and Williams have said they are confident the capsule will return them home safely; engineers are still poring over Starliner test data. Theres no return date yet, which means the congregations worries have subsided for now since they are safe aboard the space station, said Tommy Dahn. He is a pastor for the Pasadena, Texas, church where Dyson worships as a newer member and Wilmore is a longtime elder. Its the launch and return days that ratchet up their anxieties  and prayers.  
        
     We will definitely be on vigil as we find out when thats going to happen, said Dahn, who is in close contact with Wilmore and his wife during the latest mission. Wilmore paused before boarding the Starliner on each launch attempt, huddling in prayer with technicians and Williams. He acknowledged the risks of spaceflight  especially on a test flight like his.  Our families have been a part of this from the beginning. ... As far as preparing them, theyre prepared. We trust in sovereign God. Whatever the plan is, were ready for it, whatever that might be, he told reporters ahead of the flight. Wilmores faith that God is in control gives his family great peace, his wife, Deanna Wilmore, said via text message. He is content on the space station, neither worrying nor fretting, she said.  Were not saying this means that nothing bad will happen or the Starliner will bring Barry home safely, but whatever the Lord does, will be for our good and for His glory, even if they dont fully understand it, she said.  The U.S. space program has had stunning achievements and devastating tragedies.  Former NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins knew space exploration was high-risk, but didnt feel its full weight until his first assignment. A life insurance company drove that home ahead of his Soyuz rocket launch in September 2013, Hopkins said, recalling being told they didnt insure astronauts. Hopkins realized he was not spiritually ready. Between trainings, he began converting to Catholicism, a faith hed been immersed in since he began dating his Catholic wife but insisted he would never join. Its the idea of being an astronaut and recognizing the risks that we take, he said. It felt like something was missing for me. When he received Communion for the first time, he was overcome with a clarity and peace that he wanted to take into space. With his priests help, Hopkins secured permission to take a pyx of consecrated hosts. He administered weekly Communion to himself and on long, intense spacewalk days. It just set the tone for the day, he said. Then, you just go through the step-by-step process of executing the spacewalk but doing it knowing that Christ is with me. Others have taken Communion in space, including Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin after landing on the moon with Neil Armstrong in 1969. The Rev. Wencil Pavlovsky, pastor of St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in the Houston area, helped former astronaut Mark Vande Hei bring Communion into orbit. Vande Hei was aboard the space station in 2017 when Pope Francis called it.  Pavlovsky says ministering to astronauts isnt much different than supporting others: What I do find unique and what I truly, truly appreciate is that they have a very different perspective because they get to look back at us the way God does. Relatedly, there is a phenomenon that philosopher Frank White calls the Overview Effect, when someones worldview shifts after looking at Earth from space.  Thirty-six St. Paul the Apostle parishioners have been astronauts, Pavlovsky said. Established in the 1960s to serve the growing space community, the church embraces its history, including with stained-glass windows designed from Hubble Telescope images and its curated collection of space travel memorabilia. It is unknown how many have practiced their faith in orbit, according to NASA, because some keep it private. But flight-certified religious items are permitted. In 2023, astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli celebrated Hannukah on the space station, sharing a video featuring a menorah, a spinning dreidel and her view of Earth.  Houston Rabbi Shaul Osadchey encouraged a member of his congregation and then astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman to bring the first Torah into space on his final shuttle mission in 1996. Osadchey tracked down a miniature scroll, and he and about 40 synagogue members attended the launch in Florida. We bring our culture and our backgrounds with us where we go, said Osadchey, noting Hoffman read from the Torah, the start of Genesis specifically, on Shabbat. Jeff brought the Jewish tradition into a new domain  new world that is being conquered by humans. The three astronauts aboard Apollo 8 broadcasted their reading from Genesis on Christmas Eve as they flew around the moon, starting with In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth. NASA says it helps observant astronauts stay connected to their faith community. Because of Dyson and Wilmore, their Southern Baptist congregation, which numbers around 250 people on any given Sunday, has had unique opportunities.  Despite the distance, women in the church arranged a care package of sorts  notes of encouragement  for Dyson, said Dahn. Barry, he ministers to us almost, he said, noting how Wilmore makes encouraging calls to congregants while in space. After Wilmore arrived on the space station in early June, he and Dyson appeared live via video at a Providence Baptist Sunday service and gave the congregation a tour of the station, Dahn said. Wilmore taught a lesson before he and others aboard the space station led the congregation in singing Amazing Grace.  Its kind of thrilling, said Dahn, adding that thoughts of God come easily when the astronauts show Earth through the space stations window. Like other theologically conservative Christians, he believes God is the creator of the universe as depicted in the Bible, not the Big Bang or other theories. Its confirming. I dont want to be crass, but it kind of makes us laugh at the Flat Earthers, he said.  Wilmore uses his experience in space to enhance peoples understanding of their Christian beliefs, said Dahn, noting his speaking engagements with the Answers in Genesis ministry, which runs the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, evangelical attractions in Kentucky. Few others can do what Dyson and Wilmore do, although they are unlikely to say so themselves, said Corey Johnson, another Providence Baptist pastor. He thinks of how Wilmore organized a group to build a fence at his home, and how Dyson gladly read his sons a book while visiting. These are uniquely gifted individuals, he said, but theres more to them than what they do for their day job. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

SpaceX lands rocket at sea 2nd time after satellite launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  For the second month in a row, the aerospace upstart SpaceX landed a rocket on an ocean platform early Friday, this time following the successful launch of a Japanese communications satellite. A live webcast showed the first-stage booster touching down vertically in the pre-dawn darkness atop a barge in the Atlantic, just off the Florida coast. The same thing occurred April 8 during a space station supply run for NASA. That was the first successful landing at sea for SpaceX, which expects to start reusing its unmanned Falcon rockets as early as this summer to save money and lower costs. Because of the high altitude needed for this mission, SpaceX did not expect a successful landing. But it was wrong. As the launch commentator happily declared, The Falcon has landed. SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk was even more exuberant. Woohoo!! he exclaimed in bold letters via Twitter. May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar, he added in a tweet. Musk said this was a three-engine burn for the boosters return, so triple deceleration from the last flight. Before liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida, he put the chances of a successful touchdown at maybe even because the rocket was coming in faster and hotter than last time. Musk contends rocket reusability is key to shaving launch costs and making space more accessible. 
        
     SpaceX is the only company to recover a rocket following an orbital launch. It achieved its first booster landing  on solid ground at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station  in December. A landing at sea proved more elusive and required several tries. Blue Origin, led by another wealthy high-tech entrepreneur, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, has landed and even reflown its booster rockets, but those did not put anything into orbit. Following last months landing, Musk said he plans to fly that booster again, possibly as soon as June. The first recovered booster, from December, will grace the entrance of SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Already in the delivery business for NASA, SpaceX hopes to start transporting U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station by the end of next year in the companys next-generation Dragon capsules. But its ultimate goal is Mars. In a groundbreaking announcement last week, Musk said his company will attempt to send a Red Dragon to Mars in 2018  and actually land on the red planet. His ambition is to establish a city on Mars. He also runs Tesla Motors, the electric car company. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-national-fa9aa74bb9664bd9ba630b6abab29359,science
Little Mercury a black dot as it crosses vast face of sun,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  For the first time in 10 years, Mercury passed directly between the Earth and sun on Monday, resembling a black dot against the vast, glowing face of our star. Many stargazers turned to the Internet as NASA provided close-to-real-time images of the 7-hour trek, courtesy of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Although the solar systems small, innermost planet appeared to be trudging along, it actually was zooming past the sun at 106,000 mph. The cosmic show  which began at 7:12 a.m. EDT  was visible from the eastern U.S. and Canada, as well as Western Europe, western Africa and most of South America. Those places were privy to the entire event. The audience grew as the sun rose across North America, revealing Mercurys relatively rare transit. In Eastern Europe, the Middle East, central Asia and most of Africa, sunset had the curtain coming down early. Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea missed out altogether. NASA warned spectators to use high-powered binoculars or telescopes equipped with special filters to protect their eyes from the glaring sun. Eclipse glasses were useless for spotting 3,000-mile-wide Mercury as it crossed the 864,000-mile diameter of the sun. A transit of Mercury occurs only about 13 times a century. The next transit of Mercury wont occur until 2019. Then it wont happen again until 2032. What happens during a transit is really all about perspective, said Jim Green, director of NASAs planetary science division who viewed his first transit of Mercury 46 years ago. He said scientists are taking advantage of Mondays transit to learn more about Mercurys extremely thin atmosphere. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov",https://apnews.com/general-news-7d3f7c45a6dd401e9798e57518695779,science
"International Space Station makes 100,000th orbit of Earth","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Its 100,000 laps around Earth and counting for the International Space Station. The space station reached the orbital milestone  17  years in the making  Monday morning. NASA said these 100,000 orbits are akin to traveling more than 2.6 billion miles. Thats equivalent to 10 round trips to Mars, or almost one way to Neptune. Each orbit takes about 90 minutes; 16 orbits comprise a station day. Astronauts have been living continuously aboard the 250-mile-high complex since 2000. Construction began two years before that. Since then, 222 people have lived or visited there, the vast majority of them 189  men, according to NASA. Altogether, there have been 47 permanent crews representing the U.S., Russian, Canadian, Japanese and European space agencies. Two Americans, three Russians and one Englishman currently call the space station home. They recently achieved a photographic milestone, snapping the 3 millionth picture taken over the years from the scientific outpost. One-hundred-thousand orbits, the journey continues, NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams said in a celebratory video from space. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/international-space-station-makes-100-000th-orbit-of-earth-b3e56663ead84c1a821f1c2c7652034f,science
"Mars, Earth, sun line up perfectly in sky this weekend","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Last week, Mercury stole the show. Now its Mars turn. On Sunday morning, Mars, Earth and the sun will line up perfectly in the sky. This once-every-two-years event is called Mars opposition. Thats because Mars and the sun will be on opposite sides of Earth. Right now, Mars is about 48 million miles from us, coming ever closer until May 30, when the red planet passes within 46.8 million miles. That will be Mars closest approach in 10 1/2 years. In 2018, Mars will get a lot chummier, passing within a mere 36 million miles. The modern-day record of 34.6 million miles between Earth and Mars was set in 2003. That wont be surpassed until the year 2287, according to NASA. At the other end of the scale, Earth and Mars can be as much as 249 million miles apart when they wind up on opposite sides of the sun every couple years. May is proving a busy month for stargazers. On May 9, Mercury passed directly between Earth and the sun, resembling a black dot against our vast, bright star. Telescopes or high-powered binoculars were needed to see that Mercury transit, which occurs just 13 times or so a century. Nothing fancy is needed to gaze upon Mars  just your eyes. Sky-watchers, gazing to the southeast at nightfall, can enjoy a brighter, seemingly bigger Mars well into June. A full moon, on May 21, will add to the viewing pleasure. The Hubble Space Telescope already is zooming in for pictures. On Thursday, the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore released a snapshot of Mars taken May 12 from 50 million miles out. The stunning image shows details as small as 20 to 30 miles across. ___ Online: NASA: http://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/nightsky/",https://apnews.com/mars-earth-sun-line-up-perfectly-in-sky-this-weekend-5a0d8c1474464cda808339056a171ba3,science
"NASAs yearlong spaceman still has sore feet, fatigue","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs yearlong spaceman still is nursing sore feet, stiff legs and fatigue, even after nearly three months back on Earth. Retired astronaut Scott Kelly gave his first major address to NASA employees Wednesday, confiding that while he may have looked good upon landing in Kazakhstan at the beginning of March, he didnt feel that well after returning from the International Space Station. His 340-day mission was the longest single U.S. spaceflight ever. When I got out of the Soyuz ... I didnt really look too bad, Kelly told a packed auditorium at NASA headquarters in Washington. But that was only because Im a very good actor. I think I should be nominated for an Academy Award. My goal here was not to look great. I just had to make sure I didnt look worse than the two guys I was with. My colleagues would never let me hear the end of it, he added with a smile. Kelly was accompanied back to Earth by two Russians, one of whom shared his entire nearly yearlong flight. Back home in Houston, Kelly said he had burning skin, rashes and flu-like symptoms. He said he felt so bad that if he hadnt just returned from space, he would have gone straight to the emergency room. But thats why we do this, he said. We need to learn these things if were going to go to Mars. NASA wants to understand how the body copes with a year of weightlessness, as it gears up to send humans on much longer journeys to Mars beginning in the 2030s. 
        
     Kelly, 52, who retired from NASA shortly after his mission, is now on the speaker circuit and working on a book. He and identical twin brother Mark, a retired astronaut who took part in his brothers medical experiments as a ground subject, sometimes share center stage these days. Last week, they were honored at their elementary school in New Jersey, now named for them both. During Wednesdays presentation, which was broadcast to NASA centers nationwide, Kelly joked that on the space station, I changed positions so many times, you would have thought I was running for president. No longer a civil servant, I can say that now. Someone in the audience wanted to know if Kelly ever felt as though he had to get off the space station, at any point during his mission. I never felt quite like I was climbing the walls, he replied, although not even halfway through, Im thinking this is a really, really long time. In fact, as his Russian Soyuz capsule approached the orbiting outpost in March 2015, Kelly said to himself, Man, this is probably a really dumb idea to be spending a year on the space station. His previous station stay, five years earlier, had lasted barely five months. This flight was twice as long and I felt twice as bad, he said. It took Kelly about six months to recover completely from his five-month station flight. This time, he said, I suspect its probably going to be much longer, especially considering how sore my feet still are after 2  months. But the good news is I do feel better all the time. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew",https://apnews.com/nasas-yearlong-spaceman-still-has-sore-feet-fatigue-6d1d435858194001b742ec88f5b3af7b,science
NASA hits snag while inflating new room at space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA hit a snag while trying to inflate an experimental room at the International Space Station on Thursday and put everything on indefinite hold. Mission Control ordered astronaut Jeffrey Williams to call it quits after the operation had dragged on for more than two hours, with the compartment barely expanding  just a few inches. Later in the day, NASA said engineers wanted to keep monitoring the compartment for any structural changes, and so another inflation try would not be made Friday. Thanks for all your patience today, Mission Control radioed. Thats space business, Williams replied. NASA insisted that the six-man crew was safe and that both the space station and the semi-inflated pod outside were in a stable position. It was supposed to take barely an hour for the commercial test chamber known as BEAM  the worlds first inflatable room for astronauts  to swell four times in volume. Everything went smoothly at first as Williams briefly opened a valve, allowing air to slowly flow into BEAM, short for Bigelow Expandable Activity Module. He did that four more times before Mission Control told him to stop because the room had barely inflated. After a lengthy pause and another try, NASA called the whole thing off and engineers huddled at Johnson Space Center in Houston to try to figure out why BEAM hadnt expanded properly. 
        
     BEAM is the creation of Bigelow Aerospace, founded by hotel entrepreneur Robert Bigelow. NASA paid the North Las Vegas company $17.8 million to test the inflatable-habitat concept at the space station. The soft-sided, multi-layered Beam measured 7 feet long and nearly 8 feet in diameter when delivered last month to the station by SpaceX, packed in the trunk of a capsule loaded with supplies. When fully expanded, the compartment should exceed 13 feet in length and 10 1/2 feet in diameter. Thats the beauty of inflatable spacecraft; they can be packed tightly for launch, then expand and provide lots of room once aloft. Bigelow Aerospace hopes to launch even bigger inflatable habitats in the future for use by tourists orbiting Earth, as well as professional astronauts bound for Mars. Williams and his crewmates arent allowed to go inside the empty BEAM until a week after it is fully inflated, so ground controllers can check for leaks. Except for when astronauts go in to take measurements every few months, the hatch will remain sealed. BEAM is supposed to stay attached to the space station for two years. ___ Online: Bigelow Aerospace: http://bigelowaerospace.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/fl-state-wire-nv-state-wire-86cdb4489d9a437a8c98b37da6a380cc,science
SpaceX lands another rocket after satellite delivery,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX pulled off another rocket landing Friday, the third in just under two months. The first-stage booster of the unmanned Falcon rocket settled vertically onto a barge 400 miles off Floridas east coast, eight minutes after the late afternoon liftoff. Cameras on the barge provided stunning, real-time video. Falcon 9 has landed! said a SpaceX flight commentator. The touchdown occurred after the rocket launched an Asian communications satellite. Like the last successful landing, this one was especially difficult given the speed and heat of the incoming 15-story booster. SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk said via Twitter that the rockets landing speed was close to the design maximum, thus the back and forth motion. He said it was probably OK, but some risk of tipping. No one was aboard the barge at touchdown for safety reasons. SpaceXs first booster landing actually occurred in December  on land at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The California-based company followed up with a successful touchdown on its floating platform in the Atlantic in early April, then again May 6. All three of those recovered boosters are now side by side, horizontally, in a SpaceX hangar. The second recovered booster will be tested and should fly on another mission later this year. Musk wants to recycle boosters to lower launch costs and open space up to more payloads and people. These first-stage boosters normally are discarded in the ocean. SpaceX is the only one ever to land the stages left over from orbital missions. NASA is a major customer; SpaceX flies cargo to the International Space Station and aims to transport astronauts, too, by the end of next year. A glitch in the rockets engine system prevented liftoff Thursday. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacex-lands-another-rocket-after-satellite-delivery-978a5ad598de49eab2dbdc0093fcd7bc,science
NASA successfully inflates new space station room,"CAPE CANVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA successfully inflated a new experimental room at the International Space Station on Saturday, producing the worlds first pump-it-up compartment for astronauts. The operation took much longer than expected, stretching over three days in all. But victory, when it came, was sweet. A significant milestone has been accomplished, Bigelow Aerospace, the inflatable chambers creator, cheered via Twitter. Astronaut Jeffrey Williams spent seven hours Saturday opening and closing an air valve to expand the compartment. Enough air finally seeped inside so that the puffy white pod could stretch to its full 13 feet in length and 10  feet in diameter  the volume equivalent to a small bedroom. Internal air tanks provided the final pressurization to complete the job. Williams and his five crewmates will have to wait a week before venturing inside. NASA wants to make certain the chamber is airtight before opening the door. It was NASAs second shot at inflating the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, named for the aerospace company that built it as a precursor to moon and Mars habitats, and orbiting tourist hotels. BEAM barely expanded during Thursdays inflation attempt. Experts believe the soft-sided compartment was packed up tight for so long before last months launch that the fabric layers had trouble unfolding. Pressure inside the chamber was relieved Friday to ease the friction among the multiple layers. That apparently did the trick. The cubicle swelled an additional six feet in length Saturday, looking more and more like a giant beach ball with every pulse of air. 
        
     In all, Williams opened the valve 25 times Saturday for a total of 2  minutes worth of air flowing from the space station into the chamber. Popping noises could be heard as pressure built up inside BEAM  it sounded like popcorn in a frying pan. Officials said it was the sound of internal straps releasing as the pod swelled in both length and girth. NASA insisted on taking it slow to avoid a sudden pressurization of BEAM that could stress the connecting parts of the space station. The North Las Vegas-based Bigelow Aerospace provided this first inflatable room ever built for astronauts, which it based on a 1990s NASA concept. NASA paid $17.8 million for the technology demo, which could lead to an even bigger inflatable room at the space station. Founder Robert Bigelow, a longtime hotel entrepreneur, already is working on a pair of private inflatable space stations that could fly in a few years. He sees inflatables as the spaceflights future. Because expandable spacecraft can be compressed for launch, the rockets can carry more cargo, yet space travelers can still enjoy lots of room. The standard aluminum rooms that make up the space station  essentially fancy cans  can never be larger than what fits into a rocket. BEAM  empty except for sensors  will remain attached to the orbiting lab for two years as engineers measure temperature, radiation levels and resistance to space debris impacts. It will be off limits most of the time to astronauts, given its experimental status. SpaceX delivered BEAM early last month, and it was installed on the outside of the 250-mile-high outpost. Launch delays kept it grounded an extra half-year. ___ Online: Bigelow Aerospace: http://bigelowaerospace.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/nasa-successfully-inflates-new-space-station-room-935882607cc643709e75d52154d1f3b5,science
SpaceXs 4th recovered rocket arrives leaning on barge,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Call it the Leaning Tower of SpaceX. SpaceXs fourth recovered rocket returned to shore Thursday, leaning to one side but still standing tall on its ocean-landing platform. The first-stage booster pushed the limits during the landing last Friday. Its speed was close to the design maximum for the rocket and the support system for its legs. Although the 15-story rocket was in danger of tipping over, it remained upright as it pulled into Port Canaveral, smudged black in places. Fridays touchdown followed the rockets launch of a satellite. SpaceX is working to recycle its rockets; the first one may again fly in two to three months. Chief executive Elon Musk said the booster represents 70 percent of the cost of a Falcon rocket, on the order of $30 million to $35 million. So it makes sense, he said, to reuse the pieces. In fact, he said at Code Conference 2016 in Southern California on Wednesday, its tragic to discard them in the ocean, as has been the case throughout history. Musk said he tells his team, Imagine there was a pallet of cash that was plummeting through the atmosphere and it was going to burn up and smash into tiny pieces. Would you try to save it? Probably yes. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. So we want to get it back, and that way we dont have to make another one. I think its quite tragic if rockets like get smashed into tiny pieces. 
        
     The Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX is the first and only rocket-maker to land boosters used in orbital missions. Blue Origins touchdowns in Texas have occurred following suborbital flights. SpaceXs first successful landing occurred in December at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Three sea landings have followed off Floridas east coast, first in April, then two more in May. The stages look quite good, according to Musk. For the landing, the rocket flips around, uses its engines to slow down and sets down on pop-out legs. Musk said the company is working hard to whittle down a six-month backlog in Falcon 9 launches, following last summers launch accident that destroyed cargo for the International Space Station. NASA represents about a quarter of this business, with commercial satellite operators and science payloads making up the rest. SpaceX hopes to launch astronauts to the space station by the end of next year in beefed-up Dragon capsules, and in 2018 send an unmanned Dragon to Mars. He foresees sending humans to Mars via SpaceX rockets and spacecraft in 2024, if things go according to plan. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/fl-state-wire-ca-state-wire-3dbf2612e5674af5a77edc5a6cfccb38,science
Lights drown out Milky Way for third of worlds population,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  More than one-third of the worlds population can no longer see the Milky Way because of man-made lights. Among those missing out on awe-inspiring Milky Way views: nearly 80 percent of North Americans and 60 percent of Europeans. These are the findings of a new global atlas of light pollution, published as part of a scientific paper Friday. More than four-fifths of Earthlings now live beneath skies polluted by artificial light, which blocks out the Milky Way for more than a third of them, according to the research. I hope that this atlas will finally open the eyes of people to light pollution, lead author Fabio Falchi said in a statement. He is with the Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute in northern Italy. Tiny Singapore is the most light-polluted country; the entire population loses out on seeing the true night sky. Kuwait and Qatar are close runners-up. On the opposite end of the spectrum  countries whose populations are exposed to the least light pollution  are Chad, Central African Republic and Madagascar. Falchi and his team members warn the problem affects more than astronomers. Its profoundly altered a fundamental human experience, namely that of pondering the night sky. Co-author Christopher Elvidge, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Centers for Environmental Information in Boulder, Colorado, bemoans the fact that whole generations of Americans have never seen the Milky Way. 
        
     Its a big part of our connection to the cosmos  and its been lost, he said in a statement. The situation is even worse for some animals. Artificial light can confuse insects, birds and sea turtles, with deadly results. Theres also the waste of energy and money, the researchers point out. The National Park Services Dan Duriscoe, a co-author, noted that some national parks in the West like Yellowstone are among the last refuges of darkness in the U.S. Urban light a few hundred miles away or more can spoil nighttime vistas, even in pristine federal land like Death Valley National Park in Southern California.

Capsule full of space station junk makes fiery re-entry,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A capsule filled with space station trash bit the cosmic dust Wednesday with a keenly interested scientific audience. The cargo carrier broke apart and burned up while re-entering Earths atmosphere high above the Pacific. Researchers gathered information on the breakup from sensors it carried, in hopes that the data will improve future spacecraft. Built by Virginia-based Orbital ATK Inc., the capsule had been cut loose from the International Space Station last week. It followed its own orbit until it was steered into the atmosphere, where it was consumed by the heat of re-entry. The vessel had been the scene of another fiery experiment shortly after it left the space station. A large blaze deliberately was ignited in it so NASA could study the spread of flames in weightlessness. Like the re-entry test, this, too, was aimed at enhancing spacecraft safety. The so-called Cygnus vessel was named the S.S. Rick Husband, after the commander of the doomed space shuttle Columbia. Husband and six other astronauts were killed as Columbia broke apart during re-entry in 2003, the result of launch damage. NASA is paying Orbital ATK, as well as SpaceX, to stockpile the space station. SpaceX has another station supply run coming up next month, while Orbital ATK plans to resume launches from Wallops Island, Virginia, in August. Orbital ATK temporarily moved its Cygnus flights to Cape Canaveral, Florida, after its Antares rocket exploded during liftoff from Wallops Island in 2014. 
        
     This latest Cygnus was launched to the space station from Florida back in March, using another companys rocket. Once the supplies were unloaded, the capsule was filled with more than 4,000 pounds of garbage and discarded equipment for disposal. It had delivered twice that much. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-19925dac9c034cfcbf757fc678a0d77c,science

The unmanned Atlas V rocket blasted into a brilliantly clear sky Friday morning. It was the first Atlas flight by rocket maker United Launch Alliance since March, when a fuel-valve problem popped up on a space station delivery for NASA. The first stage of that rocket shut down six seconds too soon, but the second stage took control and put the Cygnus cargo ship in the proper orbit. United Launch Alliance grounded its Atlas fleet until it could fix the problem. Everything worked right Friday, according to the company, and the satellite reached its targeted orbit. The launch was the fifth in a series of advanced Navy communication satellites for use by the U.S. military worldwide. Less than two weeks ago, the companys Delta IV rocket hoisted a secret spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office. Atlas rockets have been launching for almost 60 years.

But theyll have a newfound appreciation for the massive scientific undertaking that is moving closer toward finding one. Cabrol writes that were in the midst of a golden age of astrobiology, and her book is an awe-inspiring and lucid primer for the general public on her field. That golden age is highlighted by images captured by the Webb Space Telescope that have transformed the publics understanding of the universe. From the moon to planets that mirror settings from Star Wars, Cabrol takes readers on a descriptive tour of the universe and the building blocks of life that scientists continue to chase.  Her writing and effort to broaden the publics appreciation of the universes jaw-dropping vastness is unsurprisingly reminiscent of Sagan, the popular astronomer and namesake of the center she leads. And, like Sagan, she makes a compelling case for why we may not be alone in the universe. She also offers a fascinating preview of future space missions that may help answer that question even further.

Telescope reveals amazing pillars in star-breeding ground,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A peek into a distant star-breeding ground has uncovered scenes worthy of a watercolor master. Astronomers on Wednesday released majestic images of pillars of gas and dust in the Carina Nebula, some 7,500 light-years away. The observations were taken by the European Southern Observatorys Very Large Telescope in Chile. The pictures rank right with the Hubble Space Telescopes famous Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula, an image now 21 years old. Scientists say these new images appear to be pillars of destruction, in which massive new stars destroy the clouds of gas from which they were born. They do that by blasting out radiation. Scientists were able to see the effect of this so-called photo evaporation in the dissipating pillars. ___ Online: European Southern Observatory: http://www.eso.org/public/",https://apnews.com/telescope-reveals-amazing-pillars-in-star-breeding-ground-4f2e8903316f41dfa45fcfbfaa5c234b,science
I voted from space': Lone American off planet casts ballot,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The lone American off the planet has cast his vote from space, keeping with NASAs motto of Vote while you float. NASA said Monday that astronaut Shane Kimbrough filed his ballot in Tuesdays presidential election from the International Space Station sometime over the past few days. He arrived at the orbiting lab in mid-October. Before launching on a four-month mission, Kimbrough said it was going to be special, being able to say I voted from space. By the time hes back on Earth in February, America will have a new commander in chief. Astronauts are pretty much apolitical, he told reporters last month. And Ill be glad to welcome the new president, whoever that is. The previous U.S. space station resident, Kate Rubins, also cast an absentee ballot from up there, before returning to Earth a week ago, according to NASA. A 1997 Texas law allows U.S. astronauts to vote from space. For NASA astronauts, home is Houston when theyre not circling the globe. A secure electronic ballot is forwarded to the astronauts by Mission Control in Houston and returned by email to the county clerk. Kimbrough is sharing the space station with two Russians. The crew will double in size at the end of next week, adding another American, a Russian and a Frenchman. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/events-united-states-presidential-election-699f2055faa14ec5aa8091f9691cca31,science
Mondays supermoon extra super; closest in nearly 69 years,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The moon doesnt get much bigger and brighter than this. On Monday, Earthlings will be treated to a so-called supermoon  the closest full moon of the year. Mondays supermoon will be extra super  it will be the closest the moon comes to us in almost 69 years. And it wont happen again for another 18 years. NASA says closest approach will occur at 6:21 a.m. EST when the moon comes within 221,523 miles (356,508 kilometers). Thats from the center of the Earth to the center of the moon. Full moon will occur at 8:52 a.m. EST. NASA planetary geologist Noah Petro is urging everyone to step outside and soak in the view. At the time of closest approach, the moon will be setting and the sun rising, at least on the U.S. East Coast, so prime viewing will be Sunday and Monday nights there. Ultimately, people should be more geared toward just getting outside and enjoying it, Petro said. Supermoons can appear 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter in the night sky. But it takes a real expert to notice the difference. Petro, deputy project scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter circling the moon, said Thursday that even he wont be able to see much difference in size and luminosity. What counts, he said, is getting people talking, thinking and caring about the moon. Weather permitting, its a sky show the entire planet can enjoy. 
        
     Everyone gets to see the moon, Petro said. Its a great shared resource for all humanity. The last time the moon was so close  actually, 29 miles closer  was in January 1948. Thats the same year the Cleveland Indians last won the World Series, Petro noted, a big year, at least there. In 2034, the moon will come even closer, within 221,485 miles. That, too, will be a supermoon. ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/novembers-spectacular-supermoon",https://apnews.com/mondays-supermoon-extra-super-closest-in-nearly-69-years-08d80b0696cc47b9b56c96a6b50f1823,science
An AP photographer explains how he captured the moment of eclipse totality,"FORT WORTH, TEXAS (AP)  Photographer Mat Otero has been working at the AP in the Dallas bureau for nearly 30 years. In that time, hes covered an annular and partial solar eclipse, so he was prepared for the challenge of making a photo of the only total solar eclipse on this scale he will likely cover in his career (the next coast-to-coast eclipse in the U.S. is expected in 21 years). This is what he said about making this extraordinary image. My job is to create and curate eye catching images that will draw a viewer in, communicating from my lens to their eyes and brain. Thats part of the magic of AP  our work makes a truly massive journey every day, from the field to viewers around the world. With millions interested in such a historic and widely photographed event as this eclipse, I knew that anything I produced would need to grab attention immediately and be dispatched ASAP after the moment. We joke at AP that every millisecond is our deadline.  Our modern cameras can capture massive amounts of photos, requiring us to manage and edit for best choices in a very fast fashion. In the minutes and seconds before the eclipse, clouds flowed in and out. I thought I was going to get skunked and have nothing. Ultimately the clouds opened, parting for a few minutes and allowing the light into my camera to make this photo. 
        
     Leading up to the eclipse, I had illustrated an AP story about research at the Fort Worth Zoo into how animals react to the darkness, so it was decided to position me there for the actual eclipse. We were just inside the edge of totality, so the event was going to be a little bit faster than locations near the center of its path across the country. I have an assortment of neutral density filters because I had previously photographed an annular eclipse, when the moon is farther away in its Earth orbit and therefore doesnt block the entirety of the sun. An annulus of bright sunlight rings the moon, but the spectacular corona isnt visible as it would be during a total eclipse. This time, I used the filters to make a solar optical filter for use with a new 200-600mm lens  that would be my primary camera. I also had wide and mid-range angled cameras, both mounted on a tripod to be trigged by remotes. I read as much as I could about photographing a total eclipse. I ran tests with gear, shooting position and sun placement. A sun tracking app was a useful guide for where the sun would be in the sky. Because the sun was at such a high angle above, I decided the best position was to lay flat on my back looking up. I practiced laying on a yoga block and mat holding a long-lensed camera and keeping as still as possible. Seeking to get the lushest look out of the camera and reducing the possibility of digital noise, I chose to photograph at a slower shutter speed (1/50 of a sec.) and ISO (160) with a 6.3 aperture to better show possible solar prominences  the reddish trails of plasma that loop off the suns surface. Yoga mat in tow, I made sure to pack a small lunch for myself and a reporter working our spot in the Zoo gallery. As totality moved in, there were a couple of technical issues that needed working out: changing to a hard wire when my remote did not work and repositioning the tripod to frame the sky  wheres the sun again? I sometimes describe my job as looking through a straw and now its also on a cloudy day. I had read and talked with other photogs about how fast the light-burst phase of the eclipse would pass but, wow, was it faster and more dazzling than I expected. I might have audibly gasped as I prayed and sprayed, firing frames and watching the ever-changing light. I even said to myself aloud, You can see the fire. Thankfully, the clouds stayed open long enough to allow a good look. As soon as the giant shadow passed over, I tagged my possible best photos in the camera, then ingested them into my laptop for a quick edit and dispatch to the photo desk editors.  Visual communication can be timeless, needing no translation. This photo captured a fraction of a second in time, showing wisps of solar energy and light fighting to get around the dark side of the moon. It feels like a secret look into the cosmos and the celestial dance of the Earth, moon and sun, all running rings around each other at incomprehensible speeds. The photo reminds me of ancient Native American rock art, depicting the solar eclipses our ancestors watched, just like us. ___ For more extraordinary AP photography, click here.",https://apnews.com/article/total-solar-eclipse-photo-df822c5f7a0d13677753aa4537de0288,science
NASAs earliest and greatest astronauts star in new exhibit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs earliest and greatest astronauts gathered at Kennedy Space Center on Friday to mark the grand opening of a new space exhibit in which theyre the stars. Thirty astronauts, three of them moonwalkers, took part in the outdoor ceremony, including two who had extra reason to celebrate. Fifty years ago Friday, Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin launched on Gemini 12, the last of that program. With all the excitement, Lovell forgot about Fridays anniversary  until reminded by a reporter. He said spacewalks and rendezvous were refined on the two-man Gemini missions and opened up the road to Apollo. He later flew on Apollo  Apollo 8, the first manned flight to the moon, and the infamous, close-call Apollo 13. Lovells Boy Scout handbook is on display at the exhibits new United States Astronaut Hall of Fame  relocated from its original location six miles down the road  along with his scouting sash and merit badges. I cant believe its 50 years since the last Gemini flight, said Thomas Stafford of Gemini 6 and 9, Apollo 10 and the Apollo-Soyuz joint mission between the United States and Soviet Union. Staffords Gemini 9 capsule is on display. Its minus its hatches and some other items, he noted, but otherwise still looks in good shape. Its a beautiful exhibit, Stafford, 86, told The Associated Press. To me, its something thats inspirational ... motivational for the young people. 
        
     In all, 30 U.S. astronauts spanning Gemini to shuttle  two of them women  gathered at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex for the morning ceremony, which paid high tribute to NASAs golden age of the 1960s and 1970s. Also present: the children of the late Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and the late Neil Armstrong, the first man to step onto the moon. The retired astronauts  25 of them Hall of Famers in matching navy blazers  joined a few hundred space program workers, military veterans, space buffs and tourists in the sunshine, right outside the new visitor center exhibit, called Heroes and Legends. Carved into fiberglass on the side of the building, a 30-foot-tall bas relief of the original Mercury 7 astronauts looked down on the crowd. Mercury 7s lone survivor, John Glenn, 95, sent best wishes. The event was deliberately held on Veterans Day. All of the early astronauts were military men, as were many of the later space shuttle fliers. The holiday enabled some children to attend without skipping school; a few dressed up in astronaut suits. During the ceremony, the 88-year-old Lovell said he doesnt consider himself in the same company of his own hero, Charles Lindbergh. Ever humble like so many of his colleagues, Lovell said he just did what he thought was proper and exciting and something for the country. I guess Im just a lucky guy, he said, grinning, as some of the audience laughed given his commanders role on Apollo 13. Apollo 15 command module pilot Al Worden, 84, pointed out that the visitor complex showcases a Saturn V moon rocket and space shuttle Atlantis, not to mention all these new artifacts and relics that I think people a thousand years from now are going to be happy to see. Theyre going to think back on the wonderful days that weve had here, Worden told the crowd. And I guess in that same vein, that makes me a relic, too. Apollo 16 moonwalker Charlie Duke, 81, offered this advice to everyone, particularly the young people in the audience and watching on NASA TV: Dream big, aim high. ___ Online: Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex: https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/",https://apnews.com/nasas-earliest-and-greatest-astronauts-star-in-new-exhibit-80eb4b03562b4ac084621f03e7d2803b,science
NASA astronaut on verge of becoming oldest woman in space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson is on the verge of becoming the oldest woman in space, adding to her long list of barrier-breaking records. Whitson will be 56 when she rockets off the planet Thursday. Shell celebrate her 57th birthday in February on the International Space Station. Thats a far cry from John Glenns space shuttle flight at age 77 and a few years shy of the male runners-up. But its enough to beat Barbara Morgans record as the worlds oldest spacewoman. Morgan waited so long to fulfill her role as Christa McAuliffes teacher-in-space backup that she was 55 when she finally flew in 2007. This will be the third space station mission for Whitson, an Iowa-born biochemist, and her second stint as commander. Shell launch from Kazakhstan with two younger men, Russian and French. Theyll join an American and two Russians at the space station. It is a great place to work and live, and I feel really lucky that we are going to be with friends while were there, Whitson said Wednesday at the traditional day-before-launch news conference. Even if Im just cleaning the vents in the fans, it all is important. Whitson was the first woman to serve as commander of the space station  in 2007, nine years into its lifetime. She also was the first  and so far only  woman to head NASAs male-dominated astronaut corps. No other woman has spent more time in space. 
        
     Strict when it comes to lifetime radiation exposure, NASA insisted Whitson remain Earth-bound for a while after her last mission. I would have rather gone sooner, but Ill deal with it, she said over the summer. Shell ride a Soyuz rocket with a Russian cosmonaut, Oleg Novitskiy, 45, and a French newcomer to space, Thomas Pesquet, whos 38. Launch is 3:20 p.m. EST Thursday, 2:20 a.m. Friday at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Dear Peggy, youre such a brave woman who has won over hearts of all Baikonur residents, city administrator Anatoly Petrenko said during a ceremony Wednesday. I admire you. All the best at launch. During training, a French documentary crew followed Pesquet, focusing on his relative youth and fresh eyes. Whitson said the interest on her, by comparison, was for being old and experienced. All right, yes, Im old, she said in a NASA interview. She noted in a recent series of preflight interviews that it gets easier with age, knowing what to expect on a spaceflight and how to prioritize. At Wednesdays press conference, Whitson said that while shell miss her friends and family  biochemist husband Clarence Sams also works for NASA  probably the biggest challenge is the lack of variety in space food. There will be French food this time, Pesquet assured her. He and his crewmates will enjoy dishes whipped up in advance by top chefs; Pesquet said hell prepare the New Years feast. Whitson already has spent 377 days in space and performed multiple spacewalks. Her upcoming six-month mission should push her beyond 534 days in space, the U.S. record set in September by 58-year-old astronaut Jeffrey Williams. Whitson said shes had a lucky run with few regrets. But she told reporters last summer: In terms of goals for NASA before I die, we need to be living on Mars. And I might not live that long, so they better get with it! ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/nasa-astronaut-on-verge-of-becoming-oldest-woman-in-space-981bdcca15a54aa18330cb664f5bfa5b,science
Best US weather satellite ever awaits sunset launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The nations most advanced weather satellite ever awaits a sunset liftoff. NASA is launching the $1 billion GOES-R satellite for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. An unmanned Atlas rocket is scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 5:42 p.m. Saturday. The satellite will aim for a 22,300-mile-high orbit, where it will churn out the sharpest and fastest pictures yet of hurricanes, tornadoes and other U.S. weather. NOAA (NO-ah) expects it to revolutionize forecasting. Its part of a new $11 billion system that ultimately will include four satellites. Two-dozen meteorologists from around the country are on hand for the big event. The weather, appropriately enough, couldnt be better for launching. GOES-R eventually will become known as GOES-16. It will join three other weather satellites already in orbit.",https://apnews.com/weather-forecasts-general-news-weather-65a91c3d609d40f7bb4aec18da480e2a,science
"Space station receives oldest female astronaut, bit of Mars","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station gained three new residents Saturday, including the oldest and most experienced woman to orbit the world. A bit of Mars also arrived, courtesy of a Frenchman who brought along a small piece of a Mars meteorite. Launched Thursday from Kazakhstan, the Russian Soyuz capsule docked at the 250-mile-high outpost just an hour or two before NASA launched a weather satellite from Florida. The Soyuz delivered NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. They joined three men already on board, one American and two Russians. This is the third space station mission for Whitson, who at 56 is older than each of her crewmates. She already holds the record for most time in space for a woman: nearly 400 days during her various missions. By the time she returns next spring, she should break the record for any American, man or woman. We could not be more proud, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told Whitson once she entered the space station. He joined the new crews family and friends at Russias Mission Control outside Moscow to welcome the newcomers on board. Im really happy to be here, Whitson replied. A biochemist by training, Whitson will celebrate her 57th birthday at the orbiting lab in February. Until Thursday, no woman older than 55 had flown in space. 
        
     Pesquet, meanwhile, is making his first spaceflight and Novitskiy his second. Before rocketing away, Pesquet told reporters he was taking up a piece of a Mars meteorite to illustrate the necessary union between human and robotic explorers. He intends to bring the stone back with him to Earth in six months. It then will launch aboard a Mars rover and return to its home planet. So its going to be the most experienced space traveler there is in the world, Pesquet said Wednesday at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The idea is to show that space exploration is just the whole ... were not competing against robotic exploration, were all working together. What we do on the (space station) is just one step on that road to exploration. Sunday marks the 18th anniversary of the launch of the first space station piece. Its now as big as a football field, with a mass of 1 million pounds and eight miles of electrical wiring. Whitson and company represent its 50th full-time expedition. So we can celebrate the stations birthday today, said Sergei Krikalev, a cosmonaut-turned-space official who spoke from the Russian control center. Good luck. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/space-station-receives-oldest-female-astronaut-bit-of-mars-33e8df5a505b407b960158f9710d34f8,science
Best weather satellite ever built rockets into space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The most advanced weather satellite ever built rocketed into space Saturday night, part of an $11 billion effort to revolutionize forecasting and save lives. This new GOES-R spacecraft will track U.S. weather as never before: hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, volcanic ash clouds, wildfires, lightning storms, even solar flares. Indeed, about 50 TV meteorologists from around the country converged on the launch site  including NBCs Al Roker  along with 8,000 space program workers and guests. Whats so exciting is that were going to be getting more data, more often, much more detailed, higher resolution, Roker said. In the case of tornadoes, if we can give people another 10, 15, 20 minutes, were talking about lives being saved. Think superhero speed and accuracy for forecasting. Super high-definition TV, versus black-and-white. Really a quantum leap above any satellite NOAA has ever flown, said Stephen Volz, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations director of satellites. For the American public, that will mean faster, more accurate weather forecasts and warnings, Volz said earlier in the week. That also will mean more lives saved and better environmental intelligence for government officials responsible for hurricane and other evacuations. Airline passengers also stand to benefit, as do rocket launch teams. Improved forecasting will help pilots avoid bad weather and help rocket scientists know when to call off a launch. 
        
     NASA declared success 3 1/2 hours after liftoff, following separation from the upper stage. The first in a series of four high-tech satellites, GOES-R hitched a ride on an unmanned Atlas V rocket, delayed an hour by rocket and other problems. NOAA teamed up with NASA for the mission. The satellite  valued by NOAA at $1 billion  is aiming for a 22,300-mile-high equatorial orbit. There, it will join three aging spacecraft with 40-year-old technology, and become known as GOES-16. After months of testing, this newest satellite will take over for one of the older ones. The second satellite in the series will follow in 2018. All told, the series should stretch to 2036. GOES stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. The first was launched in 1975. GOES-Rs premier imager  one of six science instruments  will offer three times as many channels as the existing system, four times the resolution and five times the scan speed, said NOAA program director Greg Mandt. A similar imager is also flying on a Japanese weather satellite. Typically, it will churn out full images of the Western Hemisphere every 15 minutes and the continental United States every five minutes. Specific storm regions will be updated every 30 seconds. Forecasters will get pictures like theyve never seen before, Mandt promised. A first-of-its-kind lightning mapper, meanwhile, will take 500 snapshots a second. This next-generation GOES program  $11 billion in all  includes four satellites, an extensive land system of satellite dishes and other equipment, and new methods for crunching the massive, nonstop stream of expected data. Hurricane Matthew, interestingly enough, delayed the launch by a couple weeks. As the hurricane bore down on Florida in early October, launch preps were put on hold. Matthew stayed far enough offshore to cause minimal damage to Cape Canaveral, despite some early forecasts that suggested a direct strike. ___ Online: NOAA: http://www.noaa.gov/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/general-news-16dd77439cc1452eaf49c19abfb9cc41,science

NASA spacecraft embarks on ring-skimming mission at Saturn,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Consider it a cosmic carousel with countless rings up for grabs. NASAs Saturn-orbiting spacecraft, Cassini, has begun an unprecedented mission to skim the planets rings. On Tuesday, Cassini got a gravitational assist from Saturns big moon Titan. That put the spacecraft on course to graze Saturns main outer rings over the next five months. The first orbit of this new venture begins Wednesday night. Then on Sunday, an engine firing by Cassini should seal the deal, with the spacecraft making its first ring crossing. Launched nearly 20 years ago, Cassini will swoop down through the outer edge of rings every seven days. The spacecraft should make 20 dives through April, observing some of Saturns many mini moons and even sampling ring particles and gases. This will be Cassinis last hurrah before a suicide plunge into Saturn next September. Saturn has five main rings, and other fainter ones, made up of chunks of ice and rock. First spotted by Galileo in 1610, the rings are named alphabetically in order of discovery. Initially, Cassini will cross a faint ring formed by meteors striking two mini moons, according to scientists at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The spacecraft will venture into the fringes of the considerably more substantial F ring in March and April. This so-called F ring  a relatively narrow 500 miles (800 kilometers) wide  is Saturns outermost major ring and appears to be in constant flux. 
        
     Even though were flying closer to the F ring than we ever have, well still be more than 4,850 miles (7,800 kilometers) distant, project manager Earl Maize said in a statement. Theres very little concern over dust hazard at that range. At the same time, Cassini will pass as close as 56,000 miles (90,000 kilometers) above Saturns clouds  until its grand-finale death dive. Cassini rocketed away from Cape Canaveral in 1997, went into orbit around Saturn in 2004, and released the European Huygens lander for touchdown on largest moon Titan in 2005. After logging more than 2 billion miles, the spacecraft is getting low on fuel, thus its intended demise in September 2017. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/fl-state-wire-ca-state-wire-431f5c2489ae4809814104693b150f61,science
Ailing Buzz Aldrin evacuated from South Pole to New Zealand,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)  An ailing Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, was evacuated from the South Pole to New Zealand where he was in a hospital on Friday in stable condition. Aldrin, 86, was visiting Antarctica as a tourist when he fell ill. He was flown to Christchurch from McMurdo Station, a U.S. research center on the Antarctic coast. Tour company White Desert said Aldrin has fluid in his lungs, but was responding well to antibiotics. Hell remain hospitalized overnight for observation. His manager Christina Korp, who accompanied him, said he was in good spirits. On Twitter, she said the past 24 hours had been grueling. She posted side-by-side photos of Aldrin  one on a stretcher giving a thumbs-up with a purple knit cap on his head, another in a hospital bed, on oxygen and with an IV in his left arm. Aldrin and Neil Armstrong became the first men on the moon, on July 20, 1969. Armstrong died in 2012. Just three weeks ago, Aldrin was at NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Florida for the unveiling of a new astronaut exhibit. The ceremony coincided with the 50th anniversary of his launch with Jim Lovell on Gemini 12, the last of the two-man Gemini flights. Both were present and looked as energetic as usual. Aldrin has crisscrossed the globe in recent months and years, pushing hard for human exploration of Mars and promoting space and science education. His latest book, No Dream Is Too High: Life Lessons from a Man who Walked on the Moon, came out in April. And year, he teamed up with Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida, now home to the Buzz Aldrin Space Institute. Aldrin lives in nearby Satellite Beach, Florida, not far from Cape Canaveral and its launch pads. 
        
     We wish Buzz a speedy recovery, the London-based White Desert said in a statement. Aldrin was part of an Antarctica sightseeing tour, along with son Andrew. The elder Aldrin was clearly excited about his adventure to the bottom of the world: South Pole here I come! he said via Twitter on Nov. 28. The group departed Tuesday from Cape Town, South Africa, on a trip that was supposed to last just over a week. Doctors agreed an evacuation was prudent after Aldrins condition deteriorated, according to his staff in Florida. The National Science Foundation helped provide the air lift via a ski-equipped LC-130 cargo plane from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to McMurdo, and then on to New Zealand on another plane. ___ Dunn reported from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Japan launches much-needed supplies to space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A Japanese capsule blasted off with much-needed supplies for the International Space Station on Friday, a week after a Russian shipment was destroyed shortly after liftoff. The Russian rocket accident and the grounding of one of NASAs commercial suppliers make this delivery all the more urgent. The spacecraft should arrive at the station Tuesday. Have a safe flight, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet said in a tweet from the space station. Looking forward to your arrival! The capsule  called Kounotori, or white stork  contains nearly 5 tons of food, water and other supplies, including six new lithium-ion batteries for the stations solar power system. Astronauts will conduct spacewalks next month to replace the old nickel-hydrogen batteries that store energy generated by the stations big solar panels. This is Japans sixth shipment to the 250-mile-high outpost, currently home to Pesquet, two Americans and three Russians. It launched from Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan. Launches by SpaceX, meanwhile, have been on hold since a September rocket explosion on the pad in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The helium pressurization system in the rockets upper stage was breached, resulting in a massive fireball. The company hopes to resume flights next month from Southern California. Iridium Communications satellites will be aboard that initial launch. A space station supply run is supposed to follow a few weeks later from Cape Canaveral. 
        
     In a televised interview from the space station following Fridays launch, NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson said there are already enough supplies to last until spring. The Japanese shipment will stretch that out even further. The Russians lost a spacesuit in the Dec. 1 launch accident, among many other items, she noted. Spaceflights not an easy thing, Whitson said. We just have to keep pressing ourselves to do the right thing, make sure were doing all the right tests ... so that we dont have these problems. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/japan-launches-much-needed-supplies-to-space-station-77b262b83dc446a08a5859ce6dc16cc2,science
NASA spacecraft halfway between Pluto and next smaller stop,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs New Horizons spacecraft is now halfway between Pluto and its next much, much smaller stop. New Horizons  which reached the milestone this week  is bound for an even more remote object called 2014 MU69. Like Pluto, the object orbits in our solar systems twilight zone known as the Kuiper Belt, but is barely 1 percent its size. MU69 is nearly 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto. The spacecraft will swoop past MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019. That flyby will set the record for the most distant world ever explored in the history of civilization, chief investigator Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said in a statement. With another 466 million miles (750 million kilometers) remaining, New Horizons will go into a five-month hibernation later this week. Although still zooming along, the spacecraft is slowing down slightly as it gets farther from the sun. Besides aiming for MU69, New Horizons will study a couple dozen other Kuiper Belt objects from afar. New Horizons arrived at Pluto in July 2015, becoming its first visitor from Earth. It launched from Cape Canaveral in 2006. The spacecraft is currently 3.5 billion miles (5.7 billion kilometers) from home. It takes radio signals five hours and 20 minutes to reach the spacecraft from the control center at Johns Hopkins University in Laurel, Maryland. ___ Online: Johns Hopkins: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/",https://apnews.com/nasa-spacecraft-halfway-between-pluto-and-next-smaller-stop-8b8b29d4a42945a0aa26624798e2d832,science
Reused rocket back in port after satellite launch by SpaceX,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs first reused rocket is back in port, five days after launching a satellite. The singed 15-story booster returned atop a barge to Floridas Port Canaveral on Tuesday. It was the second flight for the Falcon 9s first-stage core  and a first for SpaceX. Both times, the leftover booster landed upright on an ocean platform following liftoff. SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk has championed recycling rockets since his companys founding 15 years ago, to save time and money. Usually, theyre discarded into the ocean after launch. Musk plans to retire the recycled booster and display it in Cape Canaveral. SpaceX, meanwhile, plans to launch another satellite this month, but with a fresh booster. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/general-news-national-national-d49c80f42e474969b2298fa8a21b42d5,science
Veteran NASA spacewoman getting 3 extra months in orbit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The worlds oldest and most experienced spacewoman is getting three extra months in orbit. NASA announced Wednesday that astronaut Peggy Whitson will remain on the International Space Station until September. The 57-year-old astronaut arrived last November and was supposed to return to Earth in June. But under an agreement between NASA and the Russian Space Agency, shell stay another three months and take advantage of an empty seat on a Soyuz capsule in the fall. This mission  her third  will now last close to 10 months. Scientists are eager to monitor any changes to her body, to add to the knowledge gained from retired astronaut Scott Kellys recent one-year flight. The two men she flew up with in November  Frances Thomas Pesquet and Russias Oleg Novitskiy  will return in June without her. Whitson has already spent more time in space than any other woman, counting all her missions, and just last week set a record for the most spacewalks by a woman, with eight. This weekend, shell take over as space station commander, her second time at the job. And on April 24, shell set a new U.S. record for most accumulated time in space. That NASA record  534 days  is currently held by former space station resident Jeffrey Williams. Whitson welcomed Wednesdays news. I love being up here, she said in a statement. Living and working aboard the space station is where I feel like I make the greatest contribution, so I am constantly trying to squeeze every drop out of my time here. Having three more months to squeeze is just what I would wish for. 
        
     NASAs space station program director, Kirk Shireman, said Whitsons skill and experience make her an incredible asset up there, and her extra time will be put to good use. There will be a return seat for Whitson in September because the Soyuz due to launch later this month will carry up one American and one Russian, one person fewer than usual. Russia is temporarily cutting back to two station residents. With Whitsons extended stay, the orbiting outpost will continue to have a full crew of six. Whitson, a biochemist who grew up on a farm in Iowa, became an astronaut in 1996. She served as NASAs chief astronaut from 2009 to 2012, the only woman to ever hold the job. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/veteran-nasa-spacewoman-getting-3-extra-months-in-orbit-7a51fb9e57354fe5adb63f8e9d7cdae1,science

The Hubble Space Telescope zoomed in on the solar system giant Monday, and NASA released the pictures Thursday. Jupiter was a relatively close 415 million miles (668 million kilometers) away. The planets Great Red Spot is especially vivid. Its a storm big enough to swallow Earth, but is mysteriously shrinking. Hubbles ongoing observations may help explain why. Also visible in the photos is Red Spot Jr. On Friday, Jupiter will be in opposition. Thats when Jupiter, Earth and the sun all line up, with Earth in the middle.

"Second Great Spot found at Jupiter, cold and high up","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Another Great Spot has been found at Jupiter, this one cold and high up. Scientists reported Tuesday that the dark expanse is 15,000 miles (24,000 kilometers) across and 7,500 miles (12,000 kilometers) wide. Its in the upper atmosphere and much cooler than the hot surroundings, thus the name Great Cold Spot. And unlike the giant planets familiar Great Red Spot, this newly discovered weather system is continually changing in shape and size. Its formed by the energy from Jupiters polar auroras. A British-led team used a telescope in Chile to chart the temperature and density of Jupiters atmosphere. When the researchers compared the data with thousands of images taken in years past by a telescope in Hawaii, the Great Cold Spot stood out. It could be thousands of years old. The Great Cold Spot is much more volatile than the slowly changing Great Red Spot ... but it has reappeared for as long as we have data to search for it, for over 15 years, the University of Leicesters Tom Stallard, lead author of the study, said in a statement. Stallard said Jupiters upper atmosphere may hold other features. Scientists will be on the lookout for them while also studying the Great Cold Spot in greater detail, using ground telescopes as well as NASAs Juno spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter, he said.

Record-setting astronaut thrilled with bonus time in space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The worlds most experienced spacewoman said Thursday shes thrilled to get an extra three months off the planet. The commander of the International Space Station, Peggy Whitson, told The Associated Press that five months into her mission, shes not bored yet  not even close. She misses cooking, though, and a diverse menu. Shes afraid there isnt much chocolate left, to celebrate Easter this Sunday, but shes hoping for more when two astronauts fly up next week, bringing the crew to five. Whitson learned there was a chance her mission would last until September, instead of the originally planned June, the day before she rocketed away late last year. Thats because an empty seat will be available on a Russian Soyuz capsule for her return. Shell now spend close to 10 months in space, keeping up with all the science experiments. She said it was an easy decision to make, once NASA and the Russian Space Agency firmed up the plans earlier this month. She and her husband of almost 28 years, Clarence Sams, a biochemist at Johnson Space Center in Houston, decided on a flexible plan of happiness, either way. The biggest challenge of staying up so long, she said, is more mental. While phone and video communication is great, theres nothing like giving family and friends a hug, she told the AP. Given the space stations relatively limited food choices, shed like nothing more than an Italian dinner with a great salad. Shes enjoyed munching on some Chinese cabbage shes grown up there; she whipped up some tuna salad with horseradish sauce, and served it on the fresh cabbage leaves. 
        
     The 57-year-old biochemist  the oldest woman to fly in space  is on the verge of setting a U.S. record for most accumulated time in space. On April 24, shell surpass astronaut Jeffrey Williams 534 days in space. She also has performed eight spacewalks, more than any other woman. A ninth may be in the offing. During her last spacewalk two weeks ago, a piece of cloth shielding got loose and floated away before it could be installed. Whitson said they had tethered it to the wrong strap and it slid off the end. She said the training equipment on the ground was different, and didnt pose such a problem. This is her third space mission  and shed welcome more. I would definitely love to go to moon or Mars or some other destination, she said.

"Emergency operations plan ensures a great day for Mondays eclipse, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine says","COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  Ohio is pulling out all the stops for Mondays total solar eclipse, as it braces for potentially hundreds of thousands of visitors. I have to say, we dont always get a lot of time leading up to events, Ohio Emergency Management Agency Director Sima Merick said at a news conference Friday. Right? So having 200 years in the making has been very beneficial.  At the event, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said it was 1806, just three years into Ohios statehood, when a total eclipse last crossed the states path. The worlds next total solar eclipse will grace the northern fringes of Greenland, Iceland and Spain in 2026  but the next time for Ohio wont be until 2099. DeWine said he has activated the Ohio Emergency Operations Center beginning Sunday, so that it will be up and running before, during and after Mondays celestial event to help communities navigate any issues that arise.  Adding somewhere between 100,000 and 500,000 tourists to the states existing population could stress government agencies. He will have the National Guard on standby throughout the weekend, but has stopped short of activating soldiers in advance, he said. Again, this is simply a precaution. We think its smart to be ready, he said. Were hoping that the planning for the eclipse will ensure that everyone has a great day. A host of other state agencies  the state departments of Transportation, Public Safety, Health and Natural Resources, the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Ohio National Guard  will all be present at the emergency operations centers, and most are also surging resources toward the event.  
        
     If emergency officials are viewing the eclipse as they would a major weather event, the Department of Natural Resources is looking at it as if a major fireworks display were taking place in each of its 23 state parks and five wildlife areas all at the same time, director Mary Mertz said. All 300 of the states commissioned wildlife officers will be on duty this weekend. Extensive park programming around the eclipse, including hundreds of activities and viewing events, begins Saturday. Ohio is curtailing highway construction projects headed into Monday, so that maximum lanes are available to accommodate heavy traffic, Transportation Director Jack Marchbanks said. Officials encouraged travelers to pack extra snacks and water, for both themselves and any pets they have along; phone chargers; and paper road maps in case of cell service disruptions.  Besides traffic, eye damage is the other major risk associated with the eclipse. Marchbanks also noted that people should not drive in their eclipse glasses. Col. Charles Jones of the Ohio State Highway Patrol advised planning, preparation and patience in relation to the eclipse. Stopping along the highway to view the eclipse is both illegal and dangerous, he said. Travelers might consider delaying their trips home for several hours after the eclipse, to allow crowds and traffic to dissipate, if not staying overnight, DeWine said.",https://apnews.com/article/total-solar-eclipse-ohio-65009495031a18a9c106de69cfe349c3,science
A Soyuz capsule carrying 3 crew from the International Space Station lands safely in Kazakhstan,"MOSCOW (AP)  A Russian space capsule with two women and one man safely landed in a steppe in Kazakhstan on Saturday after their missions aboard the International Space Station. The Soyuz MS-24 carrying Russias Oleg Novitsky, NASAs Loral OHara and Marina Vasilevskaya of Belarus touched down southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan at 12:17 p.m. Kazakh time (0717 GMT).  Those remaining at the orbiting outpost are NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matthew Dominick, Tracy Dyson and Jeannette Epps as well as Russian cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin and Oleg Kononenko.  OHara arrived at the International Space Station on Sept. 15, 2023, spending a total of 204 days there, NASA said.  Novitsky and Vasilevskaya blasted off to space on March 23, two days later than initially planned. The launch of a Soyuz spacecraft carrying them and Dyson, scheduled for March 21, was aborted at the very last minute due to a voltage drop in a power source, according to Yury Borisov, head of Russias space agency Roscosmos.  The delay resulted in a two-day, 34-orbit trip to the space station for the crew. If the launch had gone as scheduled, the journey would have been much shorter, requiring only two orbits. The space station, which has served as a symbol of post-Cold War international cooperation, is now one of the last remaining areas of collaboration between Russia and the West amid tensions over Moscows military action in Ukraine. NASA and its partners hope to continue operating the orbiting outpost until 2030. Russia has continued to rely on modified versions of Soviet-designed rockets for commercial satellites, as well as crews and cargo to the space station.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-belarus-international-space-station-nasa-667d58f9409c5e476f2b1924a87f361b,science
John Glenn honored with launch of space station supply ship,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  John Glenns trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. Its due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASAs shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenns widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenns name emblazoned in space, said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATKs space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries, he said. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit  its the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft  as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. 
        
     Orbital ATK  one of NASAs prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX  normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliances bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. Looks like we nailed the orbit once again, said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASAs 360-degree video streaming of the launch  the first such attempt for a live broadcast  didnt go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeings Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions  hundreds of rocket launches in all. Were really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George, said Kennedy Space Centers director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a heck of a ride.

NASA providing 1st live 360-degree view of rocket launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Want the worlds best, up-close view of a rocket launch without being right there at the pad? For the first time, cameras will provide live 360-degree video of a rocket heading toward space. NASA will provide the 360 stream Tuesday as an unmanned Atlas rocket blasts off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a capsule full of space station supplies. The stream will begin 10 minutes before the scheduled 11:11 a.m. liftoff and continue until the rocket is out of sight. The four fisheye-lens cameras are located at the periphery of the pad, about 300 feet (100 meters) from the rocket. A computer in a blast-proof box will stitch together the images for a full, in-the-round view. There will be about a minute lag time. It will be shown on NASAs YouTube channel . Its great, I mean, to be able to get in there and experience that 360-degree view, said Vern Thorp, a program manager for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. Combining that with virtual reality goggles, it really gives you a new perspective that weve never been able to do before, he said at a Monday news conference. United Launch Alliance has released 360-degree video of two previous launches, but later  not live. Orbital ATK, one of NASAs main delivery services for the International Space Station, opted to use an Atlas V for this supply run from Cape Canaveral versus its own smaller, Virginia-based Antares rocket in order to haul up more items. The supply ship is known as the Cygnus after the swan constellation, and in this case has been named the S.S. John Glenn. 
        
     Glenn became the first American to orbit the world in 1962  launching on an Atlas rocket  and the oldest person to fly in space in 1998 aboard the shuttle Discovery.

Last adventure ahead for NASAs Cassini spacecraft at Saturn,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Cassini spacecraft faces one last perilous adventure around Saturn. Cassini swings past Saturns mega moon Titan early Saturday for a gravity-assisted, orbit-tweaking nudge. That last kiss goodbye, as project manager Earl Maize calls it, will push Cassini onto a path no spacecraft has gone before  into the gap between Saturn and its rings. Its treacherous territory. A particle from the rings  even as small as a speck of sand  could cripple Cassini, given its velocity. Cassini will make its first pass through the relatively narrow gap Wednesday. Twenty-two crossings are planned, about one a week, until September, when Cassini goes in and never comes out, vaporizing in Saturns atmosphere. Launched in 1997, Cassini reached Saturn in 2004 and has been exploring it from orbit ever since. Its European traveling companion, Huygens, landed on Titan in 2005. Cassinis fuel tank is practically empty, so with little left to lose, NASA has opted for a risky, but science-rich grand finale. What a spectacular end to a spectacular mission, said Jim Green, NASAs planetary science division director. I feel a little sad in many ways that Cassinis discoveries will end. But Im also quite optimistic that were going to discover some new and really exciting science as we probe the region weve never probed before. Theres no turning back once Cassini flies past Titan, Maize said. The spacecraft on Wednesday will hurtle through the 1,200-mile-wide gap (1,900 kilometers) between Saturns atmosphere and its rings, at a breakneck 70,000-plus mph (113,000 kph). 
        
     From a navigation standpoint, this is an easy shot, Maize said. The operation will be run from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The concern is whether computer models of Saturns rings are accurate. On a few of the crossings, Cassini is kind of flirting with the edge of where we think its safe, he noted. For at least the first trip through the gap, Cassinis big dish antenna will face forward to shield the science instruments from any ring particles that might be lurking there. A couple instruments will provide a quick rundown on the dust situation. Scientists anticipate lots of lightweight impacts, since the spacecraft will be going through extremely small material, more like smoke than distinct particles. Material from the innermost D ring  which is slowly extending into Saturn  should be diffuse enough that we should be fine, Maize said. If the models are wrong and Cassini is clobbered by BB-size material, it still will end up exactly where NASA is aiming for on Sept. 15  at Saturn. The space agency wants to keep the 22-foot-high, 13-foot-wide spacecraft away from Titan and its lakes of liquid methane and from the ice-encrusted moon Enceladus and its underground ocean and spouting geysers. It doesnt want to shower contaminating wreckage onto these worlds that might harbor life. This last leg of Cassinis 20-year, $3.27 billion voyage should allow scientists to measure the mass of the multiple rings  shedding light on how old they are and how they formed  and also to determine the composition of the countless ring particles. First spotted by Galileo in 1610, the rings are believed to be 99 percent ice; the remaining 1 percent is a mystery, said project scientist Linda Spilker. A cosmic dust analyzer on Cassini will scoop up ring particles and analyze them. Imagine the pictures were going to get back of Saturns rings, Spilker said. Cassini will have the best views ever of Saturns poles, as it skims its surface. Near missions end, Spilker said, were actually going to dip our toe into Saturns atmosphere, sending back measurements until the last possible moment. All this is on top of a science mission that already has rewritten the textbooks on the Saturnian system. But the best is still yet to come  perhaps, Maize said at a news conference in early April. But we are certainly going to provide more excitement. ___ Online: NASA: https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/",https://apnews.com/general-news-0a1c363a7b69438b90786b8378989fcb,science
Supply ship named for John Glenn arrives at space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A supply ship bearing John Glenns name arrived at the International Space Station on Saturday. Astronauts used the stations big robot arm to grab the capsule, as the craft flew 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Germany. NASAs commercial shipper, Orbital ATK, named the spacecraft the S.S. John Glenn in honor of the first American to orbit Earth. It rocketed from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Tuesday with nearly 7,700 pounds of food, experiments and other goods. Glenn died in December at age 95 and was buried earlier this month at Arlington National Cemetery. His widow, Annie, granted permission for Orbital ATK to use his name for the Cygnus spacecraft. The company, in fact, sent up some memorabilia for the Glenn family. Glenn made history in 1962 when he soared into orbit aboard Friendship 7, his one-man Mercury capsule. He returned to space in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery, at age 77, right before station construction began in orbit. Space station commander Peggy Whitson  who on Monday will set a U.S. record for most accumulated time in orbit  notified Mission Control when S.S. John Glenn was captured. Were very proud to welcome on board the S.S. John Glenn, said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who took part in the operation. The contents will be put to good use to continue our mission of research, exploration and discovery. 
        
     Whitson and Pesquet have been living on the space station since November, along with a Russian. They were joined by another American and Russian on Thursday. Whitson is making her third space station flight. Early Monday, she will surpass the 534-day, two-hour-and-change mark set by astronaut Jeffrey Williams last year. President Donald Trump will call her from the Oval Office to offer congratulations. The S.S.

"Astronaut breaks US space record, gets call from Trump","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronaut Peggy Whitson broke the U.S. record Monday for most time in space and talked up Mars during a congratulatory call from President Donald Trump. The International Space Stations commander surpassed the record of 534 days, two hours and 48 minutes for most accumulated time in space by an American. This is a very special day in the glorious history of American spaceflight, Trump said. His daughter and close adviser, Ivanka Trump, also offered congratulations to Whitson from the Oval Office. Whitson said its a huge honor to break such a record. Its an exciting time as NASA prepares for human expeditions to Mars in the 2030s, included in new legislation signed by Trump last month. She called the space station a key bridge between living on Earth and traveling into deep space, and she singled out the stations recycling system that transforms astronauts urine into drinking water. Its really not as bad as it sounds, she assured the president. Well, thats good, Im glad to hear that, he replied. Better you than me. Whitson already was the worlds most experienced spacewoman and female spacewalker and, at 57, the oldest woman in space. By the time she returns to Earth in September, shell have logged 666 days in orbit over three flights. The world record  879 days  is held by Russian Gennady Padalka. Whitson broke the NASA cumulative record set last year by astronaut Jeffrey Williams; Scott Kelly holds the U.S. record for consecutive days in space  340. 
        
     Whitson is also the first woman to command the space station twice and the only woman to have led NASAs astronaut corps. Behind her was a banner that read: Congrats Peggy!! New U.S. High-Time Space Ninja. The sign arrived Saturday on the commercial cargo ship, the S.S. John Glenn  barely in time for Mondays celebration. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer, who arrived at the space station last week and took part in Mondays call, said the space station is by far the best example of international cooperation. Whitson told the president that spaceflight takes a lot of time and money, so getting to Mars will require collaboration from other countries to succeed. NASA is building the hardware right now to test a new rocket that will carry astronauts farther from Earth than ever before, she said. Well, we want to try and do it during my first term or, at worst, during my second term, so well have to speed that up a little bit, OK? Trump replied. Well do our best, Whitson replied. The debut of the mega rocket is still more than a year away  at least. The date will depend on whether astronauts are on board for the test flight, which could hoist the new Orion capsule to the vicinity of the moon. Both Whitson and Fischer raised a hand when Trump asked which one of them was ready to go to Mars. Joining Trump in the Oval Office was astronaut Kate Rubins, who last summer became the first person in space to perform entire DNA decoding, or sequencing. She said she used a device the size of a cellphone for the job, and noted that such sequencing can detect microbes aboard spacecraft and monitor astronaut health. Thats fantastic, Trump said.

"NASA spacewalking suits in short supply, report finds","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs spacewalking suits are in short supply, and a replacement is still years away despite the nearly $200 million spent on new technology, the space agencys inspector general reported Wednesday. A next-generation suit for spacewalking astronauts is needed for future space travel, including trips to Mars. But a lack of a formal plan and destinations has complicated suit development, according to the report . At the same time, NASA has reduced funding for suit development, putting more priority instead on space habitats. According to the report, NASA is dealing with a variety of design and health risks associated with the spacewalking suits used by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The suits were developed more than 40 years ago and intended for 15 years. Of the original backpacks containing life-support equipment, only 11 of the 18 are still in use. That might not be enough to last until the stations retirement in 2024, let alone a possible extension until 2028, the report stated. There have been 3,400 mostly minor problems with spacewalking suits, in ground testing and in orbit, since their development in the 1970s, the report noted. In more than 200 spacewalks, astronauts have encountered 27 significant incidents with the suits. The most serious was the near drowning of an Italian astronaut in 2013 when water from his cooling system flooded his helmet. Other problems over the years have included glove damage and burning or stinging eyes. As the spacewalking suits age, NASA must deal with a dwindling number of flight-ready spacesuits and with mitigating risks related to their design and maintenance, the report said. 
        
     NASA needs a formal plan, especially if it hopes to test a new suit before the space station ends operation in 2024, the report concluded. It also needs to compare the cost of maintaining the current crop of suits with developing new ones. NASAs next spacewalk is set for May 12. Veteran spacewalker, Peggy Whitson, will venture outside with newcomer Jack Fischer.",https://apnews.com/nasa-spacewalking-suits-in-short-supply-report-finds-05e426ced7fb44d8a40395ceca8aacf0,science
"Touch new stamp and presto, total solar eclipse becomes moon","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The U.S. Postal Service is going all out for this summers total solar eclipse, with a first-of-its kind stamp. Just touch the stamp with your finger, and the heat transforms the image of the blacked-out sun into the moon. Remove your finger, and the eclipse reappears. The trick is using temperature-sensitive ink. Theres a map on the back of the stamp sheet showing the eclipses diagonal path across the U.S. on Aug. 21, as the moon covers the sun in the sky. It will be the first total solar eclipse visible in the contiguous United States since 1979 and the first one coast to coast since 1918. Announced Thursday, the Forever 49 cent stamp comes out in June  on the summer solstice. ___ Online: Postal Service: http://about.usps.com/news/welcome.htm",https://apnews.com/national-national-5d33fa9302304508910040f4f3eaee6e,science
Science Says: Solar specs needed for safe viewing of eclipse,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  With the total solar eclipse right around the cosmic corner, eye doctors are going into nagging overdrive. They say mom was right: You can damage your eyes staring at the sun, even the slimmest sliver of it. So its time to rustle up special eclipse eyewear to use Aug. 21, when the U.S. has its first full solar eclipse spanning coast to coast in 99 years. We have an opportunity to experience a spectacular natural phenomenon, and we can enjoy it with some simple protection. But if you dont use that protection, youll be paying for it for the rest of your life, says Dr. Paul Sternberg, director of the Vanderbilt Eye Institute in Nashville, smack dab in the middle of the total eclipse path. No peeking, for example, without eclipse glasses or other certified filters except during the two minutes or so when the moon completely blots out the sun, called totality. Thats the only time its safe to view the eclipse without protection. When totality is ending, then its time to put them back on. To be clear, totality means 100 percent of the sun is covered. That will occur only along a narrow strip stretching from Oregon, through the Midwestern plains, down to South Carolina. The rest of the U.S. gets a partial eclipse that extends into Canada and to the top of South America. So its important to know exactly where you are on eclipse day in relation to that path of totality, advises Dr. B. Ralph Chou, a retired professor of optometry at the University of Waterloo in Ontario who is also an astronomer and eclipse chaser. Hell be in Oregon for his 19th total solar eclipse. 
        
     Unfortunately, when it comes to safety with a solar eclipse, 99.9 percent coverage means a 0.1 percent area of the sun that is still uncovered and is every bit as dangerous, Chou said. For example, Boise, Idaho, will see 99 percent sun coverage; Omaha, Nebraska, 98 percent; Savannah, Georgia, 97 percent; and Memphis, Tennessee, 94 percent. So for those cities  and anywhere else with a partial eclipse  you need to keep those solar specs on the whole time. What can happen when you look directly at the sun? Youre essentially cooking your retina, the delicate, light-sensitive tissue deep inside the eyeball. Solar radiation can kill those cells. Hours can pass before you realize the extent of the damage. Its known in the trade as solar blindness or solar retinopathy  not total blindness, rather more like age-related macular degeneration, where you have trouble reading or recognizing faces, or lose those abilities altogether. Seconds are enough for retinal sunburn. And unlike with the skin, you cant feel it. The damage can be temporary or permanent. Its really important to resist the urge to look even momentarily, directly in the sun because you have no real sense of time, says Dr. Christopher Quinn, president of the American Optometric Association. What you think may be a glancing look could be a more substantial amount of time, and that can result in permanent damage. Forget sunglasses. Certified eclipse glasses or hand-held viewers are a must for direct viewing. Or you can look indirectly with a pinhole projector  homemade will do, crafted from a shoebox, or grab a kitchen colander  that casts images of the eclipsed sun onto a screen at least 3 feet away. When it comes to eyewear, though, the emphasis is on certified. Worried about potentially dangerous knockoffs, NASA, the American Astronomical Society and others are urging eclipse watchers to stick with reputable makers of sun-gazing devices. The societys solar eclipse task force has put out a list of approved manufacturers. Dont use eclipse glasses with filters that are crumpled, scratched or torn. If you can see any light besides the sun, its time for new solar specs. Also beware if the eclipse glasses are older than 2015, when international safety standards were adopted. Eclipse glasses can be worn directly over your prescription glasses or with contacts. As for binoculars, telescopes and cameras, high-quality solar filters are essential and must be mounted at the front end. Chou collected and studied 20 reports of temporary eye injuries following a 1979 total solar eclipse that included Canada. Males under age 20 were found to be particularly susceptible; they tended to ignore safety warnings, he said. In 1999, British doctors reported 70 cases of temporary eye damage following a full solar eclipse. Most cases involved no or inadequate eye protection and many were from spots with a partial eclipse, just shy of a full one. Chou stresses that outside the path of totality, where theres only a partial eclipse, its never safe to take the filters off. ___ Follow APs coverage of the total solar eclipse here ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX launches experiments, ice cream to space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX capsule rocketed to the International Space Station on Monday, carrying tons of science research, plus ice cream. As has become customary on these cargo flights, SpaceX landed its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral shortly after liftoff, a key to its long-term effort to recycle rockets and reduce costs. Gorgeous day, spectacular launch, said Dan Hartman, NASAs deputy manager of the space station program. Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo, which should reach the orbiting lab Wednesday. That includes 20 mice that will return alive inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule in about a month. The Dragon is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November. Shes due back at the beginning of September. Newly arrived U.S. spaceman Randolph Bresnik turns 50 next month. The space station was zooming 250 miles above the Atlantic, just off Nova Scotia, when the Falcon took flight. It was the 14th successful booster landing for SpaceX and the sixth on the giant X at the companys touchdown spot at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just a few miles from its NASA-leased pad at Kennedy Space Center. 
        
     Its right on the bulls-eye, and a very soft touchdown, said SpaceXs Hans Koenigsmann. The mice on board are part of a study of visual problems suffered in space by some male astronauts. Scientists will study the pressure in the animals eyes, as well as the movement of fluid in their brains. Thirty days for mice in space is comparable to three years for humans, according to Florida State Universitys Michael Delp, whos in charge of the experiment. The study may help explain why female astronauts dont have this vision problem, which can linger long after spaceflight, he added. The Dragon also holds an instrument to measure cosmic rays from the space station. This type of device has previously flown on high-altitude balloons. The Army has an imaging microsatellite on board for release this fall from the station. Its a technology demo; the military wants to see how small satellites like this, with low-cost, off-the-shelf cameras and telescopes, might support critical ground operations. Its about the size of a dormitory-room refrigerator. Also going up on behalf of the Michael J. Fox Foundation: protein crystals that, in space, might shed light on Parkinsons disease. The mission got a televised plug from Fox, an actor who has the disease. Three Americans, one more than usual, and an Italian will tackle all this scientific work in orbit. The station also is home to two Russians; that number will go back up to three in a year or so. This is the 13th delivery by the Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX, one of two private shippers hired by NASA. The other is Orbital ATK; its next supply run is in November from Wallops Island, Virginia. The SpaceX Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items to Earth. It parachutes into the Pacific; the others burn up during re-entry. This particular Dragon is brand new, as is the Falcon rocket. In June, SpaceX launched its first reused Dragon, and in March, its first reused Falcon. From now on, the company said it may only fly used Dragons. SpaceX is also developing a crew Dragon for NASA astronauts, set to debut next year. Boeing is working on its own capsule to ferry space station astronauts. In the meantime, SpaceX is aiming for a November debut of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which will feature three first-stage boosters and 27 engines, versus the single booster and nine engines on the Falcon 9. It will have two-thirds the thrust of NASAs Saturn V rocket, which was used during the Apollo moon program. All three of the Falcon Heavys first-stage boosters are meant to fly back to a touchdown. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/spacex-launches-experiments-ice-cream-to-space-station-60b146fb4a2d4a00a72bc7d35a10fa09,science
Spacewalking cosmonauts release 3-D-printed satellite,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking cosmonauts set free the worlds first satellite made almost entirely with a 3-D printer on Thursday. In total, Russians Fyodor Yurchikhin and Sergey Ryazanskiy ended up releasing five nanosatellites by hand. One by one, the tiny craft  no more than 1 to 2 feet in size  tumbled safely away from the International Space Station. The exterior casing of the first one tossed overboard was made with a 3-D printer. So were the battery packs inside. Researchers want to see how 3-D-made parts weather the space environment. The 3-D satellite contains regular electronics. It also holds greetings to planet Earth in a variety of languages, courtesy of students at Siberias Tomsk Polytechnic University, where the satellite was made. The other satellites deployed Thursday have traditional spacecraft parts. Each weighs just 10 to 24 pounds. Theyre expected to orbit for five to six months. One commemorates the 60th anniversary of the worlds first satellite, Sputnik 1, launched Oct. 4, 1957, by the Soviet Union. Another pays tribute to Russias father of rocketry, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. He was born 160 years ago next month. The remaining two small satellites involve navigation and other experiments. Yurchikhin and Ryazanskiy completed the satellite releases within an hour of venturing outside. Barely a minute passed between a few of the launches. The rest of their work took longer than expected, however, and Russias Mission Control outside Moscow sent the planned six-hour spacewalk into overtime. It ended up lasting 7 1/2 hours, and the cosmonauts said their hands were tired. All but one task got done. 
        
     We will have actually some grounds to get drunk today, I think, one of the cosmonauts joked in Russian. A flight controller replied that hed do it for them. The cosmonauts collected science experiments from outside their 250-mile-high home, and wiped thruster residue from various surfaces for analysis. Three Americans and one Italian also live on the space station. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/spacewalking-cosmonauts-release-3-d-printed-satellite-199cc03421074d74b7203dba02a6ee4d,science

NASA launches last of its longtime tracking satellites,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA launched the last of its longtime tracking and communication satellites on Friday, a vital link to astronauts in orbit as well as the Hubble Space Telescope. The end of the era came with a morning liftoff of TDRS-M, the 13th satellite in the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite network . It rode to orbit aboard an unmanned Atlas V rocket. There were handshakes all around two hours later, when the satellite successfully separated from the rockets upper stage. ""''Were going to really celebrate this one, said launch director Tim Dunn. NASA has been launching TDRS satellites since 1983. The 22,300-mile-high constellation links ground controllers with the International Space Station and other low-orbiting craft including Hubble. Its like our baby, said NASAs Badri Younes, deputy associate administrator for space communications and navigation. People have invested their soul and their sweat into making it happen over the decades, Younes said on the eve of launch. This spacecraft has served us so well. This latest flight from Cape Canaveral was delayed two weeks after a crane hit one of the satellites antennas last month. Satellite maker Boeing replaced the damaged antenna and took corrective action to prevent future accidents. Worker error was blamed. The rocket and satellite cost $540 million. Space shuttles hoisted the first-generation TDRS satellites. The second in the series was aboard Challengers doomed flight in 1986. It was the only loss in the entire TDRS series. 
        
     TDRS-M is third generation. NASAs next-generation tracking network will rely on lasers. This more advanced and robust method of relaying data was demonstrated a few years ago during the moon-orbiting mission LADEE. NASA hopes to start launching these high-tech satellites by 2024. Until then, the space agency will rely on the current network. NASA needs seven active TDRS satellites at any given time, six for real-time support and one as a spare. The newest one will remain in reserve, until needed to replace aging craft. Besides serving other spacecraft, the satellites help provide communication to outposts at the South Pole. In 1998, the network provided critical medical help to a doctor diagnosed with breast cancer.",https://apnews.com/nasa-launches-last-of-its-longtime-tracking-satellites-fbcd6ae02f7f49499a0bc4ed347d9c78,science

Whitsons 665 days off the planet  288 days on this mission alone  exceeds that of any other American and any other woman worldwide. She checked out of the International Space Station just hours earlier, along with another American and a Russian. Their Soyuz capsule landed in Kazakhstan shortly after sunrise Sunday  Saturday night back in the U.S. Whitson was the last one carried from the Soyuz. She immediately received a pair of sunglasses to put on, as she rested in a chair on the barren, wind-swept Kazak steppes. Medical personnel took her pulse, standard practice. She then received a bouquet of flowers with the greeting, Welcome back, Peggy. Besides duration, Whitson set multiple other records while in orbit: worlds oldest spacewoman, at age 57, and most experienced female spacewalker, with 10. She also became the first woman to command the space station twice following her launch last November. Returning cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin logged even more time in space: 673 days over five missions. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer returned after 136 days aloft. The men flew up in April. All three briefly held hands for a photo op, before being carried one by one in their chairs to the medical tent. 
        
     It was an emotional farewell to the space station for Whitson, Yurchikhin and Fischer. Before retreating into their Soyuz, they embraced the three colleagues they were leaving behind at the 250-mile-high complex. Yurchikhin patted the inside of the station before floating into his Soyuz for the final time. The stations newest commander, Randy Bresnik, noted the outpost was losing 1,474 days of spaceflight experience with the departure of Whitson, Yurchikhin and Fischer. Four years and two weeks, he pointed out. We are in your debt for the supreme dedication that you guys have to the human mission of exploration, Bresnik told them on the eve of their departure. He offered up special praise for Whitson  American space ninja  and wished them all Godspeed. Yurchikhin is now No. 7 on the worlds all-time endurance list, followed by Whitson at No. 8. The top spot belongs to Russian Gennady Padalka, with 879 days in space over five flights. Whitson, a biochemist, set a breakneck pace on all three of her space station expeditions, continually asking for more  and still more  scientific research to do. Scientists on the ground said it often was hard to keep up with her. She even experimented on food up there, trying to add some pizazz to the standard freeze-dried meals. Tortillas transformed into apple pies on her watch. Whitson was supposed to fly back in June after a half-year in space. But when an extra seat opened up on this Soyuz, she jumped at the chance to stay in orbit an extra three months. Only one other American  yearlong spaceman Scott Kelly  has spent longer in space on a single mission. Except for the past week, Whitson said her mission hurried by. Shes hungry for pizza and cant wait to use a regular flush toilet again. Shes also eager to reunite with her husband, Clarence Sams, a biochemist who also works at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Because of the effects of Hurricane Harvey, NASA could not get its plane from Houston to Kazakhstan in time for the crews landing. Instead, the European Space Agency offered to transport Whitson and Fischer to Cologne, Germany, where they will meet up with the NASA plane for the final leg of their journey.

6 inmates who sued New York over its prison lockdown order will get to view solar eclipse after all,"NEW YORK (AP)  Six inmates who sued New Yorks corrections department over its decision to lock down prisons during next Mondays total solar eclipse will get to watch the celestial event after all.  Lawyers for the six men incarcerated at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in upstate New York said Thursday that theyve reached a settlement with the state that will allow the men to view the solar eclipse in accordance with their sincerely held religious beliefs. They filed a federal suit last week arguing the April 8 lockdown violates inmates constitutional rights to practice their faiths by preventing them from taking part in a religiously significant event. The six men include a Baptist, a Muslim, a Seventh-Day Adventist, two practitioners of Santeria, and an atheist.  Thomas Mailey, a spokesperson for the corrections department, said the department has agreed to permit the six individuals to view the eclipse, while plaintiffs have agreed to drop their suit with prejudice. The lawsuit came to an appropriate resolution, he added in an emailed statement,  The department said earlier this week that it takes all requests for religious accommodations under consideration and that those related to viewing the eclipse were currently under review. Daniel Martuscello III, the departments acting commissioner, issued a memo last month ordering all incarcerated individuals to remain in their housing units next Monday from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., which are generally the normal hours for outdoor recreation in prisons.  
        
     He said the department will distribute solar eclipse safety glasses for staff and inmates at prisons in the path of totality so they can view the eclipse from their assigned work location or housing units. Communities in western and northern reaches of the state are expected to have the best viewing of the moment when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, temporarily blocking the sun.",https://apnews.com/article/solar-eclipse-prison-lawsuit-44533719957e2999232597dcf327fd2d,science
Goodbye Cassini: Saturn spacecraft gets funny opera send-off,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

An actor from TVs old Star Trek: Voyager series, Robert Picardo, said he dashed off the lyrics in about a minute, several weeks ago. He collaborated with the creative director of The Planetary Society, and, presto, Le Cassini Opera was born. Picardo set the words to the instantly recognizable aria La Donna e mobile from Verdis Rigoletto. While Cassinis 20-year mission has been a serious success, Picardo said the opera is definitely a comedy. Heres how it opens: Goodbye, Cassini. Your missions fini. Bravo, Cassini! Have some linguini. And on it goes, paying humorous tribute. No tragedy here. All good things  NASA missions, Star Trek series, turkey and Swiss sandwiches with avocado  come to an end, Picardo told The Associated Press. Cassinis program manager, Earl Maize, loves the performance. Its very heartwarming to us, Maize told reporters Wednesday at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Part of what we try to do is to extend everybody out to Saturn. Its not science for the ivory tower. Its for humanity, and so everybody to get on the ride, come with us, is just phenomenal. That was Picardos goal, too. A longtime fan of both space and opera, he merged those interests in Star Trek: Voyager as the holographic doctor who bursts into song. It seemed fitting that he celebrate Cassini in song, too. He actually got to see Cassinis hitchhiking moon lander, the European Huygens, before it left Earth in 1997. 
        
     Picardo said Wednesday from Beverly Hills, California, that he sang Le Cassini Opera through twice. Five minutes, and that was a wrap. It was definitely a seat-of-the-pants production, he said. Picardo, whos on the board of the Planetary Society , an advocacy group for space exploration, said hes delighted that the opera has been so well received The Cassini-Huygens duo arrived at Saturn in 2004. Cassini remained in orbit around the ringed planet, as Huygens parachuted onto Titan, its biggest moon, in early 2005. Cassin faces a deliberately fiery end on Friday. Its fuel tank essentially empty and its mission complete, Cassini will burn up like a meteor in Saturns sky.",https://apnews.com/goodbye-cassini-saturn-spacecraft-gets-funny-opera-send-off-40bfb9bc8e50462fb6c3e33f1cdf198f,science
Spacewalking astronauts grease robot arms new hand,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts hustled through a lube job and camera swaps outside the International Space Station on Tuesday, their second trip outside in less than a week. Astronaut Mark Vande Hei made fast work of greasing the big robot arms new hand. Vande Hei and station commander Randy Bresnik replaced the latching mechanism on one end of the 58-foot robot arm last Thursday. The mechanism malfunctioned in August. Tuesdays work involved using a grease gun, which resembles a caulking gun, to keep the latching mechanism working smoothly. Vande Hei got a jump ahead in some greasing chores, but the two-part job still will spill into next week, in a third and final spacewalk. Why dont we wash, rinse, repeat. Do it again in a week, Bresnik said as the 6 -hour spacewalk came to a close. These latches, or hands, are located on each end of the Canadian-built robot arm. Theyre used to grab arriving U.S. cargo ships and also allow the robot arm to move around the orbiting lab. Launched in 2001 with the rest of the robot arm, the original latches were showing their age. NASA plans to replace the latching mechanism on the opposite end of the arm early next year. Vande Hei and Bresnik also replaced several camera assemblies at the 250-mile-high outpost. What do you do for an encore? Bresnik asked Vande Hei, after two successful spacewalks. 
        
     I finish six months on the space station, Vande Hei replied. He arrived a month ago. Vande Hei will sit out the next spacewalk on Oct. 18. Instead, Bresnik will be accompanied by Joe Acaba, a teacher-turned-astronaut. Six men live at the orbiting lab: three Americans, two Russians and one Italian. As the space station approached Italy early in the spacewalk, Mission Control urged Bresnik and Vande Hei to take some photos for their crewmate, Paolo Nespoli.",https://apnews.com/spacewalking-astronauts-grease-robot-arms-new-hand-4618c438eb6b4460bb88d1f889e2863b,science
"SpaceX racks up another rocket launch, its 16th this year","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX has racked up another rocket launch, its 16th this year. Thats double last years count, and 2017 still has two months remaining. The unmanned Falcon rocket blasted off Monday afternoon from Floridas Kennedy Space Center, hoisting a communications satellite for the South Korean company KT SAT. This newest Koreasat will replace a failed satellite launched in 2006, and serve both Asia and the Middle East. Once separated, the 15-story first-stage booster flew to a floating platform in the Atlantic and landed upright. The TV link of the touchdown was lost. But SpaceX confirmed success despite the choppy seas and some flames shooting from the landed booster. The fire went out. A little toasty, but stage one is certainly still intact, said the launch commentator from company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX expects to reuse the booster to save time and money. Other rocket makers ditch the boosters at sea following orbital missions.

Puerto Rican astronaut reaches out to islands schoolkids,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The first astronaut of Puerto Rican heritage reached out Friday to schoolchildren on the hurricane-bashed island. Flying aboard the International Space Station, NASA astronaut Joe Acaba fielded questions from students at the Puerto Rico Institute of Robotics in Manati. One student asked how Puerto Rico looked from space after Hurricane Maria struck in September. Acaba said the first thing he noticed was the lack of lights, making the island almost impossible to see at night. A boy noted that after the hurricane, it was difficult for some Puerto Ricans to eat given the limited variety of available food. Does Acaba find the limited space menu tough to swallow? The menu, while pretty good, repeats every week or two and does get monotonous, Acaba said. Of course, he said it doesnt compare to such Puerto Rican specialties as pasteles, stuffed meat pastries wrapped in banana leaves popular around Christmas, and rice with pigeon peas and pork. Im ready to get home and have a great meal, he said. Acaba, a former school teacher, is supposed to return to Earth at the end of February. He arrived at the space station a week before Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, already reeling from Hurricane Irma. The astronauts parents were from Hatillo, Puerto Rico, and moved to the U.S. He was born in Southern California and grew up there, but has lots of relatives still in the U.S. territory. 
        
     Technical difficulties with the institutes Skype connection ate up nine minutes of the 23-minute conversation. Acaba switched between English and Spanish in answering students questions, ranging from his experience as a teacher to daily life aboard the orbiting outpost. He assured the students that the drinking water  recycled from the six-man crews urine  actually tastes great and is as natural as it gets. As for sleeping, he said hes getting some of the best sleep of his life. The students were brought to the institute from across Puerto Rico for the event. Selected by NASA in 2004, Acaba remains the space agencys only astronaut of Puerto Rican heritage. ___ AP reporter Danica Coto contributed to this report from Puerto Rico. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/puerto-rican-astronaut-reaches-out-to-islands-schoolkids-84f22ac449a14a8ea22d05bd8bd421cb,science

Because of the lingering effects of the government shutdown, the spacewalk was not broadcast live on NASA TV. A NASA message stated: We regret the inconvenience. Vande Hei performed a similar spacewalk last October, when he replaced the first of two original hands on the Canadian-built arm. This second hand will go on the opposite end of the 58-foot arm.

Spacewalking astronauts give new hand to robot arm,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts gave a hand to the International Space Stations big robot arm Tuesday. As the federal government geared back up 250 miles below, NASA astronauts Mark Vande Hei and Scott Tingle successfully installed the new mechanical gripper. Because of the lingering effects of the government shutdown, the spacewalk got started in the morning without coverage on NASA TV. An on-air message simply stated: We regret the inconvenience. Nearly an hour into the spacewalk, however, NASA TV came alive and began broadcasting the event with typical blow-by-blow commentary. Space station operations were largely unaffected by the three-day shutdown. Considered essential personnel, Mission Control kept watch as usual at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Vande Hei performed a similar spacewalk last October, when he replaced the first of two original hands on the Canadian-built arm. This second new hand will go on the opposite end of the 58-foot arm, able to move like an inchworm by grabbing hold of special fixtures. The bulky bundle of latches  more than 3 feet, or a meter, long and weighing more than 440 pounds, or 200 kilograms  needed to be replaced because of wear and tear. Its been in orbit, grabbing cargo capsules and performing other chores, since 2001. Tingle had to use extra muscle to release a stubborn bolt securing the spare mechanical arm. 
        
     Nice work, Vande Hei said. And the crowd goes wild, chimed in Mission Control. Next, the spacewalkers wrested the old, degraded hand from the robot arm. Once the new hand was in place, a software issue cropped up briefly. Six hours into the spacewalk, NASA declared victory. The spacewalk lasted 7 1/2 hours. It was the first spacewalk for Tingle, who arrived last month, and the third for Vande Hei. Make us proud out there, astronaut Joe Acaba told the spacewalkers from inside. Well have hot chow for you when you get back. Vande Hei will go back out Monday with another astronaut to finish the job. Then the two Russians on board will conduct a spacewalk Feb. 2 to install a new antenna on their countrys side of the outpost.

SpaceX fires engines on big new rocket in launch pad test,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX fired up its newest, biggest rocket in a critical launch pad test Wednesday, advancing toward a long-anticipated test flight possibly in just a week. The Falcon Heavy briefly roared to life for the first time at NASAs Kennedy Space Center. All three boosters  27 engines in all  were tested. The thunderous booms could be heard at the press site three miles away, as huge white clouds of engine exhaust billowed into a clear blue sky. Everything appeared normal: The 230-foot (70-meter) rocket stood tall and brilliantly white after the test on the historic pad once used by NASAs Apollo moon rockets and space shuttles. SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk said an hour later that the firing was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so, he said via Twitter. The press site was busier than usual, as TV crews and other journalists gathered at midday for the test. There was no guarantee of a test firing Wednesday. SpaceX had fueled the rocket before, but then stood down for undisclosed reasons. Wednesdays firing appeared to last for about 10 seconds. The Heavy  a triple-size version of SpaceXs frequent flier, the Falcon 9  is tailor-made for spacecraft headed to the moon or Mars, as well as extra-big satellites bound for low-Earth orbit. A Falcon 9 has a single first-stage booster; the Heavy has three strapped side-by-side-by side, spanning 40 feet (12 meters) across at the base. The Falcon 9 is routinely used to hoist satellites as well as space station cargo, and perhaps by the end of year, could be hauling crews for NASA, too. 
        
     NASAs Saturn V moon rocket, used during the late 1960s and early 1970s, still is the all-time champ when it comes to size and power. I love that rocket so much, Musk said in a tweet last month. The Heavys cargo for the test flight will be a Tesla Roadster belonging to Musk, who also heads the electric car company. Musk has repeatedly warned the rocket could explode. If successful, his red sports car will end up in a long, oval loop around the sun, traveling as far out as the orbit of Mars. Two of the three Heavy boosters have launched before. All three boosters will attempt to fly back and land, routine nowadays for SpaceX, which is recycling its rockets to lower future launch costs. SpaceX had hoped to fire the engines last month. But the preparations took longer than planned, and the three-day federal government shutdown contributed to the delay. The California-based company is leasing Launch Complex 39A from NASA. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacex-fires-engines-on-big-new-rocket-in-launch-pad-test-f2468000f13d44448d7900698ae4c581,science
NASA honors 7 killed on space shuttle Columbia 15 years ago,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA honored the seven astronauts killed aboard shuttle Columbia 15 years ago, with a special musical tribute Thursday by the son of Israels first astronaut. Singer and songwriter Tal Ramon joined a few hundred others at Kennedy Space Center to remember the Columbia crew and other astronauts killed in the line of duty over the decades. Seven astronauts  including Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon died Feb. 1, 2003, when Columbia shattered in the skies over Texas, just minutes before a Florida touchdown. Ramon performed two of his own songs, singing in Hebrew and playing the keyboard. Later, he and relatives of other astronauts killed in action, placed long-stemmed, yellow, orange and pink roses at the Space Mirror Memorial. In all, 24 names are engraved in the large granite monument. Im just so emotional to be here with you, Ramon told the crowd before performing at the first Kennedy memorial hes attended. It was also difficult for forest ranger Gregory Cohrs, who was among the first on the accident scene in Hemphill, Texas. Cohrs worked for three months scouring the area for shuttle debris and the astronauts remains. He now serves at Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana. It was really important for us to bring the crew home to their families. So were really thankful to have been able to do that, he told The Associated Press. 
        
     NASAs held its annual day of remembrance Thursday to honor all its astronauts killed in the line of duty. Seventeen died in three accidents: Columbia, the Apollo 1 fire on the launch pad on Jan. 27, 1967, and the shuttle Challenger launch disaster on Jan. 28, 1986. The seven others died in plane crashes during training or other official business. NASAs acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, led observances at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington, where several of these astronauts are buried. At Kennedy, NASAs first female space shuttle commander, Eileen Collins, now retired and board chairman of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation , noted next Wednesday will mark the 60th anniversary of the liftoff of Americas first satellite. Explorer 1 launched on Jan. 31, 1958, right as NASAs seven original Mercury astronauts had begun training for their space flights. They still inspire us today, she said. Among those attending the Kennedy tribute were family members of four early astronauts killed in plane crashes in the 1960s: Charles Bassett II, Elliot See Jr., Clifton Williams Jr. and Michael Adams, who reached the edge of space in his X-15. Also on hand were Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, as well as former shuttle astronauts and launch directors. The son of Columbia pilot Willie McCool  Christopher McCool  was there, too. But it was Ramon who addressed the crowd on behalf of the Columbia families. Ramon recalled how his fathers spaceflight was a very huge thing not only in Israel, but the United States as well. He shared how his fathers mother was a Holocaust survivor and piano teacher, and how his father could play the piano. His own musical journey began after his fathers death, when he returned to Israel and his fathers Steinway piano. He performed the title song from his album Character  Dmut in Hebrew  which is dedicated to his father and older brother Assaf, a pilot in the Israeli Air Force who died in a jet crash in 2009. His second selection, an instrumental piece, was Victory. Even with big tragedy, we believe that theres such a big victory that we are here today to share their stories, he said.",https://apnews.com/nasa-honors-7-killed-on-space-shuttle-columbia-15-years-ago-f5847f586a844245a7ee27970d714e55,science

Recording-setting spacewalk ends with antenna in wrong spot,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A record-setting Russian spacewalk ended with a critical antenna in the wrong position Friday outside the International Space Station. NASAs Mission Control reported that the antenna was still working. Nevertheless, Russian space officials were convening a special team to see whether further action would be necessary. The antenna is used for communications with Russias Mission Control outside Moscow. The trouble arose toward the end of the more than 8 hour spacewalk  the longest ever by Russians and the fifth longest overall  after Commander Alexander Misurkin and Anton Shkaplerov successfully replaced an electronics box to upgrade the antenna. The pair watched in dismay as the antenna got hung up on the Russian side of the complex and could not be extended properly. The antenna  a long boom with a 4-foot dish at the end  had been folded up before the repair work. Misurkin and Shkaplerov pushed, as flight controllers tried repeatedly, via remote commanding, to rotate the antenna into the right position. Finally, someone shouted in Russian, Its moving. Its in place. NASA Mission Control said from Houston that the antenna wound up in a position 180 degrees farther than anticipated. The spacewalk dragged on so long  lasting 8 hours and 13 minutes  that Misurkin and Shkaplerov ended up surpassing the previous Russian record of 8 hours and 7 minutes, set in 2013. It was supposed to last 6  hours. 
        
     Are you kidding us? one of them asked when they heard about the record. NASA still holds the world record, with a spacewalk just shy of nine hours back in 2001. Misurkin and Shkaplerov also asked flight controllers whether the antenna was operating or have we just wasted our time? The response: Its being evaluated. It was the second spacewalk in as many weeks. On Jan. 23, two U.S. astronauts went out to give a new hand to the stations big robotic arm. NASA had planned another spacewalk this week, but bumped it to mid-February because engineers needed extra time to get the mechanical hand working. After removing the old, obsolete electronics box from the antenna  an original part, launched in 2000  Misurkin shoved it away from the space station. The bundle tumbled harmlessly away, 250 miles above the North Atlantic. The 60-pound box  measuring just a couple of feet, or less than a meter  was hurled in a direction that will not intersect with the space station, according to NASA officials. While the Russians routinely toss old equipment and used towels overboard during spacewalks, NASA prefers to secure no-longer-needed items or, if possible, bring them inside. Except for SpaceXs cargo ships, empty supply capsules are filled with trash and set loose to burn up in the atmosphere. The discarded electronics box will re-enter and burn up, too; Mission Control said it did not know when that will occur. Misurkin will return to Earth at the end of this month with two NASA crewmates. The space station is home to two Russians, three Americans and one Japanese. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html",https://apnews.com/recording-setting-spacewalk-ends-with-antenna-in-wrong-spot-14baa6199f0944a68aab404b87614bb1,science
SpaceXs hot new monster rocket ready for first test flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs hot new monster rocket makes its launch debut this week, blasting off from the same pad that hoisted men to the moon a half-century ago. The Falcon Heavy wont surpass NASAs Saturn V moon rocket, still all-time king of the launch circuit. It wont even approach the liftoff might of NASAs space shuttles. But when it departs on its first test flight  as early as Tuesday  the Heavy with its three boosters and 27 engines will be the most powerful working rocket out there today, by a factor of two. Picture SpaceXs frequent-flyer Falcon 9 and its single booster and then times that by three; the Heavys three first-stage boosters are strapped side by side by side. The Heavy represents serious business for the private space company founded 16 years ago by Elon Musk. With more than 5 million pounds of liftoff thrust  equivalent to 18 747s jetliners  the Heavy will be capable of lifting supersize satellites into orbit and sending spacecraft to the moon, Mars and beyond. Using another airplane analogy, SpaceX boasts a Heavy could lift a 737 into orbit, passengers, luggage and all. The company already has some Heavy customers lined up, including the U.S. Air Force. I cant wait to see it fly and to see it fly again and again, said the Southwest Research Institutes Alan Stern. Hes the lead scientist for NASAs New Horizons spacecraft which made an unprecedented flyby of Pluto and is now headed to an even smaller, icy world on the fringes of the solar system. 
        
     Cape Canaveral hasnt seen this kind of rocket mania since the last space shuttle flight in 2011. Huge crowds are expected for the afternoon launch from Kennedy Space Center. Visitor center tickets for the best up-close viewing, called Feel the Heat and Closest Package, sold out quickly. When youre talking about what would be the biggest and largest operational launch vehicle in the world, that adds another dimension of excitement, said Phil Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who used to work for SpaceX and the Obama administration. The Heavy is capable of delivering, in one fell swoop, 140,660 pounds (63,800 kilograms) of cargo to low-Earth orbit, nearly 60,000 pounds (26,700 kilograms) to high-Earth orbit, 37,000 pounds (16,800 kilograms) to Mars, or 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) to Pluto. But for this inaugural flight, the rocket will carry up Musks cherry-red Tesla Roadster. In addition to SpaceX, he runs the electric car maker Tesla. Red car for a red planet, Musk tweeted in December, when announcing the surprise cargo. Fresh-off-the-drawing-board rockets typically carry steel or concrete blocks in place of true cargo. That seemed extremely boring, Musk explained. NASA officials said the Falcon Heavy is just the latest evidence of the Kennedy Space Centers transformation into a multi-user spaceport, a turnaround after decades of space shuttles taking center stage. A variety of rockets will be needed  besides NASAs still-under-construction Space Launch System megarocket  as astronauts venture out into the solar system, said Kennedys director of center planning and development, Tom Engler. Blue Origin, led by Amazons Jeff Bezos, for instance, is developing a big, reusable orbital-class rocket named New Glenn after the first American to orbit the world, John Glenn. Cocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik, a banker by day, noted that jobs are making a big comeback, with so many private rocketeers and other aerospace businesses hitting town. The area suffered thousands of layoffs when the 30-year space shuttle program ended. We are not only back, but the region is much more diversified, Malik said. We are becoming a high-tech hub. Stern sees the Heavy opening the door to more exploration, both human and robotic, given its heft and cost savings. SpaceXs launch failures of Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 showed the company has a very strong backbone. While Falcon 1 was completely on the SpaceX tab, Falcon 9 benefited from the companys contracts with NASA for space station shipments. This persistence resulted in SpaceX becoming, in 2010, the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and then safely guide it back to Earth, something only large governments had accomplished. Two years later, SpaceX became the first commercial supplier of the International Space Station. Now the company is aiming for the first commercial crew launch. At the heart of SpaceXs cost savings is its rocket-recycling campaign. Two of the Heavys first-stage boosters are repeats, having flown on Falcon 9s. The company will attempt to recover all three boosters; the two old boosters will aim for side-by-side vertical touchdowns at Cape Canaveral, while the new, beefed-up center core will attempt to land on a floating ocean platform. Rocket makers typically discard their leftover boosters in the ocean. Now those boosters often come back and land, at least when its SpaceX, complete with sonic booms just like the old shuttle days. Unlike most rockets out there, the Falcon Heavy receives no government funding. The Mars-obsessed Musk has taken it upon himself and his California-based aerospace company to bankroll the hulking rocket. At a sticker price of $90 million, the Heavy is a relative bargain. NASAs bigger and more powerful SLS is expected to exceed $1 billion a flight. Musk upped the ante by putting his Tesla atop this first Heavy; hes been warning for months the rocket might not make it higher than the launch tower. If the flight succeeds, it will be the first true automobile hurled into space. Its destined for a perpetual orbit around the sun that will swing out as far as Mars. The cars soundtrack will be playing David Bowies Space Oddity. It is a catchy way to get attention, said Stern while driving his blue Tesla Model S in Boulder, Colorado, last week. Musk is already looking ahead to an even bigger SpaceX rocket that would phase out both the Falcon 9 and Heavy. Retired NASA historian and Smithsonian curator Roger Launius cautioned SpaceX has a long history of overpromising, although eventually succeeding. The Heavys debut, for example, has been delayed for years. Musk has acknowledged the Heavy proved harder to build than anticipated. Im in favor of more capacity to get off this planet, so I cheer when anyone has a successful new rocket, Launius wrote in an email. He promised to be properly congratulatory if and when success comes. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacexs-hot-new-monster-rocket-ready-for-first-test-flight-4b632d6c9c1147d7a16133d113078cf2,science

A variety of rockets will be needed  besides NASAs still-under-construction Space Launch System megarocket  as astronauts venture out into the solar system, said Kennedys director of center planning and development, Tom Engler. Blue Origin, led by Amazons Jeff Bezos, for instance, is developing a big, reusable orbital-class rocket named New Glenn after the first American to orbit the world, John Glenn. Cocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik, a banker by day, noted that jobs are making a big comeback, with so many private rocketeers and other aerospace businesses hitting town. The area suffered thousands of layoffs when the 30-year space shuttle program ended. We are not only back, but the region is much more diversified, Malik said. We are becoming a high-tech hub. Stern sees the Heavy opening the door to more exploration, both human and robotic, given its heft and cost savings. SpaceXs launch failures of Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 showed the company has a very strong backbone. While Falcon 1 was completely on the SpaceX tab, Falcon 9 benefited from the companys contracts with NASA for space station shipments. This persistence resulted in SpaceX becoming, in 2010, the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and then safely guide it back to Earth, something only large governments had accomplished. Two years later, SpaceX became the first commercial supplier of the International Space Station. Now the company is aiming for the first commercial crew launch. At the heart of SpaceXs cost savings is its rocket-recycling campaign. Two of the Heavys first-stage boosters are repeats, having flown on Falcon 9s. The company will attempt to recover all three boosters; the two old boosters will aim for side-by-side vertical touchdowns at Cape Canaveral, while the new, beefed-up center core will attempt to land on a floating ocean platform. Rocket makers typically discard their leftover boosters in the ocean. Now those boosters often come back and land, at least when its SpaceX, complete with sonic booms just like the old shuttle days. Unlike most rockets out there, the Falcon Heavy receives no government funding. The Mars-obsessed Musk has taken it upon himself and his California-based aerospace company to bankroll the hulking rocket. At a sticker price of $90 million, the Heavy is a relative bargain. NASAs bigger and more powerful SLS is expected to exceed $1 billion a flight. Musk upped the ante by putting his Tesla atop this first Heavy; hes been warning for months the rocket might not make it higher than the launch tower. If the flight succeeds, it will be the first true automobile hurled into space. Its destined for a perpetual orbit around the sun that will swing out as far as Mars. The cars soundtrack will be playing David Bowies Space Oddity. It is a catchy way to get attention, said Stern while driving his blue Tesla Model S in Boulder, Colorado, last week. Musk is already looking ahead to an even bigger SpaceX rocket that would phase out both the Falcon 9 and Heavy. Retired NASA historian and Smithsonian curator Roger Launius cautioned SpaceX has a long history of overpromising, although eventually succeeding. The Heavys debut, for example, has been delayed for years. Musk has acknowledged the Heavy proved harder to build than anticipated. Im in favor of more capacity to get off this planet, so I cheer when anyone has a successful new rocket, Launius wrote in an email. He promised to be properly congratulatory if and when success comes. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacexs-hot-new-monster-rocket-ready-for-first-test-flight-040f9bafb98b46dca154d96a65de03dc,science
SpaceX Starman at wheel of sports car flying on new rocket,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX Starman is aboard the companys new rocket thats set to make its launch debut from Florida SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk revealed pictures of the surprise dummy passenger Monday. Test flights usually carry steel or concrete for cargo, or mundane experiments  nothing valuable in case the rocket blows up. But aboard the Falcon Heavy for Tuesdays demo is Musks red Tesla Roadster. A figure is in the drivers seat, with the right hand on the wheel and the left arm resting on the convertibles door. Starman, as Musk calls the passenger, is wearing a white-and-black-trimmed spacesuit and helmet. Its the same outfit real astronauts will wear when riding SpaceX rockets from Florida a year or so from now, bound for the International Space Station. Musk, who also runs the electric car company Tesla, is sending his Roadster into a long solar orbit stretching out to Mars. Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration officially licensed the flight from Kennedy Space Center. The Falcon Heavy, at liftoff, will be the worlds most powerful rocket currently in operation. A David Bowie fan, Musk has promised via Twitter to have the car soundtrack playing Space Oddity. Starman, is the title of a Bowie song from 1972. Thats three years after the late rocker penned Ground Control to Major Tom for Space Oddity. Theres a Starman waiting in the sky, goes Bowies Starman. If the flight succeeds, Musks Starman should cruise around the sun for a billion years. ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/",https://apnews.com/spacex-starman-at-wheel-of-sports-car-flying-on-new-rocket-d0960b75409e4c349d612b54457a1b88,science
SpaceX launches new megarocket with Tesla car on board,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs new megarocket launched on its first test flight Tuesday from Floridas Kennedy Space Center as thousands jammed surrounding beaches. Some details about the Falcon Heavy rocket, its cargo and whats ahead: THE ROCKET The Falcon Heavy has three first-stage boosters, strapped together with 27 engines in all. Stretching 40 feet (12 meters) at the base and standing 230 feet (70 meters) tall, the Heavy is a triple dose of the Falcon 9, the companys frequent flyer with just a single booster. At liftoff, the Heavy packs about 5 million pounds of thrust. Thats more liftoff punch than any other rocket currently operating in the world  by a factor of two  but less than NASAs old space shuttles and Saturn V moon rockets. Two of the boosters recycled from previous Falcon 9 launches  returned minutes later for simultaneous, side-by-side touchdowns at Cape Canaveral. There was no immediate word on whether the third booster made it onto the ocean platform. THE CARGO SpaceXs Elon Musk also runs the electric carmaker Tesla. So in a bit of cross-marketing, he put his own cherry-red Tesla Roadster on the Heavys inaugural flight with a space-suited dummy at the wheel. No car has ever rocketed into space before, if you dont count NASAs Apollo-era moon buggies, still parked on the lunar surface. The Federal Aviation Administration had to sign off on the Heavy-Tesla combo. Usually, there are steel or concrete slabs or mundane experiments on test flights. The convertible was at the top of the rocket, enclosed for liftoff. The protective cover dropped away, allowing the car to travel on its way. Three cameras were mounted on the Roadster. THE DESTINATION 
        
     SpaceX is targeting a long, oval orbit around the sun for the Roadster that will take the car as far out as Mars, and have it making laps for a billion years. First up, hours of deep-space coasting through the high-energy Van Allen radiation belts encircling Earth. If it weathers all this, the Roadster will reach the vicinity of Mars in six months. Musk said that the car could come fairly close to Mars and that theres an extremely tiny chance it could crash into the planet. Musk is intent on establishing a city on the red planet, with hordes of Earthlings and building materials flying there on a super-extra-mega SpaceX rocket that is still in development. THE LAUNCH PAD The Falcon Heavy lifted off from the same launch pad used by NASA to send astronauts to the moon. SpaceX leases Launch Complex 39A from NASA. Not only did LC-39A, as its known, serve as the departure point for all the Apollo moonshots from 1968 to 1972, it was the scene for most of the space shuttle liftoffs. Its location at Kennedy Space Center keeps people at least three miles away, a distance determined by NASA in the 1960s to be safe just in case the Saturn V exploded on the pad. THE FUTURE SpaceX already has customers lined up for the Falcon Heavy. The rocket is designed to hoist supersize satellites as well as equipment to the moon, Mars or other far-flung points. The private companys online flight manifest shows the U.S. Air Force as already signed up. Other aerospace companies are developing rockets and NASA is sinking billions of dollars into a massive new rocket called the Space Launch System, or SLS, thats meant to return astronauts to the moon and also get them one day to Mars.",https://apnews.com/spacex-launches-new-megarocket-with-tesla-car-on-board-a513dd933d6a44c7bc44d4e34d5d83df,science
"From Krispy Kreme to SunChips, more and more companies roll out total solar eclipse promotions","NEW YORK (AP)  More and more businesses are taking advantage of the total solar eclipse set to dim skies across North America on Monday. In the snacks department alone, Krispy Kreme is teaming up with Oreo to sell a limited doughnut-cookie creation. Sonic Drive-In is selling a Blackout Slush Float. And Frito-Lays SunChips has unveiled a new flavor that will only be available during the celestial events nearly 4 and a half minutes of totality. MoonPie also kicked off a Sun vs. Moon smackdown-themed campaign as the chocolate snack maker promotes its eclipse survival kit, made up of four mini MoonPies and two pairs of eclipse glasses. Meanwhile, airlines like Southwest and Delta have advertised eclipse-viewing flight paths. And beyond promotions from big-name brands, small businesses along the 115 mile (185 kilometer)-wide prime path are leading the charge to meet the incoming tourist demand. Some towns and local vendors have been anticipating the celestial event and its huge crowds for years. There are oodles of special eclipse safety glasses for sale, along with T-shirts emblazoned with clever slogans and more astronomical souvenirs. Other offerings include eclipse-themed beer, specialty dining packages and watch parties at amusement parks, wineries and zoos. Marketing tied to rare spectacles, like the suns disappearing act behind the moon, isnt new.  
        
     In 2017, the last time the U.S. saw a big slice of a total solar eclipse, scores of companies tapped into the action  including Krispy Kreme. AP correspondent Seth Sutel reports on attempts to cash in on the solar eclipse. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company previously rolled out limited-edition chocolate glazed doughnuts for the 2017 eclipse, and those treats have made a few returns since.

Not in the path of totality? You can still watch Mondays total solar eclipse online,"If youre nowhere near the path of totality or if clouds spoil your view, you can still catch the total solar eclipse online. Weather permitting, tens of millions who live along a narrow stretch from Mexicos Pacific coast to eastern Canada can just look skyward Monday to glimpse day turn to twilight when the moon blots out the sun.  Eclipse glasses are a must to prevent eye damage. The only time its safe to ditch protective glasses is during totality, or the few minutes of complete darkness.  Here are some alternatives if youre clouded out during the eclipse or if you cant travel to the path: NASA is offering several hours of streaming online and on NASA TV starting at 1 p.m. EDT from several cities along the totality path. The space agency will show telescope views of the sun and there will be appearances by scientists and space station astronauts. During the eclipse, small rockets will blast off from Wallops Island, Virginia, with science instruments into the electrically charged portion of the atmosphere near the edge of space known as the ionosphere.  Associated Press journalists will fan out along the path of totality to bring live coverage of watch parties and festivities. The AP livestream will start at 10 a.m. EDT with views from Mazatln, Mexico, and other locations. Commentary will run from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. EDT featuring interviews with organizers, scientists and live views from along the path. The Exploratorium museum will feature live telescope images of the sun from Junction, Texas, and Torren, Mexico. Researchers and students from the University of Maine will launch high-altitude balloons in an experiment that will be livestreamed from the stratosphere. Time and Date will show the sun from different telescope feeds. Slooh will broadcast from Texas and will have a network of partner telescopes along the path. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

One Tech Tip: How to use apps to track and photograph the total solar eclipse,"Mondays total solar eclipse might become one of the most filmed and photographed events of the year. As the moon passes in front of the sun, plunging a swath of North America into a few minutes of darkness, throngs will take pictures or videos of the moment. But powerful solar rays and drastic changes in lighting pose unique challenges in catching that perfect image. Here are some pointers on how to get the best shot: First, get in the right position. Youll want to be as close as possible to the path of totality, which passes over Mexicos Pacific coast and ends in eastern Canada. Fifteen U.S. states get to see the full eclipse. There are online maps to check if youll be anywhere near the path. NASAs map shows how many minutes of totality there will be if youre inside the path depending on location, and how much of a partial eclipse youll see if youre outside of it. For spectators in Mexico and Canada, eclipse expert Xavier Jubiers website overlays the eclipses path on Google Maps, which allows zooming into street level detail.  Be ready to adapt to changing weather conditions. Use weather forecast and cloud coverage apps, including ones from the National Weather Service and Astrospheric, on the morning or the day before to find locations with clearer skies.  
        
     With so many factors in play including cloud cover and the suns position in the sky, planning is key to getting the best image. There are a host of smartphone apps for eclipse chasers. The American Astronomical Society has compiled a list of useful ones for both iOS and Android devices, including its own Totality app that shows your location on a map of the totality path. The Solar Eclipse Timer uses your phones GPS to play an audio countdown to the moment of totality and highlights key moments. The apps maker advises using a separate phone for taking photos. Eclipse Calculator 2 for Android devices uses the phones camera to depict how the event will look in the sky from your position, using lines overlaid on top of the camera image. For iPhone users, apps like Sky Guide and SkySafari have eclipse simulators. There are other iOS apps that use augmented reality to simulate the eclipse, but theyre pricier and not yet on the societys list.  Digital SLR cameras will produce the best photos. Their manual exposure controls and ability to add zoom lenses and accessories like remote shutter buttons will let you make great pictures. Associated Press chief photographer Julio Cortez advises using a smaller aperture  f11 or f17  to keep the focus a little bit sharper. When he shot the 2017 total solar eclipse, he used an ISO setting of 1250 and 1/500 shutter speed.  The rest of us have our smartphones. NASA published detailed guidelines for smartphone eclipse photography in 2017 with the caveat that smartphones were never designed to do sun and moon photography. Thats because the wide-angle lenses on most devices wont let you capture close-up detail. But new phones released since then come with sophisticated sensors, multiple lenses and image stabilization software that give a better chance. Some experts suggest HDR, or High Dynamic Range, mode, which takes a series of pictures at different light levels and then blends them into a single shot  ideal for combining an eclipses very dark and very bright areas. But dont use flash. You can spoil the moment by ruining the vision of those around you whose eyes have adapted to darkness. The American Astronomical Society advises using a solar filter to protect cameras against intense sunlight and heat. You can buy a filter that screws onto DSLR lenses, but it will take time to remove when totality happens. Cortez made his own with cardboard, tinted film and fasteners that he can quickly rip off. For smartphones, you can use a spare pair of eclipse glasses and hold it over the lens, or buy a smartphone filter. Theres no international standard, but the societys website has a list of models it considers safe. Make sure macro mode is not on. If you plan to shoot for an extended time, use a tripod. To line up his camera after mounting it on a tripod, Cortez uses a solar finder, which helps locate the sun without damaging your eyes or equipment. Cortez also advises bringing a white towel to cover up your gear after setting up to keep it from overheating as you wait for the big moment. Its very tempting to make a TikTok or Instagram-friendly eclipse video. Perhaps you want to selfie video, narrating into the camera while the cosmic ballet between sun and moon plays out over your shoulder. Be careful: While you might think your vision isnt at risk because youre not looking at the sun, your phones screen could reflect harmful ultraviolet light, eye experts have warned. And if youre using a solar filter on the selfie camera, it will turn the picture dark and you wont show up. ___ Is there a tech challenge you need help figuring out?

Awe and dread: How religions have responded to total solar eclipses over the centuries,"Throughout history, solar eclipses have had profound impact on adherents of various religions around the world. They were viewed as messages from God or spiritual forces, inducing emotions ranging from dread to wonder. Ahead of the total solar eclipse that will follow a long path over North America on Monday, heres a look at how several of the worlds major religions have responded to such eclipses over the centuries and in modern times. In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, it is believed that the energy of positive and negative actions is multiplied during major astronomical events such as a solar eclipse. According to the late Lama Zopa Rinpoche with the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, both lunar and solar eclipses are auspicious days for spiritual practice. He has said that the merit  which represents the positive karmic results of good intentions and actions  generated on lunar eclipses is multiplied by 700,000 and on solar eclipses by 100 million. Some of the recommended spiritual activities on these days include chanting mantras and sutras. 
        
     Some Christians have believed that an eclipse portends the coming of the end times that will precede Christs return to Earth as prophesized at various points in the Bible. One such passage is in the second chapter of Acts: The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. There also has been a persisting belief among some Christians that an eclipse occurred during the crucifixion because three of the Bibles four Gospels mention a three-hour period of darkness as Jesus died. It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, for the sun stopped shining, says Luke 23:44. Its been noted that a three-hour period of darkness doesnt suggest a solar eclipse, which produces only a few minutes of darkness. But a recent commentary on ChurchLeaders.com  a website supported by numerous prominent evangelical pastors  said the darkness depicted in the three Gospels represents a profound spiritual transition. The temporary obscuring of the sun, juxtaposed with the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, offers a powerful metaphor for the transient nature of despair and the eternal promise of salvation and rebirth, the commentary says. The origin of eclipses in Hinduism is explained in ancient legends known as puranas. In one legend, the devas and asuras, who symbolized good and evil respectively, churned the ocean to receive the nectar of eternal life. As one of the asuras, Svarbhanu, posed as a deva to receive the nectar, the Sun god (Surya) and Moon god (Chandra) alerted Mohini, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, who then used a discus to behead Svarbhanu. But because the asura had already consumed a portion of the nectar, his immortal but detached head and body lived on under the names Rahu and Ketu. Legend has it that Rahu occasionally swallows the sun and the moon because of the gods part in his misery, causing solar and lunar eclipses. Hindus generally regard a solar or lunar eclipse as a bad omen. Some observe fasts before and many do not eat during the period of the eclipse. Observant Hindus ritually bathe to cleanse themselves during the first and final phases of an eclipse. Some also offer prayers to ancestors. Most temples are closed for the duration of the eclipse. Devotees gather for prayers along pilgrimage sites near holy rivers during the onset of an eclipse. The event is considered to be a good time for prayer, meditation and chanting of mantras  all believed to ward off evil. In Islam, a solar eclipse is a time to turn to God and pray. The eclipse prayer is based on narrations of sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. Kaiser Aslam, Muslim chaplain at the Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University, said one narration cited the prophet as saying: The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah and they do not eclipse because of the death of someone. ... Whenever you see these eclipses pray and invoke (Allah). The story was that after the death of the Prophet Muhammads son, Ibrahim, his companions tried to comfort him by saying that the sun eclipsed due to the greatness of the loss, Aslam said. The Prophet corrected them by reminding them that the sun and moon are signs of God and to not add any superstitions as to why an eclipse happens. On April 8, Aslam will lead the kusuf prayer on campus. Customarily, theres a brief sermon after the prayer to explain the lessons behind it and dispel any superstitions around it, he added. It is a beautiful and meaningful prayer that emphasizes our relationship with Gods creation, making sure to give our devotion to God, instead of incidental occurrences in Gods creation, Aslam said. Mahmoud Alhawary, an official with Al-Azhars Islamic Research Academy in Cairo, said its better for the eclipse prayer to be performed in congregation at the mosque, but that Muslims may also pray individually elsewhere. The wisdom is for the individual to seek refuge in God, requesting the lifting of this affliction, Alhawary said. People should know that the occurrences of the whole universe are in Gods hands. The Talmud  the collection of writings compiled more than 1,500 years ago that constitute Jewish religious law  offers specific blessings for many natural phenomena, but not for eclipses. Instead, it depicts an eclipse as an ill omen for the world. On Chabad.org  a website serving an Orthodox Jewish audience  Chicago-based Rabbi Menachem Posner sought to view the Talmud passage in a modern context, given the consensus that eclipses are natural events that can be predicted centuries in advance. Eclipses should be opportunities to increase in prayer and introspection  as opposed to prompting joyous blessings, Posner wrote. It is a sign that we really could and should be doing better. Writing in early March for the Orthodox Jewish education organization Aish, Rabbi Mordechai Becher noted that Judaism has longstanding interconnections with astronomy. He said there are three craters on the moon named after medieval rabbis with expertise in astronomy. As for eclipses, Becher  an instructor at Yeshiva University  suggested they were made possible by God for a profound reason. He created a system that would remind us regularly that our choices can create darkness, even at times when there should be light, he wrote. Our free will choices can create a barrier between us and the Divine light, but can also allow Divine light to be seen here. ___ Looking at a solar eclipse without glasses can be dangerous, heres what to know. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

A Soyuz craft with 2 Russians and 1 American docks at the International Space Station,"MOSCOW (AP)  A Soyuz spacecraft carrying two Russians and an American docked at the International Space Station on Wednesday, a little more than three hours after its launch. The capsule atop a towering rocket set off from a Russian launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and docked with the space station after two orbits of the Earth, a fast trip compared with some that have lasted for days. The crew already aboard the station were performing a lengthy series of system checks before those in the capsule can enter. The mission commander is Alexei Ovchinin, with Russian compatriot Ivan Vagner and American Donald Pettit in the crew. The launch took place without obvious problems and the Soyuz entered orbit eight minutes after liftoff, a relief for Russian space authorities after an automated safety system halted a launch in March because of a voltage drop in the power system. On the space station, Pettit, Vagner and Ovchinin will join NASAs Tracy Dyson, Mike Barratt, Matthew Dominick, Jeanette Epps, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, and Russians Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin and Oleg Kononenko. Wilmore and Williams have remained on the station long past their scheduled return to Earth. They arrived in June as the first crew of Boeings new Starliner capsule. But their trip to the orbiting laboratory was marred by thruster troubles and helium leaks, and NASA decided it was too risky to return them on Starliner.  The two astronauts will ride home with SpaceX next year.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-soyuz-space-station-american-russians-bddf1750a5d8ba4b17d7bc43f8ffff0e,science
Dunes on Pluto made of tiny frozen grains of methane,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Scientists have discovered dunes on Pluto made of tiny frozen grains of methane. The pale gray and white ridges were revealed by NASAs New Horizons spacecraft during its 2015 flyby. A British-led team announced the findings Thursday in the journal Science. Researchers said the dunes appear to be made mostly of icy specks of methane the size of sand, with some frozen nitrogen likely mixed in. Thought to be relatively recent, the parallel rows of dunes are located in Plutos heart-shaped region at the base of mountains as tall as the Alps and formed from giant blocks of ice with frosty methane snowcaps. These plains in the left lobe of Plutos heart are known as Sputnik Planitia. Scientists were surprised to find dunes given Plutos thin, weak atmosphere. They suggest nitrogen ice coating the surface of Sputnik Planitia transformed into gas that lifted methane particles into the air. Plutos gentle winds then carried and deposited the grains. Dunes already have been found on Mars, Venus, Saturns moon, Titan, and even a comet. But Plutos are the only ones known to consist of methane. Pretty much nowhere else we know of is cold enough! the studys lead author, Matt Telfer of Plymouth University in England, said via email Thursday. He noted there are dunes on the scorching surface of Venus under a dense atmosphere and out in the distant reaches of the solar system at minus 230 degrees Celsius (minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit) under a thin atmosphere. 
        
     These are not just balls of ice far out in space, he said, adding that frozen worlds on the fringes of our solar system, like the dwarf planet Pluto, might have been active early on. Researchers liken the dunes to those at White Sands, New Mexico, or Californias Death Valley. Its a little bit lower density than sand were used to holding on the Earth, Brigham Young Universitys Jani Radebaugh, a co-author, explained by phone. So it would feel lighter in your hand, but it would still be granular and would kind of flow off of your hand, and your feet would kind of crunch them as youre walking along. It would just kind of feel a lot like youre on another sand dune on the Earth. The team has yet to determine the height of the dunes; Telfer guesses theyre at least tens of meters (yards) tall Much work is left to do to understand dunes on Pluto, Cornell Universitys Alexander Hayes wrote in a companion article. He was not involved in the study. Most notably, it remains to be shown how high the dunes are, when they are most active, whether they change and whether particles can be swept into dunes without rising into the air. Nonetheless, he described the Telfer teams argument for uplifted methane granules as convincing. Launched in 2006, New Horizons was the first spacecraft ever to visit Pluto, passing within 7,770 miles (12,500 kilometers). The spacecraft is now headed toward an even more distant world in our solar systems so-called Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone. Its expected to zip past the Kuiper Belt object nicknamed Ultima Thule  orbiting 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto  on Jan. 1. Flight controllers at Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, will rouse New Horizons from a five-month electronic hibernation next week. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Spacewalking astronauts set up TV cameras for arriving ships,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts set up TV cameras Thursday for new crew capsules set to arrive in coming months. The International Space Stations commander, Drew Feustel, and Ricky Arnold completed the job after struggling with a balky shield for protection against space debris. They accomplished everything, but a small item managed to slip away. Feustel accidentally let go of a long, twisty wire tie as he secured one last piece of equipment, and it floated off into space. Now I have to live with the shame of losing a wire tie, he joked. Wrapping up the ninth spacewalk of his career, Feustel moved into third place on the all-time spacewalking list, which is topped by a Russian. Altogether, Feustel has spent 61 hours and 48 minutes out in the vacuum of space. As Thursdays spacewalk got underway, Feustel had to use a small crowbar to remove a protective shield in order to hook up a new cable for the high-definition TV cameras. Arnold floated over to help complete the initial cable work. Fantastic job, Mission Control radioed. But the NASA astronauts soon encountered more snags, slowing them down. They finally got the two high-def cameras installed on the end of 4 1/2-foot booms. The cameras are meant to provide sharp views of commercial crew capsules coming in to dock. Until SpaceX and Boeing start flying astronauts, NASA must rely solely on Russian capsules for getting to and from the 250-mile-high outpost. The Russians rides are costing NASA up to $82 million per person. 
        
     NASA hasnt launched astronauts into space from U.S. soil since the last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing are aiming for test flights from Cape Canaveral, Florida, by years end. The tentative schedule shows flights without a crew by both companies in late summer followed by launches with astronauts by December. But those dates are considered optimistic. During their nearly seven-hour spacewalk, Feustel and Arnold also replaced a camera in another part of the station, closed the flapping door to a laser-firing experiment to measure clouds and tackled some extra chores. Once back inside, they both called out, Were home! __ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"More delay, cost for NASAs next-generation space telescope","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs next-generation space telescope has been delayed yet again at a staggering cost of $1 million a day. For the third time in less than a year, the space agency announced a lengthy postponement Wednesday for the James Webb Space Telescope . The observatory will now fly no earlier than 2021; until last fall, it was on the books for a 2018 launch. The telescopes overall cost is now expected to reach nearly $10 billion. Development cost alone will exceed the $8 billion cap set by Congress by more than $800 million, and require reauthorization. An independent review board cites worker error and embedded hardware problems for much of the escalating costs and delays. In a vibration test of the telescope earlier this year in California by prime contractor Northrop Grumman, dozens of loose fasteners  some 70 pieces in all  came off. A few pieces are still missing and could well be inside the observatory. The lock nuts were not tightened properly before the test, according to a report by the board. In another mishap, the wrong solvent was used to clean spacecraft propulsion valves. No one bothered checking to see whether the cleaner might damage the equipment, said review board chairman Tom Young. The valves had to be repaired or replaced. Spacecraft sensors were also zapped with excess voltage due to improper wiring. The inspector on duty relied on the technicians word that hed wired it correctly and did not double-check the work, the board said. 
        
     These are just some of the seemingly small mistakes that could and should have been avoided, the board said. The loose and lost nuts and bolts alone were enough to bump the mission into 2021, officials noted. The 29-month delay from 2018 to 2021 represents a $1 billion hit  not including the cost of implementing the boards recommendations. Worker morale also took a hit as the problems mounted; the team had limited time off because of excessive overtime, the board said. NASA repeatedly was over-optimistic in the work schedule, especially given the complexities and unique features of the Webb telescope, Young said. Its sunshield, the size of a tennis court once unfurled in space, is needed to keep the infrared telescope cold and is a major risk area, he said. Despite the many problems, the review board urges that the project continue given its compelling scientific potential and national importance. Webb  considered a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope  is meant to peer farther into space and deeper into time than ever before. It will operate from a point 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth, unreachable by astronauts like the low-orbiting Hubble  launched in 1990 with a misshapen mirror  was. Make no mistake, Im not happy sitting here having to share this story. We never want to do this. We always want to talk about the successes that we have, said NASAs science mission chief Thomas Zurbuchen. Zurbuchen said NASA should have been providing better oversight and is part of the problem along with Northrop Grumman. Besides improved oversight, he said there will be more quality control and more NASA engineers will be taking part in everything moving forward. We have to get this right here on the ground, before we go to space, Zurbuchen said. Webb is worth the wait. Northrup Grumman acknowledged that problems have put the project behind schedule. The company said it has changed the way it works to prevent future issues. We will not sacrifice quality for schedule. Mission success is our number one priority, spokesman Tim Paynter said in a statement. The review board has issued 32 recommendations and NASA intends to implement them all, officials said. Last September, NASA announced it was delaying Webbs launch from 2018 to 2019. Then in March, the launch was postponed from 2019 to 2020. Now its March 30, 2021. The observatorys original launch date was 2010 and the cost under $1 billion. It was named after NASAs second administrator, who spearheaded the Apollo moon landings. Young said if the boards recommendations are rigorously implemented, then the newest date is feasible. He warned the new date does not allow for any more major problems or mistakes, or extra excessive testing. The complexity and risk cannot be overstated or overestimated, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX delivers AI robot, ice cream, mice to space station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Station got its first robot with artificial intelligence Monday, along with some berries, ice cream and identical brown mice. SpaceXs capsule reached the station three days after launching from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Station astronaut Ricky Arnold used a large mechanical arm to grab the Dragon capsule as the spacecraft soared above Quebec, Canada. The nearly 6,000-pound (2,700-kilogram) delivery includes the round robot Cimon, pronounced Simon. Slightly bigger than a basketball, the AI robot from the German Space Agency is meant to assist German astronaut Alexander Gerst with science experiments. Cimons brain will constantly be updated by IBM so its intelligence  and role  keep growing. There are also genetically identical mice for a study of gut bacteria, and super-caffeinated coffee aboard the Dragon to go with the fresh blueberries and ice cream. Looking forward to some really exciting weeks ahead as we unload the science and get started on some great experiments, Arnold told Mission Control minutes after snaring the Dragon. When informed it was the 30th cargo ship capture by the space stations robot arm, Arnold said, Its hard to believe ... how far weve come. Its quite an accomplishment. Most of those visiting vessels have been provided by private U.S. companies hired by NASA to keep the space station well stocked. 
        
     Mission Control said it was fitting that the latest capture occurred over Quebec; the stations robot arm is Canadas contribution. Flight controllers in Houston successfully maneuvered the Dragon tightly into place a few hours later. This particular Dragon is recycled and has visited the outpost once before. Besides Gerst, the 250-mile-high (400-kilometer-high) lab is home to three Americans and two Russians. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Report: NASA needs backup plan as US crew launches slip,"NASA needs a backup plan for getting astronauts to space, given additional delays on the horizon for new commercial crew capsules, the U.S. Government Accountability Office recommended Wednesday. Thats the top suggestion in the GAOs latest report on the SpaceX and Boeing crew capsules under development. Both companies have been shooting for test flights by the end of this year. But the GAO warned in its 47-page report that despite progress, further delays are likely. If postponements keep mounting, the GAO fears there could be a gap in U.S. access to the International Space Station. With its last shuttle flight seven years ago this month, NASA has been paying Russia up to $82 million a seat to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. But that contract is up at the end of next year. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access, the report by the Congressional watchdog agency stated. The audit also found that NASA lacks a consistent approach in gauging crew risk in these new spacecraft. NASA must balance safety with acceptable risk for human spaceflight, the report stated. NASAs human explorations chief, William Gerstenmaier, said the space agency is actively working on options to keep Americans living and working, uninterrupted, at the station. He also noted that while the different documentation for measuring crew risk can be confusing, it is up to NASAs commercial crew program to assure the proper safety guidelines. 
        
     SpaceX and Boeing have been vying to be the first to return Americans to space from U.S. soil since 2014, three years after NASAs shuttle program ended. Thats when NASA awarded contracts totaling nearly $7 billion to SpaceX and Boeing to develop crew capsules and demonstrate them in flight. The agreement called for the spacecraft to be certified by 2017. The SpaceX capsule is a beefed-up, human-rated version of the Dragon capsule already used to deliver cargo; Boeings craft is named Starliner. Each company plans a test flight without passengers, before putting astronauts on board. Currently, there are three Americans at the space station, along with two Russians and a German. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Walrus bones provide clues to fate of lost Viking colony,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Clues to the mystery of why Viking colonies in Greenland flourished and fell have been found in the DNA of medieval walrus bones housed in more than a dozen European museums. For almost 500 years, the Norse descendants of Erik the Red built churches and manor homes and expanded their settlements on the icy fringes of European civilization. On Greenland, they had elaborate stone churches with bronze bells and stained glass, a monastery, and their own bishop. Their colonies at one time supported more than 2,000 people. And then they vanished. Scholars have long wondered why. Why did they flourish and why did they disappear? asked Thomas McGovern, an anthropologist at Hunter College in New York. And did their greatest success also contain the seeds of their demise? Researchers who visited museums across western Europe to assemble a rare pile of artifacts  fragments of medieval walrus skulls  reported in a study in Wednesdays Proceedings of the Royal Society B that the fate of these medieval outposts may have been tied to the demand for walrus ivory among rich Europeans. The study revealed that during the height of the Norse settlement  from about 1120 to 1400  at least 80 percent of the walrus samples were directly sourced from Greenland. Its possible that almost all the walrus ivory in western Europe during the High Middle Ages came from Greenland, said Bastiaan Star, a scientist at the University of Oslo and one of the studys authors. This result tells a very clear story. 
        
     A dozen years ago, many historians believed that the changing climate of medieval Europe was the main reason Norse settlements in Greenland expanded and went extinct. This view was popularized in Jared Diamonds 2005 book Collapse. But evidence such as walrus bones at archaeological sites in Greenland and historical documents  including church records of tithes paid in walrus tusks  suggested another possible factor: that the Vikings descendants thrived on a lucrative trade in walrus tusks, which were sold to Europes elite and carved into luxury items, such as ivory crucifixes, knife handles, and fancy dice and chess sets. Archaeologists suspected that famous ivory artifacts from the Middle Ages  such as the Lewis Chessmen , a set of expressive and intricately carved statuettes from the 12th century now housed in the British Museum in London  were made from walrus tusks from Greenland. But they could not get permission to bore into these precious artifacts for genetic analysis. James Barrett, another study author and an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge, was opening dusty boxes and poring through museum catalogues in galleries in Norway, France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK when he realized that the tusks were often sold attached to fragments of walrus skulls  and that the bone could provide the DNA he needed. Barrett didnt get access to the Lewis Chessmen, but his hunt produced 23 medieval artifacts for analysis, after examining hundreds of related objects. This is the first study that conclusively shows that Greenland walrus exports obtained a near-monopoly in Europe, said Poul Holm, an environmental historian at Trinity College in Dublin, who was not involved in the study. McGovern, also not part of the study, said of the research: Its changing the story that weve been telling for years. If walrus ivory was the key to Greenlands medieval wealth, experts now suspect a collapsing market for the ivory may have helped doom the outposts. The Norse Greenland settlements vanished in the 1400s, sometime after life in continental Europe was badly rattled by the onset of the Black Death and the beginning of the Little Ice Age, an era of cooler climates. These calamities undermined demand for walrus ivory, said Barrett. After a bonanza tied to the novelty of bringing exotic products to the market in Europe, Holm said, the fading allure of the product locks the society in decline. ___ Follow AP Science Writer Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina . ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA sending spacecraft straight into suns glittering crown,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is sending a spacecraft straight into the suns glittering crown, an atmospheric region so hot and harsh any normal visitor would wither. Set to launch early Saturday, the Parker Solar Probe is as heat-resistant as a spacecraft gets, essential for exploring our star closer than ever before. The U.S. got a glimpse of the suns glowing, spiky crown, or corona, during last Augusts coast-to-coast total solar eclipse. Well, Parker Solar Probes going to be in there, said project scientist Nicola Fox of Johns Hopkins University. Heres why the Parker spacecraft is so tough and why scientists are so hot for this first-of-its-kind mission: SUPERHERO-WORTHY SHIELD Parkers lightweight heat shield is just 4  inches (11 centimeters) thick. But it can withstand 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,370 degrees Celsius) as well as extreme radiation, thanks to its high-tech carbon. Although the corona reaches millions of degrees, its a wispy, tenuous, environment and so the spacecraft wont need to endure such severe temperatures. The 8-foot (2.4-meter) shield will face the sun during the close solar encounters, shading the science instruments in the back and keeping them humming at a cool 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). As one scientist notes, this is a shield Captain America would envy. SEVEN YEARS IN HOT PURSUIT The spacecrafts path to the sun runs past Venus. It will fly by our solar systems hottest planet seven times over seven years, using the gravity of Venus to shrink its own oval orbit and draw increasingly closer to the sun. The first Venus flyby is in October, followed by the first dip into the suns corona in November. There will be 24 orbits between Venus and the sun, with the final three putting Parker closest to the sun  just 3.8 million miles (6 million kilometers) out  in 2024 and 2025. Thats a scant 4 percent of the 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) between Earth and the sun. 
        
     BREAKING RECORDS The records will start falling as soon as Parker takes its first run past the sun.. The current close-to-the-sun champ, NASAs former Helios 2, got within 27 million miles (43 million kilometers) in 1976. Parker will come within 15.5 million miles (25 million kilometers) in November and then start beating its own record. During its closest solar approaches, the spacecraft will hurtle through the corona at 430,000 mph (690 kph), setting a speed record. SOLAR SCIENCE Our yellow dwarf star is, in many ways, a mystery. The outreaching corona is hundreds of times hotter than the suns actual surface, confounding scientists. In addition, physicists dont know whats driving the solar wind, the supersonic stream of charged particles constantly blasting away from the sun. By being right in the thick of it, Parker should provide some answers, shedding light not only on our star but the billions of others out there. PARKER THE MAN Sixty years ago, a young astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, Eugene Parker, proposed the existence of solar wind. Many were skeptical and told him to read up on it first so you dont make these killer mistakes, he recalls. Vindication came with NASAs Mariner 2 spacecraft in 1962. Parker is now 91 years old and at Cape Canaveral with his family to witness his first launch  a Delta IV Heavy rocket with the spacecraft bearing his name. Its the first time NASA has named a spacecraft after someone whos still alive. In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, Parker noted from a publicity standpoint, it absolutely wipes out everything else in his career. At my age, it gets fatiguing. But of course, I enjoy it. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Small air leak in Russian capsule patched at space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronauts scrambled Thursday to patch a tiny hole in a Russian capsule that was allowing air to leak from the International Space Station. NASA and Russian space officials stressed the six astronauts were in no danger. The leak was detected Wednesday night  possibly from a micrometeorite strike  when it caused a small drop in cabin pressure. It was traced to a hole about 2 millimeters (less than one-tenth of an inch) across in a Soyuz capsule docked at the space station. Thursday morning, the crew taped over the hole, slowing the leak. Later, the two Russian spacemen put sealant on a cloth and stuck it over the area, while their colleagues took photos for engineers on the ground. Flight controllers, meanwhile, monitored the cabin pressure while working to come up with a better long-term solution. Mission Control outside Moscow told the astronauts to let the sealant dry overnight and that more leak checks would be conducted Friday. The makeshift repairs seem to have stabilized the situation, at least for now, officials said. Earlier, flight controllers tapped into the oxygen supply of a Russian cargo capsule to partially replenish the atmosphere in the station. The leaking Soyuz  one of two up there  arrived at the orbiting lab in June with three astronauts. Its their ride home, too, come December, and also serves as a lifeboat in case of an emergency. A NASA spokesman said it was premature to speculate on whether the three might have to return to Earth early if the leak, even as small as it is, cannot be stopped. The hole is located in the upper, spherical section of the Soyuz, which does not return to Earth, according to NASA.

"Rocket City, Ala.:Space history and an eye on the future","The birthplace of NASAs rockets lies in the land of cotton, hundreds of miles from Cape Canaverals launch pads. From the first U.S. satellites and astronauts, to the Apollo moon shots, to the space shuttles and now NASAs still-in-development Space Launch System, rocket history inundates Huntsville, Ala. Huntsvilles nickname, Rocket City, is thanks largely to Wernher von Braun and his team of fellow German-born rocketeers who settled here in the 1950s. The city has long been home to the Armys Redstone Arsenal and NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center. But now its attracting new generations of engineers, scientists and techies. Tourists come for the history. Kids and adults come to learn at Space Camp. It was von Braun, Marshalls first director, who wanted to showcase Huntsvilles rocket development and testing. Thus was born the U.S. Space & Rocket Center , an official NASA tourist spot that houses one of only three remaining Saturn V moon rockets, this one a National Historic Landmark. Von Braun planted the seed for Space Camp as well. Why band camp, football camp and cheerleading camp but no science camp, he wondered. He didnt live long enough to see Space Camp open in 1982 at the rocket center, but since then, 800,000 youngsters and grown-up space fans have attended daylong, weekend or weeklong sessions with space, robotics and aviation themes. Its address? One Tranquility Base, Huntsville. As in Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed, words spoken by astronaut Neil Armstrong when he landed on the moon with Buzz Aldrin. The 50th anniversary of those first moon steps is next July. Huntsville plans to shoot up thousands of little rockets in commemoration. 
        
     The DNA from Americas original rocket force still permeates Huntsville, according to Deborah Barnhart, the U.S. Space & Rocket Centers executive director. Its Alabamas No. 1 paid tourist attraction, with bus tours into the restricted Redstone and Marshall, and wild rocket-style rides Space Shot and G-Force Accelerator. Were all space geeks, and we love it, Barnhart said. Hunstville isnt just about history. Ongoing research aims to return astronauts to the moon and on to Mars. Were looking to the future, really looking to travel in space, trying to figure out the problems of living and working in space, Barnhart said. Despite Huntsvilles role, author Homer Hickam, a longtime Huntsville resident whos now retired from NASA, sees Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Houston getting most of the attention when it comes to space travel. Hickams 1998 memoir Rocket Boys became the movie October Sky. You look at all this whole great big Saturn V, and the only part that Houston was responsible for was, I dont know. This little part right here, Hickam said, laughing, as he pointed to the capsule at the tip of the 363-foot-long rocket, stretching horizontally in its massive exhibit hall. German-style beer gardens are hosted beneath the Saturn V every Thursday evening, spring to fall. Engineers and their families mobbed a recent one. Beverages included T-Minus, a locally made, tangerine-flavored beer. Monkeynaut brew is also a favorite. Its probably the most scientific small town in America, said retired Apollo program worker Billy Neal, a volunteer docent who shed his white lab coat for that nights Biergarten. Miss Baker, the squirrel monkey who preceded Mercury astronauts into space in 1959, is buried at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center. Space Campers sometimes leave bananas at her tombstone. Nearly 1,000 campers from around the globe swarmed the rocket center during a typical week this summer. They launched small rockets and got the feel of walking in space while dangling from the ceiling in harnesses or scuba diving in a water tank smaller but similar to what astronauts once used for practice. They were strapped into a mock cockpit coming in for a Mars landing and sat behind computers as flight controllers for the Mars mission. They even live in dormitories that look as though they belong on the moon or Mars. Camp counselors  called crew trainers  are mostly university students or recent graduates in STEM fields  science, technology, engineering or math. In July, campers got to meet the first Space Camp graduate to actually launch into space, Dottie Metcalf-Lindenburger. She attended a Space Academy for older students the same month that shuttle Discovery delivered the Hubble Space Telescope to orbit in 1990. She went on to fly aboard Discovery in 2010 as a NASA astronaut-educator. Space Camps simulations are as realistic as they can be for whats done in a week, she said. We cant train kids on a whole bunch of switches and circuit breakers and systems, but we can give them the big idea. Her goal is to help campers see that what they were doing this week isnt so very different than what we did in the program and how it prepares you for real space ... and then also to hopefully impart some things like all of us are going to go through rough times, but there are ways to stay plugged in. As Metcalf-Lindenburger shook hands with each of the nearly 1,000 graduates at weeks end, another Space Camp graduate, Serena Aunon-Chancellor, orbited Earth aboard the International Space Station. The roster of Space Camp alumni includes many other engineers and scientists, among them two others who lived on the space station and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who attended as an adult during his early tech days. This is a thinly veiled workforce-development program, Barnhart said. Were trying to inspire people in STEM. Were trying to inspire aviation-oriented people as well as robotics and cyber-security specialists. She added: These young people, here, theyre going into outer space someday. Cant make space?

2 Russians set record for longest single stay on the International Space Station,"MOSCOW (AP)  Two Russians on Friday set a record for the longest continuous stay on the International Space Station, according to Russias space agency. Roscosmos said Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub broke the old record of 370 days, 21 hours and 22 minutes, which was set in September 2023 by Russians Sergei Prokopiev and Dmitry Petelin and American Francisco Rubio.  Chub and Kononenko will add several days to their total before their scheduled return to Earth on Monday.  The 59-year-old Kononenko holds other space duration records, including the most cumulative time in space  1,110 days over the course of five missions by the time he lands in Kazakhstan next week.  Two American astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, have inadvertently been aboard the space station for much of the Russians record-setting stay.

Final day drama: Things to know about testimony on the Titan sub disaster,"Last year, five people hoping to view the Titanic wreckage died when their submersible imploded in the Atlantic Ocean. A Coast Guard panel thats investigating the Titan submersible disaster heard two weeks of testimony that ended Friday. Previous witnesses provided testimony that raised serious questions about whether warning signs were ignored. Heres what witnesses have been saying so far: The Marine Board of Investigation concluded two weeks of testimony Friday with a moment of silence for the five victims who perished on the submersible Titan. The chair said more work needs to be done before a final list of recommendations is submitted to the leadership of the Coast Guard. The final day brought some dramatic moments, including when a former OceanGate employee testified company co-founder Stockton Rush brushed aside worries about the U.S. Coast Guard. Rush said that if the Coast Guard became a problem, then he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away, according to Matthew McCoy, who resigned after the interaction. Also Friday, Capt. Jamie Frederick, commander of the Coast Guard sector based in Boston, appeared to be stunned to learn that the captain of Titans support vessel felt, in hindsight, there was a slight shudder around the time the submersible imploded on its way to the wreckage of the Titanic last year. Frederick said it was unconscionable that they wouldnt share that in real time, and said it couldve changed the equation in terms of the Coast Guard rescue response. 
        
     NASA and Boeing officials on Thursday described what they called their limited roles in the creation of the doomed submersible Titan even though the co-founder of OceanGate previously touted ties to NASA and aerospace manufacturers. Tony Nissen, the lead engineer for an experimental OceanGate submersible that imploded en route to the wreck of the Titanic said he refused to pilot it for a journey several years earlier because he didnt trust the operations crew. Justin Jackson, a materials engineer, said NASA was unable to fulfill a role in building and testing the carbon fiber hull because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said NASA officials were uncomfortable with being linked to the experimental submersible, saying our folks had some heartburn when OceanGate suggested NASAs endorsement. Boeing was involved in an early feasibility study of the use of carbon fiber for Titans hull and in OceanGates acoustic sensors on the hull before the relationship ended. Mark Negley, material and process engineer at Boeing, said OceanGate ultimately departed from some of its recommendations on the pressure hull. A key employee with the company that owned the experimental submersible that imploded pushed back at a question from a Coast Guard investigator focusing on whether OceanGate felt a sense of desperation to complete the dives because of the high price tag. Amber Bay, director of administration for OceanGate, insisted Tuesday that the company would not conduct dives that would be risky just to meet a need. That said, told the Coast Guard panel, There definitely was an urgency to deliver on what we had offered and a dedication and perseverance towards that goal. She also referred to clients as mission specialists and explorers, not passengers. She tearfully noted that she knew all of them. Theres not a day that passes that I dont think of them, their families and the loss, she testified through tears. A paid passenger on an expedition to the Titanic with the company that owned the Titan submersible testified before a U.S. Coast Guard investigatory panel that the vessel was unsafe. (AP Video produced by Rodrique Ngowi.) The co-founder of the company that owned the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic told a Coast Guard panel Monday that he hopes the tragedy yields a renewed interest in exploration. This cant be the end of deep ocean exploration, said businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Stockton Rush. He said the company was started with a laudable goal: We wanted to give humanity greater access to the ocean, specifically the deep ocean, Sohnlein said. Roy Thomas of the American Bureau of Shipping testified about challenges associated with carbon fiber, which was the material used for the pressure hull of the doomed Titan submersible. He noted that carbon fiber is difficult to manufacture and salt water can damage and weaken the material in multiple ways. He said theres no recognized standard for a submersible carbon fiber pressure hull for human occupancy and that carbon fiber is susceptible to fatigue failure under repeated external pressurization. When testifying about a dive that took place several years before the fatal accident, lead engineer Tony Nissen said he felt pressured to get the Titan ready and he refused to pilot it. Im not getting in it, Nissen said he told Rush. Nissen said Rush was difficult to work for, made demands that often changed day-to-day, and was focused on costs and schedules. Nissen said he tried to keep his clashes with Rush hidden so others in the company wouldnt be aware of the friction. Scientific director Steven Ross said that on a dive just a few days before the Titan imploded, the vessel had a problem with its ballast, which keeps vessels stable. The issue caused passengers to tumble about and crash into the bulkhead, he said. One passenger was hanging upside down. The other two managed to wedge themselves into the bow, Ross testified. He said nobody was injured but it took an hour to get the vessel out of the water. He said he didnt know if a safety assessment or hull inspection was carried out after the incident. A paid passenger on a 2021 mission to the Titanic said the journey was aborted when the vessel started experiencing mechanical problems. We realized that all it could do was spin around in circles, making right turns, said Fred Hagen. At this juncture, we obviously werent going to be able to navigate to the Titanic. He said the Titan resurfaced and the mission was scrapped. Hagen said he was aware of the risks involved in the dive. Anyone that wanted to go was either delusional if they didnt think that it was dangerous, or they were embracing the risk, he said. Operations director David Lochridge said the tragedy could possibly have been prevented if a federal agency had investigated the concerns he raised with them on multiple occasions. Lochridge said that eight months after he filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a caseworker told him the agency had not begun investigating and there were still 11 cases ahead of his. By that time, OceanGate was suing Lochridge and he had filed a countersuit. A couple of months later, Lochridge said, he decided to walk away from the complaint. He said the case was closed and both lawsuits were dropped. The whole idea behind the company was to make money, Lochridge testified. There was very little in the way of science. After Lochridges testimony this week, the federal agency responded that, at the time, it had promptly referred his safety concerns to the Coast Guard. Renata Rojas, a member of the Explorers Club which lost two paid passengers in the fatal dive, struck a different tone with her testimony. She said she felt OceanGate was transparent in the run-up to the dive and she never felt the operation was unsafe.

Canadas Niagara region declares a state of emergency to prepare for an influx of eclipse viewers,"NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP)  Ontarios Niagara Region has declared a state of emergency as it prepares to welcome up to a million visitors for the solar eclipse in early April. The total solar eclipse on April 8 will be the first to touch the province since 1979, and Niagara Falls was declared by National Geographic to be one of the best places to see it. The city is in the path of totality, where the moon will entirely block the suns rays for a few minutes. Niagara Falls Mayor Jim Diodati said earlier in March that he expects the most visitors his city has ever seen in a single day.  The regional municipality of Niagara is proactively invoking a state of emergency to prepare for the event. The declaration announced Thursday sets in motion some additional planning tools to prepare for the day, which could involve major traffic jams, heavier demands on emergency services and cell phone network overloads. The eclipse will reach Mexicos Pacific coast in the morning, cut diagonally across the United States from Texas to Maine, and exit in eastern Canada by late afternoon. Most of the rest of the continent will see a partial eclipse.",https://apnews.com/article/canada-solar-eclipse-niagara-falls-emergency-b82ab4a1539666045cdde60a0683ad1d,science
The solar eclipse may change some voting registration deadlines in Indiana. Heres what to know,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  While all eyes will be on the skies Monday, April 8 for the total solar eclipse, Indiana residents should also look to their voter registration.  The deadline to register to vote in Indianas upcoming primary is the same day as the solar eclipse that will shadow most of the state. Many county offices will be closed Monday in anticipation of the event, according to a March newsletter from the Indiana Election Division, but exceptions may extend the deadline for some voters. This isnt just a special day for space enthusiasts, the newsletter said.  If a county office is closed on the deadline date, the in-person application deadline is extended to noon the following day, according to state law. That means Hoosiers have until Tuesday, April 9 at noon to register to vote if their county office was closed Monday due to the eclipse.  If a county office is open on the day of the eclipse, the deadline to register in person is not extended, and residents must submit their applications by the end of the offices business day. Indiana residents are encouraged to check with their county for operation hours.  Angela Nussmeyer, co-director of the election division, said the office does not have a count of how many counties may have modified hours due to the eclipse.  While the deadline for in-person voter registration may be moved, the deadline to register online remains the same. Hoosiers must submit online applications by 11:59 p.m. Monday in order to register for the upcoming primary.  
        
     All of Indiana will at least see a partial eclipse, and the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path of totality will cross a large swath of central and southern Indiana. Cities in the path of totality include Terre Haute, Indianapolis, Bloomington and Muncie. The celestial event is expected to drive significant tourism to the state  The election division newsletter noted that regardless of whether a county is closed for eclipse day, early voting is not delayed and will start Tuesday with the opening of a county office.

2 record-breaking Russians and an American who lived on space station for 6 months return to Earth,"MOSCOW (AP)  A Soyuz capsule carrying two Russians and one American from the International Space Station landed Monday in Kazakhstan, ending a record-breaking stay for the Russian pair. The capsule landed on the Kazakh steppe about 3 1/2 hours after undocking from the space station in an apparently trouble-free descent. In the last stage of the landing, it descended under a red-and-white parachute at about 7.2 meters per second (16 mph), with small rockets fired in the final seconds to cushion the touchdown. The astronauts were to be extracted from the capsule and placed in nearby chairs to help them adjust to gravity, then given medical examinations in a nearby tent. Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub returned after 374 days aboard the space station; on Friday they broke the record for the longest continuous stay there. Also in the capsule was American Tracy Dyson, who was in the space station for six months. Eight astronauts remain in the space station, including Americans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have remained long past their scheduled return to Earth. They arrived in June as the first crew of Boeings new Starliner capsule. But their trip was marred by thruster troubles and helium leaks, and the U.S. space agency NASA decided it was too risky to return them on Starliner. The two astronauts are to ride home with SpaceX next year.",https://apnews.com/article/international-space-station-capsule-russians-americans-earth-5fa5492856400fb9e1ac1275c8364ea3,science
"Scientists show off space snowman, Ultima Thule, in 3D","LAUREL, Md. (AP)  The newly visited space snowman  the most distant object ever explored  is now appearing in 3D. At a news conference Thursday, scientists and others put on 3D glasses to see the city-size, two-sphered cosmic body in stereo, revealing possible curvy ridges. Ultima Thule, as its known, is still not showing any signs of craters, moons or rings. Photos taken by NASAs spacecraft New Horizons during a flyby earlier this week revealed that Ultima Thule (TOO-lee) has two reddish globes joined by a narrow neck, much like a snowman. It is 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) from Earth. Brian May, an astrophysicist better known as a guitarist with the rock band Queen, created the stereo images released Thursday. He joined in the New Years Day flyby festivities at Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, home to Mission Control. The Prize!! For those of us who waited with bated breath for the Ultimate Stereo of Ultima Thule ... here it is! tweeted May. Mark Showalter of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, said he expects to know within weeks or months, once better images arrive, whether Ultima Thule has any tiny moons or faint, narrow rings. He suspects there might be at least a couple moons a few hundred miles (kilometers) out. The data covering that area are still aboard the spacecraft, he noted. As for impact craters, lead scientist Alan Stern said hed be surprised if none turn up. If they are there, they will create a window into the interior so theyre super valuable tools. 
        
     For the next several days, data transmission will be halted temporarily because of the suns position smack between Earth and Ultima Thule, creating radio interference. It will take nearly two years for all of the data to be transmitted to Earth, given the vast distance. Ultima Thule is deep within the so-called Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone, well beyond the orbit of Neptune. In 2015, New Horizons first visited Pluto, which is barely in the Kuiper Belt, a full 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) closer to Earth. Since Tuesdays close approach, New Horizons is already 3 million miles (5 million kilometers) deeper into that mysterious region. It will keep pressing farther out, observing other objects from afar, and measuring dust and particles. Stern hopes to get another mission extension from NASA, so another flyby can be arranged sometime in the 2020s. In the meantime, hell come up with a formal name for Ultima Thule, to recommend to the International Astronomical Union, the deciding body. He acknowledged its current nickname may wind up on the short list. Everybody knows it as Ultima Thule, he noted. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Hubble Space Telescopes premier camera shuts down,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Hubble Space Telescopes premier camera has shut down because of a hardware problem. NASA said the camera stopped working Tuesday. Hubbles three other science instruments are still working fine, with celestial observations continuing. This third incarnation of the wide field camera was installed by spacewalking astronauts in 2009. The camera has backup electronics that could be called into action, if necessary, according to NASA. The camera has captured stunning images of stars, galaxies stretching far back in time and assisted in deep sky surveys. Its also studied objects in our own solar system, discovering some of the tiny moons around Pluto, as well as a 14th moon around Neptune. It takes pictures in both visible and ultraviolet light, as well as near infrared. Orbiting 350 miles (560 kilometers) above Earth, Hubble was launched in 1990 and visited by space shuttle astronauts, for repairs and upgrades, five times. Last fall, Hubble stopped working altogether for three weeks because of a pointing problem. This is the first time the camera has acted up like this, said Cheryl Gundy, a spokeswoman with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which handle science operations for the telescope. NASA is trying to pull together the team to try to diagnose the issue, Gundy said Wednesday. We would like to have Hubble back up and working as quickly as possible, and NASA is making that happen, even with the partial government shutdown, she added. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Hubble Telescope camera back in action after 1-week shutdown,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Hubble Space Telescopes premier camera is back in action, after a shutdown of just over a week. The Space Telescope Science Institute says the camera resumed observations Thursday. It stopped working Jan. 8. The wide field camera shut itself down, sensing a problem with voltage levels. It turns out the levels were normal and the readings were bad. The problem was solved after flight controllers reset the telemetry circuits. The repair effort was unaffected by the partial government shutdown; NASAs satellite operations are considered high priority. Spacewalking shuttle astronauts installed this camera in 2009. Its the third and final version of the instrument, and has captured stunning pictures of some of the earliest galaxies.

Scientists: Saturn spent billions of years without its rings,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Saturn may have flown solo for billions of years  almost its entire existence  before getting its stunning set of rings, a new study suggests. An Italian-led team reported Thursday in the journal Science that Saturns primary rings appear to be just 10 million to 100 million years old. The gas giant Saturn, on the other hand, is 4.5 billion years old, like all the other planets in our solar system. The findings are based on data collected by NASAs Cassini spacecraft while repeatedly diving between Saturn and its rings in 2017, shortly before its demise. By estimating the mass of the rings through gravity measurements, the researchers gauged the age of the three main rings: A, B and C. Its still a mystery, though, how these icy rings formed. Scientists suspect a collision between two of Saturns many moons or perhaps a moon and comet. The rings are made mostly of ice. The remaining 1 percent is dust and possibly organic contaminants. Overall, the material ranges in size from tiny particles, to pebbles, to boulders. Lead researcher Luciano Iess, a planetary scientist at Sapienza University in Rome, said orbital motion sprayed the dust and other contaminants onto the icy rings at a constant rate. His team calculated the length of time it would take for the contaminants to accumulate  it turned out to be a short 10 million to 100 million years. Its possible the rings originally were denser than they are now and have thinned over time, which would put them more in line with Saturns age. But Iess said theres little consensus for that theory. 
        
     Iess said NASAs Voyager spacecraft  as well as Cassini  had already provided clues that the rings had not formed with Saturn. But now we have much more concrete evidence, which was only possible to obtain during the final phase of the mission, called the Grand Finale, he wrote in an email. The only spacecraft to ever orbit Saturn, Cassini burned up as it plunged through the planets atmosphere. The masses of Saturns fainter D, F, G and E rings are considered negligible, the researchers wrote. Saturns E ring, meanwhile, has its own unique source: plumes of water vapor streaming into space from the moon Enceladus, believed to harbor an ocean beneath its surface. Iess noted the latest findings are another gift we received from this beautiful mission. Cassini, like all giants, has left a legacy that will last for a long time, he said. Cassini was launched from Florida in 1997. It carried the European probe named Huygens, which separated and landed on Saturns moon Titan in 2005. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Telescopes capture moment of impact during eclipse of moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers managed to capture the moment of an impact during this weeks eclipsed moon. Spanish astrophysicist Jose Maria Madiedo of the University of Huelva said Wednesday it appears a rock from a comet slammed into the moon during the total lunar eclipse late Sunday and early Monday. The strike was seen by telescopes in Spain and elsewhere as a bright flash. Madiedo said its the first impact flash ever seen during a lunar eclipse, although such crater-forming impacts are common. The object hit at an estimated 10 miles (17 kilometers) per second, and was 22 pounds (10 kilograms) and 12 inches (30 centimeters) across, according to Madiedo. Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles also recorded the impact during its livestream of the eclipse. A second flash was seen a minute after the first by some observers, said Anthony Cook, an astronomical observer at Griffith. It was in the brightest part of the moons image, Cook said of the second suspected strike, and there might not be enough contrast for the flash to be visible in our video. Madiedo said lunar impact monitoring generally is conducted five days before and after a new moon, when flashes can be easily observed. To take advantage of the three-plus-hour eclipse, he set up four extra telescopes in addition to the four he operates at the observatory in Seville. I did not want to miss any potential impact event, he explained in an email. I could not sleep for almost two days, setting up and testing the extra instruments, and performing the observation during the night of Jan. 21, he wrote. I was really exhausted when the eclipse was over. 
        
     Then computer software alerted him to the impact. I jumped out of the chair I was sitting on. I am really happy, because I think that the effort was rewarded, he said. Moon monitoring can help scientists better predict the rate of impacts, not just at the moon but on Earth, Madiedo noted. He helps run the Moon Impacts Detection and Analysis System, or MIDAS , in Spain. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASAs storm-silenced rover marks 15th anniversary on Mars,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Opportunity rover is silently marking the 15th anniversary of its touchdown on Mars. The spacecraft hasnt been heard from since a global dust storm last June. The six wheeler  about the size of a golf cart  logged more than 28 miles (45 kilometers) on the red planet before falling silent. There was so much dust in the Martian atmosphere that sunlight could not reach Opportunitys solar panels to generate power.md Flight controllers are still sending commands to the rover in hopes of a response.

Rare pangolins languish in China wildlife rescue system,"WASHINGTON (AP)  When Chinese police found them in the trunk of a smugglers car, 33 of the trafficked pangolins  endangered scaly mammals from southern China  were still alive, wrapped in plastic bags soaked with their own urine. But the fate of the creatures  whose scales are worth nearly their weight in silver on the black market  was not a happy one. Every last pangolin died in government captivity within a few months of the August 2017 seizure. A pioneering environmental nonprofit in Beijing has launched an investigation, called counting pangolins, to figure out what happens to such animals recovered from the illegal wildlife trade. Its findings so far highlight discrepancies between environmental laws and outcomes. China is hardly unique. The number of environmental laws on the books worldwide has increased 38-fold since 1972, according to an exhaustive U.N. Environment report released Thursday. But the political will and capacity to enforce those laws often lags  undermining global efforts to curb issues like wildlife trafficking, air pollution and climate change, the report found. The law doesnt self-execute, said Carl Bruch, a study co-author and director of international programs at the Environmental Law Institute in Washington, D.C. Each of the 33 pangolins transferred to the care of a government-run wildlife rescue center in Chinas Guangxi province died within three months  according to records obtained by the nonprofit China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation and shown to the Associated Press. 
        
     Whats still unclear is what happened to their bodies. Pangolins are insect-eating, scaly mammals  playfully described by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as resembling an artichoke with legs and a tail. Their scales  made of keratin, the same material in human finger nails  are in high demand for Chinese traditional medicine, to purportedly cure arthritis, promote breast-feeding for mothers, and boost male virility, although there is no scientific backing for these beliefs. The price of pangolin scales in China has risen from $11 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) in the 1990s to $470 in 2014, according to researchers at Beijing Forestry University. Scientists have designated all eight species of pangolins as being at risk of extinction  four species in Asia, and four in Africa. More than 1 million pangolins were trafficked between 2004 and 2014  for their scales, meat and blood  with China and Vietnam as the largest markets. In the last two decades, the number of pangolins worldwide has dropped by about 90 percent. In 2016, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) adopted a worldwide ban on commercial trade in pangolins, and China later approved that ban. Pangolins are also listed as a protected species in China. While Chinese state-run media have publicized a few high-profile poacher busts, watchdogs say a thriving black market for endangered-animal parts persists. In November 2017, customs officials in Shenzhen seized 13.1 tons (11.9 metric tonnes) of pangolin scales  reportedly the largest-ever seizure of scales from Africa  according to state media. The penalties offenders face are not always publicized, but in another case involving a smaller shipment of scales, two smugglers received prison sentences of five years, state media said. Its significant that China has adopted laws against trade in many endangered species, but the law itself isnt enough to protect a species from extinction, said Jinfeng Zhou, director of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation. Zhou wants the government to issue public records tracking all living and dead pangolins seized by authorities  and to offer evidence that contraband, including pangolin scales, is destroyed before it enters black markets. We are determined to know what happens to the pangolins, said Sophia Zhang, a researcher at the biodiversity group. After reading news reports about the August 2017 poaching bust, she filed information requests to government agencies and traveled to Guangxi to visit the wildlife rescue center. The Guangxi Forestry Department, which manages the wildlife rescue center, declined APs requests for an interview and comment. Chinas state-run news service Xinhua reported in December 2018 that China remains committed to stopping pangolin trafficking, noting there were 209 pangolin smuggling busts from 2007 to 2016. Less official attention has been paid to what happens after these busts. In Guangxi, Zhang saw that pangolins were kept in small cages and fed cat food at the wildlife center, whereas wild pangolins eat termites. She said she had tried to coordinate with Save Vietnams Wildlife, a nonprofit, to bring shipments of termites to feed the pangolins, but the center declined the offer. After the animals died, the center wouldnt reveal what happened to their scaly bodies. But in other instances, the same center has turned over live pangolins to industry groups  including a steel factory in Guangdong province and a farm associated with a Chinese traditional medicine center in Jiangxi province. The government released this information on its web site. In response to an information request from Zhang, the Guangxi Forestry Department sent copies of the licenses held by these organizations for handling pangolins. The reason for transferring pangolins remains unclear. We want the wildlife center to provide a full explanation, Zhang said. We know the trade in pangolins is very lucrative. The public should be able to know what happens. The biodiversity nonprofit has filed information requests about trafficked wildlife in nearly 30 Chinese provinces and has attempted to verify what happens to pangolin scales seized by customs officials. Zhang said wildlife rescue centers need better training to properly handle live animals. China has a rather complete set of environmental laws, said Barbara Finamore, the senior strategic director for Asia at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, DC. But environmental laws are not worth the paper theyre written on unless theres also strong enforcement and oversight. Countries large and small, rich and poor, have passed extensive green legislation since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. The world has made incredible progress in adopting environmental laws and environmental impact assessments, in creating environmental ministries and agencies, said Bruch, co-author of the U.N. report. Now comes the hard part. The legal framework is there in an enormous number of countries, said Deborah Seligsohn, a political scientist focusing on environmental policy at Villanova University. But once you have all these laws, you need trained and willing personnel to actually enforce them. You need boots on the ground. Green mandates often go unfunded, said Barney Long, director of species conservation at Global Wildlife Conservation, a nonprofit group in Austin, Texas. Many countries have laws stating the minimum number of park rangers that should be patrolling per square mile in national parks and protected areas. But these arent implemented if sufficient money isnt appropriated. Non-governmental groups  like the biodiversity nonprofit in Beijing  try to help close the gap between environmental laws and enforcement action. But in many countries, this is dangerous work. In 2017, at least 207 environmental defenders  including forest rangers, advocates, journalists, and inspectors  were murdered for performing such work, according to Global Witness, a research and advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. and London. There are some bright spots, experts say. China is gradually releasing more environmental data to the public, especially on air pollution, even as the government clamps down on other forms of information. And more officials are being held accountable, said Jennifer Turner, director of the Woodrow Wilson Centers China Environment Forum in Washington, D.C. Before local officials were only evaluated on economic performance  but now its harder to hide from environmental sins.

Tiny satellites fall silent after proving new tech at Mars,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Two tiny satellites have fallen silent hundreds of millions of miles away, after proving new technology at Mars. The twin CubeSats, nicknamed WALL-E and EVE, shadowed NASAs InSight lander to Mars last year. As the lander descended to the Martian surface in November, the briefcase-size satellites flew past the red planet, providing real-time updates to ground controllers in this first-of-its-kind experiment. This week, NASA said it hasnt heard from them for more than a month now  and doubts it ever will. WALL-E, which had been leaking fuel since liftoff last May, last radioed back on Dec. 29. Its now more than 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) beyond Mars. EVE went mum on Jan. 4; its nearly 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) past the red planet. These were the first CubeSats to venture into deep space, part of an $18.5 million experiment to see whether such compact, cheap devices might serve as radio relays at faraway worlds. Theres big potential in these small packages, program manager John Baker of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a statement. Chief engineer Andy Klesh noted the mission was about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology. Weve put a stake in the ground, he said. Future CubeSats might go even farther. Engineers speculate WALL-E and EVE might be wobbling and unable to point precisely to send messages, or there could be battery recharging issues. In any event, the mini satellites will remain in an elongated orbit around the sun. They were named after the main characters in the 2008 animated movie. 
        
     NASA, meanwhile, is still trying to contact the Mars lander Opportunity, silenced last June by a global dust storm that prevented sunlight from reaching its solar panels.

"NASA, SpaceX aim for March test of 1st new astronaut capsule","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA and SpaceX are now aiming for a March debut of the first capsule from a private company designed to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. No one will be on board for the crew Dragons inaugural test flight to the orbiting outpost. Officials on Wednesday set March 2 as the latest launch date. If the demo goes well, two NASA astronauts will take a test flight in July aboard the SpaceX capsule. It would be the first launch of U.S. astronauts into orbit, from U.S. soil, since NASAs shuttle program ended in 2011. President Donald Trump mentioned the upcoming milestone in Tuesday nights State of the Union address. Boeing, meanwhile, is shooting for an April launch of its first Starliner capsule without a crew. The first Starliner flight with astronauts would be August at best. NASAs commercial crew program has been delayed repeatedly over the years, forcing a lengthy, expensive reliance on Russian rockets. Each seat on a Russian Soyuz capsule has cost NASA as much as $82 million. More time is still needed to complete testing, training and safety reviews, according to NASA. Kathy Lueders, manager of NASAs commercial crew program, said the initial launches without astronauts are a great dry run for not only our hardware, but for our team to get ready for our crewed flight tests. NASA is paying SpaceX and Boeing to provide the capsules and fly astronauts to and from the space station, allowing the space agency to focus on developing a new capsule, Orion, and rocket, Space Launch System or SLS, for transporting astronauts to the moon and, eventually, Mars. 
        
     SpaceX has been delivering cargo to the space station since 2012, under contract to NASA. Northrop Grumman is NASAs other station supplier. Blue Origin is also developing a crew capsule that might carry passengers by years end. But that capsule is intended for brief up-and-down hops, not orbital flights, by tourists. Virgin Galactic also is preparing a spaceship for tourists. Wednesdays announcement fell on the one-year anniversary of SpaceXs debut of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which shot chief executive Elon Musks red Tesla convertible into space with a mannequin, dubbed Starman, at the wheel. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Neptunes newest, tiniest moon likely piece of bigger one","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Neptunes newest and tiniest moon is probably an ancient piece of a much larger moon orbiting unusually close. In the journal Nature on Wednesday, California astronomers shine a light on the 21-mile-diameter (34-kilometer-diameter) moon Hippocamp, named after the mythological sea horse. The SETI Institutes Mark Showalter discovered Neptunes 14th moon in 2013, using Hubble Space Telescope images.

The two moons orbit just 7,500 miles (12,000 kilometers) apart and were likely even closer in the past before Proteus migrated outward. Scientists have long believed Neptunes inner moons were repeatedly broken apart by collisions with comets, according to Showalter. The discovery of Hippocamp, orbiting so close to the much larger moon Proteus, provides a particularly dramatic illustration of the Neptune systems battered history, Showalter said in an email. While the researchers said they cannot rule out the possibility that Hippocamp is unrelated to Proteus, the moons tiny size and peculiar location support their formation theory. Discovered by NASAs Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, dark and irregularly shaped Proteus is Neptunes second-largest moon, measuring about 250 miles (400 kilometers) across. The biggest is Triton. 
        
     Voyager 2 beamed back pictures of a massive impact crater on Proteus. Thanks to Hubble, now we know that a little piece of Proteus got left behind and we see it today as Hippocamp, Showalter said in a statement. With two moons so close together, a big one like Proteus normally would knock a little one like Hippocamp right out of orbit or swallow it. Showalter said hes searched for more little moons around Neptune, using Hubble observations. He wouldnt be surprised if there are more, but noted it will take a spacecraft in orbit around Neptune to find them.

"NASA, SpaceX OK 1st test flight of crew capsule next week","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA and SpaceX on Friday approved a first test flight next week of the new commercial Dragon capsule designed for crew. No one will be aboard, only an instrumented dummy in a white SpaceX spacesuit. But the capsule will still fly to the International Space Station, following its planned March 2 liftoff from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. Officials gave the green light after conducting a safety review. NASAs head of human exploration and operations, William Gerstenmaier, called the upcoming test flight an absolutely critical first step to eventually putting astronauts on board. A phenomenal amount of work has gone into ensuring the capsule does not endanger the space station and its three occupants as it pulls up and docks, Gerstenmaier said. It will remain at the orbiting lab just under a week before aiming for a splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida. Radiation monitors and supplies are going up, and science samples and used equipment are coming down. Human spaceflight is the companys core mission, said Hans Koenigsmann, a SpaceX vice president, and for now, theres nothing more important than this endeavor. Its a really big deal for SpaceX, he told reporters. Space X has been making space station shipments since 2012. The private company had to overhaul its cargo capsule for astronauts. If the upcoming demo goes well, two NASA astronauts could strap in for the next test flight this summer. Officials stressed much work remains to be done, with problems possibly solved through redesign, before the capsule is qualified to carry humans. 
        
     It would be the first launch of NASA astronauts from U.S. soil in eight years, since NASAs shuttle program ended. They have been riding Russian rockets to get to and from the space station, costing NASA tens of millions of dollars per seat. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket scheduled to soar at 2:48 a.m. EST on March 2 is brand new. NASA does not want recycled boosters for these crew capsule missions. SpaceX plans to conduct a high-altitude launch abort in April, reusing this same capsule. Boeing is also in the commercial race to transport space station astronauts. Its first Starliner demo is targeted for April, and the second, with astronauts, no earlier than August. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX shipment reaches space station after weekend launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX shipment arrived at the International Space Station on Monday with a cosmic catch by a pair of Canadians. The Dragon capsule delivered 5,500 pounds (2,500 kilograms) of equipment and experiments. Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques used the stations big robot arm  also made in Canada  to capture the Dragon approximately 250 miles (400 kilometers) above the North Atlantic Ocean. An external cable that normally comes off during launch dangled from the capsule, but it did not interfere with the grappling. Welcome on board, Dragon, Saint-Jacques radioed. He congratulated ground teams for their help, in both English and French. Saint-Jacques later told Canadian schoolchildren it was a big moment of pride to grab the Dragon using the stations 58-foot (18-meter) robot arm  Canadas main contribution to the space station. He became the first Canadian to use it to grab a visiting spacecraft  a cosmic catch, in the words of the Canadian Space Agency. To be at the controls myself, after all these years of training, it was a very, very special moment  and, fortunately, it all went well, Saint-Jacques told the schoolchildren later in the day. Its the second station visit for this recycled Dragon, which was launched by SpaceX on Saturday from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It also flew in 2017. This is SpaceXs 17th delivery to the space station; the first was in 2012. Northrop Grumman is NASAs other shipper; its Cygnus cargo ship arrived just two weeks ago. 
        
     The Dragon will remain about a month, being filled with science samples for return to Earth. Its the only cargo ship capable of coming back intact. Besides one Canadian, the space station is home to three Americans and two Russians. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Travelers through Maines biggest airport can now fly to the moon. Or at least a chunk of it,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP)  Fly me to the moon. Or, at least, to Maine. Maines largest airport is now home to the second largest piece of the moon on Earth, according to moon rock enthusiasts who installed the extraterrestrial chunk. The moon piece is a little bigger than a rugby ball and is on loan to the Portland International Jetport from the Maine Mineral & Gem Museum. The moon chunk went on display at the airport on Tuesday and organizers said, jokingly, that it gives Maine travelers a chance to go somewhere no other airport can take them  the moon. The piece is housed in an exhibit alongside one of the worlds largest pieces of Mars and other samples. This exhibit will be full of beautiful examples of meteorite specimens from the moon, Mars and the asteroid 4 Vesta, said Cari Corrigan, curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian Institution. The moon chunk weighs about 94 pounds (42.7 kilograms) and is the result of an asteroid striking the moon, said Darryl Pitt, a consultant to the mineral museum and a meteorite dealer. It was found in Libya in 2021, but exactly when the piece fell to Earth is difficult to say, he said. The piece is usually displayed at the Bethel museum in Maines western mountains, some 70 miles (112.65 kilometers) from Portland. The museums organizers said it is home to the largest known pieces of the moon and Mars, as well as the worlds largest collection of lunar meteorites. 
        
     Organizers said the display of the moon piece at the airport is especially appropriate because of the buzz about the coming total solar eclipse in April. The National Weather Service has said the total solar eclipse will occur for a large portion of northern Maine with a partial eclipse for the remainder of the state. We love celebrating unique aspects of Maine and the MMGM is certainly among them, said Paul Bradbury, the director of the Portland airport. The moon chunk exhibit is slated to be on display at the airport for five years, organizers said.",https://apnews.com/article/moon-rock-airport-maine-e17bf66338b16871e09cc8abac618c25,science
A faster spinning Earth may cause timekeepers to subtract a second from world clocks,"Earths changing spin is threatening to toy with our sense of time, clocks and computerized society in an unprecedented way  but only for a second. For the first time in history, world timekeepers may have to consider subtracting a second from our clocks in a few years because the planet is rotating a tad faster than it used to. Clocks may have to skip a second  called a negative leap second  around 2029, a study in the journal Nature said Wednesday. This is an unprecedented situation and a big deal, said study lead author Duncan Agnew, a geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Its not a huge change in the Earths rotation thats going to lead to some catastrophe or anything, but it is something notable. Its yet another indication that were in a very unusual time. Ice melting at both of Earths poles has been counteracting the planets burst of speed and is likely to have delayed this global second of reckoning by about three years, Agnew said. We are headed toward a negative leap second, said Dennis McCarthy, retired director of time for the U.S. Naval Observatory who wasnt part of the study. Its a matter of when. Its a complicated situation that involves, physics, global power politics, climate change, technology and two types of time. Earth takes about 24 hours to rotate, but the key word is about. 
        
     For thousands of years, the Earth has been generally slowing down, with the rate varying from time to time, said Agnew and Judah Levine, a physicist for the time and frequency division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The slowing is mostly caused by the effect of tides, which are caused by the pull of the moon, McCarthy said. This didnt matter until atomic clocks were adopted as the official time standard more than 55 years ago. Those didnt slow.  That established two versions of time  astronomical and atomic  and they didnt match. Astronomical time fell behind atomic time by 2.5 milliseconds every day. That meant the atomic clock would say its midnight and to Earth it was midnight a fraction of a second later, Agnew said. Those daily fractions of seconds added up to whole seconds every few years. Starting in 1972, international timekeepers decided to add a leap second in June or December for astronomical time to catch up to the atomic time, called Coordinated Universal Time or UTC. Instead of 11:59 and 59 seconds turning to midnight, there would be another second at 11:59 and 60 seconds. A negative leap second would go from 11:59 and 58 seconds directly to midnight, skipping 11:59:59. Between 1972 and 2016, 27 separate leap seconds were added as Earth slowed. But the rate of slowing was tapering off. In 2016 or 2017 or maybe 2018, the slowdown rate had slowed down to the point that the Earth was actually speeding up, Levine said. Earths speeding up because its hot liquid core  a large ball of molten fluid  acts in unpredictable ways, with eddies and flows that vary, Agnew said.  Agnew said the core has been triggering a speedup for about 50 years, but rapid melting of ice at the poles since 1990 masked that effect. Melting ice shifts Earths mass from the poles to the bulging center, which slows the rotation much like a spinning ice skater slows when extending their arms out to their sides, he said. Without the effect of melting ice, Earth would need that negative leap second in 2026 instead of 2029, Agnew calculated. For decades, astronomers had been keeping universal and astronomical time together with those handy little leap seconds. But computer system operators said those additions arent easy for all the precise technology the world now relies on. In 2012, some computer systems mishandled the leap second, causing problems for Reddit, Linux, Qantas Airlines and others, experts said. What is the need for this adjustment in time when it causes so many problems? McCarthy said. But Russias satellite system relies on astronomical time, so eliminating leap seconds would cause them problems, Agnew and McCarthy said. Astronomers and others wanted to keep the system that would add a leap second whenever the difference between atomic and astronomical time neared a second. In 2022, the worlds timekeepers decided that starting in the 2030s theyd change the standards for inserting or deleting a leap second, making it much less likely. Tech companies such as Google and Amazon unilaterally instituted their own solutions to the leap second issue by gradually adding fractions of a second over a full day, Levine said. The fights are so serious because the stakes are so small, Levine said. Then add in the weird effect of subtracting, not adding a leap second, Agnew said. Its likely to be tougher to skip a second because software programs are designed to add, not subtract time, McCarthy said. McCarthy said the trend toward needing a negative leap second is clear, but he thinks its more to do with the Earth becoming more round from geologic shifts from the end of the last ice age. Three other outside scientists said Agnews study makes sense, calling his evidence compelling. But Levine doesnt think a negative leap second will really be needed. He said the overall slowing trend from tides has been around for centuries and continues, but the shorter trends in Earths core come and go. This is not a process where the past is a good prediction of the future, Levine said. Anyone who makes a long-term prediction on the future is on very, very shaky ground. ___ Read more of APs climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Schools in the path of Aprils total solar eclipse prepare for a natural teaching moment,"CLEVELAND (AP)  Seventh-grade student Henry Cohen bounced side to side in time to the Beatles Here Comes the Sun playing in teacher Nancy Morris classroom, swinging his arms open and closed across the planets pictured on his T-shirt. Henry and other classmates at Clevelands Riverside School were on their feet, dancing during a session of activities tied to Aprils total solar eclipse. Second-graders invited in for the lessons sat cross-legged on the floor, laughing as they modeled newly decorated eclipse viewing glasses. Dioramas with softball-sized model earths and moons and flashlight suns occupied desks and shelves around the room. Henry said his shirt reflected his love of space, which he called a cool mystery. The eclipse, he said, is a one in a million chance and Im glad I get to be here for it.  For schools in or near the path of totality of the April 8 eclipse, the event has inspired lessons in science, literacy and culture. Some schools also are organizing group viewings for students to experience the awe of daytime darkness and learn about the astronomy behind it together.  A hair out of the path of totality, the school system in Portville, New York, near the Pennsylvania line, plans to load its 500 seventh- through 12th-grade students onto buses and drive about 15 minutes into the path, to an old horse barn overlooking a valley. There, they will be able to trace the shadow of the eclipse as it arrives around 3:20 p.m. EDT.  It required rearranging the hours of the school day to remain in session, but Superintendent Thomas Simon said staff did not want to miss out on the learning opportunity, especially at a time when when students experience so much of life through screens. 
        
     We want them to leave here that day feeling theyre a very small part of a pretty magnificent planet that we live on, and world that we live in, and that theres some real amazing things that we can experience in the natural world, Simon said. Schools in Cleveland and some other cities in the eclipses path will be closed that day so that students arent stuck on buses or in crowds of people expected to converge. At Riverside, Morris came up with a mix of crafts, games and models to educate and engage her students ahead of time. They really were not realizing what a big deal this was until we really started talking about it, Morris said. Learning about phases of the moon and eclipses is built into every states science standards, said Dennis Schatz, past president of the National Science Teaching Association. Some school systems have their own planetariums  relics of the 1960s space race  where students can take in educational shows about astronomy. But there is no better lesson than the real thing, said Schatz, who encourages educators to use the eclipse as a teachable moment. Dallas science teachers Anita Orozco and Katherine Roberts plan to do just that at the Lamplighter School, arranging for the entire pre-K- through fourth-grade student body to watch it together outdoors. The teachers spent a Saturday in March at a teaching workshop at the University of Texas at Dallas where they were told it would be almost criminal to keep students inside. We want our students to love science as much as we do, Roberts said, and we just want them understanding and also having the awe of how crazy this event is.  Wrangling young children may be a challenge, Orozco said, but we want it to be an event. In training future science teachers, University at Buffalo professor Noemi Waight has encouraged her student teachers to incorporate how culture shapes the way people experience an eclipse. Native Americans, for example, may view the total eclipse as something sacred, she said. This is important for our teachers to understand, she said, so when theyre teaching, they can address all of these elements. The STEM Friends Club from the State University of New York Brockport planned eclipse-related activities with fourth-grade students at teacher Christopher Albrechts class, hoping to pass along their passion for science, technology, engineering and math to younger students. I want to show students what is possible, said Allison Blum, 20, a physics major focused on astrophysics. You know those big mainstream jobs, like astronaut, but you dont really know whats possible with the different fields. Albrecht sees his fourth-grade students interest in the eclipse as a chance to incorporate literacy into lessons, too  maybe even spark a love of reading. This is is a great opportunity to read a lot with them, Albrecht said. He has picked What Is a Solar Eclipse? by Dana Meachen Rau and A Few Beautiful Minutes by Kate Allen Fox for his class at Hill Elementary School in Brockport, New York.  Its capturing their interest, he said, and at the same time, their imagination, too. ___ Associated Press writer Patrick Orsagos contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/eclipse-school-teach-science-experiment-a179fe2c0ac71074087678d7b52dc281,science
US air quality is slipping after years of improvement,"After decades of improvement, Americas air may not be getting any cleaner. Over the last two years the nation had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier, federal data shows. While it remains unclear whether this is the beginning of a trend, health experts say its troubling to see air quality progress stagnate. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when America had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed just the opposite, saying earlier this month in Ireland: We have the cleanest air in the world, in the United States, and its gotten better since Im president. Thats not quite the case. There were noticeably more polluted air days each year in the presidents first two years in office than any of the four years before, according to new Environmental Protection Agency data analyzed by The Associated Press. The Trump administration is expected to replace an Obama-era rule designed to limit emissions from electric power plants on Wednesday. Called the Clean Power Plan, it would have gradually phased out coal-burning power plants that emit both air pollutants and heat-trapping gases responsible for climate change. Air quality is affected by a complex mix of factors, both natural and man-made. Federal regulations that limit the emissions of certain chemicals and soot from factories, cars and trucks have helped dramatically improve air quality over recent decades. In any given year, however, air quality can be affected by natural variations. That may be whats behind the stalled progress, scientists say. 
        
     What youre seeing is a flattening off of progress as opposed to a major change in the wrong direction, said former deputy EPA administrator Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. But Trump is moving to loosen regulations on coal-fired power plants and cars that scientists credit for cleaner air, and he appears to be less stringent about enforcing current rules, according to data obtained by environmental advocates through the Freedom of Information Act. Scientists say that it is too early to see the effects of changes in environmental policy of the Trump administration, which took office in January 2017. But they say looser restrictions and lax enforcement would almost certainly reverse the gains that have been made in recent decades, potentially turning what has so far been a modest, two-year backslide into a dangerous trend. Today it feels like the future of our kids and our country is at stake, said former Obama EPA chief Gina McCarthy, now director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard School of Public Health. We do not have the cleanest air and we have not crossed the finish line when it comes to pollution. The EPA quietly posted new air quality data online last month that shows a recent uptick in polluted days. Five hundred and thirty-two American metro areas reported a total of 4,134 days in 2018 when the official air quality index passed 100, which means it is unhealthy for people with heart and lung disease, the elderly and the very young. Thats about 15% more bad air days per city than the average for 2013 to 2016, Americas clean air heyday. The worst of the bad air days jumped even more. On average, in 2017 and 2018 there were nearly 140 times when a citys air pollution reached the worst two categories  very unhealthy and hazardous  with the air quality index greater than 200. Thats more than two-and-a-half times the average of nearly 55 from 2013 to 2016. Last year, Riverside, California, topped the nation with 13 days in the worst two air quality categories and had the most bad air days of all types: 173. About 100,000 Americans each year die prematurely because of polluted air, studies show. El Paso, Texas, saw one of the biggest increases in bad air days from the mid-2010s among metro areas with at least 750,000 people. Like the rest of the country, El Paso has seen huge improvements in recent decades, but things have turned worse recently, and people say they notice. El Paso first grade teacher Tonya Olivas said shes had to watch her son Joey more carefully. If hes having issues with coughing excessively because of his asthma, I will pull him out of recess and P.E. I wont let him go outside, she said. El Paso averaged more than 200 bad air days a year in the 1980s. That dropped steadily to just under 14 a year on average from 2010 to 2016, then ticked up to an average of about 20 over the past two years. In an email, the EPA told The Associated Press the increase in unhealthy air days in 2017 is largely associated with wildfires in the west and it is studying 2018 before officially announcing its annual air trend data. Air pollution experts agree wildfires likely have had a role, along with random variation, a stronger economy which leads to more consumption of fuels, and a changing climate. Higher temperatures increase the chances for fires and smog. Even with the recent stagnation, there are far fewer bad air days now than in the early 2000s, 1990s and 1980s. Perciasepe said whats happening now is a tug of war between the worsening effects of warming on air quality and cleaner air from less coal use and more efficient cars. But if regulations on coal plants, cars and other emissions are relaxed, the air quality will deteriorate, said Carnegie Mellon University engineering professor Neil Donahue. There is zero reason to expect any other outcome, he said. ___ Borenstein reported from Washington, Forster from New York.

NASA: Budget boost good start to put astronauts on moon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs chief said Tuesday that the Trump administrations proposed $1.6 billion budget boost is a good start for getting astronauts back on the moon within five years. Administrator Jim Bridenstine addressed employees a day after the White House introduced the budget amendment. During an hourlong town hall from NASA headquarters in Washington, Bridenstine said $1.6 billion is enough for 2020. But more money will be needed in the years ahead to land the next man and the first woman at the south pole of the moon by 2024. NASA is once again turning to Greek mythology for the name of the project. Its being called Artemis, after the twin sister of Apollo. Apollo was the name of NASAs moonshot program that, 50 years ago this summer, achieved the first manned lunar landing. NASA landed 12 men on the moon over six Apollo missions. For the next go-around, the space agency wants its moonwalkers to reflect todays more diverse astronaut corps, thus the name of Apollos sister. Artemis was goddess of the hunt as well as the moon. I have a daughter, shes 11 years old, and I want her to see herself in the same position that our current, very diverse astronaut corps currently sees itself, having the opportunity to go to the moon, Bridenstine said. In the 1960s, young ladies didnt have the opportunity to see themselves in that role. Today, they do. Bridenstine said hes heartened by the fact that the extra money, if approved by Congress, will come from outside NASA, rather than being taken from the International Space Station or other departments within the space agency. 
        
     The administration seeks to use money from Pell Grants for college education, for NASAs new spending. Bridenstine said hes already heard criticism of how the new spending will be dead on arrival in Congress because neither NASA nor the administration worked in advance with Congress on it. As a former congressman from Oklahoma, he said he knows how the process works and assured the space agencys 17,000 employees that would not be the case. This is a good out-of-the-gate first start, a very honest proposal from the administration that keeps us all together, moving forward, he said. He also plugged NASAs ongoing Space Launch System megarocket and Orion spacecraft, both under development, and a proposed outpost in the vicinity of the moon, called Gateway. A few hours later, Bridenstine found himself before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, talking up the Artemis moon plan. The space agency envisions that the effort will involve private industry as well as other countries. Just last week, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos introduced a mock-up of his own planned lunar lander for his Blue Origin space company. In March, Vice President Mike Pence urged NASA to accelerate its moon-landing program, moving it up from 2028 to 2024. NASA has flip-flopped between the moon and Mars, a victim of changing presidential administrations. More recently, President Barack Obama targeted Mars as astronauts next big destination, while President Donald Trump has favored the moon. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

AP-NORC poll: Asteroid watch more urgent than Mars trip,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Americans prefer a space program that focuses on potential asteroid impacts, scientific research and using robots to explore the cosmos over sending humans back to the moon or on to Mars, a poll shows.  The poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research , released Thursday, one month before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, lists asteroid and comet monitoring as the No. 1 desired objective for the U.S. space program. About two-thirds of Americans call that very or extremely important, and about a combined 9 in 10 say its at least moderately important. The poll comes as the White House pushes to get astronauts back on the moon, but only about a quarter of Americans said moon or Mars exploration by astronauts should be among the space programs highest priorities. About another third called each of those moderately important. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on July 20, 1969, became the first humans to walk on another celestial body. In all, 12 NASA astronauts stepped on the moon. Jan Dizard, 78, a retired environmental studies professor living in Chico, California, acknowledges theres more to learn on the moon and it would be miraculous to send astronauts to Mars. But nows not the time, he stressed. There are all kinds of other things, not the least of which is climate change, that deserve our attention, Dizard told the AP. This other stuff can wait. 
        
     After asteroid and comet monitoring, scientific research to expand knowledge of Earth and the rest of the solar system and universe came next on the list of Americans space priorities  about 6 in 10 said that was very or extremely important. Close to half said the same about sending robotic probes, rather than astronauts, to explore space, and about 4 in 10 said the same about continued funding of the International Space Station. Searching for life on other planets came in fifth with 34% rating it at least very important, followed by 27% for human Mars expeditions and 23% for crewed moonshots. In a dead heat for last place among the nine listed goals: setting up permanent human residences on other planets, with 21% ranking it as a very high priority, and establishing a U.S. military presence in space with 19%. While other goals were considered at least moderately important by majorities of Americans, about half called a military presence and space colonies unimportant. President Donald Trump, who wants to create a Space Force as a new military service, said at a rally formally kicking off his reelection campaign this week that, if he wins a second term, the country will lay the foundation for landing astronauts on Mars. That came after a confusing tweet from Trump in which he said that NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon and instead focus on much bigger things including Mars (of which the Moon is a part). NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine later explained that the moon can be used as a waypoint for Mars access. Toni Dewey, 71, a retired clerical worker in Wilmington, North Carolina, said space exploration should benefit life on Earth and the explorers should be machines versus humans. It would cost a lot of money to send somebody to Mars, she said, and we have roads and bridges that need repaired here. As for the moon, Dewey noted, Weve been there. But Alan Curtis, 47, of Pocatello, Idaho, considers moon and Mars trips a top priority, especially if the U.S. is to remain a world leader in space. Compared with its feats of the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. space program is now a second thought, he said. Its pretty bad that we have to rent a spot on a Russian spacecraft to get to the space station, said Curtis, a store cashier who says hes an occasional bounty hunter. He pointed to the first-ever landing by a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, by China in January. Abdul Lotiff, 28, a retail security company manager in Mason City, Iowa, also favors a return to the moon. He sees economic benefits there, with the resulting new tech spilling into areas outside the space business. In addition, he said, if and when Earth becomes overpopulated, the moon could serve as a springboard for humanitys expansion into space. The survey asked Americans to directly choose between the moon and Mars for exploration by U.S. astronaut. The red planet was the winner by about double: 37% compared with 18%. However, 43% said neither destination was a priority. For Americans under 45  born after NASAs Apollo moonshots  Mars came out on top by an even larger margin: 50% prefer a Mars trip, versus 17% for the moon. A third said neither should be a priority. For those 45 and older, 52% said neither Mars nor the moon should be a priority as a human destination. Of that age bracket, 26% preferred sending astronauts to Mars and 19% to the moon. As for the White Houses deadline of returning astronauts to the moon within five years  NASA is aiming for the water ice-rich lunar south pole by 2024  about 4 in 10 Americans favored the plan, versus 2 in 10 against. The remainder had no strong opinion either way. The good news, at least for NASA and its contractors, is that 60% of Americans believe the benefits of the space program have justified the cost. In 1979  on the 10th anniversary of the first manned moon landing  41% of Americans said the benefits were worth the cost, according to an AP-NBC News poll. If given an opportunity to experience space travel themselves, about half of Americans said they would orbit the Earth, while about 4 in 10 would fly to the moon and about 3 in 10 would go to Mars. Among those willing to travel to the red planet, about half  or 15% of all Americans  said they would move to a Mars colony, even if it meant never returning to Earth. Men were more likely than women to want to travel to any space destination: Earth orbit, moon and Mars. Curtis contends the U.S. might have a colony on the moon by now if we had put our money in the right places. We havent been there in so long, he said. Is the flag even still there?

Apollo 11 at 50: Celebrating first steps on another world,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A half-century ago, in the middle of a mean year of war, famine, violence in the streets and the widening of the generation gap, men from planet Earth stepped onto another world for the first time, uniting people around the globe in a way not seen before or since. Hundreds of millions tuned in to radios or watched the grainy black-and-white images on TV as Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, in one of humanitys most glorious technological achievements. Police around the world reported crime came to a near halt that midsummer Sunday night. Astronaut Michael Collins, who orbited the moon alone in the mother ship while Armstrong proclaimed for the ages, Thats one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, was struck by the banding together of Earths inhabitants. How often can you get people around our globe to agree on anything? Hardly ever, Collins, now 88, told The Associated Press in a recent interview. And yet briefly at the time of the first landing on the moon, people were united. They felt they were participants. He added, It was a wonderful achievement in the sense that people everywhere around the planet applauded it: north, south, east, west, rich, poor, Communist, whatever. That sense of unity did not last long. But 50 years later, Apollo 11  the culmination of eight years of breakneck labor involving a workforce of 400,000 and a price tag in the billions, all aimed at winning the space race and beating the Soviet Union to the moon  continues to thrill. 
        
     Think of how many times you hear people say, Well, if we could land a man on the moon, we could certainly do blah, blah, blah, said NASA chief historian Bill Barry, who like many other children of the 1960s was drawn to math and science by Apollo. It really, I think, has become a throwaway phrase because it gets used so often. It gets used so often because I think it had an impact. For the golden anniversary, NASA, towns, museums and other institutions are holding ceremonies, parades and parties, including the simultaneous launch of 5,000 model rockets outside the installation in Huntsville, Alabama, where the behemoth Saturn V moon rockets were born. Apollo 11K and Saturn 5K runs are go at NASAs Kennedy Space Center. In nearby Titusville, the American Space Museum and local businesses will mark the exact moment of the moon landing by lifting cups of Tang, the powdered orange drink that rocketed into orbit with the pioneers of the Space Age. Armstrong, who expertly steered the lunar module Eagle to a smooth landing with just seconds of fuel left, died in 2012 at 82. Aldrin, 89, who followed him onto the gray, dusty surface, was embroiled recently in a now-dropped legal dispute in which two of his children tried to have him declared mentally incompetent. He has kept an uncharacteristically low profile in the run-up to the anniversary. Many of the Apollo programs other key players are gone as well. Of the 24 astronauts who flew to the moon from 1968 through 1972, only 12 are still alive. Of the 12 who walked on the moon, four survive. A vast majority of Earths 7.7 billion inhabitants were born after Apollo ended, including NASAs current administrator, 44-year-old Jim Bridenstine, who is overseeing the effort to send humans back to the moon by 2024. Back in 1961, NASA had barely 15 minutes of human suborbital flight under its belt  Alan Shepards history-making flight  when President John F. Kennedy issued the Cold War-era challenge of landing a man on the moon by decades end and returning him safely. At the time, the Soviets were beating America at every turn in the space race, with the first satellite, Sputnik, the first spaceman, Yuri Gagarin, and the first lunar probes. JFKs challenge struck John Tribe, one of Cape Canaverals original rocket scientists, as impossible. I was used to facing up to impossible things. We were in the rocket business, so we were doing some weird and wonderful things back in those days. But, yes, it was an unbelievable announcement at that time, he said. It took a lot of guts. NASAs Project Mercury gave way to the two-man Gemini flights, then the three-man Apollo program, dealt a devastating setback when three astronauts were killed in a fire during a 1967 test on the launch pad. The pace was relentless amid fears the Soviets would get to the moon first. Cape Canaverals Bill Waldron remembers working seven days a week, 12 hours a day, six months at a clip on the lunar modules. You know how we got to the moon as fast as we did is because we burned people out, said Homer Hickam, a retired NASA engineer whose autobiography, Rocket Boys, became the 1999 movie October Sky. Come to Huntsville, go to the cemetery, look at all those young men who are dead down there. They worked themselves to death, Hickam said. Or better yet, go to the courthouse and look at all the divorce records. They abandoned their families. The pressure was so intense leading up to the flight that Collins developed tics in both eyes. Collins privately gave the mission 50-50 odds of total success. Launch day  Wednesday, July 16, 1969  dawned with an estimated 1 million people lining the sweltering beaches and roads of what had been renamed Cape Kennedy in memory of the slain president. Among the VIPs: Vice President Spiro Agnew, former President Lyndon Johnson and wife Lady Bird, aviation legend Charles Lindbergh, science fiction writer Isaac Asimov and TVs Johnny Carson. Civil rights demonstrators who had descended on the launch site to question Americas spending priorities temporarily stood down to gaze skyward. The firing room was filled with 500 launch controllers and managers in white shirts and skinny ties, including Wernher von Braun, the German-born mastermind behind the Saturn V. The Saturn V stood 363 feet (110 meters) tall, the largest, most powerful rocket ever flown. Unbeknownst to most of the world, just two weeks earlier, the Soviets even mightier moon rocket exploded moments after liftoff, destroying the Kremlins moon dreams. At 9:32 a.m. EDT, the Saturn V roared off Pad 39A, its astronauts hurtling toward their destination and destiny 240,000 miles (386,000 kilometers) away. The command module, Columbia, and the attached lunar module, Eagle, reached the moon three days later. The next day, July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the surface in the lunar module. Collins wasnt overly concerned about Armstrong and Aldrin getting down to the moon. Rather, he worried about them getting off the moon and back to the mother ship. He kept his fears to himself. If it was unthinkable, it was unsayable also, Collins told the AP. We never discussed or hinted at their getting stranded on the moon. I mean, we were not fools, and we knew darn well that a lot of things had to go exactly right for them to ascend as they were supposed to do. President Richard Nixon even had a speech prepared in case of disaster: Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. As it turned out, descent proved more alarming than ascent. With minutes remaining to touchdown, the Eagle was rattled by one computer alarm then another. Caution lights flashed. But flight controllers had rehearsed that very scenario right before the flight, and so guidance officer Steve Bales knew it was safe to proceed rather than abort. Then a boulder-strewn crater the size of a football field appeared at the target landing site, and Armstrong had to keep flying, looking for somewhere safe to put down. Aldrin called out the distance to the surface  75 feet, 40 feet, 30 feet  as Mission Control informed the astronauts of the fuel remaining. Sixty seconds left. Thirty seconds. Finally came word from Armstrong: Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed. The time was 4:17 p.m. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. Were breathing again, Mission Controls Charlie Duke radioed back. (He would walk on the moon three years later.) Armstrong descended the nine-rung ladder first, his left boot, size 9, touching the lunar surface at 10:56 p.m. Aldrin followed him out 18 minutes later. Working in one-sixth Earths gravity, they gathered rocks, set up experiments, planted an American flag stiffened with wires to make it look as if it were waving in the windless vacuum and took a congratulatory call from Nixon, who observed, For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one. Dave Waldrup of Reston, Virginia, watched on TV that day, his 15th birthday, and recalled thinking: Wow! What are we going to do next? Its literally not just the sky, but outer space is the limit. And I cant wait to be part of it. He went on to become an Air Force pilot and is now a volunteer at the National Air and Space Museum. The moonwalk lasted 2 hours. The Eagle later reunited with Columbia, and the three astronauts headed home, splashing down July 24 in the Pacific. After spending 2 weeks in quarantine in case they brought back deadly moon germs, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins were given a ticker-tape parade in New York, followed by a frenzied monthlong world tour in which they met kings, queens and Pope Paul VI. Five more missions took men to the surface of the moon  Apollo 13 had to be aborted because of an explosion  before Project Apollo came to a premature end, the last three flights on the schedule scrapped. NASA put the entire Apollo tab at $25 billion, equivalent to more than $150 billion in todays dollars. The first lunar landing, at least, lifted Americas spirits  indeed, the planets  when it needed it. The Vietnam War, civil strife, racial strife, all kinds of stuff going on that was bad, which I wasnt paying much attention to because I was working so hard in the space world. The Cold War and all of that, said JoAnn Morgan, Apollo 11s lone female launch controller. It was such a demonstration of the power and the passion of our country. She added: I mean, literally, we did exactly what JFK said we would do. ___ Follow APs full coverage of the Apollo 11 anniversary at: https://apnews.com/Apollo11moonlanding ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Apollo 11s amiable strangers Armstrong, Aldrin, Collins","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Mission commander Neil Armstrong was the flying ace, Buzz Aldrin the scholar. Michael Collins was a crack test pilot, too, but also a wordsmith who described the trio as amiable strangers. Apollo 11s astronauts had six months to gel as a crew and prepare for humanitys greatest space feat. The three had never served together on the same spaceflight before, and the almost frantic preparation left little if any time for bonding, Collins said. Apollo 11 was a little different than some of the other flights, Collins explained. We didnt cruise around in color-coordinated Corvettes or anything like that. We were all business. We were all hard work, and we felt the weight of the world upon us. A brief look at each man: Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon but the least inclined to talk about it. Last years film, First Man, captured his private nature; his two sons served as movie consultants. Such reticence merely reinforced the mystery surrounding the late astronaut, who by skill, hard work and chance became the first human to set foot on another world. Armstrong was superbly qualified for the job: fighter pilot in Korea, X-15 test pilot, one of only two civilians selected for the second astronaut group in 1962, Gemini 8 command pilot, backup commander of Apollo 8 and, finally, commander of Apollo 11. Hed proven his mettle again and again. He had to gain control of his tumbling Gemini 8 spacecraft in 1966 and bring it down early, and he ejected from a lunar lander training device in 1968 just before it crashed in flames in Houston. 
        
     Armstrong left NASA two years after Apollo 11 and taught engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979. He spent his remaining years in his home state of Ohio. He finally agreed to a biography: 2005s First Man by historian James Hansen, the basis for last years film. Armstrong died in 2012 at age 82. ___ Buzz Aldrin was the second man to walk on the moon, but the first astronaut to have a doctorate and dance with the stars. Aldrin, now 89, had a long list of accomplishments by the time NASA chose him for the third astronaut group in 1963: third in his class at West Point, fighter pilot in Korea, Air Force officer, a doctorate in astronautics. He was dubbed Dr. Rendezvous for his expertise in orbital dockings. He flew on Gemini 12 in 1966 and was on the backup crew for Apollo 8. Then came Apollo 11. He later legally changed his name from Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. to his childhood nickname Buzz. His name was the inspiration for the character Buzz Lightyear in the animated Toy Story films. His mothers name: Marion Moon. After Apollo 11, Aldrin spent years struggling with mental depression and alcoholism. He left NASA in 1971 and briefly headed the test pilot school at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Drawn toward the spotlight, Aldrin portrayed himself in a 1994 episode of the TV program The Simpsons and took a spin in 2010 on TVs Dancing with the Stars. Hes traveled the globe, including the South Pole, pushing for Mars travel. Last year, two of his three children sought to declare him mentally incompetent, then he sued them. Both sides dropped the case in March. Aldrin moves between Satellite Beach, Florida, and Southern California. ___ Michael Collins was The Forgotten Man during the Apollo 11 lunar landing: While the two others were walking on the moon, he circled overhead in the command module. For previous Apollo 11 anniversaries, Collins was content to be forgotten. But with the huge gap left by Armstrongs death, Collins, 88, feels compelled to speak up even though my first inclination for celebrating the 50th anniversary ... is to go hide under a rock somewhere. His two daughters have helped him navigate the avalanche of requests. The Air Force officer and former test pilot flew on Gemini 10 in 1966, three years after being accepted into the third astronaut group. He was supposed to be command module pilot of Apollo 8, the first manned flight to circle the moon, but was bumped because of a bone spur in his neck. Surgery corrected the problem, and he wound up on Apollo 11. Collins was astounded when reporters later asked him about being lonely as he circled the moon by himself, especially on the lunar far side, out of radio contact. I felt like I was Neil and Buzzs meal ticket home, he said. I was in no way, shape or form lonely. Collins left NASA six months after Apollo 11. He briefly served as assistant secretary of state for public affairs and was founding director of the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum. In an updated preface to his 1974 autobiography Carrying the Fire, Collins said he enjoys fishing, painting and reading near Floridas Everglades, and feels lucky, lucky, lucky.",https://apnews.com/article/business-science-apollo-11-moon-landing-3331f25b122349e49ce621f762e927ea,science
Former astronaut helps break flight record over poles,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A former astronaut landed back at NASAs Kennedy Space Center on Thursday after helping to shatter a pair of records for a round-the-world airplane flight over the North and South poles. Terry Virts was part of the team whose 46-hour, 39-minute and 38-second polar circumnavigation flight ended where it began. They set the duration and speed records in a Qatar Executive Gulfstream G650ER aircraft. Their average speed was 535 mph (861 kph). Dubbed One More Orbit, the flight paid homage to next weeks 50th anniversary of humanitys first moon landing. Virts former space station crewmate, Russian Gennady Padalka, was on the first two legs of the flight. Padalka, the worlds space champ with 879 days in orbit, left during a fueling stop. Virts said in a tweet that the three stops were NASCAR pit-stop intense. Each stop lasted less than an hour. The plane departed from the former space shuttle landing strip Tuesday at 9:32 a.m.  the same liftoff time as Apollo 11s Saturn V rocket on July 16, 1969. It crossed over the North Pole, stopped in Kazakhstan and then Mauritius, crossed above the South Pole, stopped in Chile, and then returned to Florida. The speed record, as recognized by the World Air Sports Federation, was last set in 2008. That was 511 mph (823 kph). The One More Orbit crew also set a Guinness World Record for flight duration, last set in 1977 in San Francisco at 54 hours. Representatives for both organizations were present for Thursdays landing. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Richard Branson inspired by Apollo, his own space shot soon","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Virgin Galactics Richard Branson said Thursday his spaceship has just a few more test flights before he jumps on board for the first tourist trip. The British billionaire celebrated his 69th birthday at NASAs Kennedy Space Center during 50th anniversary festivities for humanitys first moon landing. His guests were 100 other aspiring astronauts who have put down deposits to launch into space with Virgin Galactic. Like Branson, many in the crowd were inspired to fly into space by Apollo 11, which he called the most audacious journey of all time. Branson said three or four test flights will be conducted from New Mexico, beginning this fall, before engineers allow him to fly. The two suborbital test flights to date  conducted in December and February over Californias Mojave Desert  provided several minutes of weightlessness. Branson declined to say when his flight might happen. My track record for giving dates has been so abysmal that Im not giving dates anymore. But I think months, not years, he told The Associated Press. The company is in the process of moving from Southern California to Spaceport America in the New Mexico desert near Truth or Consequences, which has set everything back four months, according to Branson. The test pilots need to practice landing there, he said, before passengers tag along. I certainly wont go into space before brave test pilots feel 100% comfortable that weve checked every box, Branson said. 
        
     In 2014, the companys experimental space plane broke apart during a California test flight, killing the co-pilot. The winged spaceship is dropped in flight from a custom-designed airplane; once free, it fires its rocket motor to hurtle toward space before gliding back to Earth like NASAs old space shuttles. The latest test flight by VSS Unity reached an altitude of 56 miles (90 kilometers) while traveling at three times the speed of sound. About 600 people, ranging from their teens to early 90s, have reserved a seat, according to a company spokeswoman. Tickets are $250,000. Maryann Barry bought a ticket less than a month ago. She grew up near Cape Canaveral during the 1960s, and her late brother worked on NASAs Saturn V moon rockets. This is my life coming full circle actually, said Barry, 58, who works for the Girl Scouts in Orlando. When asked if shell be afraid, Houston violinist Debbie Moran, 62, said shes trying to do everything shes ever wanted to do in life before her spaceflight in another few years. We all know its not the safest thing in the world, she said. I still have not told my mother. Everybody is fearful. But the point is you have to overcome the fear to get the excitement, said Arvinder Bahal, 73, a real estate investor from Boston who cant wait to see the world from afar without boundaries. Branson said he did not remember his 19th birthday in London on July 18, 1969. But Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrins moon landing on July 20, 1969, was forever etched in his memory. Watching those first lunar footsteps on a little black and white TV, with his sisters and parents in the English countryside, was a turning point for him. He said its why Virgin Galactic exists today. He lifted a glass of Tang  the powdered orange drink made famous on Americas pioneering spaceflights  as he made a toast to space past, space present and, even more important for us all in this room, space future. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Apollo 11 astronauts reunite on 50th anniversary of moonshot,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins reunited Friday on the eve of the 50th anniversary of humanitys first moon landing. They gathered in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump, who got a rundown on his administrations plans to get astronauts back on the moon by 2024 and then on to Mars in the 2030s. Were bringing the glamour back to the space program, Trump said. Both sons of the late Neil Armstrong, the first man to step onto the moon on July 20, 1969, also attended, as well as first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. The moon versus Mars debate as astronauts next destination arose again Friday. The president asked if astronauts could get to Mars without first going back to the moon. Collins, 88, who circled the moon alone in the command module while Armstrong and Aldrin descended in the Eagle, told the president that he supports going directly to Mars and bypassing the moon. It seems to me Mars direct, who knows better than these people? Trump noted. Bridenstine, though, stressed the importance of the moon as a training ground and noted that because of the planetary alignment, launches to Mars can occur only every 26 months and even then the trip is seven months each way. What happens if you miss the timing? Theyre in deep trouble? Trump asked. You dont want to be on that ship. 
        
     Aldrin, meanwhile, said hes disappointed with the state of human space exploration the past 10 or 15 years. We were able to achieve so much early, the 89-year-old said. Aldrin, whose specialty was orbital rendezvous, doesnt like NASAs idea for a small space station around the moon, called the Gateway, from which to stage lunar landings and, eventually, Mars trips. He noted that the Apollo 11 command module and attached lunar module went straight into lunar orbit and even separated and redocked around the moon. We have the No. 1 rocket right now in the U.S. and we have the No. 1 spacecraft, and they cannot get into lunar orbit with significant maneuvering capability, Aldrin pointed out. Trump directed Bridenstine to listen to the other side. Aldrin and Armstrong, who died in 2012, landed on the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. on July 20, 1969. Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed, Armstrong radioed. Armstrong was the first to climb down the ladder, stepping onto the lunar surface at 10:56 p.m. His Thats one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, is arguably the most famous space line of all time. The vice president is commemorating Saturdays anniversary at Floridas Kennedy Space Center, visiting the launch pad where Apollo 11 blasted off. Museums and towns across the country geared up for their own golden anniversary celebrations, including Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrongs hometown that was serving up cinnamoon pancakes and buckeye on the moon sundaes. The U.S. Postal Service, meanwhile, issued its 1969: First Moon Landing Forever stamps Friday at Kennedy. NASA televised a two-hour show Friday afternoon remembering Apollo 11 but also looking forward to its future moon plans. At the end of the program, Bridenstine revealed the new logo for the moon program, called Artemis after the twin sister of Greek mythologys Apollo. Besides Wapakoneta and Kennedy, the program went live to Johnson Space Center in Houston, home to Mission Control; the U.S. Space and Rocket Center next door to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama; and the National Air and Space Museum in Washington. In Houston, Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham said the moon landings will be remembered hundreds of years from now and Armstrong, in particular, will go down in history. Here we are 50 years later, and I never in my life could have projected this amount of interest and association with what we were doing back then, Cunningham said. In Wapakoneta, former astronaut Don Thomas recalled how he invited fellow Ohioan Armstrong to one of his four space shuttle launches in the 1990s. Not only did Armstrong show up, Thomas said the moonwalker met with him the day before liftoff and promised to stick around as long as it took the shuttle to fly. It was the thrill of my life to have him there for the launch, Thomas said. __ AP reporter Zeke Miller contributed from Washington. ___ Follow APs full coverage of the Apollo 11 anniversary at: https://apnews.com/Apollo11moonlanding ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA picks Alabamas Rocket City for lunar lander job,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA picked Alabamas Rocket City on Friday to lead development of the next moon lander for astronauts. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville beat out Johnson Space Center in Houston, which managed the Apollo lunar lander a half-century ago. The new lunar lander  not yet built or even designed  is meant to carry an American woman and a man to the moons south pole by 2024. Under the plan, the astronauts will depart for the surface from a small space station around the moon and return there. Three Republican members of Congress from Texas  Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, and Rep. Brian Babin  had asked that the decision be reconsidered. Babin, who was on the initial guest list, was missing from the ceremony, held near a rocket test stand at Marshall one month after the 50th anniversary of the first lunar footsteps by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Houston was one of the first words ever uttered on the Moon, and Houston, the city that last sent man to the Moon, should be where the lander that will once again send Americans to the lunar surface is developed, they said in a statement Thursday. Marshall is the longtime expert in rocket propulsion. Thats where NASAs Saturn V moon rockets were developed back in the 1960s. Its also the base for NASAs new megarocket, the Space Launch System or SLS, which is supposed to carry up the orbiting lunar station, called Gateway, as well as the lunar lander and other components of the Artemis moon program. 
        
     When asked why he chose Marshall, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine explained to reporters that propulsion is a critical element of lunar landers. I would argue that when it comes to propulsion, there is no place in the world that is more experienced and better than the Marshall Space Flight Center, he said. At the same time, it is absolutely true that when you think about the module where our astronauts will be, that cannot be done without the Johnson Space Center. More than a third of the 360 jobs  140  will be at Marshall. Eighty-seven will be at Johnson and the rest elsewhere. This is one NASA. We are all working to achieve the same goal, Bridenstine said. The lunar lander program will be led by Marshalls Lisa Watson-Morgan, formerly an engineering manager. Unlike Apollo, she said, industry will be instrumental in designing the new lander and not just in building it. The goal, she said, is to bring their speed and our experience in getting astronauts on the moon by the White Houses deadline of 2024. NASA has named its new moon program Artemis after the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology, who also happens to be the goddess of the moon. Bridenstine has stressed that a woman will be on the first crew to the lunar surface. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Surprise rescue of Jamaica coral reefs shows nature can heal,"OCHO RIOS, Jamaica (AP)  Everton Simpson squints at the Caribbean from his motorboat, scanning the dazzling bands of color for hints of what lies beneath. Emerald green indicates sandy bottoms. Sapphire blue lies above seagrass meadows. And deep indigo marks coral reefs. Thats where hes headed. He steers the boat to an unmarked spot that he knows as the coral nursery. 'Its like a forest under the sea, he says, strapping on blue flippers and fastening his oxygen tank before tipping backward into the azure waters. He swims straight down 25 feet carrying a pair of metal shears, fishing line and a plastic crate. On the ocean floor, small coral fragments dangle from suspended ropes, like socks hung on a laundry line. Simpson and other divers tend to this underwater nursery as gardeners mind a flower bed  slowly and painstakingly plucking off snails and fireworms that feast on immature coral. When each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to individually transplant onto a reef, a process akin to planting each blade of grass in a lawn separately. Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year. And its not possible to simply scatter seeds. A few hours later, at a site called Dickies Reef, Simpson dives again and uses bits of fishing line to tie clusters of staghorn coral onto rocky outcroppings  a temporary binding until the corals limestone skeleton grows and fixes itself onto the rock. The goal is to jumpstart the natural growth of a coral reef. And so far, its working. 
        
     Almost everyone in Jamaica depends on the sea, including Simpson, who lives in a modest house he built himself near the islands northern coast. The energetic 68-year-old has reinvented himself several times, but always made a living from the ocean. Once a spear fisherman and later a scuba-diving instructor, Simpson started working as a coral gardener two years ago  part of grassroots efforts to bring Jamaicas coral reefs back from the brink. Coral reefs are often called rainforests of the sea for the astonishing diversity of life they shelter. Just 2 percent of the ocean floor is filled with coral, but the branching structures  shaped like everything from reindeer antlers to human brains  sustain a quarter of all marine species. Clown fish, parrotfish, groupers and snappers lay eggs and hide from predators in the reefs nooks and crannies, and their presence draws eels, sea snakes, octopuses and even sharks. In healthy reefs, jellyfish and sea turtles are regular visitors. With fish and coral, its a codependent relationship  the fish rely upon the reef structure to evade danger and lay eggs, and they also eat up the corals rivals. Life on the ocean floor is like a slow-motion competition for space, or an underwater game of musical chairs. Tropical fish and other marine animals, like black sea urchins, munch on fast-growing algae and seaweed that may otherwise outcompete the slow-growing coral for space. When too many fish disappear, the coral suffers  and vice-versa. After a series of natural and man-made disasters in the 1980s and 1990s, Jamaica lost 85 percent of its once-bountiful coral reefs. Meanwhile, fish catches declined to a sixth of what they had been in the 1950s, pushing families that depend on seafood closer to poverty. Many scientists thought that most of Jamaicas coral reef had been permanently replaced by seaweed, like jungle overtaking a ruined cathedral. But today, the corals and tropical fish are slowly reappearing, thanks in part to a series of careful interventions. The delicate labor of the coral gardener is only one part of restoring a reef  and for all its intricacy, its actually the most straightforward part. Convincing lifelong fishermen to curtail when and where they fish and controlling the surging waste dumped into the ocean are trickier endeavors. Still, slowly, the comeback effort is gaining momentum. The coral are coming back; the fish are coming back, says Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. Its probably some of the most vibrant coral reefs weve seen in Jamaica since the 1970s. When you give nature a chance, she can repair herself, he adds. Its not too late. Sandin is studying the health of coral reefs around the world as part of a research project called the 100 Island Challenge. His starting assumption was that the most populated islands would have the most degraded habitats, but what he found instead is that humans can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on how they manage resources. In Jamaica, more than a dozen grassroots-run coral nurseries and fish sanctuaries have sprung up in the past decade, supported by small grants from foundations, local businesses such as hotels and scuba clinics, and the Jamaican government. At White River Fish Sanctuary, which is only about 2 years old and where Simpson works, the clearest proof of early success is the return of tropical fish that inhabit the reefs  as well as hungry pelicans, skimming the surface of the water to feed on them. Jamaicas coral reefs were once among the worlds most celebrated, with their golden branching structures and resident bright-colored fish drawing the attention of travelers from Christopher Columbus to Ian Fleming, who wrote most of his James Bond novels on the island nations northern coast in the 1950s and 60s. In 1965, the country became the site of the first global research hub for coral reefs, the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, now associated with the University of the West Indies. The pathbreaking marine biologist couple Thomas and Nora Goreau completed fundamental research here, including describing the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae and pioneering the use of scuba equipment for marine studies. The same lab also provided a vantage point as the coral disappeared. Peter Gayle has been a marine biologist at Discovery Bay since 1985. From the yard outside his office, he points toward the reef crest about 300 meters away  a thin brown line splashed with white waves. Before 1980, Jamaica had healthy coral, he notes. Then several disasters struck. The first calamity was 1980s Hurricane Allen, one of the most powerful cyclones in recorded history. Its 40-foot waves crashed against the shore and basically chewed up the reef, Gayle says. Coral can grow back after natural disasters, but only when given a chance to recover  which it never got. That same decade, a mysterious epidemic killed more than 95% of the black sea urchins in the Caribbean, while overfishing ravaged fish populations. And surging waste from the islands growing human population, which nearly doubled between 1960 and 2010, released chemicals and nutrients into the water that spur faster algae growth. The result: Seaweed and algae took over. There was a tipping point in the 1980s, when it switched from being a coral-dominated system to being an algae-dominated system, Gayle says. Scientists call it a phase shift. That seemed like the end of the story, until an unlikely alliance started to tip the ecosystem back in the other direction  with help from residents like Everton Simpson and his fellow fisherman Lipton Bailey. The fishing community of White River revolves around a small boat-docking area about a quarter-mile from where the river flows into the Caribbean Sea. One early morning, as purple dawn light filters into the sky, Simpson and Bailey step onto a 28-foot motorboat called the Interceptor. Both men have lived and fished their whole lives in the community. Recently, they have come to believe that they need to protect the coral reefs that attract tropical fish, while setting limits on fishing to ensure the sea isnt emptied too quickly. In the White River area, the solution was to create a protected area  a fish sanctuary  for immature fish to grow and reach reproductive age before they are caught. Two years ago, the fishermen joined with local businesses, including hotel owners, to form a marine association and negotiate the boundaries for a no-fishing zone stretching two miles along the coast. A simple line in the water is hardly a deterrent, however  to make the boundary meaningful, it must be enforced. Today, the local fishermen, including Simpson and Bailey, take turns patrolling the boundary in the Interceptor. On this morning, the men steer the boat just outside a row of orange buoys marked No Fishing. 'We are looking for violators, Bailey says, his eyes trained on the rocky coast. Sometimes you find spearmen. They think theyre smart. We try to beat them at their game. Most of the older and more established fishermen, who own boats and set out lines and wire cages, have come to accept the no-fishing zone. Besides, the risk of having their equipment confiscated is too great. But not everyone is on board. Some younger men hunt with lightweight spearguns, swimming out to sea and firing at close-range. These men  some of them poor and with few options  are the most likely trespassers. The patrols carry no weapons, so they must master the art of persuasion. Let them understand this  its not a you thing or a me thing. This isnt personal, Bailey says of past encounters with violators. These are sometimes risky efforts. Two years ago, Jerlene Layne, a manager at nearby Boscobel Fish Sanctuary, landed in the hospital with a bruised leg after being attacked by a man she had reprimanded for fishing illegally in the sanctuary. He used a stick to hit my leg because I was doing my job  telling him he cannot fish in the protected area, she says. Layne believes her work would be safer with more formal support from the police, but she isnt going to stop. Public mindsets can change, she says. If I back down on this, what kind of message does that send? You have to stand for something. She has pressed charges in court against repeat trespassers, typically resulting in a fine and equipment confiscation. One such violator is Damian Brown, 33, who lives in a coastal neighborhood called Stewart Town. Sitting outside on a concrete staircase near his modest home, Brown says fishing is his only option for work  and he believes the sanctuary boundaries extend too far. But others who once were skeptical say theyve come to see limits as a good thing. Back at the White River docking area, Rick Walker, a 35-year-old spearfisherman, is cleaning his motorboat. He remembers the early opposition to the fish sanctuary, with many people saying, No, theyre trying to stop our livelihood. Two years later, Walker, who is not involved in running the sanctuary but supports its boundary, says he can see the benefits. Its easier to catch snapper and barracuda, he says. At least my great grandkids will get to see some fish. When Columbus landed in Jamaica, he sailed into Oracabessa Bay  today a 20-minute drive from the mouth of the White River. Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary was the first of the grassroots-led efforts to revive Jamaicas coral reefs. Its sanctuary was legally incorporated in 2010, and its approach of enlisting local fishermen as patrols became a model for other regions. The fishermen are mostly on board and happy  thats the distinction. Thats why its working, sanctuary manager Inilek Wilmot says. David Murray, head of the Oracabessa Fishers Association, notes that Jamaicas 60,000 fishermen operate without a safety net. Fishing is like gambling, its a game. Sometimes you catch something, sometimes you dont, he says. When fish populations began to collapse two decades ago, something had to change. Murray now works as a warden in the Oracabessa sanctuary, while continuing to fish outside its boundary. He also spends time explaining the concept to neighbors. Its people work  its a process to get people to agree on a sanctuary boundary, he says. Its a tough job to tell a man whos been fishing all his life that he cant fish here. But once it became clear that a no-fishing zone actually helped nearby fish populations rebound, it became easier to build support. The number of fish in the sanctuary has doubled between 2011 and 2017, and the individual fish have grown larger  nearly tripling in length on average  according to annual surveys by Jamaicas National Environment and Planning Agency. And that boosts catches in surrounding areas. After word got out about Oracabessa, other regions wanted advice. We have the data to show success, but even more important than data is word of mouth, says Wilmot, who oversaw training to help start the fish sanctuary at White River. Belinda Morrow, a lifelong water-sports enthusiast often seen paddle-boarding with her dog Shadow, runs the White River Marine Association. She attends fishers meetings and raises small grants from the Jamaican government and other foundations to support equipment purchases and coral replanting campaigns. We all depend on the ocean, Morrow says, sitting in a small office decorated with nautical maps in the iconic 70-year-old Jamaica Inn. If we dont have a good healthy reef and a good healthy marine environment, we will lose too much. Too much of the country relies on the sea. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Surprise rescue of Jamaica coral reefs shows nature can heal,"OCHO RIOS, Jamaica (AP)  Everton Simpson squints at the Caribbean from his motorboat, scanning the dazzling bands of color for hints of what lies beneath. Emerald green indicates sandy bottoms. Sapphire blue lies above seagrass meadows. And deep indigo marks coral reefs. Thats where hes headed. He steers the boat to an unmarked spot he knows as the coral nursery. 'Its like a forest under the sea, he says, fastening his oxygen tank before tipping backward into the azure waters. He swims straight down 25 feet carrying a pair of metal shears, fishing line and a plastic crate. On the ocean floor, small coral fragments dangle from suspended ropes, like socks hung on a laundry line. Simpson and other divers tend to this underwater nursery as gardeners mind a flower bed  slowly and painstakingly plucking off snails and fireworms that feast on immature coral. When each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to individually transplant onto a reef, a process akin to individually planting each blade of grass in a lawn. Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year. And its not possible to simply scatter seeds. A few hours later, at an underwater site called Dickies Reef, Simpson uses fishing line to tie clusters of staghorn coral onto rocky outcroppings  a temporary binding until the corals limestone skeleton grows and fixes itself onto the rock. The goal is to jumpstart the natural growth of a coral reef. And so far, its working. 
        
     Almost everyone in Jamaica depends on the sea, including the energetic 68-year-old Simpson. Once a spear fisherman and later a scuba-diving instructor, he started working as a coral gardener two years ago  part of grassroots efforts to bring Jamaicas coral reefs back from the brink. Coral reefs are often called rainforests of the sea for the astonishing diversity of life they shelter. Just 2 percent of the ocean floor is filled with coral, but the branching structures sustain a quarter of all marine species. Clown fish, parrotfish, groupers and snappers lay eggs and hide from predators in the reefs nooks and crannies, and their presence draws eels, sea snakes, octopuses and even sharks. In healthy reefs, jellyfish and sea turtles are regular visitors. With fish and coral, its a codependent relationship  the fish rely on the reef to evade danger and lay eggs, and they also eat up the corals rivals. After a series of natural and man-made disasters in the 1980s and 1990s, Jamaica lost 85 percent of its once-bountiful reefs. Meanwhile, fish catches declined to a sixth of what they had been in the 1950s, pushing families depending on seafood closer to poverty. Many scientists thought most of Jamaicas coral reef had been permanently replaced by seaweed, like jungle overtaking a ruined cathedral. But today, the corals and tropical fish are slowly reappearing, thanks in part to a series of careful interventions. The delicate labor of the coral gardener is only one part of restoring a reef.

Intrepid scientists witness final days of Venezuelan glacier,"MERIDA, Venezuela (AP)  Blackouts shut off the refrigerators where the scientists keep their lab samples. Gas shortages mean they sometimes have to work from home. They even reuse sheets of paper to record field data because fresh supplies are so scarce. As their country falls apart, a hardy team of scientists in Venezuela is determined to transcend the political and economic turmoil to record what happens as the countrys last glacier vanishes. Temperatures are warming faster at the Earths higher elevations than in lowlands, and scientists predict that the glacier  an ice sheet in the Andes Mountains  could be gone within two decades. If we left and came back in 20 years, we would have missed it, says Luis Daniel Llamb, a mountain ecologist at the University of the Andes in Mrida. Scientists say Venezuela will be the first country in South America to lose all its glaciers. Throughout history, glaciers have waxed and waned numerous times. But the rapid pace of glacial retreat over the past century and a half, accelerated by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels, creates a new urgency  and opportunity  for scientists to understand how freshly exposed rock forms new soil and eventually new ecosystems. While most of the planets ice is stored in the polar regions, there also are glaciers in some mountainous regions of the tropics  primarily in South America. 
        
     Practically all of the high-mountain tropical glaciers are in the Andes. Theres still a little bit on Mount Kilimanjaro, says Robert Hofstede, a tropical ecologist in Ecuador who advises international agencies such as the World Bank and United Nations. Monitoring Venezuelas Humboldt glacier depends on continuous visits, Llamb notes. And even in the best of circumstances, its no easy trek from the small mountain town of Mrida to the ice sheet perched within Venezuelas Sierra Nevada National Park at nearly 16,500 feet (5,000 meters) above sea level. When Llamb and three other scientists made the journey this spring to scout out mountain terrain for a new research project, they first rode a cable car, then walked a full day to the base camp, pitching their tents in drizzling rain. Each day, they then had to climb an additional three hours to reach the glacier, at times donning helmets and holding tight to ropes to maneuver up steep boulders. Some of the scientists had waterproofed their worn-out old boots using melted candle wax. Mountain fieldwork always is physically grueling, but the deepening crisis in Venezuela since the death of former president Hugo Chavez in 2013 has transformed even simple tasks into immense hurdles. Things that you normally take for granted for research  internet, gas, electricity  all become scarce and unpredictable, Llamb says. Perhaps the hardest toll has been watching many of their colleagues and students leave, joining the more than 4 million people who have fled Venezuelas political upheaval in recent years. Every week, someone asks me why I havent left, says Alejandra Melfo, a team member who is a physicist at the University of the Andes. Not now, she tells anyone who asks. Climate change is real and has to be documented, she says. We have to be there. The Institute of Environmental and Ecological Sciences at the University of the Andes was founded 50 years ago, in 1969, and the scientists there see themselves as custodians of long-term data monitoring how temperatures and plant life are changing in the region, including in the Andean ecosystem known as the paramos  a mist-covered mountain grassland that lies between the top of the treeline and the bottom of the glacier. While most tundras have sparse vegetation, the paramos is famous for striking plants called frailejones that can be taller than humans and resemble a cross between a cactus and a palm tree. These mountain grasslands also store and release water that sustains the cities and croplands further downslope. Its hard to overstate the importance of the Andean glaciers in maintaining regional water cycles. More than 50 million people in South America rely on water provision from the Andes, says Francisco Cuesta, a tropical ecologist at the University of the Americas in Quito, Ecuador, who marvels at the dogged work the team is doing under such punishing conditions. To me, its incredible that they are still doing research there, Cuesta says. The region is one of the front lines of climate change. Glaciers in the tropical Andes have been retreating faster than most other glaciers since scientists began keeping detailed records in the 1970s, because tropical latitudes get more direct sunlight and radiation. When a glacier melts away, at first only bedrock is left behind  sometimes rough gravel and sometimes smooth rock, worn down by centuries or millenniums of grinding ice. But within a few years or decades, bacteria and lichen began to colonize the area. As they decompose the minerals of the rock and their bodies then decay into organic matter, the first hints of soil begin to form. And soil is the basis of a new ecosystem, providing a structure to retain water and for plant roots to grow. The formation of soil is the difference between an ecosystem being able to form quickly and being stalled for hundreds of years, Llamb says. On the rocks left behind when the glacier retreats, the scientists think that a new ecosystem resembling the paramos may eventually begin to develop. But there are many questions still to answer: Will it take decades to form new soil? Can plant and animal species that thrive at lower elevations also survive further upslope? Will they be able to adapt to continually changing temperatures? Venezuela has the worlds largest known oil reserves, but an economy hitched for decades to global oil demand has proven unstable. Llamb believes he has a special obligation to help inform the public of the impacts of climate change in a country where the boom-and-bust cycle of fossil fuel exploration has shaped nearly everyones life. Our university is in Mrida, which has long been called the city of eternal snow, he reflects. We are discovering that eternity is not forever, and thats what we have to get used to in a world with climate change. ___ Larson reported from Washington. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Japanese officials traced the fire to static electricity and oxygen propellant, and corrected the problem. The 4-ton shipment should arrive at the space station Saturday. Spacewalking astronauts will install the six new lithium-ion batteries later this year, replacing old-style batteries. The cargo ship is named Kounotori, Japanese for white stork.

Boeing delays crew capsule test flight to space station,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeing has delayed its first test flight of its Starliner crew capsule to the International Space Station.  The launch is now targeted for Dec. 19.  NASA said Tuesday that the two-day postponement was caused by problems with ground equipment at the Cape Canaveral pad. Both the Starliner and United Launch Alliances Atlas V rocket are healthy, officials said. It will be the first trip to space by a Starliner. No astronauts will be aboard. Instead, a mannequin loaded with sensors and named Rosie  after World War IIs Rosie the Riveter  will occupy the commanders seat.  SpaceX conducted a similar test flight of its Dragon crew capsule in March.  The two companies expect to start launching astronauts to the space station for NASA next year. It will be the first time since the end of NASAs space shuttle program in 2011 that U.S. astronauts rocket into orbit from home soil. NASA astronauts have been riding Russian rockets to the space station, for tens of millions of dollars per seat, while awaiting the repeatedly delayed commercial crew vehicles. SpaceXs crew Dragon is a much enhanced version of its cargo Dragon, which has been delivering supplies to the space station since 2012.

Difficult but rewarding work: Planting trees to aid climate,"MADRE DE DIOS, Peru (AP)  Destruction of the forests can be swift. Regrowth is much, much slower. But around the world, people are putting shovels to ground to help it happen. In a corner of the Peruvian Amazon, where illegal gold mining has scarred forests and poisoned ground, scientists work to change wasteland back to wilderness. More than 3,000 miles to the north, on former coal mining land across Appalachia, workers rip out old trees that never put down deep roots and make the soil more suitable to regrow native tree species. In Brazil, a nursery owner grows different kinds of seedlings to help reconnect forests along the countrys Atlantic coast, benefiting endangered species like the golden lion tamarin. They labor amid spectacular recent losses  the Amazon jungle and the Congo basin ablaze, smoke from Indonesian rainforests wafting over Malaysia and Singapore, fires set mostly to make way for cattle pastures and farm fields. Between 2014 and 2018, a new report says, an area the size of the United Kingdom was stripped of forest each year. Rebuilding woodland is slow and often difficult work. And it requires patience: It can take several decades or longer for forests to regrow as viable habitats, and to absorb the same amount of carbon lost when trees are cut and burned. Planting a tree is only one step in the process, says Christopher Barton, a professor of forest hydrology at the Appalachian Center of the University of Kentucky. And yet, there is urgency to that work  forests are one of the planets first lines of defense against climate change, absorbing as much as a quarter of man-made carbon emissions each year. 
        
     Through photosynthesis, trees and other plants use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce chemical energy to fuel their growth; oxygen is released as a byproduct. As forests have shrunk, however, so has an already overloaded Earths capacity to cope with carbon emissions. Successful reforestation programs take into account native plant species. They are managed by groups with a sustained commitment to monitoring forests, not just one-off tree planting events. And usually, they economically benefit the people who live nearby  for instance, by creating jobs, or reducing erosion that damages homes or crops. The impact could be great: A recent study in the journal Science projected that if 0.9 billion hectares (2.2 billion acres) of new trees were planted  around 500 billion saplings  they could absorb 205 gigatonnes (220 gigatons) of carbon once they reached maturity. The Swiss researchers estimated this would be equivalent to about two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Other scientists dispute those calculations, while some fear the theoretical promise of tree-planting as an easy solution to climate changes could distract people from the range and scope of the responses needed. But all agree: Trees matter. ___ On a spring morning, forestry researcher Jhon Farfan steered a motorcycle through the dense Peruvian jungle, his tires churning up red mud. He was following a narrow path cut by illegal gold miners in the heart of the Amazon, but he was not seeking treasure. Instead, he was on a quest to reforest abandoned gold mines within the worlds largest tropical forest. After three hours of difficult travel, he reached a broad clearing where knee-high saplings stood in rows, their yellow-green leaves straining for the sun. Farfan whipped out a clipboard with a diagram of the saplings planted months earlier, much like a teacher checking attendance. The goal is to look for the survivors, he said. Within the thick jungle, only a sliver of light escapes to the forest floor. Often more can be heard than seen: a chorus of howler monkeys, the chatter of red-crowned parakeets  reminders that the Amazon is home to more species diversity than anywhere on the planet. But the rainforest is under increasing threat from illicit logging, mining and ranching. In a region of southeastern Peru called Madre de Dios, Farfans job involves inspecting lands where the forest has already been lost to illegal mining spurred by the spike in gold prices following the 2008 global financial crash. To recover the gold, the floor of the jungle was turned upside down. There are no gold seams in the lowland areas of the Amazon, but only flakes of gold washed down from the Andes mountains by ancient rivers, buried beneath the soil. After cutting and burning centuries-old trees, miners used diesel pumps to suck up deep layers of the earth, then pushed the soil through filters to separate out gold particles. To turn gold dust into nuggets, they stirred in mercury, which binds the gold together but also poisons the land. Left behind are patches of desert-like land  dry, sandy, stripped of topsoil and ringed by trunks of dead trees. Last December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers. Most tree deaths happen in the first year, Farfan added. If the trees make it to year five, typically theyre going to be there a long time. A study of former gold mines in Peru by scientists at CINCIA and Wake Forest University several years ago found that seedlings transplanted with soil were more likely to survive than bare-root seedlings, and the use of special fertilizers also helped growth. Some of the trees tested had absorbed trace amounts of mercury through contaminated soil, but its not clear yet how this will affect them. Since the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 42 hectares (115 acres) with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date. The group is in discussion with Perus government to expand their efforts. Its very hard to stop mining in Madre de Dios, since its a major activity, said Farfan. The challenge now: to plant a tree that can grow in this soil. ___ While scientists struggle with tainted landscapes in the Amazon, activists a continent away are reckoning with flawed past attempts to heal the land. After miners left West Virginias Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with federal law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldnt seep down, and tree roots couldnt expand. Companies planted desperation species  grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure, but wouldnt reach their full height or restore the forest as it had been. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development. It was like trees trying to grow in a parking lot  not many could make it, said Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work. The Appalachian highlands once supported a large and unique ecosystem, dominated by 500,000 acres of red spruce forest a century and a half ago. But commercial logging in the late 1800s and later coal mining in the 20th century stripped the landscape, leaving less than a tenth of the red spruce forests intact. Now French and colleagues at Green Forests Work are collaborating with the U.S. Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support  by first tearing down other trees. We literally go in with a giant plow-like machine and rip the guts out of the soil, by dragging a 4-foot ripping shank behind a bulldozer, said Barton, the University of Kentucky professor and founder of Green Forests Work. Sometimes we call it ugly. This deep ripping, as its known, gives rainwater and tree roots a better chance to push down into the soil. A 2008 study found that disrupting the soil on U.S. brownfield sites through this method helped tree growth. After five growing seasons, trees planted on ripped sites had more roots compared to those where deep ripping didnt occur. Trees also grew taller. The idea of ripping up the ground seemed startling at first. When we first started, a lot of our colleagues thought we were crazy. But 10 years later, were well on our way, said Shane Jones, a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service. Earlier efforts at reforesting old mining sites within West Virginias Monongahela National Forest hadnt fared so well; sometimes, the majority of seedlings died. But in areas where the team has deep-ripped over the last decade, the survival rate of saplings has been around 90%. Green Forests Work has now reforested around 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested around 4,500 total acres since 2009. Their ultimate goal is to restart the natural cycle of the forest  so that scientists work becomes invisible again. ___ Other reforestation crusades are more personal. Maria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Graa, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazils lesser-known jungle  the Atlantic coastal rainforest. She collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. The Atlantic rainforest is one of the planets most threatened biomes, more than 90% of it was deforested, said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofits executive secretary. What is left is very fragmented. As she nears 50, Dona Graa says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities. She deplores the stupidity and ignorance of people who have destroyed most of the trees and continue destroying them. So Im trying. I cant do too much, but the little I can do, I try to do it properly to rescue those trees. And so, between feeding her chickens and raking the leaves, she grows seedlings of rare species  pau pereira, peroba, trees that people have damaged already, they dont exist anymore. She mixes limestone and clay, places it in plastic nursery bags and plants seeds in them; she irrigates them with water and cow urine. Local replanting efforts  which aim to reconnect fragmented parcels of forest  often use the seedlings from Dona Graas nursery, which gives her both income and great satisfaction.

The spring equinox is here. What does that mean?,"Spring is almost here  officially, at least. The vernal equinox arrives on Tuesday, marking the start of the spring season for the Northern Hemisphere. But what does that actually mean? Heres what to know about how we split up the year using the Earths orbit. As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle. For most of the year, the Earths axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the suns warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet. During the equinox, the Earths axis and its orbit line up so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight. The word equinox comes from two Latin words meaning equal and night. Thats because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time  though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet. The Northern Hemispheres spring  or vernal  equinox can land between March 19 and 21, depending on the year. Its fall  or autumnal  equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24. The solstices mark the times during the year when the Earth is at its most extreme tilt toward or away from the sun. This means the hemispheres are getting very different amounts of sunlight  and days and nights are at their most unequal. During the Northern Hemispheres summer solstice, the upper half of the earth is tilted in toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22. Meanwhile, at the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning away from the sun  leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls between December 20 and 23. These are just two different ways to carve up the year. Meteorological seasons are defined by the weather. They break down the year into three-month seasons based on annual temperature cycles. By that calendar, spring starts on March 1, summer on June 1, fall on Sept. 1 and winter on Dec. 1. Astronomical seasons depend on how the Earth moves around the sun. Equinoxes mark the start of spring and autumn. Solstices kick off summer and winter. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

A Russian Soyuz rocket with 3 astronauts blasts off to the International Space Station,"MOSCOW (AP)  A Russian Soyuz rocket carrying three astronauts to the International Space Station blasted off Saturday, two days after its launch was aborted at the last minute. The spacecraft carrying NASA astronaut Tracy Dyson, Russian Oleg Novitsky and Marina Vasilevskaya of Belarus launched smoothly from the Russian-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan. The launch had been planned for Thursday but was halted by an automatic safety system about 20 seconds before the scheduled liftoff. The head of the Russian space agency, Yuri Borisov, said the launch abort was triggered by a voltage drop in a power source. The space capsule atop the rocket separated and went into orbit eight minutes after the launch and began a two-day, 34-orbit trip to the space station. If the launch had gone as scheduled on Thursday, the journey would have been much shorter, requiring only two orbits. Docking is now expected at 1510 GMT Monday.  The three astronauts were to join the stations crew consisting of NASA astronauts Loral OHara, Matthew Dominick, Mike Barratt, and Jeanette Epps, as well as Russians Oleg Kononenko, Nikolai Chub, and Alexander Grebenkin. Novitsky, Vasilevskaya and OHara are to return to Earth on April 6. The space station, which has served as a symbol of post-Cold War international cooperation, is now one of the last remaining areas of collaboration between Russia and the West amid tensions over Moscows military action in Ukraine. NASA and its partners hope to continue operating the orbiting outpost until 2030. Russia has continued to rely on modified versions of Soviet-designed rockets for commercial satellites, as well as crews and cargo to the space station.",https://apnews.com/article/russia-space-soyuz-iss-726b9300c0662a9951de86a81d9db030,science
SpaceX delays space station delivery due to high wind,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX has delayed its delivery to the International Space Station because of dangerous wind gusts.  The Falcon 9 rocket came less than an hour from launching Wednesday. But the company halted the countdown because of excessive upper-level wind at Cape Canaveral and also out in the Atlantic. SpaceX wants to land the brand new booster on an offshore barge following liftoff so it can be reused.  SpaceX said it would try again early Thursday afternoon. While the wind should be calmer, it may be cloudier. The Dragon capsule contains 3 tons of supplies for NASA, including mighty mice for a muscle and bone study and barley for a beer-malting experiment. This will be the third trip to the space station for this recycled Dragon. SpaceX has been restocking the orbiting lab since 2012. Northrop Grumman is NASAs other private shipper. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Boeings crew capsule declared ready for 1st space flight,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeings Starliner crew capsule finally has a launch date for its first test flight to the International Space Station.  After an intensive review Thursday, NASA and Boeing managers agreed to a Dec. 20 liftoff.  Hopefully, we should all be getting an early Christmas present this year, said Phil McAlister, director of NASAs commercial spaceflight development. Just a few technical issues remain to be completed, he noted. No one will be aboard, just a mannequin named Rosie. Three astronauts will strap in for the second test flight of a Starliner sometime next year.  SpaceX also plans to launch astronauts for NASA next year. The company conducted a test flight without a crew back in March.  NASA turned to the two private companies in 2014 to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. Whether Boeing or SpaceX, it will be the first time U.S. astronauts rocket to orbit from home soil in nearly nine years. The longer-than-anticipated hiatus stretches back to NASAs last space shuttle flight in July 2011. NASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets in the interim. United Launch Alliances Atlas V rocket will provide the Starliners lift from Cape Canaveral, a little before sunrise. The capsule will parachute into New Mexico on Dec. 28 to close out the flight. ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Boeings Starliner crew capsule makes space debut this week,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeings shiny new Starliner crew capsule makes its debut this week with a launch to the International Space Station, the companys last hurdle before flying astronauts for NASA next year. Testing the cosmic waters will be Rosie the mannequin, decked out in Boeings custom blue spacesuit and a red polka dot bandanna modeled after the World War II riveter. If the orbital demo goes well, the first Starliner crew could be rocketing to the space station by summer. SpaceX also is looking to start launching astronauts for NASA, perhaps by spring. It completed a similar test flight of its crew capsule back in March.  The space agency hired the private companies to build and fly the capsules while it focused on a new generation of moonshots and other distant travel. Regardless of which company flies astronauts first, NASAs commercial crew program finally seems to be closing in on the finish line, after years of technical difficulties and delays. 2020 is the year, program manager Kathy Lueders said this week. This is really the final trial of these vehicles. Its been 8 1/2 years since Americans rocketed into orbit from home soil, and everyone  Boeing, SpaceX, NASA, local residents  is anxious for astronaut launches to resume. Really exciting now! NASA-turned-Boeing astronaut Chris Ferguson recently tweeted. Lets go fly. Ferguson was the commander of NASAs final space shuttle flight in July 2011, when human launches from Florida ceased. He left NASA and joined Boeing to help develop the Starliner. Hes assigned to the first crew, along with two NASA astronauts.  
        
     All three will watch Fridays launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. An Atlas V rocket, from United Launch Alliance, is set to blast off with the Starliner just before sunrise. The test dummy Rosie is outfitted with hundreds of sensors to gauge the stresses of the weeklong flight, from launch and space station docking, through atmospheric re-entry and touchdown in the New Mexico desert. Virtually every capsule system will be tested, including the ultra critical life-support.  The Starliner will carry Christmas presents and treats for the six space station residents, as well as 500 tree seeds similar to the ones that flew to the moon on Apollo 14 in 1971. Unlike Elon Musks decade-and-a-half-old SpaceX, Boeings human spaceflight ties run deep. As a result of company acquisitions, Boeing has partnered with NASA on every domestic astronaut program dating back to Project Mercury.  Its incredibly inspirational. The team is really excited, said John Mulholland, manager of Boeings commercial crew program.  NASA gave more than $4 billion to Boeing in 2014 to develop and fly the capsule to the space station; the company had been working on it since 2010. SpaceX got $2.6 billion for its crew capsule, an upscale version of its Dragon cargo ship, flying since 2012. Crew capsules turned out to be far more complicated than cargo capsules. Launch dates starting in 2017 came and went, as SpaceX and Northrop Grumman made steady supply runs. The delays have been costly. NASA has been shelling out as much as $86 million for a seat on a Russian Soyuz, the only ride to the space station for astronauts since the shuttles retirement. The space agencys overall Soyuz tab is now in the billions. Both Boeing and SpaceX have been beset by parachute problems, among other things. Last month, a Starliner landed safely despite only two of three parachutes deploying during a test. The mishap was traced to human error: The parachute rigging was improperly connected. Boeing also was blasted last month in a NASA audit. According to the inspector generals report, NASA overpaid Boeing as launch delays starting piling up. Boeing disputes the findings. SpaceX completed its first orbital test flight of the crew Dragon last March, but the capsule was destroyed a month later during testing at Cape Canaveral. Still ahead: an emergency escape test during liftoff, scheduled for January. On Wednesday, the towering Atlas V rocket was moved to the launch pad with the Starliner on top. White with black and blue trim, the capsule is 16.5 feet (5 meters) tall with its attached service module  the height of a giraffe  and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter.  It can fit up to seven people, though crews typically will number four: two Americans, one Russian and another international astronaut. Boeing eventually wants to sell empty seats to private researchers or even tourists. In a first for a U.S. crew capsule bound for orbit, the Starliner will aim for a land, versus water, landing. Its reusable and this one will be recycled for the second mission with a crew, including NASA astronaut Sunita Williams.  Bring it back in good shape, she urged Boeing this week. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Boeing capsule returns to Earth after aborted space mission,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeing safely landed its crew capsule in the New Mexico desert Sunday after an aborted flight to the International Space Station that could hold up the companys effort to launch astronauts for NASA next year. The Starliner descended into the Armys White Sands Missile Range in the frigid predawn darkness, ending a two-day demo that should have lasted more than a week. A trio of red, white and blue parachutes popped open and airbags also inflated around the spacecraft to ease the impact.  We pinpoint landed it, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a post-landing briefing.  The successful return capped a rocky start to a mission that was supposed to include a docking with the space station. Managers will review all the data before deciding whether to do another test flight or go straight to flying astronauts, said NASAs Steve Stich.  After seeing this first test flight cut short and the space station docking canceled because of an improperly set clock on the capsule, Boeing employees were relieved to get the Starliner back. Recovery teams cheered as they watched the capsule drift down through the air and make a bulls-eye landing. The touchdown was broadcast live on NASA TV; infrared cameras painted the descending capsule in a ghostly white.  As the sun rose, close-up views showed the large white and black capsule upright  with hardly any scorch marks from re-entry  next to a U.S. flag waving from a recovery vehicle. The astronauts assigned to the first Starliner crew  two from NASA and one from Boeing  were part of the welcoming committee.  
        
     A beautiful soft landing, said NASA astronaut Mike Fincke. Cant wait to try it out.  It was the first American-made capsule designed for astronauts to make a ground landing after returning from orbit. NASAs early crew capsules  Mercury, Gemini and Apollo  all had splashdowns. SpaceXs Dragon capsule, which made its orbital debut last winter with a test dummy, also aims for the ocean at missions end. Minutes after touchdown, top NASA and Boeing officials poured into Mission Control in Houston to congratulate the team. The newly returned Starliner also got a personalized name: Calypso, after Jacques Cousteaus boat. The capsules first trip to space began with a smooth rocket ride from Cape Canaveral on Friday. But barely a half hour into the flight, it failed to fire its thrusters to give chase to the space station and ended up in the wrong orbit.  The problem was with the Starliners internal clock: It did not sync up with the Atlas V rocket and was off by 11 hours, according to Boeings Jim Chilton.  The capsule burned so much fuel trying to orient itself in orbit that there wasnt enough left for a space station rendezvous. Flight controllers tried to correct the problem, but between the spacecrafts position and a gap in communications, their signals did not get through. They later managed to reset the clock.  Boeing is still trying to figure out how the timing error occurred. The mission lasted nearly 50 hours and included 33 orbits around the Earth, about 100 orbits fewer than planned.  A test dummy named Rosie the Rocketeer  after Rosie the Riveter from World War II  rode in the commanders seat. Also returning were holiday presents, clothes and food that should have been delivered to the space station crew. Even though not all goals were met including a station docking, in my eyes, it was a huge success, said Boeing flight director Richard Jones. There were no parachute problems this time. Last month, only two parachutes deployed during an atmospheric test because workers failed to connect a pin in the rigging. We didnt do everything we wanted to do, but we dont see anything wrong with this spaceship right now, despite the timing error, Chilton said. He apologized to the six space station residents for not delivering their Christmas presents.  Boeing had been shooting for its first astronaut launch in the first half of 2020. This capsule is supposed to be recycled for the second flight with crew; each Starliner is built to fly in space 10 times. The capsule will return to Floridas Kennedy Space Center in two weeks for inspections and refurbishments. Weve got a lot of learning in front of us, Bridenstine said. But we have enough information and data to where we can keep moving forward in a very positive way. Despite its own setbacks, SpaceX remains in the lead in NASAs commercial crew program. SpaceXs Dragon crew capsule successfully completed its first orbital demo last March. While the flight to the space station went well, the capsule exploded a month later on a test stand at Cape Canaveral.  If a launch abort test goes well next month, SpaceX could start launching NASA astronauts by spring and end a nearly nine-year gap in flying people from Cape Canaveral. As its space shuttle program was winding down, NASA looked to private industry to take over cargo and crew deliveries to the space station. SpaceX kicked off supply runs in 2012. Two years later, NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to ferry astronauts to the orbiting lab.  SpaceX got $2.6 billion under NASAs commercial crew program, while Boeing received more than $4 billion. The goal was to launch NASA astronauts by 2017. Because of delays, NASA is looking to buy another two seats on Russian rockets in 2020 and 2021 to guarantee a continuing U.S. presence on the space station. Even when private companies are regularly carrying up astronauts for NASA, the space agency always will reserve a seat for a Russian in exchange for a free U.S. seat on a Soyuz. Over the years, these Soyuz rides have cost NASA up to $86 million apiece, with the tab totaling in the billions. A recent audit by NASAs inspector general found a Starliner seat will cost slightly more than that, with a Dragon seat going for just over half the price. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Rough seas delay escape test for SpaceX crew capsule,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Rough seas prompted SpaceX on Saturday to delay the emergency escape test of its new crew capsule by a day. Liftoff is now set for Sunday at NASAs Kennedy Space Center.  The Falcon rocket was supposed to blast off Saturday on a 10-minute flight to demonstrate the capsules emergency escape system before astronauts climb aboard in a few months. But the wind and waves were too high in the recovery area out in the Atlantic.  Once launched, the capsule will catapult off the rocket and, if all goes well, parachute into the ocean with a pair of mannequins. The rocket - being recycled after three previous flights - will end up being destroyed. The test is the last major hurdle for SpaceX before launching two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA officials said that could happen as soon as March. Boeing, meanwhile, is still investigating why its Starliner crew capsule ended up in the wrong orbit last month following liftoff. It was the Starliners first test flight, with no one on board, and the mishap prevented the capsule from flying to the International Space Station.  NASA is looking for SpaceX and Boeing to start flying astronauts to the space station this year. The last time NASA astronauts launched from the U.S. was in 2011; theyve been riding Russian rockets in the interim for hefty prices.",https://apnews.com/general-news-1a544a48d9e84d03503df75d2a396e36,science
Spacewalking astronauts wrap up battery improvements,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A pair of spacewalking astronauts successfully wrapped up battery improvements outside the International Space Station on Monday, completing a job begun last fall.  NASAs Jessica Meir and Christina Koch installed the last new battery in a set of six launched to the orbiting lab in September. They also removed two old batteries in their second spacewalk in under a week to upgrade the stations solar power grid. This marked the womens third spacewalk together. They conducted the worlds first all-female spacewalk last October, replacing a failed charging device that bumped the battery replacements into this year. The women had just completed the battery work when Koch inadvertently deployed the hand controller on her emergency jet pack, called a Safer. Meir hurried over to get the controller back in its proper place. Koch called her my hero. Mission Control cautioned that, given the current set-up, we would not count on Christinas Safer in an emergency. NASAs spacewalking astronauts always wear small Safer jet packs in case they become untethered from the station and float away. Its never been needed. During last Wednesdays spacewalk, Kochs helmet lights and camera came loose. She later found a faulty latch in the helmet assembly and replaced it before floating out Monday. Koch has been aboard the space station for more than 10 months, the longest single spaceflight by a woman. She returns to Earth in just over two weeks. 
        
     NASA gradually has been replacing the space stations 48 aging, original-style nickel-hydrogen batteries with new and more powerful lithium-ion batteries. Only half as many of the new batteries are needed. So far, 18 new batteries have been installed over the past three years and 36 old ones removed.  Another batch of six new batteries will be launched to the orbiting lab this spring to complete the power upgrade. The old batteries, meanwhile, will be discarded in a supply ship. These oversized, boxy batteries keep all the space stations systems running when the outpost is on the night side of Earth, drawing power from the sprawling solar wings. Theyre not easy to handle: Each is about a yard, or a meter, tall and wide, with a mass of about 400 pounds (180 kilograms.)  In all, five spacewalks were needed to complete the battery work this time around. Monitoring the action from inside, NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan congratulated his astro-sisters for a mission accomplished. As Mondays seven-hour spacewalk drew to a close, Meir and Koch paid tribute to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. on the holiday marking his birth. Koch noted how she and Meir often say how much they owe the pioneering female astronauts who came before them and everyone else working for civil rights and inclusion. Thats why its so meaningful for us today to be out here, on the day we honor Martin Luther King Jr., who paved the way not only for us, but so many that have a dream, Koch said. It was their last spacewalk together, at least during this mission. Morgan and Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano will venture outside Saturday to complete repairs to a cosmic ray detector on the space station. The science instruments cooling system had to be replaced, an intricate job requiring four spacewalks. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support  from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Space stations cosmic detector working after 4 spacewalks,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The cosmic detector that required a series of difficult spacewalking repairs is back in action.  The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is working better than ever, Samuel Ting, the Nobel laureate who oversees the instrument, said Friday.  The $2 billion spectrometer  the International Space Stations premier science instrument  has now measured 152 billion charged cosmic rays in its hunt for elusive antimatter and dark matter, said Ting, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  A pair of astronauts conducted four spacewalks, beginning in November, to replace the spectrometers failing cooling system.  The final spacewalk, last Saturday, was the only one where Ting was not at NASAs Mission Control in Houston. Instead, he was in Switzerland at the control room for the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, which helps run the spectrometer. The only time I was not there, something happened, Ting said. But he said he was never nervous  even when a leak cropped up in one of the coolant lines last Saturday  and was always confident the spacewalks would succeed. Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano plugged the leak by repeatedly tightening the fitting for the line. The spectrometer has been at the space station since 2011. Ting expects it to last the lifetime of the station, or another five to 10 years.  Ting said the instrument already has provided strong candidates for antimatter and dark matter.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX aims to launch up to 4 tourists into super high orbit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX aims to launch up to four tourists into a super high orbit, possibly by the end of next year. The private company is working with Space Adventures Inc. for the flight, officials announced Tuesday. Ticket prices are not being divulged but expected to be in the millions. Space Adventures already has helped put tourists into orbit with trips to the International Space Station, working with the Russian space program.  For this trip, paying customers will skip the space station and instead orbit two to three times higher, or roughly 500 miles to 750 miles (800 kilometers to 1,200 kilometers) above Earth.  Its a lofty goal that would approach the record 850-mile-high (1,370 kilometers) orbit achieved by Gemini 11s Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon in 1966. The tourist flight will forge a path to making spaceflight possible for all people who dream of it, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said in a statement. Elon Musks California-based SpaceX already is dabbling in space tourism, signing on a Japanese billionaire to fly to the moon in three or so years. Jeff Bezos Blue Origin and Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic also plan tourist trips to space, but these will be brief up-and-downs, not orbital. SpaceX will use the same kind of Dragon capsule that will launch NASA astronauts to the space station, possibly in another few months. The capsule has flown only once in space so far, making its debut last year in a successful test flight without a crew. 
        
     Space Adventures spokeswoman Stacey Tearne said the tourist flight could occur in the last quarter of 2021. The company is in discussions with several potential clients. No professional pilot or astronaut will be required, Tearne said, because the Dragon is fully autonomous. But passengers will be able to control the spacecraft if required, she said in an email.  The cost will be in line with previous tourist flights, she said. Canadian billionaire Guy Laliberte, founder of Cirque du Soleil, paid $35 million for a 1 1/2-week space station flight in 2009. He said from orbit that it was worth every penny and more. Like all previous space tourists, he launched on a Russian rocket from Kazakhstan. This private Dragon flight from Cape Canaveral will be shorter, lasting up to five days, according to Tearne.  Based in Vienna, Virginia, Space Adventures helped arrange the flight of the worlds first space tourist, Dennis Tito, founder and chairman of Wilshire Associates in California. He flew to the space station on a Russian capsule in 2001, igniting the wrath of top NASA officials who opposed visiting tourists. The company has arranged eight space missions, with one tourist going twice. Space Adventures goal is to create unique and previously impossible opportunities for private citizens to experience space, Eric Anderson, company chairman, said in a statement. NASA has softened its stance on space tourists, and is opening the station doors to paying customers once commercial crew flights by SpaceX and Boeing have been established.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Satellite almost on empty gets new life after space docking,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A communication satellite almost out of fuel has gotten a new life after the first space docking of its kind.  Northrop Grumman and Intelsat announced the successful link-up nearly 22,500 miles (36,000 kilometers) above Earth on Wednesday. Its the first time two commercial satellites have joined in orbit like this.  The recently launched satellite  Northrop Grummans Mission Extension Vehicle, or MEV-1  will serve as a guide dog of sorts for its aging Intelsat companion. Company officials called it a historic moment for space commerce, akin to the three-spacewalker capture of a wayward Intelsat satellite 28 years ago. Were pushing the boundaries of what many thought would be impossible, said Tom Wilson, president of SpaceLogistics, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. The impossible is now a reality. Today is a great example of that. The Northrup Grumman satellite was launched from Kazakhstan in October. On Tuesday, it closed in on the 19-year-old Intelsat 901 satellite and clamped onto it. The duo will remain attached for the next five years. This novel rescue was carried out at a slightly higher orbit to avoid jeopardizing other satellites if something had gone wrong. The Intelsat satellite was never designed for this kind of docking; officials said everything went well. Once maneuvered back down into its operational orbit, the Intelsat satellite should resume operations in another month or two. MEV-1 will move on to another satellite in need once its five-year hitch is over.  
        
     Jean-Luc Froeliger, a vice president for Intelsat, said the satellite had just months of fuel remaining. It ended service late last year and was sent into the slightly higher orbit for the docking.  Officials declined to say how much the operation cost or what future rescues might cost. Intelsat CEO Stephen Spengler said there was a solid business case for undertaking the salvage attempt with five more years of operation ahead for the satellite. Its reminiscent of another Intelsat rescue that unfolded closer to home.  Spacewalking astronauts captured the wayward Intelsat 603 satellite during Endeavours maiden voyage in 1992. It took three men to grab the satellite with their gloved hands in perhaps the most dramatic shuttle mission of all time. An attached rocket motor ended up propelling the satellite from a low altitude to its proper orbit.  Northrop Grumman envisions satellite refueling and other robotic repairs in another five to 10 years. In the meantime, a second rescue satellite will be launched later this year. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Go forth and spend: Call for action closes US climate summit,"WASHINGTON (AP)  World leaders shared tales of climate-friendly breakthroughs  and feverish quests for more  to close President Joe Bidens virtual global climate summit on Friday, from Kenyans abandoning kerosene lanterns for solar to Israeli start-ups straining for more efficient storage batteries. It was an exhortational end to an unusual pandemic-era summit hosted from a specially created TV-style set in the White House East Room. Bidens two-day gathering briefly united the heads of global rivals America, China and Russia  on screens, anyway  long enough to pledge cooperation on climate. It also saw the U.S. and a half-dozen allies commit to significant new efforts and financing to reduce climate-damaging emissions.  Fridays closing message: Go forth and spend, making good on pledges for rapid transitions to cleaner vehicles, power grids and buildings to stave off the worst of global warming. The commitments weve made must become real, declared Biden, who is seeking $2.3 trillion from Congress for legislation that would partly go for electric charging stations, for laying out an efficient new national electrical grid and for capping abandoned oil and gas rigs and coal mines. Commitment without doing anything is a lot of hot air, no pun intended. Were gonna do this together, Biden said, speaking live to a final Zoom-style screen of leaders of national governments, unions and business executives around the world.  
        
     His closing message echoed the sentiments of Kenyan President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta, who told the summit: We cannot win this fight against climate change unless we go globally to fight it together. Compared to the United States and other wealthy but carbon-addicted nations, Kenya stands out as a poorer country closing the technology gap despite limited financial resources. It has become a leading user and producer of geothermal and wind power. Small solar panels that charge lights and mobile phones have become cheap enough for some poor households to replace their kerosene lanterns. Opposition has stalled work on what would be its first dirtier-burning coal-fired power plant. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, described scientists at hundreds of Israeli start-ups working to improve crucial battery storage for solar, wind and other renewable energy.  Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark renewed her countrys pledge to end oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, switching from offshore oil and gas rigs to wind farms. Biden convened the summit showcasing the United States own high-profile return to international climate efforts after President Donald Trumps withdrawal. Biden used the summit to announce he intended to cut U.S. coal and petroleum emissions in half by 2030, nearly doubling the previous target. Publicly, there had been no firm word up until this week that Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia would accept Bidens summit invite, given disputes with the U.S. over nonclimate issues.  But they did, despite concerns that international isolation and domestic political conflict under Trump had weakened the United States. Nations still want to come to the party that the U.S. throws, said Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations. Xi, whose country is the worlds No. 1 climate polluter, held out the possibility in his summit speech of moving faster to slow Chinas building of new coal-fired power plants.  He pledged to strictly control coal power, which sends a strong domestic message to Chinese provincial officials on future coal projects, said Yan Qin, a carbon analyst with the Refinitiv Carbon group. South Koreas announcement at the summit that it would stop funding new coal-fired power plants abroad increased pressure on China and Japan, which still do, analysts said. Friday also featured billionaires Bill Gates and Mike Bloomberg, steelworker and electrical union leaders and executives for solar and other renewable energy. We cant beat climate change without a historic amount of new investment, said Bloomberg, who has spent heavily to promote replacing coal-fired power plants with increasingly cheaper renewable energy. It was all in service of an argument officials say will make or break Bidens climate vision: Pouring trillions of dollars into clean-energy technology, research and infrastructure will speed a competitive U.S. economy into the future and create jobs while saving the planet. While technological development and wider use has helped make wind and solar power strongly competitive against coal and natural gas in the U.S., Biden said investment also would bring forward thriving, clean-energy fields in things we havent even thought of so far. Republicans are sticking to the arguments that Trump made in pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. They point to China as the worlds worst climate polluter and say any transition to clean energy hurts American oil, natural gas and coal workers. Biden envoy John Kerry stressed the presidential political selling point that rebuilding creaky U.S. infrastructure to run more cleanly would put the U.S. on a better economic footing long-term.  No one is being asked for a sacrifice, Kerry said. This is an opportunity. ___ AP writer Matthew Daly contributed from Washington.

Summit shows Bidens big vision on fighting climate change,"WASHINGTON (AP)  What did the world learn at Joe Bidens global summit about his vision of the battle to save the worlds climate?  For two days, Biden and his team of climate experts pressed his case that tackling global warming not only can avert an existential threat, but also benefit the U.S. economy  and the worlds as well. The virtual summit, based at the White House and featuring more than  40 world leaders whose views were beamed to a global online audience, offered fresh details on how the U.S. might hope to supercharge its efforts on climate while leveraging international action to spur new technologies to help save the planet. Biden opened the conference by announcing a goal to cut up to 52% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030  double the target set by President Barack Obama in the 2015 Paris climate accord. The 2030 goal vaults the U.S. into the top tier of countries on climate ambition. This goal is eyebrow-raising, but it has to be, said Marshall Shepherd, a climate expert at the University of Georgia. To move the needle on the climate crisis, we need bold actions like this rather than individual or incremental actions only. While new targets from the U.S. and others got mostly positive reviews, they still fall a bit short of what some scientists say is necessary to avoid a potentially disastrous 1.5 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures.  
        
     Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a climate science think tank in Berlin, said his teams calculations showed the U.S. needs to reduce emissions 57% by 2030 to stay on a 1.5 degree Celsius pathway. He calls the new target really a major improvement, but also not quite enough. Still, the U.S. goal is ambitious, and reflects lessons learned, not only by Biden  Obamas vice president  but by his team of battle-tested aides, including climate envoy John Kerry and White House adviser Gina McCarthy. Both served in the Obama administration. Biden and his team absorbed the lessons of the Obama years, including watching the stumbles in climate foreign policy at a disappointing 2009 Copenhagen summit, said Hare. What shocked me is just how fast this moved, less than 100 days after Biden took office. The 78-year-old Biden, known as a cautious, mainstream politician during four decades in public life, as president has shown a willingness to take aggressive action on issues from virus relief to immigration.  In so many areas, he is much bolder than Obama, right out of the gate, and thats certainly true on climate, said Nathaniel Keohane, a former Obama White House adviser who now is a senior vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund.  The message from the White House is clear, Keohane added: The United States is ready to go all-in to beat the climate crisis. As the conference wrapped up Friday, Biden said he has come to see the economic opportunities of the climate fight as the silver lining in a cloud that threatens the worlds very future. My mother would always say when something very bad would happen in our family, Out of everything bad, Joe, something good will come, said Biden, whose life has repeatedly been touched by tragedy. On climate, the good that Biden hopes will emerge is the chance to remake the global economy and produce millions of jobs in clean energy and technology that will be needed to slow global warming. Is there anything else you can think of that could create as many good jobs going into the middle of the 21st century? he asked.  The climate crisis also has provided an opportunity for the U.S. to work with longtime rivals such as Russia and China. While Biden has often disagreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader now is talking about how you capture carbon from space, Biden said.  Despite their differences, two big nations can cooperate to get something done ... that benefits everybody,' Biden said. Bidens re-entry into the Paris agreement and his decision to host the summit were welcomed by world leaders. Im delighted to see that the United States is back ... in climate politics. Because there can be no doubt about the world needing your contribution if we really want to fulfill our ambitious goals, Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel told Biden.  We are all so delighted to have the United States back in the climate game, added South Africas President Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa.  Even after four years of inaction on climate change under President Donald Trump, the United States still has cachet, said Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. She pointed to the attendance of world leaders on both friendly and otherwise chilly terms with the U.S., including China, Russia, Germany and Brazil. Kerry, who has worked on climate issues in a long career as a senator and former secretary of state, said the next 10 years are crucial to slow global warming and avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. This has to be the decade of decision, Kerry said.  But even as Biden opts to go big on climate, his plan faces obstacles, including continued resistance from congressional Republicans and the reality that businesses are struggling to create needed technology on an affordable scale. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has dismissed Bidens plans, including a $2.3 trillion infrastructure package, as costly and ineffective.  The infrastructure bill includes up to $1 trillion in spending on clean energy and climate change, including 500,000 charging stations for electric vehicles, expansion of solar and wind power and technology to capture and store carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. About $174 billion would go to help put school children, commuters and truckers into electric vehicles and buses, $50 billion to make infrastructure more resilient against volatile weather linked to climate change, and $100 billion to update the power grid. The administration has pitched the bill as the American Jobs Plan,' and Moodys Analytics estimates gains of about 2.7 million jobs.  Failure to adopt the package could doom Bidens commitments to cut carbon emissions in half, although officials say substantial progress can be made through administrative regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency, Transportation Department and other agencies. The White House says officials will continue to reach out to Republicans and will remind them that the proposals ideas are widely popular with a wide swath of Americans. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this story.",https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-technology-business-climate-summits-949962c299ab8792d82d0d0fef57b046,science

Biggest space station crowd in decade after SpaceX arrival,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The International Space Stations population swelled to 11 on Saturday with the jubilant arrival of SpaceXs third crew capsule in less than a year. Its the biggest crowd up there in more than a decade.  All of the astronauts  representing the U.S., Russia, Japan and France  managed to squeeze into camera view for a congratulatory call from the leaders of their space agencies. In this tough situation around the world, I believe you have brought courage and hope for all of us, Japanese Space Agency President Hiroshi Yamakawa said from his countrys flight control center, referring to the global pandemic. A recycled SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts arrived at the space station a day after launching from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. The Dragon capsule docked autonomously with the orbiting outpost more than 260 miles (420 kilometers) above the Indian Ocean. The hatches swung open a couple hours later, uniting all 11 space travelers. Man, it is awesome to see the 11 of you on station, said NASAs acting administrator, Steve Jurczyk. He noted that this will be the norm, now that SpaceX is regularly flying crews. The newcomers will spend six months at the space station. Theyll replace four astronauts who will return to Earth in their own Dragon capsule Wednesday to end a half-year mission. NASA deliberately planned for a brief overlap so the outgoing SpaceX crew could show the new arrivals around. 
        
     Although this was SpaceXs third crew flight for NASA, it was the first to use a vehicle thats flown before, an essential part of a plan by SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk to push to the moon and Mars. The Dragon capsule was used for SpaceXs first crew launch last May, while the Falcon rocket soaring Friday hoisted crew two in November. It was the first time two SpaceX crew Dragons were parked there at the same time  practically side by side. NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur  the commander and pilot of the returning Dragon  monitored their capsules flat screen computers during the morning rendezvous. They could have taken control if necessary, but the autonomous system did its job, much like a self-driving car. Also checking into the space station: Frances Thomas Pesquet and Japans Akihiko Hoshide. Both have lived there before, as has Kimbrough. But it was the first station visit for McArthur. She flew up in the same seat and the same capsule  named Endeavour  as her husband, Bob Behnken, did on SpaceXs debut crew mission. The European Space Agencys director general, Josef Aschbacher, joked that the space station needs expansion with so many on board. Pesquet  the first European to fly on a commercial crew capsule  noted that the space station has changed quite a bit since his last visit four years ago, with more people and types of spacecraft. Were so happy to see our friends, he said. We wish we could keep them a little bit longer, but not too long as well, because 11 people is a lot on a space station. The all-time record is 13, set during NASAs space shuttle era. The current population includes six Americans, two Russians, two Japanese and one French. It will shrink by four on Wednesday when three Americans and one Japanese depart for home and a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. NASA turned to private companies for space station deliveries after the shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX began supply runs in 2012, honing its skills before launching astronauts and ending NASAs reliance on Russia. NASA also hired Boeing for taxi service, but the companys Starliner capsule isnt expected to fly astronauts until next year. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

False alarm: No space junk threat after all to SpaceX crew,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceXs four astronauts had barely settled into orbit last Friday when they were ordered back into their spacesuits because of a potential collision with orbiting junk. It turns out there was no object and no threat, the U.S. Space Command acknowledged Monday. The false alarm is under review. Lt. Col. Erin Dick, a spokeswoman for Space Command, said it was believed at the time that an object was going to come close to the newly launched SpaceX capsule carrying a crew to the International Space Station.  However, we quickly realized this was a reporting error, she wrote in an email, and that there was never a collision threat because there was no object at risk of colliding with the capsule. She declined to comment further, saying additional information should be available later this week once they understand what happened. Astronauts typically get a fair amount of advance notice of potential close calls, with enough time to even dodge out of the way, if necessary. Fridays situation, however, popped up quickly  the astronauts got barely a half-hour heads-up. The Space Commands 18th Space Control Squadron alerted NASA about 45 minutes before the potential conjunction, according to officials at Johnson Space Center in Houston. SpaceX and NASA notified the astronauts 15 minutes later, urging them to put on their suits right away and lower their helmet visors. By then, there wasnt enough time to change the capsules path. The drama played out live on NASA TV. 
        
     The U.S., French and Japanese astronauts had practiced this many times before flight, according to NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries. Of course, were always happy to hear that there never was a threat, but were also glad the procedures were in place and the crew would have been ready if the threat had been real, he said. The Dragon capsule and its crew safely reached the space station on Saturday, with no further surprises. The new arrivals will spend six months there. Based at Californias Vandenberg Air Force Base, the 18th Space Control Squadron is tracking more than 32,000 objects in orbit, mostly defunct satellites and rocket parts. Some is as small as 4 inches (10 diameters). Even something that little can do big damage to a spacecraft at high speed. The space station is particularly vulnerable because of its sprawling size.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"More patrols, fewer boaters for SpaceX splashdown Saturday","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The astronauts flying SpaceX back to Earth this weekend urged boaters to stay safe by staying away from their capsules splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. NASA and SpaceX are promising more Coast Guard patrols and fewer pleasure boaters for Saturday mornings planned splashdown off the Florida coast  the companys second return of a crew. The trip home for the four astronauts was delayed from Wednesday because of high winds forecast for the area.  Last August, pleasure boaters swarmed the Dragon capsule carrying two astronauts. NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins said everyone is putting a lot of emphasis on keeping the area clear this time. I dont think any of us are too worried in terms of landing on a boat, he said during a news conference Monday from the International Space Station. Leaking fuel from the capsules thrusters could endanger people outside the capsule. A crowd could also hamper SpaceXs recovery effort. Hopkins is winding up a six-month mission, along with U.S. crewmates Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and Japans Soichi Noguchi. Their replacements arrived Saturday on their own SpaceX capsule.  When Hopkins and his crew launched last November, they hoped to return to a world where COVID-19 held less of a grip than it does. They will go into semi-quarantine for a while, Walker said, to give their space-weakened immune systems time to bounce back. 
        
     Theyll roll up their sleeves for their first vaccine shot seven to 10 days after splashdown. We definitely have enjoyed not wearing masks up here, Walker said. And having to go back and wear masks  well, its what we will do because that is the right thing to do. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"4th flight fizzles for NASAs Mars helicopter, retry Friday","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs Mars helicopter fizzled Thursday on its fourth flight attempt. The 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) helicopter named Ingenuity was supposed to lift off on its longest, fastest flight yet, after three successes. But the chopper remained on the ground.  Flight controllers at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California will attempt a redo on Friday.  Ingenuitys took flight for the first time at Mars on April 19  becoming the first powered aircraft to soar at another planet  after controllers fixed a software error.  Managers said the solution would work 85% of the time. After three successful flights, Thursdays attempt was not one of them. The helicopter team has until early next week to test Ingenuity in the Martian skies. Two more flights are planned before NASAs Perseverance rover shoves off on its primary mission: seeking signs of past life in the Martian rocks. The rover will collect core samples and set them aside for pickup by a future robotic craft, for eventual return to Earth. Perseverance and Ingenuity arrived at Mars on Feb. 18, landing in an ancient river delta. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX making 1st US crew splashdown in dark since Apollo 8,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX this weekend will attempt the first U.S. splashdown of returning astronauts in darkness since the Apollo 8 moonshot in 1968.  Elon Musks company is targeting the predawn hours of Sunday to bring back three NASA astronauts and one from Japan, after dangerously high wind scuttled a pair of earlier attempts.  The astronauts  only the second crew to fly SpaceX  will depart the International Space Station on Saturday night aboard the SpaceX Dragon capsule that carried them up last November. Theyll aim for a splashdown 6 1/2 hours later, around 3 a.m. in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Panama City, Florida.  SpaceX brought back a station cargo capsule with a splashdown in darkness in January. That adds to NASAs confidence for a nighttime homecoming, said Rob Navias, a spokesman at Johnson Space Center in Houston. SpaceX has done numerous dress rehearsals and spent a lot of time with nighttime recoveries, he said.  Navias said the time slot provided the best weather conditions in the coming days. The capsule carrying Apollo 8s three astronauts  the first men to fly to the moon  splashed into the Pacific near Hawaii before dawn on Dec. 27, 1968. The Russians also had one crew splashdown in darkness, back in 1976. The two-man capsule could not dock to the Soviet Unions Salyut 5 space station as intended and had to make a hasty return, ending up in a partially frozen lake in Kazakhstan  in the middle of a blizzard. It took hours for recovery teams to rescue the cosmonauts. 
        
     Even with the early hour, the Coast Guard promises to have more patrols to keep sightseers at a safe distance. On a Sunday afternoon last August, pleasure boaters swarmed the capsule that parachuted into the Gulf of Mexico with the first SpaceX crew.  The departure of NASAs Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker and Japans Soichi Noguchi will leave seven aboard the space station. Their replacements  representing the U.S., Japan and France  arrived last weekend in their own SpaceX capsule for a six-month mission.

"Mars helicopter aces 4th flight, gets extra month of flying","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs little Mars helicopter has gotten a reprieve.  Instead of wrapping up flight tests at the beginning of May, NASA is giving its Ingenuity helicopter at least an extra month to tackle tough new terrain and serve as a scout for its companion rover, Perseverance.  Officials announced the flight extension Friday, following three short flights in under two weeks for the $85 million tech demo. Soon afterward, there was more good news: Ingenuity  the first powered aircraft to soar at another planet  had aced its fourth flight at Mars. For Fridays trip, Ingenuity traveled 872 feet (266 meters) at a height of 16 feet (5 meters) for two minutes  considerably farther and longer than before. An attempt Thursday had failed because of a known software error.  On its fifth flight in another week or so, the 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) chopper will move to a new airfield on Mars, allowing the rover to finally start focusing on its own rock-sampling mission. The rover is seeking signs of ancient life at Jezero Crater, home to a lush lakebed and river delta billions of years ago. The helicopter team at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, expects to chalk up a sixth and seventh flight in May. The previous limit had been five. If all goes well, the helicopter mission could go even longer.  Ingenuity loves Mars, project manager MiMi Aung told reporters. It takes off and I almost feel the freedom that it feels. 
        
     Now Perseverance will take priority, scoping out the rocks around the Feb. 18 landing site. Ingenuity hitched a ride to Mars on the rovers belly, launching from Cape Canaveral last summer. Managers expect the rover to collect its first sample in July for return to Earth in a decade. The rover will continue to relay data and pictures from the helicopter, but stop taking its own chopper shots. The two spacecraft must be within a half-mile (1 kilometer) of one another, for communication relay. Designed to operate on Mars for 30 days, Ingenuity probably can survive the freezing Martian nights  and repeated flights in the extremely thin atmosphere  for at least another few months. We really do expect some finite life, Aung said, and so it will be a race between how long these parts surprise us in surviving.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX capsule departs station with 4 astronauts, heads home","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts departed the International Space Station late Saturday, aiming for a rare nighttime splashdown to end the companys second crew flight. It would be the first U.S. splashdown in darkness since Apollo 8s crew returned from the moon in 1968. NASAs Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and Japans Soichi Noguchi, headed home in the same Dragon capsule that delivered them to the space station last November. The ride back was expected to take just 6 1/2 hours. Thanks for your hospitality, Hopkins radioed as the capsule undocked 260 miles (420 kilometers) above Mali. SpaceX targeted a splashdown around 3 a.m. Sunday in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Panama City, Florida. Despite the early hour, the Coast Guard deployed extra patrols  and spotlights  to keep any night-owl sightseers away. The capsule of the first SpaceX crew was surrounded by pleasure boaters last summer, posing a safety risk. Hopkins, the spacecraft commander, rocketed into orbit with his crew on Nov. 15 from NASAs Kennedy Space Center. Their replacements arrived a week ago aboard their own Dragon capsule  the same one that launched SpaceXs first crew last spring. The four should have been back by now, but high offshore wind kept them at the space station a few extra days. SpaceX and NASA determined the best weather would be before dawn.

SpaceX returns 4 astronauts to Earth; rare night splashdown,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX safely returned four astronauts from the International Space Station on Sunday, making the first U.S. crew splashdown in darkness since the Apollo 8 moonshot. The Dragon capsule parachuted into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Panama City, Florida, just before 3 a.m., ending the second astronaut flight for Elon Musks company. It was an express trip home, lasting just 6 1/2 hours. The astronauts, three American and one Japanese, flew back in the same capsule  named Resilience  in which they launched from NASAs Kennedy Space Center in November. We welcome you back to planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX, SpaceXs Mission Control radioed moments after splashdown. For those of you enrolled in our frequent flyer program, youve earned 68 million miles on this voyage. Well take those miles, said spacecraft commander Mike Hopkins. Are they transferrable? SpaceX replied that the astronauts would have to check with the companys marketing department. Within a half-hour of splashdown, the charred capsule  resembling a giant toasted marshmallow  had been hoisted onto the recovery ship, with the astronauts exiting soon afterward. NASA and SpaceX managers marveled at how fast and smooth the operation went. The companys senior adviser, Hans Koenigsmann, said it looked more like a race car pit stop than anything else. Hopkins was the first one out, doing a little dance as he emerged under the intense spotlights. 
        
     Its amazing what can be accomplished when people come together, he told SpaceX flight controllers at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Quite frankly, you all are changing the world. Congratulations. Its great to be back. The 167-day mission was the longest for a crew capsule launching from the U.S. The previous record of 84 days was set by NASAs final Skylab station astronauts in 1974. Saturday nights undocking left seven people at the space station, four of whom arrived a week ago via SpaceX. Earthbound! NASA astronaut Victor Glover, the capsules pilot, tweeted after departing the station. One step closer to family and home! Hopkins and Glover  along with NASAs Shannon Walker and Japans Soichi Noguchi  should have returned to Earth last Wednesday, but high offshore winds forced SpaceX to pass up a pair of daytime landing attempts. Managers switched to a rare splashdown in darkness, to take advantage of calm weather. SpaceX had practiced for a nighttime return, just in case, and even recovered its most recent station cargo capsule from the Gulf of Mexico in darkness. Infrared cameras tracked the astronauts capsule as it re-entered the atmosphere; it resembled a bright star streaking through the night sky. All four main parachutes could be seen deploying just before splashdown, which was also visible in the infrared. Apollo 8  NASAs first flight to the moon with astronauts  ended with a predawn splashdown in the Pacific near Hawaii on Dec. 27, 1968. Eight years later, a Soviet capsule with two cosmonauts ended up in a dark, partially frozen lake in Kazakhstan, blown off course in a blizzard. That was it for nighttime crew splashdowns  until Sunday. Despite the early hour, the Coast Guard was out in full force to enforce an 11-mile (18-kilometer) keep-out zone around the bobbing Dragon capsule. For SpaceXs first crew return in August, pleasure boaters swarmed the capsule, a safety risk. Leisure boats stayed away this time. Once finished with their medical checks on the ship, the astronauts planned to hop on a helicopter for the short flight to shore, then catch a plane straight to Houston for a reunion with their families. Its not very often you get to wake up on the space station and go to sleep in Houston, chief flight director Holly Ridings told reporters. The astronauts capsule, Resilience, will head back to Cape Canaveral for refurbishment for SpaceXs first private crew mission in September. The space station docking mechanism will be removed, and a brand new domed window put in its place. A tech billionaire has purchased the entire three-day flight, which will orbit 75 miles (120 kilometers) above the space station. Hell fly with a pair of contest winners and a physician assistant from St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, his designated charity for the mission. SpaceXs next astronaut launch for NASA will follow in October. NASA turned to private companies to service the space station, after the shuttle fleet retired in 2011. SpaceX began supply runs in 2012 and, last May, launched its first crew, ending NASAs reliance on Russia for astronaut transport. Boeing isnt expected to launch astronauts until early next year. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

60 years since 1st American in space: Tourists lining up,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Sixty years after Alan Shepard became the first American in space, everyday people are on the verge of following in his cosmic footsteps. Jeff Bezos Blue Origin used Wednesdays anniversary to kick off an auction for a seat on the companys first crew spaceflight  a short Shepard-like hop launched by a rocket named New Shepard. The Texas liftoff is targeted for July 20, the date of the Apollo 11 moon landing.  Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic aims to kick off tourist flights next year, just as soon as he straps into his space-skimming, plane-launched rocketship for a test run from the New Mexico base. And Elon Musks SpaceX will launch a billionaire and his sweepstakes winners in September. That will be followed by a flight by three businessmen to the International Space Station in January. Weve always enjoyed this incredible thing called space, but we always want more people to be able to experience it as well, NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough said from the space station Wednesday. So I think this is a great step in the right direction. Its all rooted in Shepards 15-minute flight on May 5, 1961.  Shepard was actually the second person in space  the Soviet Union launched cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin three weeks earlier, to Shepards everlasting dismay.  The 37-year-old Mercury astronaut and Navy test pilot cut a slick sci-fi figure in his silver spacesuit as he stood in the predawn darkness at Cape Canaveral, looking up at his Redstone rocket. Impatient with all the delays, including another hold in the countdown just minutes before launch, he famously growled into his mic: Why dont you fix your little problem and light this candle? 
        
     His capsule, Freedom 7, soared to an altitude of 116 miles (186 kilometers) before parachuting into the Atlantic. Twenty days later, President John F. Kennedy committed to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely by decades end, a promise made good in July 1969 by Apollo 11s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.  Shepard, who died in 1998, went on to command Apollo 14 in 1971, becoming the fifth moonwalker  and lone lunar golfer. Since Gagarin and Shepards pioneering flights, 579 people have rocketed into space or reached its fringes, according to NASA. Nearly two-thirds are American and just over 20% Soviet or Russian. About 90% are male and most are white, although NASAs crews have been more diverse in recent decades.  A Black community college educator from Tempe, Arizona, sees her spot on SpaceXs upcoming private flight as a symbol. Sian Proctor uses the acronym J.E.D.I. for a just, equitable, diverse and inclusive space. NASA wasnt always on board with space tourism, but is today. Our goal is one day that everyones a space person, NASAs human spaceflight chief, Kathy Lueders said following Sundays splashdown of a SpaceX capsule with four astronauts. Were very excited to see it starting to take off.  Twenty years ago, NASA clashed with Russian space officials over the flight of the worlds first space tourist. California businessman Dennis Tito paid $20 million to visit the space station, launching atop a Russian rocket. Virginia-based Space Adventures arranged Titos weeklong trip, which ended May 6, 2001, as well as seven more tourist flights that followed. By opening up his checkbook, he kicked off an industry 20 yrs ago, Space Adventures co-founder Eric Anderson tweeted last week. Space is opening up more than it ever has, and for all. Theres already a line. A Russian actress and movie director are supposed to launch from Kazakhstan in the fall. Theyll be followed in December by Space Adventures two newest clients, also launching on a Russian Soyuz rocket. SpaceX will be next up in January with the three businessmen; the flight from Floridas Kennedy Space Center was arranged by Axiom Space, a Houston company run by former NASA employees. And as early as 2023, SpaceX is supposed to take a Japanese entrepreneur and his guests around the moon and back. While no fan of human spaceflight  he prefers robotic explorers  Duke University emeritus history professor Alex Roland acknowledges the emergence of spaceflight companies might be the most significant change in the last 60 years. Yet he wonders whether there will be much interest once the novelty wears off and the inevitable fatalities occur. Then theres the high price of admission. The U.S., Canadian and Israeli entrepreneurs flying SpaceX early next year are paying $55 million  each  for their 1 1/2-week mission. Virgin Galactics tickets cost considerably less for minutes versus days of weightlessness. Initially $250,000, the price is expected to go up once Bransons company starts accepting reservations again. Blue Origin declined Wednesday to give a ticket price for future sales and would not comment on who else  besides the auction winner  will be on board the capsule in July. A couple more crew flights, each lasting minutes, would follow by years end. As for SpaceXs private flight on a fully automated Dragon capsule, tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman wont say what hes paying. He considers his three-day flight a great responsibility and is taking no shortcuts in training; he took his crewmates hiking up Mount Rainier last weekend to toughen them up. If something does go wrong, it will set back every other persons ambition to go and become a commercial astronaut, Isaacman said recently. John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University, where he founded the Space Policy Institute, has mixed feelings about this shift from space exploration to adventure tourism. It takes the romance and excitement out of going to space, Logsdon said in an email this week. Instead of the dawn of a new era like so many have proclaimed, its more like the end of the era when space flight was special. I guess that is progress. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASA astronaut is released from the hospital after returning from space,"A NASA astronaut who was briefly hospitalized after returning from space has been released, the space agency said Saturday. NASAs Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Russias Alexander Grebenkin were flown to the hospital for additional medical checks Friday after parachuting into the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast aboard a SpaceX capsule. Three were released and returned to Houston. A NASA astronaut  who was not identified  was kept for observation for an unspecified medical issue. Citing patient privacy, the space agency declined to identify the astronaut or release details about their condition  other than to say the astronaut is in good health and would resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members. The crew arrived at the International Space Station in March and should have been back on Earth two months ago. But the return trip was delayed by Boeings new Starliner astronaut capsule and Hurricane Milton.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

EXPLAINER: The US investigation into COVID-19 origins,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Once dismissed by most public health experts and government officials, the hypothesis that COVID-19 leaked accidentally from a Chinese lab is now receiving scrutiny under a new U.S. investigation. Experts say the 90-day review ordered  on May 26 by President Joe Biden will push American intelligence agencies to collect more information and review what they already have. Former State Department officials under President Donald Trump have publicly pushed for further investigation into virus origins, as have scientists and the World Health Organization.  Many scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, say they still believe the virus most likely occurred in nature and jumped from animals to humans. Virus researchers have not publicly identified any key new scientific evidence that might make the lab-leak hypothesis more likely. Virologists also say it is unlikely that any definitive answer about virus origins will be possible in 90 days. The work to fully confirm origins and pathways of past viruses  such as the first SARS or HIV/AIDS  has taken years or decades. A look at what is known about the U.S. investigation of the virus. WHAT ARE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES REVIEWING? Biden ordered a review of what the White House said was an initial finding leading to two likely scenarios, an animal-to-human transmission or a lab leak. The White House statement says two agencies in the 18-member intelligence community lean toward the hypothesis of a transmission in nature; another agency leans toward a lab leak. 
        
     One document drawing new attention is a State Department fact sheet published in the last days of Trumps administration. The memo notes that the U.S. believes three researchers at a Wuhan, China, lab sought medical treatment for a respiratory illness in November 2019. However, the report is not conclusive: The origin and severity of the staffers illness is not known  and most people in China regularly go to hospitals, not primary-care physicians, for routine care. The memo also pointed to gain of function studies  which in theory could enhance the lethality or transmissibility of a virus  allegedly done at the Wuhan lab with U.S. backing. However, National Institutes of Health Director  Francis Collins has since adamantly denied that the U.S. supported any gain-of-function research on coronaviruses in Wuhan. David Feith, who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs under Trump, said he supported Bidens call for an enhanced review. Implicit in the presidents statement is that there is more to analyze and more to collect than has been analyzed or collected to date, Feith said.  The Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.  IS CHINA HAMPERING INVESTIGATIONS? The White House statement criticized China for a lack of transparency, echoing previous criticisms by Democrats and Republicans. The failure to get our inspectors on the ground in those early months will always hamper any investigation into the origin of COVID-19, the White House said. The Associated Press has reported  on Chinas interference in the World Health Organizations probes of the virus and its fanning  of conspiracy theories online. China has also forced journalists to leave the country in recent years and silenced or jailed whistleblowers from Wuhan and elsewhere.  The lack of transparency in China is a significant and familiar challenge. But that does not in itself signal that something in particular is being hidden.  The problem is when you make that announcement (Bidens call for investigation) in a highly politicized environment, it makes it even less likely that China will cooperate with efforts to find the origins of the virus, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. WHAT DO SCIENTISTS BELIEVE ABOUT VIRUS ORIGINS? The most compelling argument for investigating the possibility of a lab leak is not any new hard evidence, but rather the fact that another pathway for virus spread has not been 100% confirmed. The great probability is still that this virus came from a wildlife reservoir, said Arinjay Banerjee, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatchewan, Canada. He pointed to the fact that spillover events  when viruses jump from animals to humans  are common in nature, and that scientists already know of two similar beta coronaviruses that evolved in bats and caused epidemics when humans were infected, SARS1 and MERS. However, the case is not completely closed. There are probabilities, and there are possibilities, said Banerjee. Because nobody has identified a virus thats 100% identical to SARS-CoV-2 in any animal, there is still room for researchers to ask about other possibilities. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CONFIRM THE ORIGIN OF A VIRUS? Confirming with 100% certainty the origin of a virus is often not fast, easy, or always even possible.  For example, scientists never confirmed the origin of smallpox before the disease was eradicated through a global vaccination program.  In the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)  a disease caused by a beta coronavirus, like the current coronavirus  researchers first identified the virus in February 2003. Later that year, scientists discovered the likely  intermediary hosts: Himalayan palm  civets found at live-animal markets in Guangdong, China. But it wasnt until 2017 that researchers traced the likely original source of the virus to bat caves in Chinas Yunnan province. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN? From a scientific perspective, researchers are always keen to better understand how diseases evolve. From a public health perspective, if a virus has transitioned to being spread mostly by human-to-human contact, discovering its origins is not as essential to strategies for containing the disease.  Questions of origins and questions of disease control are not the same thing once human-to-human transmission has become common, said Deborah Seligsohn, an expert in environment and public health at Villanova University. Republicans have pressed for more inquiries into a possible lab leak as part of a broader effort to blame China and vindicate Trumps handling of the pandemic. Nearly 600,000 people in the United States have died of COVID-19, the highest toll of any country.  WHAY HAPPENS AFTER THE 90 DAYS? Many scientists caution that its unlikely a 90-day investigation will yield definitive new answers.  We rarely get a smoking gun, said Stephen Morse, a disease researcher at Columbia University. Even under the best of circumstances we rarely get certainty, just degrees of likelihood.  Any findings will likely be politically explosive, especially if new evidence comes to light supporting or dismissing the zoonotic transfer or lab-leak theory. And a failure to reach definitive conclusions, almost inevitable after a 90-day review, could provide grist for Trump supporters and opponents alike, as well as embolden conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile experts like the Council on Foreign Relations Huang suspect China may simply clamp down more, adding another complication to already tense relations. This will likely make it even more challenging to extract concessions from China to allow another team to visit Wuhan, or have unfettered access to investigate there, he said.",https://apnews.com/article/investigation-covid-origins-wuhan-lab-nature-850b7a6ee1005596bb0f8b2bc6b79dd5,science
Scientists hail golden age to trace bird migration with tech,"TAKOMA PARK, Md. (AP)  A plump robin wearing a tiny metal backpack with an antenna hops around a suburban yard in Takoma Park, then plucks a cicada from the ground for a snack. Ecologist Emily Williams watches through binoculars from behind a bush. On this clear spring day, shes snooping on his dating life. Now Im watching to see whether hes found a mate, she said, scrutinizing his interactions with another robin in a nearby tree.  Once the bird moves on at seasons end, shell rely on the backpack to beam frequent location data to the Argos satellite, then back to Williams laptop, to track it. The goal is to unravel why some American robins migrate long distances, but others do not. With more precise information about nesting success and conditions in breeding and wintering grounds, we should be able to tell the relative roles of genetics versus the environment in shaping why birds migrate, said Williams, who is based at Georgetown University.  Putting beacons on birds is not novel. But a new antenna on the International Space Station and receptors on the Argos satellite, plus the shrinking size of tracking chips and batteries, are allowing scientists to remotely monitor songbird movements in much greater detail than ever before. Were in a sort of golden age for bird research, said Adriaan Dokter, an ecologist at Cornell University who is not directly involved with Williams study. Its pretty amazing that we can satellite-track a robin with smaller and smaller chips. Ten years ago, that was unthinkable. 
        
     The device this robin is wearing can give precise locations, within about 30 feet (about 10 meters), instead of around 125 miles (200 kilometers) for previous generations of tags.  That means Williams can tell not only whether the bird is still in the city, but on which street or backyard. Or whether its flown from the Washington, D.C., suburbs to land on the White House lawn.  A second new tag, for only the heaviest robins, includes an accelerometer to provide information about the birds movements; future versions may also measure humidity and barometric pressure. These Icarus tags work with a new antenna on the International Space Station.  That antenna was first turned on about two years ago, but there were some glitches with the power-supply and the computer, so we had to bring it down again with a Russian rocket, then transport it from Moscow to Germany to fix it, said Martin Wikelski, director of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, whose scientific team is honing the technology. After the usual troubleshooting for space science, the antenna was turned back on this spring. As researchers deploy precision tags, Wikelski envisions the development of an Internet of animals  a collection of sensors around the world giving us a better picture of the movement of life on the planet. The American robin is an iconic songbird in North America, its bright chirp a harbinger of spring. Yet its migratory habits remain a bit mysterious to scientists. Its astounding how little we know about some of the most common songbirds, said Ken Rosenberg, a conservation scientist at Cornell University. We have a general idea of migration, a range map, but thats really just a broad impression. An earlier study Williams worked on showed some robins are long-distance migrants  flying more than 2,780 miles (4,480 km) between their breeding area in Alaska and winter grounds in Texas  while others hop around a single backyard most of the year. What factors drive some robins to migrate, while others dont? Does it have to do with available food, temperature fluctuations or success in mating and rearing chicks?  Williams hopes more detailed data from satellite tags, combined with records of nesting success, will provide insights, and shes working with partners who are tagging robins in Alaska, Indiana and Florida for a three-year study. Scientists have previously put GPS-tracking devices on larger raptors, but the technology has only recently become small and light enough for some songbirds. Tracking devices must be less than 5% of the animals weight to avoid encumbering them.  In a Silver Spring, Maryland, yard, Williams has unfurled nylon nets between tall aluminum poles. When a robin flies into the net, she delicately untangles the bird. Then she holds it in a banders grip  with her forefinger and middle finger loosely on either side of the birds neck, and another two fingers around its body.  On a tarp, she measures the robins beak length, takes a toenail clipping and plucks a tail feather to gauge overall health. Then she weighs the bird in a small cup on a scale. This one is about 80 grams, just over the threshold for wearing the penny-sized Argos satellite tag.  Williams fashions a makeshift saddle with clear jewelry cord looped around each of the birds legs. She then tightens the cord so the tag sits firmly on the birds back.  When she opens her hand, the robin hops to the ground, then takes a few steps under a pink azalea shrub before flying off.  In addition to providing very precise locations, the satellite tags transmit data that can be downloaded from afar onto Williams laptop. The data on older tags couldnt be retrieved unless the same bird was recaptured the following year  a difficult and uncertain task. Wikelski hopes the new technology will help scientists better understand threats birds and other creatures face from habitat loss, pollution and climate change.  It is detective work to try to figure out why a population is declining, said Ben Freeman, a biologist at the Biodiversity Research Centre at the University of British Columbia. Better information about migration corridors will help us look in the right places. A 2019 study co-written by Cornells Rosenberg showed that North Americas population of wild birds declined by nearly 30%, or 3 billion, since 1970. He said tracking birds will help explain why: Where in their annual cycles do migratory birds face the greatest threats? Is it exposure to pesticides in Mexico, the clearing of rainforests in Brazil, or is it what people are doing in their backyards here in the U.S.? ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter:@larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Sunrise special: Solar eclipse thrills worlds northern tier,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The top of the world got a sunrise special Thursday  a ring of fire solar eclipse.  This so-called annular eclipse began at the Canadian province of Ontario, then swept across Greenland, the North Pole and finally Siberia, as the moon passed directly in front of the sun. An annular eclipse occurs when a new moon is around its farthest point from us and appearing smaller, and so it doesnt completely blot out the sun when its dead center.  The upper portions of North America, Europe and Asia enjoyed a partial eclipse, at least where the skies were clear. At those locations, the moon appeared to take a bite out of the sun. It was the first eclipse of the sun visible from North America since August 2017, when a dramatic total solar eclipse crisscrossed the U.S. The next one is coming up in 2024. A total lunar eclipse graced the skies two weeks ago. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Venus hotter than ever: 3rd new robotic explorer on horizon,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Venus is hotter than ever, with a third new robotic explorer on the horizon.  A week after NASA announced two new missions to our closest neighbor, the European Space Agency said Thursday it will launch a Venus-orbiting spacecraft in the early 2030s. Named EnVision, the orbiter will attempt to explain why Venus is so wildly different from Earth, even though the two planets are similar in size and composition. NASA will provide EnVisions radar. NASAs own pair of upcoming missions to our solar systems hottest planet  called DaVinci Plus and Veritas  will be the first for the U.S. in more than 30 years. Theyll blast off sometime around 2028 to 2030. Its a Venus hat trick! tweeted NASAs top science chief, Thomas Zurbuchen. The Europeans have visited more recently, with their Venus Express in action around the hothouse planet until 2014. Japan has had an orbiter around Venus since 2015 to study the climate. Its a forbidding place: the thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere is home to sulfuric acid clouds. A new era in the exploration of our closest, yet wildly different, solar system neighbour awaits us, the European Space Agencys science director, Gunther Hasinger, said in a statement. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

UN: Dont forget to save species while fixing global warming,"To save the planet, the world needs to tackle the crises of climate change and species loss together, taking measures that fix both and not just one, United Nations scientists said. A joint  report Thursday by separate U.N. scientific bodies that look at climate change  and biodiversity loss found there are ways to simultaneously attack the two global problems, but some fixes to warming could accelerate extinctions of plants and animals. For example, measures such as expansion of bioenergy crops like corn, or efforts to pull carbon dioxide from the air and bury it, could use so much land  twice the size of India  that the impact would be fairly catastrophic on biodiversity, said co-author and biologist Almut Arneth at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Policy responses to climate change and biodiversity loss have long been siloed, with different government agencies responsible for each, said co-author Pamela McElwee, a human ecologist at Rutgers University.  The problems worsen each other, are intertwined and in the end hurt people, scientists said. Climate change and biodiversity loss are threatening human well-being as well as society, said report co-chair Hans-Otto Portner, a German biologist who helps oversee the impacts group of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Earths naturally changing climate shaped what life developed, including humans, but once people in the industrialized world started pumping fossil fuels into the air, that triggered cascading problems, Portner said. 
        
     Its a high time to fix what we got wrong, he said. The climate system is off-track and the biodiversity is suffering. There are many measures that can address both problems at once, the report said. Protecting and restoring high-carbon ecosystems, such as tropical forests and peatlands, should be high priority, said co-author Pete Smith, a plant and soil scientist at the University of Aberdeen.  While some climate solutions can increase species loss, scientists said efforts to curb extinctions dont really harm the climate. Yunne Shin, director of research at French National Research Institute, said the bulk of measures taken to protect biodiversity will also help curb climate change. While she applauded growing interest in nature-based solutions, she said, conservation measures must be accompanied by clear cuts in emissions. This report is an important milestone, said Simon Lewis, chairman of global change science at University College London, who was not part of the report.  Finally the worlds bodies that synthesize scientific information on two of the most profound 21st century crises are working together, he said. Halting biodiversity loss is even harder than phasing out fossil fuel use. ___ Read stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at https://apnews.com/hub/climate ___ Follow Seth Borenstein and Christina Larson on Twitter at @borenbears and @larsonchristina.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

For love of birds: Backyard sleuths boost scientists work,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Georgetown University ecologist Emily Williams first became fascinated with birds not because of their beauty, or their sweet songs. She was riveted by their extraordinary travels. Realizing that this tiny animal that can fit in the palm of your hand can travel thousands and thousands of miles one way in spring, and then does it again later in the year, was just amazing to me, she said. I have always been dazzled by migration. This spring and summer, her research project tracking the annual migration of American robins has gotten a boost from the enthusiasm of homeowners in the greater Washington area, whove let her and a research assistant set up makeshift research stations in their backyards before dawn  and sometimes contributed their own notes and observations.  Several homeowners have eagerly shown her where theyve discovered robins nests in their azalea bushes, or shared diaries theyve made on the movements of birds passing through their yards  not only robins, but also cardinals, blue jays, house wrens, tufted titmice, white-throated sparrows, even red-shouldered hawks.  Williams often begins her fieldwork at 4:30 a.m., but she can only be in one backyard at a time. And so her research, like that of many biologists, benefits from the cooperation and excitement of a growing number of citizen scientists  some of whom record their daily observations on Cornell Universitys popular bird-watching smartphone app, eBird.  People who love birds and report their sightings  thats really helping scientists learn in much greater detail about birds behavior and distribution, said Adriaan Dokter, an ecologist at Cornell.  
        
     Arjun Amar, a conservation biologist at the University of Cape Town, has even used photos uploaded by citizen scientists on Cornells platform as the foundation of new research projects  such as examining global variations in the stripes on peregrine falcons faces, which reduce solar glare and allow them to dive at breakneck speeds. This wouldnt have been so possible before, he said. The pandemic that put much of normal life on pause  stopping travel and shutting people in their homes  also afforded more time for many families to study the wildlife in their own backyards.  Cornells records show a boom in amateur bird-watching. The number of people submitting eBird checklists  recording their bird sightings  was up 37% in 2020 compared with the previous year. The annual big day event, when people are encouraged to submit sightings during spring migration (this year, on May 8), also set participation records.  Those numbers dont surprise Williams, who says many of her non-scientist friends have taken up bird-watching during the past year. Maybe youd have to travel to Alaska or Canada to see a grizzly bear, or go to Africa to see a zebra  but birds are literally right outside your door, anywhere you are in the world, she said. People have really started to pay more attention to their backyards because they had to stay home so much. I think its a huge boon for us as scientists, that more people appreciate birds. ___ One Good Thing is a series that highlights individuals whose actions provide glimmers of joy in hard times  stories of people who find a way to make a difference, no matter how small.

Winning auction bid to fly in space with Jeff Bezos: $28M,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  An auction for a ride into space next month alongside Jeff Bezos and his brother ended with a winning $28 million bid Saturday. The Amazon founders rocket company, Blue Origin, did not disclose the winners name following the live online auction. The identity will be revealed in a couple weeks  closer to the brief up-and-down flight from West Texas on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrins moon landing. It will be the first launch of Blue Origins New Shepard rocket with people on board, kicking off the companys space tourism business. Fifteen previous test flights of the reusable rocket and capsule since 2015  short hops lasting about 10 minutes  were all successful. Saturdays auction followed more than a month of online bidding that reached $4.8 million by Friday. More than 7,500 people from 159 countries registered to bid, according to Blue Origin. More than 20 bidders  the high rollers  took part in Saturdays auction.  Bezos announced Monday that he and his younger brother, Mark, would be on board New Shepards first crew flight; the news quickly boosted bidding. The winning amount is being donated to Blue Origins Club for the Future, an educational effort to promote science and tech among young people. The completely automated capsule can carry up to six passengers, each with their own big window. Blue Origins top sales director, Ariane Cornell, said following the auction that the fourth and final seat on the debut crew flight will be announced soon. Blue Origin has yet to open ticket sales to the public or divulge prices. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Computer trouble hits Hubble Space Telescope, science halted","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The Hubble Space Telescope has been hit with computer trouble, with all astronomical viewing halted, NASA said Wednesday. The orbiting observatory has been idle since Sunday when a 1980s-era computer that controls the science instruments shut down, possibly because of a bad memory board.  Flight controllers at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland tried to restart the computer Monday, but the same thing happened. Theyre now trying to switch to a backup memory unit. If that works, the telescope will be tested for a day, before the science instruments are turned back on and observations can resume. For now, the cameras and other instruments are in a so-called safe mode. Launched in 1990, Hubble is showing more and more signs of aging, despite a series of repairs and updates by spacewalking astronauts during NASAs shuttle era. The idled computer was installed during the fifth and final service call in 2009. NASA plans to launch Hubbles successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, in November. This observatory will be too far from Earth  1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away in a solar orbit  for astronaut tune-ups. The launch from French Guiana using Europes Ariane rocket is years behind schedule; the latest delay of two weeks is the result of rocket processing and scheduling issues. Scientists hope to have an overlap in orbit between Hubble and the considerably more advanced and powerful Webb. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Spacesuit problems prevent astronauts from completing job,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacesuit problems prevented astronauts from completing the installation Wednesday of powerful, new solar panels outside the International Space Station. NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough encountered a pair of spacesuit issues midway through the seven-hour spacewalk, forcing him to temporarily retreat back into the airlock to reset his equipment. The interruption put Kimbrough and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet an hour behind, then they had trouble trying to unfold the solar panels booms before time finally ran out. The two are supposed to venture back out Sunday. But its unclear whether that will be delayed, or whether the astronauts will wrap up work on the first solar panel or get started on a second one.  NASA wants to reenergize the aging space station as demand to visit grows. But theres no urgency to do so, said Mission Control commentator Rob Navias, with the old solar panels providing plenty of power for now. Theyll continue to operate in a degraded state, even after the new ones are up and running. Mission Control stressed that Kimbrough was safe the entire time, despite problems with his suits display control panel and a fleeting pressure spike in the cooling system. His control panel came back on, and Mission Control continued to monitor his suits cooling system.  We just want to be super safe here, Mission Control radioed. 
        
     It was the first of a series of spacewalks to equip the aging orbital outpost with six smaller but stronger solar wings. The electrical boost is needed to accommodate the paying passengers expected to drop by, beginning with a Russian film crew this fall.  NASA put extra safety precautions in place as Kimbrough and Pesquet worked on the stations primary power grid, to avoid an electrical shock. The duo conducted the most hazardous parts of the spacewalk on the nighttime side of Earth, to prevent the stations old solar panels from soaking up sunlight and generating power. Metal surfaces on their spacesuits were covered to avoid any contact. Launched by SpaceX earlier this month, the first of these new solar panels will operate alongside the stations oldest electricity-producing wings, in continuous operation for more than 20 years.  The astronauts had to lug the bundled solar wing 10 feet long and 4 feet wide (3 meters long by 1 meter wide)  to the work site on the far left end of the station. They managed to bolt it into place, but could not unfold the booms because of a problem in the mounting bracket. Once properly installed, the solar panel is designed to roll out like a red carpet 63 feet (19 meters) in length. NASA wants to keep the space station churning out science research through this decade, and space tourists will further tax the power system. A Russian movie director and actress are due to visit in October for filming, followed by wealthy entrepreneurs launching from Kazakhstan and Cape Canaveral as part of a push to open up the private space market. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Russian space officials say air leak at International Space Station poses no danger to its crew,"MOSCOW (AP)  Russian space officials on Wednesday acknowledged a continuing air leak from the Russian segment of the International Space Station, but said it poses no danger to its crew. The Roscosmos state corporation said that specialists were monitoring the leak and the crew regularly conducts work to locate and fix possible spots of the leak. There is no threat to the crew or the station itself, it said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.  Roscosmos statement followed comments by Joel Montalbano, NASAs station project manager, who noted Wednesday that the leak in the Russian segment has increased but emphasized that it remains small and poses no threat to the crews safety or vehicle operations.  As the space outpost is aging, the crew has to spend more time to repair and maintain it, Roscosmos said.. Russian space officials first reported a leak in the Zvezda module in August 2020 and later that year Russian crew members located what they believed was its source and tried to fix it. In November 2021, another potentially leaky spot was found in a different part of the Russian section of the station. Both Roscosmos and NASA have said the leak posed no danger to the crew and didnt impact operations on the station. There have been other glitches too. In October, coolant leaked from an external backup radiator for Russias new science lab Nauka (Science), although its main thermal control system was working normally and space officials said the crew and the station werent in danger. 
        
     That incident followed coolant leaks from Russian spacecraft parked at the station. In December 2022, coolant leaked from a Soyuz crew capsule docked to the station, and another similar leak from a Progress supply ship was discovered in February 2023. A Russian investigation concluded that those leaks likely resulted from hits by tiny meteoroids, not manufacturing flaws. The space station, which has served as a symbol of post-Cold War international cooperation, is now one of the last remaining areas of cooperation between Russia and the West amid the tensions over Moscows military action in Ukraine. NASA and its partners hope to continue operating the orbiting outpost until 2030. The stations current crew consists of NASA astronauts Jasmin Moghbeli and Loral OHara, the European Space Agencys Andreas Mogensen, Russian cosmonauts Konstantin Borisov, Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub and Japanese astronaut Satoshi Furukawa.",https://apnews.com/article/international-space-station-leak-f3a282a0cd6c78f59328f4ee1d722e42,science
Take 2: Spacewalking astronauts install new solar panel,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts equipped the International Space Station with the first in a series of powerful new solar panels Sunday, overcoming suit problems and other obstacles with muscle and persistence. It took two spacewalks for French astronaut Thomas Pesquet and NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough to install and unfurl the panel to its full 63 feet (19 meters) in length. The solar wing unrolled like a red carpet once the final set of bolts was released, relying solely on pent-up energy. The slow but steady extension took 10 minutes, with station cameras providing live TV views.  It is beautiful, Pesquet called out. Well done, both of you, Mission Control replied once the operation was complete. That was great to see. As the 6 1/2-hour spacewalk concluded, Kimbrough, who has three children, wished Happy Fathers Day to all the flight controller dads. Thanks for working with us on a Sunday. The astronauts started Sundays spacewalk picking up where they left off Wednesday, when a string of problems prevented them from unrolling the high-tech solar panel. Remember: You are butterflies with biceps today, astronaut Megan McArthur radioed from inside. After pushing and tugging, the spacewalkers managed to unfold and align the solar panel so both halves were now end to end, resembling a roll of paper towels. Their shout of Woo-hoo! was met with applause in Mission Control. 
        
     The two had to wait until they were back on the night side of Earth  and the stations old solar panels were no longer soaking up sunlight and generating power  before making the final power connections. Otherwise, they could be shocked. While awaiting darkness, the camera-and-light assembly on Kimbroughs helmet came loose, even though hed switched to a different suit to avoid the trouble he encountered last time. Pesquet did his best to secure it with wire ties, as the minutes ticked by. His effort paid off, and the final step  the actual unfurling  went off without a hitch. This new solar wing  with five more to come  will give the aging station a much needed electrical boost, as demand for experiments and space tourists grows. NASA originally allotted two spacewalks for the job  one for each solar panel being installed. But managers added a third spacewalk, given all the earlier problems. Pesquet and Kimbrough will go back out Friday to complete work on the second panel delivered by Space X earlier this month. This first pair will augment the space stations oldest solar wings, which are degrading after 20 years of continuous operation. SpaceX will deliver two more pairs over the next year. Although smaller than the originals, the new solar panels supplied by Boeing can generate considerably more power. The space station needs this reenergizing if NASA hopes to keep the space station running the rest of this decade, with private guests paying millions of dollars to come aboard. A Russian film crew is scheduled to launch to the orbiting outpost this fall from Kazakhstan, followed by a string of rich businessmen. SpaceX is providing the rides from Cape Canaveral. On Wednesday, the display control panel on Kimbroughs suit conked out and he had to return to the air lock to reset it. Then his cooling system registered a momentary pressure spike. Engineers are still evaluating what went wrong. Space is hard, Kimbrough tweeted last week. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Dirty laundry in space? NASA, Tide tackle cleaning challenge","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  How do astronauts do laundry in space? They dont. They wear their underwear, gym clothes and everything else until they cant take the filth and stink anymore, then junk them. NASA wants to change that  if not at the International Space Station, then the moon and Mars  and stop throwing away tons of dirty clothes every year, stuffing them in the trash to burn up in the atmosphere aboard discarded cargo ships. So its teamed up with Procter & Gamble Co. to figure out how best to clean astronauts clothes in space so they can be reused for months or even years, just like on Earth. The Cincinnati company announced Tuesday that it will send a pair of Tide detergent and stain removal experiments to the space station later this year and next, all part of the galactic battle against soiled and sweaty clothes. Its no small problem, especially as the U.S. and other countries look to establish bases on the moon and Mars. Rocket cargo space is tight and expensive, according to NASA, so why waste it on new outfits if their clothes could be kept looking and smelling fresh? When you figure an astronaut needs 150 pounds (68 kilograms) of clothes in space per year, that quickly adds up, especially on a three-year Mars mission, said Mark Sivik, a chemist specializing in fabric and home care technology for P&G. Theres also the health  and ick  factors. 
        
     Space station astronauts exercise two hours every day to counter the muscle- and bone-withering effects of weightlessness, quickly leaving their workout clothes sweaty, smelly and stiff. Their T-shirts, shorts and socks end up so foul that they run through a pair every week, according to Leland Melvin, a former NASA astronaut and NFL player. After that, theyre deemed toxic, said Melvin, whos serving as a spokesman for the project. They like have a life of their own. Theyre so stiff from all that sweat.  While NASA and the other space station partners have looked into special antimicrobial clothes to prolong wear, its not a long-term solution.  In its initial experiment, P&G will send up detergent custom-made for space in December so scientists can see how the enzymes and other ingredients react to six months of weightlessness. Then next May, stain-removal pens and wipes will be delivered for testing by astronauts.  At the same time, P&G is developing a washer-dryer combo that could operate on the moon or even Mars, using minimal amounts of water and detergent. Such a machine could also prove useful in arid regions here on Earth. One of the many design challenges: The laundry water would need to be reclaimed for drinking and cooking, just like urine and sweat are currently recycled aboard the space station. The best solutions come from the most diverse teams, Melvin said, and how more diverse can you be than Tide and NASA?  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Biden signs bill to study salt lakes in drought-hit US West,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Scientists will get $25 million to study salt lake ecosystems in the drought-stricken U.S. West, as President Joe Biden signed legislation Tuesday allocating the funds in the face of unprecedented existential threats caused by the lack of water. The funding allows the United States Geological Survey to study the hydrology of the ecosystems in and around Utahs Great Salt Lake, Californias Mono Lake, Oregons Lake Albert and other saline lakes. Amid a decadeslong drought, less snowmelt has flowed through the rivers that feed into the lakes, causing shorelines to recede and lake levels to plummet.  Dwindling lake levels jeopardize the people, animals and businesses that rely on maintaining the ecosystem. The lakes often serve as critical habitats for migratory birds. Dust exposed by receding water levels can be blown into the air and have dangerous health effects on surrounding communities. And further depletion threatens the canals and infrastructure that a multi-million dollar mining industry needs to extract salts from the lakes. In Utah, the Great Salt Lake shrunk to its lowest point in recorded history, posing threats to economic output, snowpack, public health and wildlife. Ski resorts worry about a future without lake effect snow. State lawmakers and local water district officials have committed to funding and incentivizing conservation efforts, yet development, population growth and enduring agricultural demand continue to strain the water supply needed to maintain the lake. In eastern California, state officials have dramatically curtailed the amount Los Angeles can divert from the creeks and tributaries that feed Mono Lake in the eastern Sierras. Diminishing lake levels have for years made the water saltier, jeopardizing bird, fish and brine shrimp habitats. 
        
     The legislation signed on Tuesday establishes what it calls a Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States Assessment and Monitoring Program to examine variables such as water use and demand and climatic stressors. Marcelle Shoop, the Saline Lakes Program Director for the Audubon Society, said in a statement that the funding would complement existing conservation efforts. The Great Salt Lake and the network of saline lake ecosystems in the arid West face very serious challenges with increasingly low water levels, placing local communities and millions of migratory birds at risk, she said. Although the legislations sponsors  senators and congressmen from throughout the West  lauded the effort and said they hoped the studies would inform solutions, the program does not mandate any conservation measures or institute new water management guidelines. These ecosystems must be protected, but we cant do that without sufficient data, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the bills sponsor, said in a statement. The bill adds to $40 million that Utah lawmakers allocated to the Great Salt Lake for watershed enhancement programs this year and supplements $10 million in Army Corps of Engineers funding for the saline lakes passed as part of a defense spending bill.",https://apnews.com/article/utah-state-government-oregon-california-climate-and-environment-environmental-conservation-1d337599b8103ac3cb6974795ae3d7c5,science
Brazil authorities probe Amazon ties to capital attacks,"SAO PAULO (AP)  On the edge of Brazils Amazon rainforest, the Rovaris family is a symbol of a pioneering success story.  The family arrived in the state of Mato Grosso in the 1970s as part of a wave of agricultural expansion promoted by the countrys then-military dictatorship. In a short span, the Rovaris clan accumulated vast wealth as agronomists figured out how to successfully grow soy in the hostile tropical climate. Now, the familys scion, Atilio Rovaris, is being investigated in the sprawling criminal probe into how supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro tried to subvert Brazils democracy when they blocked highways right after the election and temporarily took over several government buildings in the capital of Brasilia in early January. Bolsonaro lost Octobers election to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a result that many Bolsonaro supporters dont accept.  Much of the investigation is centered along the northern stretch of highway BR-163, built in the 1970s. It connects two of Bolsonaros most substantial support bases. In Mato Grosso, these are Rovaris and other businesspeople from wealthy cities such as Sorriso, Brazils largest soybean producer. In Para, they are land-grabbers, illegal gold miners, and loggers who sustain impoverished cities such as Novo Progresso, 700 km (438 miles) north of Sorriso.   
        
     Days after the failed takeover, Justice Minister Flvio Dino said that agribusiness sectors were among the leading financiers. And Environment Minister Marina Silva said some of the rioters were linked to criminal activities in the Amazon. 
        
     A significant portion of the enraged crowd were individuals who, under the Bolsonaro government, believed their criminal activities, such as deforestation, land grabbing, illegal logging, illegal fishing, and illegal mining, would go unpunished, Silva told daily Folha de S.Paulo a few days after the Jan. 8 attack.  Bolsonaro won by big margins in population centers along the highway, as many people in theses areas share his view that Brazil needs to push economic growth by rolling back environmental regulations aimed at slowing deforestation. They deem conservation units and Indigenous territories as barriers that undermine agribusiness. Protected areas in the region are reeling from invasions from cattle farmers, loggers and gold miners. That so much support for Bolsonaro came from these areas could complicate Lulas promise to reach zero deforestation in the Amazon, as such efforts will require the buy in of locals and must be joined with sustainable forms of development.  Rovaris, an amateur rally car driver, has made no secret of his support for Bolsonaro. He was one of the biggest donors to his presidential campaign, contributing close to $100,000, according to public election data.  Although no evidence in the fledgling probe has emerged publicly tying him to the rioters who vandalized Brazils presidential palace and congress, he is being investigating for alleged support of protests that blocked major highways for weeks in attempts to restore Bolsonaro to power after the lost the elections in October.  In November, a bank account belonging to a trucking company that Rovaris owns was one of 43 frozen by the Supreme Court as part of an investigation into possible crimes against Brazils democracy. In total, 30 of the frozen accounts belonged to individuals or companies from Mato Grosso  a sign of how deep support for Bolsonaro remains in one of Brazils key economic hubs. There is a repeated abuse of the right of assembly, directed illicitly and criminally, to propagate non-compliance and disrespect for the result of the election for president, Justice Alexandre de Moraes wrote in the ruling. Rovaris merely supported Bolsonaro in the campaign and had no involvement in anti-democratic acts, Larissa Gribler, his spokesperson, told The Associated Press. Gribler said Rovaris declined to answer further questions or give an interview.  During his first term as president, between 2003 and 2006, Lula started paving BR-163, a job later completed by Bolsonaro. As part of the environmental licensing to authorize the paving, conservation units were created along the highway. The goal was to close the agriculture border to prevent uncontrolled deforestation, as had happened in Mato Grosso. In the Novo Progresso region in Para state, these conservation units have been largely invaded by land-grabbers, who have fought to annul them. The most prominent example is Jamanxin National Forest, the most deforested federal conservation unit in the Amazon. A roadblock there lasted several days in November. Footage shows police cars being attacked with stones by an angry mob and a felled Brazil Nuts tree, a protected species, across the road. According to local press reports, about 30 Novo Progresso residents were arrested in Brasilia following the attack. Those included the owner of a sawmill. The city relies on illegal activities such as illegal gold mining, illegally harvested wood, cattle raised in off-limits areas within conservation units, and land grabbing, said Mauricio Torres, a geographer from Para Federal University. Bolsonaro supported these illegal activities. And the people are willing to kill and die for it because they have no other option. So I dont know how Lula will be able to implement the rule of law, he added. That is a different situation from Sorriso, where initial deforestation and land-grabbing were legalized decades ago, and the economy depends on soybean exports, Torres said. Just as the profile of the Amazonian strongholds for Bolsonaro differ, combatting deforestation will require different approaches, depending on the place, according to deforestation experts.  Lulas administration will have to act on many fronts, said Brenda Brito from Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, a group focused on sustainable development in the Amazon. It will have to reverse court decisions that have favored land-grabbers inside conservation units and a offer wide range of economic incentives, from forest land concessions to supporting ecotourism.  Otherwise, even if we manage to remove invaders, the protected areas will be invaded again, she said.  ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

China says its ready to launch the next crew to its orbiting space station early Wednesday,"JIUQUAN, China (AP)  China said all systems are ready to launch the next crew to its orbiting space station early Wednesday, the latest mission to make the country a major space power. The two men and one woman will replace the astronauts whove lived on the Tiangong space station for the last six months.  The new mission commander, Cai Xuzhe, went to space in the Shenzhou-14 mission in 2022, while the other two, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, are first-time space travelers both born in the 1990s.  Song was an air force pilot and Wang an engineer with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation who will be the crews payload specialist. Wang will be the third Chinese woman aboard a crewed mission. The three appeared at a brief news conference Tuesday behind protective glass, declaring their intention to carry out their scientific projects on the space station and bring pride to the fatherland.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) The Shenzhou-19 spaceship carrying the trio is due to launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket, the backbone of Chinas crewed space missions. Launch time is set for 4:27 a.m., according to the space agencys spokesperson Lin Xiqiang. China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to the United States concerns over the programs complete control by the Peoples Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Partys military arm.  Besides putting a space station into orbit, the space agency has landed an explorer on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so. It also plans to build a research station on the moon. The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S.  still the leader in space exploration  and others, including Japan and India. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years, though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) During the upcoming mission, the space station will receive resupplies from an uncrewed craft, aiding them in performing space walks and replacing and installing equipment to protect the Tiangong station from space debris, some of which was created by China.  According to NASA, large pieces of debris have been created by satellite explosions and collisions. Chinas firing of a rocket to destroy a redundant weather satellite in 2007 and the accidental collision of American and Russian communications satellites in 2009 greatly increased the amount of large debris in orbit, it said. The Shenzhou-19 astronauts will complete in-orbit rotation with the Shenzhou-18 trio and stay at the space station for approximately six months, witnessing the arrival of the Tianzhou-8 cargo craft and Shenzhou-20 crewed spaceship during the mission. Many tasks await the new crew: conducting space science and application tests, performing extravehicular activities, installing protective devices against space debris, and installing and recycling extravehicular payloads and equipment. They will also engage in science education, public welfare activities and other payload tests. The Shenzhou-19 astronauts are scheduled to return to the Dongfeng landing site in north Chinas Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in late April or early May next year, according to the agency. Lin, the spokesman, said China has measures in place in the event that the astronauts must return earlier.  China launched its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the former Soviet Union and the United States. The space program is a source of enormous national pride and a hallmark of Chinas technological advances over the past two decades.  China is looking toward further foreign cooperation in space and is in talks with partners to train astronauts and transport them to Tiangong, Lin said Tuesday.",https://apnews.com/article/china-space-station-crewed-mission-shenzhou-f85181be7ae5bfb309e119c087bf468e,science

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Besides putting a space station into orbit, the Chinese space agency has landed an explorer on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so. It also plans to build a research station on the moon and has already transferred rock and soil samples from the moon in a first for any nation in decades, and placed a rover on the little-explored far side of the moon in a global first. The U.S. still leads in space exploration and plans to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years, though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year. The new Chinese crew will perform spacewalks and install new equipment to protect the station from space debris, some of which was created by China. According to NASA, large pieces of debris have been created by satellite explosions and collisions. Chinas firing of a rocket to destroy a redundant weather satellite in 2007 and the accidental collision of American and Russian communications satellites in 2009 greatly increased the amount of large debris in orbit, it said. Chinas space authorities say they have measures in place in case their astronauts have to return to Earth earlier.  China launched its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the former Soviet Union and the United States. The space program is a source of enormous national pride and a hallmark of Chinas technological advances over the past two decades.  ___ Associated Press producer Caroline Chen contributed to this report.",https://apnews.com/article/china-space-launch-new-crew-eeb0d5ca1f7dd080918cc8942511601f,science
Marsquakes offer detailed look at red planets interior,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A quake-measuring device on Mars is providing the first detailed look at the red planets interior, revealing a surprisingly thin crust and a hot molten core beneath the frigid surface.  In a series of articles published this week, scientists reported that the Martian crust is within the thickness range of Earths. The Martian mantle between the crust and core is roughly half as thick as Earths. And the Martian core is on the high side of what scientists anticipated, although smaller than the core of our own nearly twice-as-big planet. These new studies confirm that the Martian core is molten. But more research is needed to know whether Mars has a solid inner core like Earths, surrounded by a molten outer core, according to the international research teams. Stronger marsquakes could help identify any multiple core layers, scientists said Friday. The findings are based on about 35 marsquakes registered by a French seismometer on NASAs InSight stationary lander, which arrived at Mars in 2018. The domed seismometer has actually detected 733 marsquakes so far, but the 35 with magnitudes from 3.0 to 4.0 served as the basis for these studies. Most of the sizable quakes originated in a volcanic region 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away where lava may have flowed just millions of years ago. Mark Panning of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who took part in the crust study, said even the biggest marsquakes are so weak they would barely be felt on Earth. Hes hoping for the big one which would make it easier to process the data and define the Martian interior. 
        
     Fingers crossed, we would love to see some bigger events, Panning said. Current measurements show Mars crust possibly reaching as deep as 12 miles to 23 miles (20 kilometers to 37 kilometers); the mantle extending down nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers); and the relatively lightweight core with a radius of 1,137 miles (1,830 kilometers).  By comparison, Earths crust ranges from a few miles (kilometers) beneath the oceans to more than 45 miles (70 kilometers) beneath the Himalayas. Earth is almost double the size of Mars. By going from cartoon understanding of what the inside of Mars looks like, putting real numbers on it ... we are able to really expand the family tree of understanding how our solar systems rocky planet formed, Panning said. Its mission extended by another two years, InSight has been hit with a power crunch in recent months. Dust covered its solar panels, just as Mars was approaching the farthest point in its orbit around the sun.  Flight controllers have boosted power by using the landers robot arm to release sand into the blowing wind to knock off some of the dust on the panels. The seismometer has continued working, but all other science instruments remain on hiatus because of the power situation  except for a German heat probe was declared dead in January after it failed to burrow more than a couple feet (half a meter) into the planet.

First sign of animal life on Earth may be a sponge fossil,"WASHINGTON (AP)  A Canadian geologist may have found the earliest fossil record of animal life on Earth, according to a report published  Wednesday in the journal Nature.  Around a billion years ago, a region of northwest Canada now defined by steep mountains  was a prehistoric marine environment where the remains of ancient sponges may be preserved in mineral sediment, the paper says. Geologist Elizabeth Turner discovered the rocks in a remote region of the Northwest Territories accessible only by helicopter, where she has been excavating since the 1980s. Thin sections of rock contain three-dimensional structures that resemble modern sponge skeletons.  I believe these are ancient sponges  only this type of organism has this type of network of organic filaments, said Joachim Reitner, a geobiologist and expert in sponges at Germanys University of Gottingen, who was not involved in the research.  The dating of adjacent rock layers indicates the samples are about 890 million years old, which would make them about 350 million years older than the oldest undisputed sponge fossils previously found.  Whats most stunning is the timing, said Paco Cardenas, an expert on sponges at Swedens Uppsala University, who was not involved in the research. To have discovered sponge fossils from close to 900 million years ago will greatly improve our understanding of early animal evolution. 
        
     Many scientists believe the first animal groups included soft sponges or sponge-like creatures that lack muscles and nerves but have other features of simple animals, including cells with differentiated functions and sperm.  To be sure, theres very little scientific consensus or certainty about anything dating back a billion years ago, so other researchers will likely continue to vet and debate Turners findings.  I think shes got a pretty strong case. I think this is very worthy of publishing  it puts the evidence out there for other people to consider, said David Bottjer, a paleobiologist at University of Southern California, who was not involved in the research.  Scientists believe life on Earth emerged around 3.7 billion years ago. The earliest animals appeared much later, but exactly when is still debated.  Until now, the oldest undisputed fossil sponges date to around 540 million years ago, an era called the Cambrian period.  But scientists using a line of reasoning called the molecular clock   where they analyze the rate of genetic mutations to backdate when two species likely diverged  say that available evidence points to sponges emerging much earlier, around a billion years ago.  Yet no supporting physical evidence has yet been found until now. This would be the first time that a sponge fossil has been found from before the Cambrian, and not only before, but way before  thats whats most exciting, said Uppsala Universitys Cardenas, adding that the research seems to confirm the molecular clock estimates. Fossil evidence is scant before the Cambrian period when animals first developed hard skeletons, exoskeletons and shells, which are more likely to be preserved.  Those kinds of fossils belong to more complicated animals  obviously there has to be a back history of simpler animals like sponges emerging first, said the papers author Turner, who is based at Laurentian University in Ontario.  The dating of 890 million years ago is significant because, if the sponges identification is confirmed, it shows that the first animals evolved before a time when oxygen in the atmosphere and ocean reached a level scientists once thought was necessary for animal life. Yet recent research shows that some sponges can survive with very little oxygen. Everything on Earth has an ancestor. Its always been predicted that the first evidence of animal life would be small and cryptic, a very subtle clue, said Roger Summons, an MIT geobiologist who was not involved in the research.  ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Mars rover comes up empty in 1st try at getting rock sample,"WASHINGTON (AP)  NASAs newest Mars rover came up empty Friday in its first attempt to pick up a rock sample to eventually be brought back to Earth. The rover Perseverance drilled into the floor of the planets Jezero Crater to extract a finger-sized sample from slabs of flat rocks. The drill seemed to work as intended, but it appeared no rock made it into the sample tube, the agency said Friday.  Engineers were working to figure out what happened. While this is not the hole-in-one we hoped for, there is always risk with breaking new ground, said NASAs science mission chief Thomas Zurbuchen.  The next step will be using a camera mounted on a robotic arm to inspect inside the hole and see whats down there, said NASA project scientist Ken Farley. He said they might see the broken rock core, or might discover the sample had turned to sand. The rock properties might be different than we expected, he said. Its a bit deflating because this whole complicated piece of machinery worked fine, the engineering worked just fine, but it seems Mars didnt cooperate, Farley said, adding that he didnt see the glitch as a long-term problem. We will persevere. NASA aims to collect up to 31 samples in tubes and stash them for pickup in about a decade. Plans call for the samples to be brought to Earth in the early 2030s in another mission with the European Space Agency. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Space station supplies launched with a pizza delivery for 7,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Northrop Grummans latest space station delivery includes pizza for seven. The companys Cygnus cargo ship rocketed away from Virginias eastern shore Tuesday. It should reach the International Space Station on Thursday.  The 8,200-pound (3,700-kilogram) shipment includes fresh apples, tomatoes and kiwi, along with a pizza kit and cheese smorgasbord for the seven station astronauts.  Also flying: a mounting bracket for new solar wings launching to the orbiting lab next year, a material simulating moon dust and dirt that will be used to create items from the space stations 3D printer, slime mold for a French educational experiment called Blob and an infrared-detecting device meant as a prototype for future tracking satellites. It is Northrop Grummans 16th supply run for NASA and its biggest load yet. The companys Antares rocket hoisted the capsule from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility. Aloha to the S.S. Ellison Onizuka, Northrop Grumman said via Launch Control minutes before liftoff. The capsule was named for Hawaiis Onizuka, the first Asian American in space who died in the 1986 Challenger launch disaster. NASAs other shipper, SpaceX, will follow with a cargo run in a few weeks. The space station is currently home to three Americans, two Russians, one French and one Japanese. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASA blames Mars rover sampling fiasco on bad, powdery rock","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is blaming unusually soft rock for last weeks sampling fiasco on Mars.  The Perseverance rover came up empty after attempting to collect its first core sample on the red planet for eventual return to Earth. Data beamed back last Friday showed that the rover drilled to the proper depth of nearly 3 inches (8 centimeters), and pictures of the borehole looked good. But it quickly became clear the sample tube was empty.  Since then, engineers have determined the rock was not strong enough to produce a core sample, and the small, powdery fragments remained in the hole or ended up in the cuttings pile  or both. So the rover is moving on to the next sampling site in its quest for signs of ancient Martian life; it should arrive there by early next month. Imaging by the rover and its companion helicopter, Ingenuity, show the sedimentary rock should be much better for sampling there, Louise Jandura, chief engineer for Perseverances sampling campaign, said Wednesday. The hardware performed as commanded but the rock did not cooperate this time, Jandura wrote in an online update.  It reminds me yet again of the nature of exploration, she said. A specific result is never guaranteed no matter how much you prepare. NASA is looking to collect about 35 samples that would be returned via future spacecraft in a decade. Its not the first time that a Mars lander has run into ground resistance. A German digger on NASAs InSight lander failed to burrow more than a couple feet, far short of its target. The clumping soil didnt provide enough friction for the heat-measuring device, and experimenters gave up in January. 
        
     The little helicopter, Ingenuity, meanwhile, is still wowing its team. Its completed 11 test flights, the latest one lasting more than two minutes, and even conducted aerial surveys of Jezero Crater. Thats the ancient river delta where Perseverance and its hitchhiking chopper landed in February, following a nearly seven-month flight from Earth. Scientists believe the area would have been prime for microscopic life billions of years ago, if it existed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Higher but still slim odds of asteroid Bennu slamming Earth,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The good news is that scientists have a better handle on asteroid Bennus whereabouts for the next 200 years. The bad news is that the space rock has a slightly greater chance of clobbering Earth than previously thought. But dont be alarmed: Scientists reported Wednesday that the odds are still quite low that Bennu will hit us in the next century. We shouldnt be worried about it too much, said Davide Farnocchia, a scientist with NASAs Center for Near Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who served as the studys lead author. While the odds of a strike have risen from 1-in-2,700 to 1-in-1,750 over the next century or two, scientists now have a much better idea of Bennus path thanks to NASAs Osiris-Rex spacecraft, according to Farnocchia.  So I think that overall, the situation has improved, he told reporters.  The spacecraft is headed back to Earth on a long, roundabout loop after collecting samples from the large, spinning rubble pile of an asteroid, considered one of the two most hazardous known asteroids in our solar system. The samples are due here in 2023. Before Osiris-Rex arrived at Bennu in 2018, telescopes provided solid insight into the asteroid, about one-third of a mile (one-half kilometer) in diameter. The spacecraft collected enough data over 2 1/2 years to help scientists better predict the asteroids orbital path well into the future.  
        
     Their findings  published in the journal Icarus  should also help in charting the course of other asteroids and give Earth a better fighting chance if and when another hazardous space rock heads our way. Before Osiris-Rex arrived on the scene, scientists put the odds of Bennu hitting Earth through the year 2200 at 1-in-2,700. Now its 1-in-1,750 through the year 2300. The single most menacing day is Sept. 24, 2182. Bennu will have a close encounter with Earth in 2135 when it passes within half the distance of the moon. Earths gravity could tweak its future path and put it on a collision course with Earth in the 2200s  less likely now based on Osiris-Rex observations. If Bennu did slam into Earth, it wouldnt wipe out life, dinosaur-style, but rather create a crater roughly 10 to 20 times the size of the asteroid, said Lindley Johnson, NASAs planetary defense officer. The area of devastation would be much bigger: as much as 100 times the size of the crater. If an object Bennus size hit the Eastern Seaboard, it would pretty much devastate things up and down the coast, he told reporters. Scientists already are ahead of the curve with Bennu, which was discovered in 1999. Finding threatening asteroids in advance increases the chances and options for pushing them out of our way, Johnson said.  One-hundred years from now, who knows what the technology is going to be? he said. In November, NASA plans to launch a mission to knock an asteroid off-course by hitting it. The experimental target will be the moonlet of a bigger space rock. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Boeing astronaut capsule grounded for months by valve issue,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Boeings astronaut capsule is grounded for months and possibly even until next year because of a vexing valve problem.  Boeing and NASA officials said Friday that the Starliner capsule will be removed from the top of its rocket and returned to its Kennedy Space Center hangar for more extensive repairs.  Starliner was poised to blast off on a repeat test flight to the International Space Station last week  carrying a mannequin but no astronauts  when the trouble arose. A similar capsule was plagued by software issues in 2019 that prevented it from reaching the space station. Were obviously disappointed, said John Vollmer, vice president and program manager of Boeings commercial crew program. We will fly this test when were ready to fly it and its safe to do so. Kathy Lueders, head of NASAs human exploration office, said its another example of why these demo missions are so very important to us ... to make sure we have the system wrung out before we put our crews on. Boeings performance is in stark contrast to that of SpaceX, NASAs other contracted taxi service. SpaceX has flown 10 astronauts to the space station in just over a year, with four more due to launch aboard the companys Dragon capsule at the end of October. Elon Musks company will mark another first next month when it launches a billionaire into orbit with three guests, two of them contest winners.  Vollmer said moisture in the air somehow infiltrated 13 valves in the capsules propulsion system. That moisture combined with a corrosive fuel-burning chemical that had gotten past seals, preventing the valves from opening as required before the Aug. 3 launch attempt. 
        
     As of Friday, nine of the valves had been fixed. The other four require more invasive work. Rain from a severe thunderstorm penetrated some of the capsules thrusters at the pad, but engineers do not believe that is the same moisture that caused the valves to stick. Engineers are trying to determine how and when the moisture got there; it could have been during assembly or much later, Vollmer said. The 13 in question are among dozens of valves that are tied into thrusters needed to get the capsule into the proper orbit and to the space station, and to also re-enter the atmosphere at flights end. All the valves worked fine five weeks earlier and performed well in the 2019 test flight, Vollmer said. Vollmer said its too soon to know whether the valves will need to be replaced or even redesigned. Aerojet Rocketdyne supplied the valves, along with the rest of the propulsion system. Given all the uncertainty, Vollmer was reluctant to say when Starliner might be ready for another launch attempt. Boeing will need to work around other space station traffic, as well as a NASA asteroid mission thats due to launch on the same kind of rocket from the same pad in October. Probably too early to say whether its this year or not, Vollmer told reporters.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Astronauts undisclosed minor medical issue delays spacewalk,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is delaying a spacewalk at the International Space Station this week because of an undisclosed medical issue involving one of its astronauts.  Officials announced the postponement Monday, less than 24 hours before Mark Vande Hei was supposed to float outside.  Vande Hei is dealing with a minor medical issue, officials said in a statement. Its not an emergency, they noted, but didnt provide any further details.  Vande Hei, 54, a retired Army colonel, has been at the space station since April and is expected to remain there until next spring for a full one-year mission. This is his second station stay. He and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide were supposed to venture out Tuesday to install a bracket for new solar wings. NASA said the work can wait.  The spacewalk will be rescheduled after this weekends planned supply run by SpaceX and a September series of spacewalks on the Russian side of the orbiting lab, according to NASA. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Fossil leaves may reveal climate in last era of dinosaurs,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Richard Barclay opens a metal drawer in archives of the Smithsonian Natural History Museum containing fossils that are nearly 100 million years old. Despite their age, these rocks arent fragile. The geologist and botanist handles them with casual ease, placing one in his palm for closer examination. Embedded in the ancient rock is a triangular leaf with rounded upper lobes. This leaf fell off a tree around the time that T-rex and triceratops roamed prehistoric forests, but the plant is instantly recognizable. You can tell this is ginkgo, its a unique shape, said Barclay. It hasnt changed much in many millions of years. Whats also special about ginkgo trees is that their fossils often preserve actual plant material, not simply a leafs impression. And that thin sheet of organic matter may be key to understanding the ancient climate system  and the possible future of our warming planet.  But Barclay and his team first need to crack the plants code to read information contained in the ancient leaf.  Ginkgo is a pretty unique time capsule, said Peter Crane, a Yale University paleobotanist. As he wrote in Ginkgo, his  book on the plant, It is hard to imagine that these trees, now towering above cars and commuters, grew up with the dinosaurs and have come down to us almost unchanged for 200 million years. If a tree fell in an ancient forest, what can it tell scientists today?  
        
     The reason scientists look back in the past is to understand whats coming in the future, said Kevin Anchukaitis, a climate researcher at the University of Arizona. We want to understand how the planet has responded in the past to large-scale changes in climate  how ecosystems changed, how ocean chemistry and sea levels changed, how forests worked. Of particular interest to scientists are  hothouse  periods when they believe carbon levels and  temperatures were significantly higher than today. One such time occurred during the late Cretaceous period (66 million to 100 million years ago), the last era of the dinosaurs before a meteor slammed into Earth and most species went extinct.  Learning more about hothouse climates also gives scientists valuable data to test the accuracy of climate models for projecting the future, says Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology. But climate information about the distant past is limited. Air bubbles trapped in ancient ice cores allow scientists to study ancient carbon dioxide levels, but those only go back about 800,000 years. Thats where the Smithsonians collection of ginkgo leaves come in. Down a warren of corridors, Barclay hops across millennia  as is only possible in a museum  to the 19th century, when the Industrial Revolution had started changing the climate.  From a cabinet, he withdraws sheets of paper where Victorian-era scientists taped and tied ginkgo leaves plucked from botanical gardens of their time. Many specimens have labels written in beautiful cursive, including one dated Aug. 22, 1896.  The leaf shape is virtually identical to the fossil from around 100 million years ago, and to a modern leaf Barclay holds in his hand. But one key difference can be viewed with a microscope  how the leaf has responded to changing carbon in the air.  Tiny pores on a leafs underside are arranged to take in carbon dioxide and respire water, allowing the plant to transform sunlight into energy. When theres a lot of carbon in the air, the plant needs fewer pores to absorb the carbon it needs. When carbon levels drop, the leaves produce more pores to compensate. Today, scientists know the global average level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about 410 parts per million  and Barclay knows what that makes the leaf look like. Thanks to the Victorian botanical sheets, he knows what ginkgo leaves looked like before humans had significantly transformed the planets atmosphere.  Now he wants to know what pores in the fossilized ginkgo leaves can tell him about the atmosphere 100 million years ago.  But first he needs a codebreaker, a translation sheet  sort of a Rosetta stone to decipher the handwriting of the ancient atmosphere. Thats why hes running an experiment in a forest clearing in Maryland. One morning earlier this year, Barclay and project assistant Ben Lloyd tended rows of ginkgo trees within open-topped enclosures of plastic sheeting that expose them to rain, sunlight and changing seasons. We are growing them this way so the plants experience natural cycles, Barclay said. The researchers adjust the carbon dioxide pumped into each chamber, and an electronic monitor outside flashes the levels every five seconds. Some trees are growing at current carbon dioxide levels. Others are growing at significantly elevated levels, approximating levels in the distant past, or perhaps the future. Were looking for analogues  we need something to compare with, said Barclay. If theres a match between what the leaves in the experiment look like and what the fossil leaves look like, that will give researchers a rough guide to the ancient atmosphere. They also are studying what happens when trees grow in super-charged environments, and they found that more carbon dioxide makes them grow faster.  But adds Barclay, If plants grow very quickly, they are more likely to make mistakes and be more susceptible to damage. ... Its like a race car driver thats more likely to go off the rails at high speeds. - Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"100,000 more COVID deaths seen unless US changes its ways","The U.S. is projected to see nearly 100,000 more COVID-19 deaths between now and Dec. 1, according to the nations most closely watched forecasting model. But health experts say that toll could be cut in half if nearly everyone wore a mask in public spaces. In other words, what the coronavirus has in store this fall depends on human behavior. Behavior is really going to determine if, when and how sustainably the current wave subsides, said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. We cannot stop delta in its tracks, but we can change our behavior overnight. That means doubling down again on masks, limiting social gatherings, staying home when sick and getting vaccinated. Those things are within our control, Meyers said. The U.S. is in the grip of a fourth wave of infection this summer, powered by the highly contagious delta variant, which has sent cases, hospitalizations and deaths soaring again, swamped medical centers, burned out nurses and erased months of progress against the virus. Deaths are running at over 1,100 a day on average, turning the clock back to mid-March. One influential model, from the University of Washington, projects an additional 98,000 Americans will die by the start of December, for an overall death toll of nearly 730,000.  
        
     The projection says deaths will rise to nearly 1,400 a day by mid-September, then decline slowly. 
        
     But the model also says many of those deaths can be averted if Americans change their ways. We can save 50,000 lives simply by wearing masks. Thats how important behaviors are, said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle who is involved in the making of the projections. Already there are signs that Americans are taking the threat more seriously.  Amid the alarm over the delta variant in the past several weeks, the slump in demand for COVID-19 shots reversed course. The number of vaccinations dispensed per day has climbed around 80% over the past month to an average of about 900,000. White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Tuesday that in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, more people got their first shots in the past month than in the prior two months combined.  Also, millions of students are being required to wear masks. A growing number of employers are demanding their workers get the vaccine after the federal government gave Pfizers shot full approval earlier this week. And cities like New York and New Orleans are insisting people get vaccinated if they want to eat at a restaurant. Half of American workers are in favor of vaccine requirements at their workplaces, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Early signs suggest behavior changes may already be flattening the curve in a few places where the virus raged this summer. An Associated Press analysis shows the rate of new cases is slowing in Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana and Arkansas, some of the same states where first shots are on the rise. In Florida, pleas from hospitals and a furor over masks in schools may have nudged some to take more precautions. However, the troubling trends persist in Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming, where new infections continue to rise steadily. Mokdad said he is frustrated that Americans arent doing what it takes to control this virus. I dont get it, he said. We have a fire and nobody wants to deploy a firetruck.  One explanation: The good news in the spring  vaccinations rising, cases declining  gave people a glimpse of the way things used to be, said Elizabeth Stuart of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and that made it tough for them to resume the precautions they thought they left behind.  
        
     We dont need to fully hunker down, she said, but we can make some choices that reduce risk. Even vaccinated people should stay vigilant, said Dr. Gaby Sauza, 30, of Seattle, who was inoculated over the winter but tested positive for COVID-19 along with other guests days after an Aug. 14 Vermont wedding, even though the festivities were mostly outdoors and those attending had to submit photos of their vaccination cards. In retrospect, absolutely, I do wish I had worn a mask, she said. Sauza, a resident in pediatrics, will miss two weeks of hospital work and has wrestled with guilt over burdening her colleagues. She credits the vaccine with keeping her infection manageable, though she suffered several days of body aches, fevers, night sweats, fatigue, coughing and chest pain.  If we behave, we can contain this virus. If we dont behave, this virus is waiting for us, Mokdad said.

"Landowner help sought to protect endangered animals, plants","TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP)  The Biden administration called for regulatory changes Wednesday to encourage voluntary conservation projects on private land, partly by shielding owners from punishment if their actions kill or harm small numbers of imperiled species. The proposed U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule outlines steps to simplify permitting for damage that otherwise would be illegal under the Endangered Species Act. The Associated Press obtained details on the proposal prior to its public release. To qualify, landowners take steps that would benefit declining species, including pollinators such as bumblebees and monarch butterflies. The idea is to make landowners allies rather than adversaries as climate change, urban sprawl and other trends jeopardize more animals and plants. The United Nations says up to 1 million species could go extinct worldwide, many in the next few decades. Preventing such losses will require protections on both private and public lands, officials told AP. We believe very strongly that collaborative conservation is the way forward, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in an interview. She added in a statement that partnerships would set us on a course for continued recovery and resilience. The proposed rule involves a section of the federal law that offers exceptions to its broad prohibitions on harming species listed as endangered or threatened. It allows taking  killing  individual plants or animals for scientific purposes, or to preserve a species through steps such as establishing new populations. 
        
     It also allows such harm if its an unintended result of an otherwise legal activity such as logging, mining and oil and gas development. Killing or harming members of listed species under those circumstances requires a permit, accompanied by plans for limiting the damage and conserving the species overall. These are tools that are valuable and popular, but are largely constrained by the fact that they are time consuming and expensive to negotiate, said Jonathan Wood, a vice president at the Property and Environment Research Center, which supports a free-market approach to environmentalism. The proposed new rule is designed to make reaching such deals easier and get more landowners to take part. It would combine two existing types of protection agreements into one. It also would allow owners eventually to stop their protection measures  for example, by cutting trees they had allowed to grow for the benefit of woodland species such as birds or bats. Another provision would allow issuance of permits for harming individuals of species that havent been listed as endangered or threatened but could be in the future. The landowner would begin protective measures immediately but couldnt hurt or kill any of the animals or plants until their species are listed. That could help them recover well enough that legal protections arent needed. We anticipate that these improvements will encourage more individuals and companies to engage in these voluntary programs, thereby generating greater conservation results overall, the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a regulatory filing. Environmental law experts said the strategy is worth trying but success isnt certain  particularly since it opens the door to more incidental deaths and gives landowners the option of dropping conservation efforts. This is not a risk-free rule, said Pat Parenteau, an emeritus law professor at the Vermont Law and Graduate School. It may not work out to the net benefit of the species in question. Most endangered species live largely on private land, so the government has little choice but to seek voluntary cooperation, accept tradeoffs and assure owners theyll be able to manage their property, said Dan Rohlf, a professor with the Lewis and Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon. But an agreement that doesnt require permanent conservation measures sends a message to non-federal landowners that species conservation is ultimately not your obligation, Rohlf said. It says that hopefully well recover a species somewhere else than your land. And that may or may not be true or possible. Wildlife advocates have criticized the use of conservation agreements in cases including Arctic grayling, a fish struggling to survive in parts of Montana. Advocates sued the government last week, contending a deal reached more than a decade ago involving the Big Hole River and its tributaries  home to the grayling and a water source for agriculture  had failed to stop the fishs decline. The agreement wasnt enforceable and didnt go through a public process so experts could weigh in, said Kristine Akland, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. The concept is great: State and private entities and the federal government all come together and agree to abide by certain measures to help a species, Akland said. Every ... conservation agreement is going to be subject to those pitfalls. The Fish and Wildlife Service scheduled a public comment period for Feb. 9 through April 10. No date has been set for a final decision on the proposed rule. The service invited feedback on matters such as whether the proposed changes would save time and money; how they would affect conservation; how much private land could be eligible; and the potential for more permit applications. The upcoming rule is important to bring in the nonfederal landowners, to bring working landscapes into this partnership of really embracing the Endangered Species Act, Martha Williams, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, told AP. ___ Brown reported from Billings, Montana. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Costa Rica ponders ways to sustain reforestation success,"SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP)  Costa Rica went from having one of the worlds highest deforestation rates in the 1980s to a nation centered on ecotourism, luring world travelers with the possibility of moving between marine reserves and cloud forest in a single day. But the Central American country known for lush jungle and rich biodiversity now faces a dilemma as one environmental priority  reforestation -- runs headlong into another -- reducing the use of fossil fuels. The program that has paid landowners for 25 years not to cut down trees depends almost entirely on fuel tax revenue, which stands to fade away by 2050 as Costa Rica converts public and private transportation to electricity in pursuit of net-zero emissions. That has the government hunting for alternative funding options. Those could include new taxes or a tweaked mix of existing ones. Tourists who flock to see toucans, sloths and brilliantly colored frogs might someday see a charge on their hotel bill to aid forest conservation. And Costa Rica will continue to pressure developed countries  the planets biggest polluters  to compensate countries doing more than their share to store carbon. Costa Rica reforestation got a boost last year with President Rodrigo Chaves announcement of $16.4 million from the World Bank for forests that are reducing carbon emissions. The program will bring in a total of $60 million by the end of 2025, money Costa Rica hopes can double the amount of protected forest. The money is one step toward the international community doing its part to preserve valuable forest, said Jorge Mario Rodrguez Ziga, director of the National Forestry Financing Fund, known by its Spanish initials FONAFIFO.  
        
     If it benefits the world, its only fair that the world contributes to its protection, he said, adding that he hopes that one day soon he will be able to say that all privately held forest in Costa is receiving some incentive. Demand for agricultural land once took a heavy toll on Costa Ricas forest cover, which fell to 21% of the national territory in the 1980s as nearly 125,000 acres were cleared each year. Even as Costa Rica invested heavily to establish national parks, the government realized that something had to be done to conserve privately held forest as it moved to promote ecotourism.  A forestry law passed in 1996 created the Payments for Environmental Services (PSA) program, with funding from the gas tax. It paid landowners about $60 per 2 1/2 acres (1 hectare) annually for four environmental services  water, scenic beauty, biodiversity and carbon  associated with conserving the forest. The program currently enrolls more than 680,000 acres (276,000 hectares). Along with the carrot came the stick: Strict rules and penalties for changes in land use.  Tourism soon grew so much that agricultures share of the economy was eclipsed, falling from 25% in 1982 to 4.2% in 2019. Meanwhile, visits to protected natural areas soared from about 500,000 in 1990 to more than 1.7 million in 2019. Some landowners were already philosophically disposed to conserve their forest. Floripe Crdoba and Siegfried Kussmaul had decided even before the program launched that they wanted to let the forest retake the 8 acres near San Jose where they had grown coffee and raised cattle, though they said some neighbors thought they were crazy. They now get about $300 annually from the program, for them a largely symbolic amount since they live comfortably off his pension from years as a geology professor. When I conserve I let all of the insects, down to the smallest, the fauna and everything there is in the forest, have its place, said Crdoba, a former tourism guide who strolls in the forest daily. On one such walk, Crdoba pointed out her favorite trees and identified the butterflies flitting past. Surrounded by cattle ranches, Kussmaul said, The neighbors see us and say: What a waste of land! The World Bank money is open to landowners not already enrolled in Costa Ricas program. But it only reimburses for carbon, one of the four environmental services, raising the question of whether $18 per 2 1/2 acres (1 hectare) will attract many landowners. The Foundation for the Development of the Central Volcanic Mountain Chain, FUNDECOR, a nongovernmental conservation organization, for years helped sign up landowners to the PSA program. Executive Director Mario Piedra welcomed the decline in funding that will come from reduced fossil fuels, but said replacement options must be found beyond what the World Bank program is offering. What they have failed to understand is that with $7 or $18 per hectare per year it is impossible to improve the sustainability of these areas in the long term because it is very little money, he said.  Rodrguez, director of FONAFIFO, said he knows $18 isnt a lot, but said his organization is looking for additional funding that would cover adding biodiversity as an environmental service to be compensated. In the meantime, the program offers retroactive payments to those who had verifiable forest land as far back as 2018. Officials are also trying to make it easier. Landowners can register through a website, with the government in most cases using satellite imagery rather than a site visit to verify the existence of the forest. And where PSA requires landowners to hire a forester to help monitor their woods  with a cost of up to 18% of the government payments  the World Bank money does not. Rodrguez said FONAFIFO hopes to find money to make payments beyond 2024. And both Piedra and Rodriguez talked of tapping private capital markets to set up systems that would compensate conservation efforts. FONAFIFO has been talking with Costa Rican tourism officials because that industry is one of the biggest beneficiaries of forest conservation, but no tax for that purpose exists and its not the right time to launch one given lingering economic difficulties from the pandemic, Rodrguez said.  One indicator that tourists may be willing to support some kind of tax: a voluntary program in which they were offered a chance to offset their vacations emissions raised $600,000 last year.",https://apnews.com/article/costa-rica-rainforest-ecotourism-fossil-fuels-ea98d1c6cc3d0ec05bd3532e08364bbe,science
"Biden creates national monuments in Nevada, Texas mountains","WASHINGTON (AP)  President Joe Biden said Tuesday he is establishing national monuments on more than half a million acres in Nevada and Texas and creating a marine sanctuary in U.S. waters near the Pacific Remote Islands southwest of Hawaii. The conservation measures are protecting the heart and soul of our national pride,' Biden said. Speaking at a White House summit on conservation action, Biden said the new monuments are among the natural treasures that define our identity as a nation. Theyre a birthright we have to pass down to generation after generation.' Biden designated Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in southern Nevada that Native Americans consider sacred, as a national monument, along with the Castner Range in El Paso, Texas. He also moved to create a national marine sanctuary in U.S. waters around the Pacific Remote Islands. Conservation and tribal groups praised Bidens actions, but Nevadas new Republican governor slammed the monument designation as federal confiscation of Nevada land and a historic mistake that will cost Nevadans for generations to come. Gov. Joe Lombardo, who unseated the states Democratic governor in November, said the White House did not consult with his administration before moving to block clean-energy projects and other development in his state. This kind of Washington Knows Best policy might win plaudits from unaccountable special interests, but its going to cost our state jobs and economic opportunity, Lombardo said in a statement. Our national wonders are literally the envy of the world, Biden said in a speech at the Interior Department. Theyve always been and always will be central to our heritage as a people and essential to our identity as a nation. 
        
     The Nevada site spans more than 500,000 acres (200,000 hectares) and includes Spirit Mountain, a peak northwest of Laughlin called Avi Kwa Ame (ah-VEE kwa-meh) by the Fort Mojave Tribe and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The rugged landscape near the Arizona and California state lines is home to bighorn sheep, desert tortoises and a large concentration of Joshua trees, some of which are more than 900 years old.   
        
     In Texas, the Castner Range designation will protect cultural, scientific and historic objects, honor U.S. veterans and tribal nations, and expand access to outdoor recreation on public lands, Biden said. Located on Fort Bliss, Castner Range served as a training and testing site for the U.S. Army during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Army ceased training at the site and closed Castner Range in 1966.  Together, the two new national monuments protect nearly 514,000 acres (208,000 hectares) of public lands. The Avi Kwa Ame landscape is sacred to 12 tribes and is home to rare wildlife and plants, while Castner Range is the ancestral homeland of the Comanche and Apache people, and its cultural ecology is considered sacred to several Indigenous communities. To the native people who point to Avi Kwa Ame as their spiritual birthplace, and every Nevadan who knows the value of our cherished public lands: Today is for you, tweeted Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, who sponsored a bill to protect the rugged region near the Mojave National Preserve from development, including solar farms and a proposed wind farm. Spirit Mountain will now be protected for future generations, Titus said. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Avi Kwa Ame holds deep spiritual, sacred and historic significance to the Native people who have lived on these lands for generations, adding that she was grateful to Biden for taking this important step in recognition of the decades of advocacy from tribes and the scientific community.' In the Pacific, Biden directed the Commerce Department to initiate a marine sanctuary designation to protect 777,000 square miles around the Pacific Remote Islands. If completed, the new sanctuary would help ensure the U.S. reaches Bidens goal to conserve at least 30% of ocean waters under U.S. jurisdiction by 2030, the White House said. The area to be protected is larger than Alaska and Colorado put together,' Biden said.  Bidens actions come as he faces sharp criticism from environmental groups and youth activists over his approval of the huge Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. Biden has made fighting global warming a central part of his agenda and has pledged to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. But the decision on Willow has alienated supporters, particularly young activists skeptical about political compromise at the same time Biden is planning to announce his reelection campaign. Climate activists gathered outside the Interior Department on Tuesday to condemn what they call Bidens climate hypocrisy and demand the administration change course on Willow. Protesters hung a large yellow banner that said, Stop the Willow oil project and chanted no more drilling, no more drilling, no more drilling on federal land.  In Texas, the Castner Range monument will preserve fragile lands already surrounded on three sides by development,' help ensure access to clean water and protect rare and endangered species, said Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar. Fort Mojave Tribe Chairman Timothy Williams, who attended the conservation summit, said tribes throughout the Southwest consider Avi Kwa Ame to be sacred land. Bidens creation of a new monument demonstrated his commitment to respect tribal nations and our nation-to-nation relationship.'  Under the leadership of Biden and Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet member, We have a seat at the table and we have seen an unprecedented era and opportunity for our tribal communities,' Williams said. The Honor Avi Kwa Ame coalition, which includes tribes, local residents, state lawmakers and conservation groups, said its members were overjoyed at the new monument. Biden designated his first national monument, in Colorado, last year. In 2021, he restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah after they were significantly narrowed by President Donald Trump, a Republican. Biden announced other steps Tuesday to conserve, restore and expand access to public lands and waters, promote tribal conservation and reduce wildfire risk. The proposals seek to modernize management of Americas public lands, better harness the ocean to help fight climate change and better conserve wildlife corridors, the White House said. ___ Associated Press writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Ken Ritter and Rio Yamat in Las Vegas contributed to this story.",https://apnews.com/article/biden-avi-kwa-ame-nevada-conservation-willow-7378dadd793195bcedcc8562241cf54f,science
New Mexico OKs its 1st wildlife bridges to limit collisions,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP)  New Mexico will build its first wildlife highway overpasses for free-roaming cougars, black bears, bighorn sheep and other creatures large and small and will also set aside $100 million for conservation projects, under two bills signed Thursday by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. Advocates for the initiatives say the state stands to capture millions of dollars in federal matching funds for wildlife crossings and an array of established conservation programs. New Mexico hopes to expand efforts ranging from river stewardship to outdoor adventures for young people from low-income households. The states first wildlife bridge is likely to span a state highway that traverses remote desert oilfields and Native American lands of the Navajo Nation, Jicarilla Apache Nation and several pueblo communities, including a treacherous hotspot for wildlife-auto collisions north of Cuba, New Mexico. Several hundred large animals  primarily deer and elk  are killed in the state each year by collisions that can also total cars and severely injure human passengers. The state estimates property damage from such wrecks at nearly $20 million annually, while unbroken roads also fracture habitats for monitored species of concern including the ornate box turtle, white-nosed coati and gila monster.  Recent casualties include a roughly 4-year-old mountain lion that previously bore kittens and was struck and killed on State Highway 550 at Santa Ana Pueblo in January at night. 
        
     Glenn Harper, manager of the Santa Ana Pueblo Range and Wildlife Division, said the pueblo is committed to establishing safe corridors for wildlife and that it shared a trove of GPS tracking data when state agencies were identifying the first crucial locations for bridges. The state Legislature commissioned the plan in 2019. We have a pretty good sense of where these animals want to cross the highway, Harper said. As communities are growing around the pueblo, it becomes a cultural preservation issue. The pueblo is closely tied and entwined with the natural world. Nearby states including Colorado, Arizona, Utah and Nevada already have invested substantially in wildlife crossings. And California last year broke ground on what it bills as the worlds largest  a bridge over a major Southern California highway for mountain lions and other animals hemmed in by urban sprawl. The second New Mexico bill signed Thursday places $50 million in a permanent trust aimed at generating investment earnings, plus a $50 million spending account to underwrite established programs in environmental stewardship, forest management, watershed health, outdoor recreation, agriculture, historic preservation and species protection.  Many Republicans in the legislative minority opposed the conservation trust bill over concerns the state might expand public land holdings by unfairly outbidding individuals including ranchers. Opposition among Republican legislators to the wildlife crossings plan was more muted. The state joins others in the Western U.S. that already fund their own, similar conservation trusts that help them apply for federal financial awards. Such trusts are underwritten by lottery proceeds, taxes on cannabis or money borrowed from bond investors, said Brittany Fallon of the conservation group Western Resource Advocates. At a signing ceremony inside an REI Co-op store, Lujan Grisham highlighted New Mexicos efforts to set aside billions in investment accounts for future spending on conservation programs, infrastructure and early childhood education.  More is needed to ensure natural wonders survive the next 50 years amid a financial windfall in state income linked to local oil production, she added. We have to start thinking big in the context of how expensive it is to do the right public safety and conservation work, Lujan Grisham said. It is in fact expensive because it is a generational investment in the well-being of New Mexico. Last week the Legislature sent the governor a record $9.6 billion annual spending proposal, along with a $1.1 billion tax relief package. She has until April 7 to veto any provisions.",https://apnews.com/article/wildlife-overpasses-new-mexico-mountain-lions-ab172d22bd43917583b73ff78f6251a7,science
William Shatner will fly to space aboard Blue Origin rocket,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Captain Kirk is rocketing into space next week  boldly going where no other sci-fi stars have gone.  Jeff Bezos space travel company, Blue Origin, announced Monday that Star Trek actor William Shatner will blast off from West Texas on Oct. 12.  Yes, its true; Im going to be a rocket man! the 90-year-old tweeted. He added: Its never too late to experience new things. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is a huge fan of the sci-fi series and even had a cameo as a high-ranking alien in the 2016 film Star Trek Beyond. His rocket company invited Shatner to fly as its guest. Shatner will become the oldest person to go to space. Hell join three others  two of them paying customers  aboard a Blue Origin capsule. Hell wind up being the second actor to reach space this month: Russia is launching an actress and a film director to the International Space Station on Tuesday for almost two weeks of moviemaking. Shatners flight, by comparison, will last just 10 minutes and reach no higher than about 66 miles (106 kilometers). The capsule will parachute back to the desert floor, not far from where it took off. With flights short or long, space tourism is picking up steam fast.  Virgin Galactic carried founder Richard Branson to the edge of space with five others in July, followed nine days later by Bezos space hop. Elon Musks SpaceX, meanwhile, launched its first private crew last month  a Pennsylvania entrepreneur who bought the three-day flight and took along two contest winners and a cancer survivor. 
        
     Virgin Galactics ship launches from an airplane and requires two pilots. Blue Origin and SpaceXs capsules are fully automated, but the passengers must pass medical screenings and, among other things, be able to quickly climb several flights of steps at the launch tower to get to the capsule  or out of it in an emergency. This will be Blue Origins second launch of a crew. Bezos was on the debut flight on July 20. He took along his brother, an 18-year-old from the Netherlands and 82-year-old aviation pioneer Wally Funk  the youngest and oldest to fly in space. Shatner will break that upper threshold by eight years.  Ive heard about space for a long time now. Im taking the opportunity to see it for myself. What a miracle, Shatner said in a statement. Shatner played the role of the USS Starship Enterprises commander for three seasons, from 1966 to 1969. He also portrayed Captain James T. Kirk in seven movies, directing one of them. Hes currently the host and executive producer of a History Channel show, The UnXplained. The ashes of two other Star Trek powerhouses  creator Gene Roddenberry and actor James Doohan, who played Scotty  rocketed into space years ago following their deaths.  Also launching with Shatner: a former NASA engineer who founded a nanosatellite company and the co-founder of a software company specializing in clinical research. The two took part in the auction for a seat on the first flight. That seat cost $28 million; Blue Origin isnt divulging any other ticket prices. A fourth seat on the flight is going to Blue Origins vice president of mission and flight operations, who used to work for NASA as a space station flight controller. A Blue Origin spokeswoman said Shatner, like the others, met all the companys health and physical requirements. Last week, more than 20 current and former Blue Origin employees accused  the Kent, Washington-based company of having a toxic work environment and not adhering to proper safety protocols. Blue Origin said it doesnt tolerate harassment or discrimination and stood by its safety record. Bezos company is also challenging a NASA contract award to SpaceX for providing a lunar lander that will return astronauts to the moon in a few years. Blue Origin was unsuccessful in its bid for the job.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"William Shatner, TVs Capt. Kirk, blasts into space","VAN HORN, Texas (AP)  Hollywoods Captain Kirk, 90-year-old William Shatner, blasted into space Wednesday in a convergence of science fiction and science reality, reaching the final frontier aboard a ship built by Jeff Bezos Blue Origin company. The Star Trek actor and three fellow passengers hurtled to an altitude of 66.5 miles (107 kilometers) over the West Texas desert in the fully automated capsule, then safely parachuted back to Earth. The flight lasted just over 10 minutes. What you have given me is the most profound experience, an exhilarated Shatner told Bezos after climbing out the hatch, the words spilling from him in a soliloquy almost as long as the flight. I hope I never recover from this. I hope that I can maintain what I feel now. I dont want to lose it. He said that going from the blue sky to the utter blackness of space was a moving experience: In an instant you go, `Whoa, thats death. Thats what I saw. Shatner became the oldest person in space, eclipsing the previous record  set by a passenger on a similar jaunt on a Bezos spaceship in July  by eight years. The flight included about three minutes of weightlessness and a view of the curvature of the Earth. Sci-fi fans reveled in the opportunity to see the man best known as the brave and principled commander of the starship Enterprise boldly go where no star of American TV has gone before. The internet went wild, with Trekkies quoting favorite lines from Kirk, including, Risk: Risk is our business. Thats what this starship is all about. 
        
     This is a pinch-me moment for all of us to see Capt. James Tiberius Kirk go to space, Blue Origin launch commentator Jacki Cortese said before liftoff. She said she, like so many others, was drawn to space by shows like Star Trek. NASA sent best wishes ahead of the flight, tweeting: You are, and always shall be, our friend. The flight brought priceless star power to Bezos space-tourism business, given its built-in appeal to baby boomers, celebrity watchers and space enthusiasts. Shatner starred in TVs original Star Trek from 1966 to 1969, when the U.S. was racing for the moon, and went on to appear in a string of Star Trek movies. Bezos is a huge Star Trek fan  the Amazon founder had a cameo as an alien in one of the later movies  and Shatner rode free as his invited guest. As a favor to Bezos, Shatner took up into space some Star Trek tricorders and communicators  sort of the iPhones of the future  that Bezos made when he was a 9-year-old Trekkie. Bezos said his mother had saved them for 48 years. Bezos himself drove the four crew members to the launch pad, accompanied them to the platform high above the ground and cranked the hatch shut after they climbed aboard the 60-foot rocket. He was there to greet them when the capsule floated back to Earth under its brilliant blue-and-red parachutes. Hello, astronauts. Welcome to Earth! a jubilant Bezos said as he opened the hatch of the New Shepard capsule, named for first American in space, Alan Shepard. Shatner and the others wore close-fitting, flame-retardant, royal-blue flight suits, not exactly the tight, futuristic-for-the-60s V-necks that the crew of the Enterprise had on TV. The actor said he was struck by the vulnerability of Earth and the relative sliver of its atmosphere. Everybody in the world needs to do this. Everybody in the world needs to see, he said. To see the blue color whip by, and now youre staring into blackness, thats the thing. The covering of blue, this sheath, this blanket, this comforter of blue that we have around, we say, Oh, thats blue sky. And then suddenly you shoot through it all, and youre looking into blackness, into black ugliness. Shatner said the return to Earth was more jolting than his training led him to expect and made him wonder whether he was going to make it back alive. Everything is much more powerful, he said. Bang, this thing hits. That wasnt anything like the simulator. ... Am I going to be able to survive the G-forces? Passengers are subjected to nearly 6 Gs, or six times the force of Earths gravity, as the capsule descends. Blue Origin said Shatner and the rest of the crew met all the medical and physical requirements, including the ability to hustle up and down several flights of steps at the launch tower.  Shatner going into space is the most badass thing I think Ive ever seen, said Joseph Barra, a bartender who helped cater the launch week festivities. William Shatner is setting the bar for what a 90-year-old man can do. The flight comes as the space tourism industry finally takes off, with passengers joyriding aboard ships built and operated by some of the richest men in the world. Virgin Galactics Richard Branson went into space in his own rocket ship in July, followed by Bezos nine days later on Blue Origins first flight with a crew. Elon Musks SpaceX made its first private voyage in mid-September, though without Musk on board. Last week, the Russians launched an actor and a film director to the International Space Station for a movie-making project. Blue Origin said it plans one more passenger flight this year and several more in 2022. Sounding like the humane and idealistic Captain Kirk himself, the company said its goal is to democratize space. Shatner strapped in alongside Audrey Powers, a Blue Origin vice president and former space station flight controller for NASA, and two paying customers: Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer, and Glen de Vries of a 3D software company. Blue Origin would not divulge the cost of their tickets. The flight brought to 597 the number of humans who have flown in space. Todays launch is a testimony to the power of the imagination, and we should not lose sight of that power, University of Rochester astrophysicist Adam Frank said in an email. William Shatner may be `just an actor, but Captain James T. Kirk represents a collective dream of a hopeful future in space that Star Trek, and science fiction in general, gave us all, Frank continued. Bezos gave Shatner a seat on his rocket because he, like millions of others, fell in love with Star Trek and its vision of a boundless frontier for humanity. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Nobel in chemistry honors greener way to build molecules,"STOCKHOLM (AP)  Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday for finding an ingenious and environmentally cleaner way to build molecules  an approach now used to make a variety of compounds, including medicines and pesticides. The work of Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan has allowed scientists to produce those molecules more cheaply, efficiently, safely and with significantly less hazardous waste. Its already benefiting humankind greatly, said Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, a member of the Nobel panel.  It was the second day in a row that a Nobel rewarded work that had environmental implications. The physics prize honored developments that expanded our understanding of climate change, just weeks before the start of global climate negotiations in Scotland. The chemistry prize focused on the making of molecules. That requires linking atoms together in specific arrangements, an often difficult and slow task. Until the beginning of the millennium, chemists had only two methods  or catalysts  to speed up the process, using either complicated enzymes or metal catalysts. That all changed when List, of the Max Planck Institute in Germany, and MacMillan, of Princeton University in New Jersey, independently reported that small organic molecules can be used to do the job. The new tools have been important for developing medicines and minimizing drug manufacturing glitches, including problems that can cause harmful side effects.  Johan qvist, chair of the Nobel panel, called the method as simple as it is ingenious. 
        
     The fact is that many people have wondered why we didnt think of it earlier, he added. MacMillan said that winning the prize left him stunned, shocked, happy, very proud.  I grew up in Scotland, a working-class kid. My dads a steelworker. My mom was a home help.  I was lucky enough to get a chance to come to America, to do my Ph.D., he said. In fact, he said at a news conference in Princeton, he was planning to follow his older brother into physics, but the physics classes in college were at 8 a.m. in a cold and leaky classroom in rainy Scotland, while the chemistry courses were two hours later in warmer, drier spaces. As he told that story, he said he could hear his wife pleading with him not to share it. His said the inspiration for his Nobel-winning work came when thinking about the dirty process of making chemicals  one that requires precautions he likened to those taken at nuclear power plants.  If he could devise a way of making medicines faster by completely different means that didnt require vats of metal catalysts, the process would be safer for both workers and the planet, he reasoned. List said he did not initially know MacMillan was working on the same subject and figured his own hunch might just be a stupid idea  until it worked. At that eureka moment, I did feel that this could be something big, the 53-year-old said. H.N. Cheng, president of the American Chemical Society, said the laureates developed new magic wands. Before the their work, the standard catalysts frequently used were metals, which frequently have environmental downsides, Cheng said. They accumulate, they leach, they may be hazardous.  The catalysts that MacMillan and List pioneered are organic, so they will degrade faster, and they are also cheaper, he said.  The Nobel panel noted that their contributions made the production of key drugs easier, including an antiviral and an anti-anxiety medication. One way to look at their work is like molecular carpentry, said John Lorsch, director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.  Theyve found ways to not only speed up the chemical joining, he said, but to make sure it only goes in either the right-handed or left-handed direction. The ability to control the orientation in which new atoms are added to molecules is important. Failing to do so can result in side effects in drugs, the Nobel panel explained, citing the catastrophic example of thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects in children. Since the scientists discovery, the tool has been further refined, making it many times more efficient. Peter Somfai, another member of the committee, stressed the importance of the discovery for the world economy. It has been estimated that catalysis is responsible for about 35% of the worlds GDP, which is a pretty impressive figure, he said. If we have a more environmentally friendly alternative, its expected that that will make a difference. The NIH supported Lists research with a grant in 2002. MacMillans work has received funding from NIH since 2000, for a total of around $14.5 million to date. Its a great example of supporting basic science that you dont necessarily know where its going to go but can have major impact, said Francis Collins, NIH director. The Nobel comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor,, or more than $1.14 million. The money comes from a bequest left by the prizes creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895. Over the coming days, Nobels will be awarded in literature, peace and economics. ___ Jordans reported from Berlin and Larson from Washington.

Lucy in the sky: Spacecraft will visit record 8 asteroids,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Attention asteroid aficionados: NASA is set to launch a series of spacecraft to visit and even bash some of the solar systems most enticing space rocks. The robotic trailblazer named Lucy is up first, blasting off this weekend on a 12-year cruise to swarms of asteroids out near Jupiter  unexplored time capsules from the dawn of the solar system. And yes, there will be diamonds in the sky with Lucy, on one of its science instruments, as well as lyrics from other Beatles songs. NASA is targeting the predawn hours of Saturday for liftoff. Barely a month later, an impactor spacecraft named Dart will give chase to a double-asteroid closer to home. The mission will end with Dart ramming the main asteroids moonlet to change its orbit, a test that could one day save Earth from an incoming rock. Next summer, a spacecraft will launch to a rare metal world  an nickel and iron asteroid that might be the exposed core of a once-upon-a-time planet. A pair of smaller companion craft  the size of suitcases  will peel away to another set of double asteroids. And in 2023, a space capsule will parachute into the Utah desert with NASAs first samples of an asteroid, collected last year by the excavating robot Osiris-Rex. The samples are from Bennu, a rubble and boulder-strewn rock that could endanger Earth a couple centuries from now. Each one of those asteroids were visiting tells our story ... the story of us, the story of the solar system, said NASAs chief of science missions, Thomas Zurbuchen. 
        
     Theres nothing better for understanding how our solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago, said Lucys principal scientist, Hal Levison of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Theyre the fossils of planet formation.  China and Russia are teaming up for an asteroid mission later this decade. The United Arab Emirates is also planning an asteroid stop in the coming years.  Advances in tech and design are behind this flurry of asteroid missions, as well as the growing interest in asteroids and the danger they pose to Earth. All it takes is looking at the moon and the impact craters created by asteroids and meteorites to realize the threat, Zurbuchen said. The asteroid-smacking Dart spacecraft  set to launch Nov. 24  promises to be a dramatic exercise in planetary defense. If all goes well, the high-speed smashup will occur next fall just 7 million miles (11 million kilometers) away, within full view of ground telescopes. The much longer $981 million Lucy mission  the first to Jupiters so-called Trojan entourage  is targeting an unprecedented eight asteroids. Lucy aims to sweep past seven of the countless Trojan asteroids that precede and trail Jupiter in the giant gas planets path around the sun. Thousands of these dark reddish or gray rocks have been detected, with many thousands more likely lurking in the two clusters. Trapped in place by the gravitational forces of Jupiter and the sun, the Trojans are believed to be the cosmic leftovers from when the outer planets were forming. Thats what makes the Trojans special. If these ideas of ours are right, they formed throughout the outer solar system and are now at one location where we can go and study them, Levison said.  Before encountering the Trojans, Lucy will zip past a smaller, more ordinary object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists consider this 2025 flyby a dress rehearsal. Three flybys of Earth will be needed as gravity slingshots in order for Lucy to reach both of Jupiters Trojan swarms by the time the mission is set to end in 2033. The spacecraft will be so far from the sun  as much as 530 million miles (850 million kilometers) distant  that massive solar panels are needed to provide enough power. Each of Lucys twin circular wings stretches 24 feet (7 meters) across, dwarfing the spacecraft tucked in the middle like the body of a moth. Lucy intends to pass within 600 miles (965 kilometers) of each targeted asteroid. Every one of those flybys needs to be near-perfection, Zurbuchen said.  The seven Trojans range in size from a 40-mile (64-kilometer) asteroid and its half-mile (1-kilometer) moonlet to a hefty specimen exceeding 62 miles (100 kilometers). Thats the beauty of studying these rocks named after heroes of Greek mythologys Trojan War and, more recently, modern Olympic athletes. Any differences among them will have occurred during their formation, Levison said, offering clues about their origins.  Unlike so many NASA missions, including the upcoming Dart, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, Lucy is not an acronym. The spacecraft is named after the fossilized remains of an early human ancestor discovered in Ethiopia in 1974; the 3.2 million-year-old female got her name from the 1967 Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. The Lucy fossil really transformed our understanding of human evolution, and thats what we want to do is transform our understanding of solar system evolution by looking at all these different objects, said Southwest Research Institutes Cathy Olkin, the deputy principal scientist who proposed the spacecrafts name. One of its science instruments actually has a disc of lab-grown diamond totaling 6.7 carats. And theres another connection to the Fab Four, a plaque attached to the spacecraft includes lines from songs they wrote, along with quotes from other luminaries. From a John Lennon single: We all shine on . . . like the moon and the stars and the sun. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

NASAs asteroid hunter Lucy soars into sky with diamonds,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft named Lucy rocketed into the sky with diamonds Saturday morning on a 12-year quest to explore eight asteroids. Seven of the mysterious space rocks are among swarms of asteroids sharing Jupiters orbit, thought to be the pristine leftovers of planetary formation. An Atlas V rocket blasted off before dawn, sending Lucy on a roundabout journey spanning nearly 4 billion miles (6.3 billion kilometers). Researchers grew emotional describing the successful launch  lead scientist Hal Levison said it was like witnessing the birth of a child. Go Lucy! he urged. Lucy is named after the 3.2 million-year-old skeletal remains of a human ancestor found in Ethiopia nearly a half-century ago. That discovery got its name from the 1967 Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, prompting NASA to send the spacecraft soaring with band members lyrics and other luminaries words of wisdom imprinted on a plaque. The spacecraft also carried a disc made of lab-grown diamonds for one of its science instruments. In a prerecorded video for NASA, Beatles drummer Ringo Starr paid tribute to his late colleague John Lennon, credited for writing the song that inspired all this. Im so excited  Lucy is going back in the sky with diamonds. Johnny will love that, Starr said. Anyway, if you meet anyone up there, Lucy, give them peace and love from me. 
        
     The paleoanthropologist behind the fossil Lucy discovery, Donald Johanson, had goose bumps watching Lucy soar  I will never look at Jupiter the same ... absolutely mind-expanding. He said he was filled with wonder about this intersection of our past, our present and our future. That a human ancestor who lived so long ago stimulated a mission which promises to add valuable information about the formation of our solar system is incredibly exciting, said Johanson, of Arizona State University, who traveled to Cape Canaveral for his first rocket launch. Lucys $981 million mission is the first to aim for Jupiters so-called Trojan entourage: thousands  if not millions  of asteroids that share the gas giants expansive orbit around the sun. Some of the Trojan asteroids precede Jupiter in its orbit, while others trail it. Despite their orbits, the Trojans are far from the planet and mostly scattered far from each other. So theres essentially zero chance of Lucy getting clobbered by one as it swoops past its targets, said Levison of Southwest Research Institute, the missions principal scientist. Lucy will swing past Earth next October and again in 2024 to get enough gravitational oomph to make it all the way out to Jupiters orbit. On the way there, the spacecraft will zip past asteroid Donaldjohanson between Mars and Jupiter. The aptly named rock will serve as a 2025 warm-up act for the science instruments. Drawing power from two huge circular solar wings, Lucy will chase down five asteroids in the leading pack of Trojans in the late 2020s. The spacecraft will then zoom back toward Earth for another gravity assist in 2030. That will send Lucy back out to the trailing Trojan cluster, where it will zip past the final two targets in 2033 for a record-setting eight asteroids visited in a single mission. Its a complicated, circuitous path that had NASAs science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, shaking his head at first. Youve got to be kidding. This is possible? he recalled asking. Lucy will pass within 600 miles (965 kilometers) of each target; the biggest one is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) across. Are there mountains? Valleys? Pits? Mesas? Who knows? Im sure were going to be surprised, said Johns Hopkins Universitys Hal Weaver, whos in charge of Lucys black-and-white camera. But we can hardly wait to see what ... images will reveal about these fossils from the formation of the solar system. NASA plans to launch another mission next month to test whether humans might be able to alter an asteroids orbit  practice in case Earth ever has a killer rock headed this way. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Can new variants of the coronavirus keep emerging?,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Can new variants of the coronavirus keep emerging? Yes, as long as the virus that caused the pandemic keeps infecting people. But that doesnt mean new variants will keep emerging as regularly, or that theyll be more dangerous. With more than half the world still not vaccinated, the virus will likely keep finding people to infect and replicating inside them for several months or years to come. And each time a virus makes a copy of itself, a small mutation could occur. Those changes could help the virus survive, becoming new variants. But that doesnt mean the virus will keep evolving in the same way since it emerged in late 2019. When a virus infects a new species, it needs to adapt to the new host to spread more widely, says Andrew Read, a virus expert at Pennsylvania State University. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the delta variant is twice as contagious as earlier versions of the virus. And while it could still mutate to become more infectious, it probably wont double its transmission rate again, says Dr. Adam Lauring, a virus and infectious disease expert at the University of Michigan. Weve seen a stage of rapid evolution for the virus. Its been harvesting the low-hanging fruit, but theres not an infinite number of things it can do, Lauring says. Its possible that the virus could become more deadly, but there isnt an evolutionary reason for that to happen. Extremely sick people are also less likely to socialize and spread the virus to others.  
        
     Experts are watching to see whether emerging variants could be better at evading the protection people develop from vaccination and infections. As more people get the shots, the virus would have to be able to spread through people who have some immunity for it to survive, says Dr. Joshua Schiffer, a virus expert at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.  The virus could take on a mutation that makes the immune response less effective, he says.  If that happens, scientists may recommend that vaccine formulas be updated periodically, just as annual flu shots are.  ___ The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in this series.

Why no tusks? Poaching tips scales of elephant evolution,"WASHINGTON (AP)  A hefty set of tusks is usually an advantage for elephants, allowing them to dig for water, strip bark for food and joust with other elephants. But during episodes of intense ivory poaching, those big incisors become a liability.  Now researchers have pinpointed how years of civil war and poaching in Mozambique have led to a greater proportion of elephants that will never develop tusks.  During the conflict from 1977 to 1992, fighters on both sides slaughtered elephants for ivory to finance war efforts. In the region thats now Gorongosa National Park, around 90% of the elephants were killed.  The survivors were likely to share a key characteristic: half the females were naturally tuskless  they simply never developed tusks  while before the war, less than a fifth lacked tusks. Like eye color in humans, genes are responsible for whether elephants inherit tusks from their parents. Although tusklessness was once rare in African savannah elephants, its become more common  like a rare eye color becoming widespread.  After the war, those tuskless surviving females passed on their genes with expected, as well as surprising, results. About half their daughters were tuskless. More perplexing, two-thirds of their offspring were female.  The years of unrest changed the trajectory of evolution in that population, said evolutionary biologist Shane Campbell-Staton, based at Princeton University.  
        
     With colleagues, he set out to understand how the pressure of the ivory trade had tipped the scale of natural selection. Their findings were published Thursday in the journal  Science. Researchers in Mozambique, including biologists Dominique Goncalves and Joyce Poole, observed the national park s roughly 800 elephants over several years to create a catalogue of mothers and offspring.  Female calves stay by their mothers, and so do males up to a certain age, said Poole, who is scientific director and co-founder of the nonprofit ElephantVoices.  Poole had previously seen other cases of elephant populations with a disproportionately large number of tuskless females after intense poaching, including in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Ive been puzzling over why its the females who are tuskless for a very long time, said Poole, who is a co-author of the study.  In Gorongosa, the team collected blood samples from seven tusked and 11 tuskless female elephants, then analyzed their DNA for differences.  The elephant survey data gave them an idea where to look: Because the tuskless elephants were female, they focused on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes; males have one X and one Y chromosome.)  They also suspected that the relevant gene was dominant  meaning that a female needs only one altered gene to become tuskless  and that when passed to male embryos, it may short-circuit their development.  When mothers pass it on, we think the sons likely die early in development, a miscarriage, said Brian Arnold, a co-author and evolutionary biologist at Princeton.  Their genetic analysis revealed two key parts of the elephants DNA that they think play a role in passing on the trait of tusklessness. The same genes are associated with the development of teeth in other mammals.  Theyve produced the smoking-gun evidence for genetic changes, said Chris Darimont, a conservation scientist at the University of Victoria in Canada, who was not involved in the research. The work helps scientists and the public understand how our society can have a major influence on the evolution of other life forms.  Most people think of evolution as something that proceeds slowly, but humans can hit the accelerator.  When we think about natural selection, we think about it happening over hundreds, or thousands, of years, said Samuel Wasser, a conservation biologist at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the research. The fact that this dramatic selection for tusklessness happened over 15 years is one of the most astonishing findings. Now the scientists are studying what more tuskless elephants means for the species and its savannah environment. Their preliminary analysis of fecal samples suggests the Gorongosa elephants are shifting their diet, without long incisors to peel bark from trees.  The tuskless females ate mostly grass, whereas the tusked animals ate more legumes and tough woody plants, said Robert Pringle, a co-author and biologist at Princeton University. These changes will last for at least multiple elephant generations.  ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

SpaceX needs to tame toilet trouble before weekend launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX is taming some toilet troubles in its Dragon capsules before launching four more astronauts.  The company and NASA want to make sure any toilet leaks wont compromise the capsule launching early Sunday from Kennedy Space Center or another one thats been parked at the International Space Station since April.  During SpaceXs first private flight last month, a tube came unglued, spilling urine onto fans and beneath the floor, said William Gerstenmaier, a SpaceX vice president who used to work for NASA. The same problem was recently discovered inside the Dragon capsule at the space station, he told reporters Monday night. As a permanent fix, SpaceX has welded on the urine-flushing tube thats inside the companys newest capsule, named Endurance by its U.S.-German crew. NASA isnt quite finished reviewing the last-minute fix. NASA astronaut Raja Chari, the spacecraft commander, said Tuesday that he has complete confidence in the repairs. SpaceX jumped quickly on the issue, he noted, with hundreds of people working on it to ensure the crews safety.  As for the Dragon capsule in orbit, less urine pooled beneath the floor panels than the one that carried a billionaire and three others on a three-day flight, Gerstenmaier said. Thats because the NASA-led crew only spent a day living in it before arriving at the space station.  SpaceX is conducting tests to make sure the spilled liquid didnt weaken the orbiting capsule during the past six months, Gerstenmaier said. Any structural damage could endanger astronauts during their flight back to Earth next month. The final tests should be completed later this week, he noted. 
        
     This will be SpaceXs fourth launch of NASA astronauts and its fifth passenger flight overall. NASA turned to SpaceX and Boeing to transport crews to and from the space station, following the retirement of the shuttle fleet in 2011. U.S. astronauts hitched rides on Russian rockets until SpaceX took over the job last year. Boeing has yet to launch anyone. A repeat test flight of its Starliner capsule, without a crew, is off until next year because of valve trouble. Once he launches atop SpaceXs Falcon rocket, German astronaut Matthias Maurer will become the 600th person in space, according to NASA statistics. He said at a news conference Tuesday that he offered the designation to U.S. crewmate Kayla Barron, who will be the 601st. She and I will be together like No. 600, Maurer said. I was the lucky one that got the round number, but we will all have fun in space, Maurer said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

China offers few new climate targets ahead of UN conference,"WASHINGTON (AP)  China is offering no significant new goals for reducing climate-changing emissions ahead of the UN climate summit set to start next week in Glasgow.  China, the worlds top emitter of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that cause global warming, formally submitted its goals Thursday. The highly-anticipated announcement includes targets previously established in speeches by President Xi Jinping and domestic policy documents. China says it aims to reach peak emissions of carbon dioxide  which is produced mainly through burning coal, oil and natural gas for transportation, electric power and manufacturing  before 2030. The country is aiming for carbon neutrality  no net emissions of CO2  before 2060.  Its not surprising, but it is disappointing that there wasnt anything new in terms of goals, said Joanna Lewis, an expert in China, climate and energy at Georgetown University.  Lewis said the document released today gave more detail about China will meet those goals, however, by measures including increasing its wind and solar power capacity, as well as carbon-absorbing forest cover. Climate experts say key questions about Chinas future carbon emissions remain unanswered.  The document gives no answers on the major open questions about the countrys emissions, said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki. At what level will emissions peak and how fast should they fall after the peak?  
        
     Nations participating in the UN climate conference, known as the 26th Conference of Parties, or COP26, submit what are called nationally determined contributions that lay out emissions reduction plans. Its still possible that China may have additional announcements at the climate summit related to financing for renewable energy overseas, said Lewis. Sam Geall, CEO of nonprofit China Dialogue and associate fellow at Chatham House in London said Chinas pledge is consistent with everything that weve seen from Xi Jinpings previous statements. He and other experts are concerned that pledges on emissions targets and also on financial support to help reduce emissions and adapt to a changing climate, especially for developing countries, are coming in far too late, far too small.  __ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Solar wing jammed on NASA spacecraft chasing asteroids,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is debating whether to try to fix a jammed solar panel on its newly launched Lucy spacecraft, en route to explore an unprecedented number of asteroids. The problem cropped up shortly after the spacecrafts Oct. 16 liftoff on a 12-year journey. After measuring the electric current this week, NASA reported Wednesday that one of Lucys two giant, circular solar panels is only between 75% and 95% extended. A lanyard is holding it in place.  Any attempt at reopening the wing  which is 24 feet in diameter (7 meters)  would not occur before mid-November. So far, the problem has not affected Lucys outbound flight, so theres no rush to figure out the next step, officials said. Everything else on the spacecraft  already 3.7 million miles (6 million kilometers) away  is working properly. The missions lead scientist, Hal Levison of Southwest Research Institute, said the team is encouraged that the combined power from both solar panels is keeping the spacecraft healthy and functioning. Its too early to determine longer range implications to the entire mission, Levison said in an email Thursday. While the problem is concerning, our team is working this very diligently and carefully to find a workable solution. The nearly $1 billion mission seeks to explore seven so-called Trojan asteroids that share Jupiters orbit around the sun and another space rock closer to home. Lucy should swoop within 600 miles (965 kilometers) of each target. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Japans new flagship H3 rocket reaches orbit in a key test after failed debut last year,"TOKYO (AP)  Japans flagship H3 rocket reached orbit and released two small observation satellites in a key second test following a failed debut launch last year, buoying hope for the country in the global space race. The H3 rocket blasted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on time Saturday morning, two days after its originally scheduled liftoff was delayed by bad weather. The rocket successfully reached orbit at an altitude of about 670 kilometers (about 420 miles) and released two satellites, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, said.  An H3 rocket lifts off at Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima, southern Japan Saturday, Feb. 17, 2024. (Kyodo News via AP) An H3 rocket lifts off at Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima, southern Japan Saturday, Feb. 17, 2024. (Kyodo News via AP) We feel so relieved to be able to announce the good results, JAXA President Hiroshi Yamakawa told a news conference.  The H3s main missions are to secure independent access to space and be competitive as international demand for satellite launches grows. We made a big first step today toward achieving that goal, Yamakawa said. The launch is a boost for Japans space program following a recent streak of successes, including a historic precision touchdown on the moon of an unmanned spacecraft last month. The liftoff was closely watched as a test for Japans space development after H3, in its debut flight last March, failed to ignite the second-stage engine. JAXA and its main contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have been developing H3 as a successor to its current mainstay, H-2A, which is set to retire after two more flights. As the rocket soared and released its first payload successfully, project members at the JAXA command center cheered and hugged each other in livestreaming footage. NHK television showed some staff at a press center crying with relief and joy.  
        
     JAXA H3 project manager Masashi Okada called the result perfect, saying H3 cleared all missions set for Saturdays flight. After a long wait, the newborn H3 finally had its first cry. I now feel a heavy load taken off my shoulders. But now is the real start for H3, and we will work to steadily improve it, Okada said. The H3 No. 2 rocket was decorated with thousands of stickers carrying messages sent from well-wishers around the country. Two microsatellites  observation satellite CE-SAT-IE, developed by Canon Electronics, and TIRSAT, which was co-developed by a number of companies and universities  were piggybacked on the H3 Saturday. Their makers said they were willing to take the chance as they see a growing market in the satellite business. The 57-meter (187-feet) -long H3 is designed to carry larger payloads than H-2A at much lower costs of about 50 billion yen ($330 million), to be globally competitive.  Masayuki Eguchi, head of defense and space segment at Mitsubishi Heavy, said his company hopes to achieve better price competitiveness after about a dozen more launches.  Im delighted to see this incredible accomplishment in the space sector right after the success of the SLIM moon landing, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on X, formerly Twitter. I expect the Japanese mainstay rocket will steadily make achievement. Last month, a H-2A rocket successfully placed a spy satellite into its planned orbit, and days later JAXAs unmanned spacecraft SLIM made the worlds first pinpoint moon landing then captured lunar data.",https://apnews.com/article/japan-space-rocket-h3-launch-fe05ba22d3c0299e5712eef9864d18f9,science
Space telescope spies neutron star in the debris of famous supernova,"Scientists have confirmed what became of a star that exploded in a stunning supernova visible to Earth more than three decades ago: It morphed into a neutron star, one of the oddest objects in the universe.  In 1987, a star in a nearby galaxy went supernova and its fiery demise was detected in Earths nighttime sky with the naked eye for months. Scientists figured when its core collapsed, the remnants would turn into one of two things: a black hole, where nothing escapes; or a neutron star, the most dense object in the universe besides a black hole.  The trouble was there was so much debris, astronomers couldnt see past the dust. But NASAs Webb Space Telescope cut through the clutter by peering in infrared light and saw two telltale chemical signatures  argon and sulfur  of a pulsing super-hot neutron star, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science. Since the explosion was recent and well-tracked, this discovery should help astronomers better understand this type of cosmic oddball and its predecessors that helped seed the universe with important elements such as carbon and iron.  This neutron star is only 12 miles (20 kilometers) from end to end, yet weighs 1 1/2 times our sun. Its densely packed with little space between parts of its atoms. The aftermath of the so-called supernova 1987A is likely the only time modern astronomy has witnessed the birth and early years of a neutron star, even though there are closer but older ones in our own galaxy, scientists said.  
        
     Besides the black hole, these are the most exotic objects we have in the universe, said lead author Claes Fransson, an astrophysicist at Stockholm University in Sweden. We know about these objects from the 1960s, but we havent seen any of them being really formed. Images of the distant supernova remnant shows what Fransson calls a ring of pearls encircling a cloud of dust. Somewhere in the middle of that dust is the neutron star, he said. Scientists had long suspected the collapsed core was now a neutron star. But this measurement by the Webb telescope, even though it isnt a direct image of the neutron star, provides a pretty definitive answer, Fransson and outside scientists said. The case for a neutron star is well-made, said Stanford University astrophysicist Roger Blandford, who wasnt part of the study. Because the supernova explosion was so recent and close, it is a gift that keeps on giving, teaching us about neutrinos, the evolution of stars and now what happens following the explosion, Blandford said in an email.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

Jupiters monster storm not just wide but surprisingly deep,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Jupiters Great Red Spot, a storm so big it could swallow Earth, extends surprisingly deep beneath the planets cloud tops, scientists reported Thursday.  NASAs Juno spacecraft has discovered that the monster storm, though shrinking, still has a depth of between 200 miles (350 kilometers) and 300 miles or so (500 kilometers.) When combined with its width of 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers), the Great Red Spot resembles a fat pancake in new 3D images of the planet.  The missions lead scientist, Scott Bolton of Southwest Research Institute, said there might not be a hard cutoff at the bottom of the storm.  It probably fades out gradually and keeps going down, Bolton said at a news conference. The research was published Thursday in the journal Science. The Great Red Spot is probably the tallest Jovian storm measured so far with Junos microwave and gravity-mapping instruments, Bolton said. Thousands of storms rage across the gas giant at any given time  beautiful and colorful swirls, plumes and filaments covering the entire planet, as seen by the spacecrafts camera. Still ahead for Juno: measuring the depth of the polar cyclones, which might penetrate even deeper beneath the clouds. I wouldnt want to be too quick to guess that weve seen the deepest, Bolton told reporters. But the Great Red Spot is the largest and that makes it special by itself, and you might expect that it might be deeper just because of that. 
        
     By contrast, some of the surrounding jet streams extend an estimated 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) into Jupiter.  Launched in 2011, Juno has been orbiting the solar systems largest planet since 2016. NASA recently extended the mission by another four years, to 2025.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX delays astronaut flight due to rough wind, waves","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX has bumped its next astronaut flight for NASA until Wednesday because of rough wind and waves hundreds of miles away.  Four astronauts were supposed to blast off early Sunday morning on a six-month mission to the International Space Station. But while the forecast at NASAs Kennedy Space Center was near perfect, a large storm in the Northeast had the sea churning farther up the coast. The safety violation prompted managers on Saturday to move the launch. For crew launches, SpaceX requires good weather all the way up the Eastern Seaboard and across the North Atlantic to Ireland, in case something goes wrong and the capsule has to make an emergency splashdown.  Calmer conditions are expected Wednesday. The one German and three U.S. astronauts will remain at Kennedy until then. This will be SpaceXs fourth astronaut flight for NASA in 1 1/2 years and the companys fifth passenger flight overall. Last month, SpaceX launched its first private flight, sending a billionaire and his three guests into orbit. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"As tiger count grows, Indias Indigenous demand land rights","BENGALURU, India (AP)  It was a celebratory atmosphere for officials gathered just hours away from several of Indias major tiger reserves in the southern city of Mysuru, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Sunday to much applause that the countrys tiger population has steadily grown to over 3,000 since its flagship conservation program began 50 years ago after concerns that numbers of the big cats were dwindling. India is a country where protecting nature is part of our culture, Modi proclaimed. This is why we have many unique achievements in wildlife conservation. Modi also launched the International Big Cats Alliance that he said will focus on the protection and conservation of seven big cat species, namely, the tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard, puma, jaguar and cheetah.  Protesters, meanwhile, are telling their own stories Sunday of how they have been displaced by wildlife conservation projects over the last half-century, with dozens demonstrating about an hour away from the announcement. Project Tiger began in 1973 after a census of the big cats found Indias tigers were fast going extinct through habitat loss, unregulated sport hunting, increased poaching and retaliatory killing by people. Its believed the tiger population was around 1,800 at the time, but experts widely consider that an overestimate due to imprecise counting methods in India until 2006. Laws attempted to address the decline, but the conservation model centered around creating protected reserves where ecosystems can function undisturbed by people. Several Indigenous groups say the conservation strategies, deeply influenced by American environmentalism, meant uprooting numerous communities that had lived in the forests for millennia.  
        
     Members of several Indigenous or Adivasi groups  as Indigenous people are known in the country  set up the Nagarahole Adivasi Forest Rights Establishment Committee to protest evictions from their ancestral lands and seek a voice in how the forests are managed.  Nagarahole was one of the first forests to be brought under Project Tiger and our parents and grandparents were probably among the first to be forced out of the forests in the name of conservation, said J. A. Shivu, 27, who belongs to the Jenu Kuruba tribe. We have lost all rights to visit our lands, temples or even collect honey from the forests. How can we continue living like this? Jenu, which means honey in the southern Indian Kannada language, is the tribes primary source of livelihood as they collect it from beehives in the forests to sell.  The fewer than 40,000 Jenu Kuruba people are one of the 75 tribal groups that the Indian government classifies as particularly vulnerable. Adivasi communities like the Jenu Kurubas are among the poorest in India.  Some experts say conservation policies that attempted to protect a pristine wilderness were influenced by prejudices against local communities.  The Indian governments tribal affairs ministry has repeatedly said it is working on Adivasi rights. Only about 1% of the more than 100 million Adivasis in India have been granted any rights over forest lands despite a government forest rights law, passed in 2006, that aimed to undo the historical injustice for forest communities. Indias tiger numbers, meanwhile, are thriving: the countrys 3,167 tigers account for more than 75% of the worlds wild tiger population.  Tigers have disappeared in Bali and Java and Chinas tigers are likely extinct in the wild. The Sunda Island tiger, the other sub-species, is only found in Sumatra. Indias project to safeguard them has been praised as a success by many.  Project Tiger hardly has a parallel in the world since a scheme of this scale and magnitude has not been so successful elsewhere, said SP Yadav, a senior Indian government official in charge of Project Tiger.  But critics say the social costs of fortress conservation  where forest departments protect wildlife and prevent local communities from entering forest regions  is high.  Sharachchandra Lele, of the Bengaluru-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, said the conservation model is outdated. There are already several examples of forests used actively by local communities and tiger numbers have actually increased even while people have benefited in these regions, he said.  Vidya Athreya, the director of Wildlife Conservation Society in India who has been studying the interactions between large cats and humans for the last two decades, agreed. Traditionally we always put wildlife over people, Athreya said, adding that engaging with communities is the way forward for protecting wildlife in India.  Shivu, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, also wants to go back to a life where Indigenous communities and tigers lived together. We consider them gods and us the custodians of these forests, he said.  ___ Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi, India, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Sibi Arasu on Twitter at @sibi123 ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Biden plan to sell land leases for conservation gets pushback,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)  Biden administration officials on Monday sought to dispel worries they want to exclude oil drilling, livestock grazing and other activities from vast government-owned lands, as they faced pushback from Republicans and ranchers and over a contentious proposal to put conservation on equal footing with industry. The proposal would allow conservationists and others to lease federally owned land to restore it, much the same way oil companies buy leases to drill and ranchers pay to graze cattle. Leases also could be bought on behalf of companies such as oil drillers who want to offset damage to public land by restoring acreage elsewhere. But more than a century after the U.S. started selling grazing permits and oil and gas leases, the proposal is stirring debate over the best use of public land, primarily in the West. Opponents including Republican lawmakers and agriculture industry representatives are blasting it as a backdoor way to exclude mining, energy development and agriculture.  Tracy Stone-Manning, director of the Bureau of Land Management, told The Associated the proposed changes address rising pressure from climate change and development. She said it would make conservation an equal to grazing, drilling and other uses while not interfering with them. The bureau has a history of industry-friendly policies for the 380,000 square miles (990,000 square kilometers) it oversees, an area more than twice the size of California. It also regulates publicly owned underground minerals, including oil, coal and lithium for renewable energy across more than 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers). 
        
     Those holdings put the agency at the center of arguments over how much development should be allowed. Senior bureau officials on Monday night hosted the first virtual public meeting about the conservation proposal. There was no opportunity for public comment, and questions for officials were screened by the agency. But officials acknowledged receiving numerous queries about grazing and drilling potentially being excluded. Brian St. George, acting assistant director for the bureau, said the conservation leases would not lock up land in perpetuity. It would have a term, and when that restoration goal is met, the term would lapse, he said. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who tried to block Stone-Mannings 2021 Senate confirmation, says the proposed rule is illegal. Earlier this month he berated Interior Secretary Deb Haaland over it during an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, saying she was giving radicals a new tool to shut out the public. The secretary wants to make non-use a use, said Barrasso, the ranking Republican on the committee. She is ... turning federal law on its head. Stone-Manning told the AP that critics were misreading the rule, and that conservation leases would not usurp existing ones. If grazing is now permitted on a parcel, it could continue. And people could still hunt on the leased property or use it for recreation, she said. It makes conservation an equal among the multiple uses that we manage for, Stone-Manning said. There are rules around how we do solar development. There are rules around how we do oil and gas. There have not been rules around how we deliver on the portions of (federal law) that say, Manage for fish and wildlife habitat, manage for clean water. Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada  where the federal land bureau controls about two thirds of the land  urged the administration to work with ranchers and farmers before finalizing the proposal, which the National Cattlemens Beef Association said would upend land management in the West. While the bureau previously issued leases for conservation in limited cases, it has never had a dedicated program for it. Former President Donald Trump tried to ramp up fossil fuel development on bureau lands, but President Joe Biden suspended new oil and gas leasing when he entered office. Biden later revived the deals to win West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchins support for last years climate law. Biden remains under intense pressure from Manchin and many Republicans to allow more drilling. Such companies currently hold leases across some 37,500 square miles (97,000 square kilometers) of bureau land. The pending rule also would promote establishing more areas of critical environmental concern due to their historic or cultural significance, or their importance for wildlife conservation. More than 1,000 such sites covering about 33,000 square miles (85,000 square kilometers) have been designated previously. By comparison, about 242,000 square miles (627,000 square kilometers) of bureau land are open to grazing livestock.  Environmentalists have largely embraced the changes, characterizing the proposal as long overdue. Joel Webster with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, a coalition of conservation groups and hunting and fishing organizations, said the administrations plan would set up a process to ensure landscapes are considered for conservation without forcing restrictions.  He cautioned, however, that administration officials must ensure a final rule doesnt have unintended consequences.

"Auschwitz museum begins emotional work of conserving 8,000 shoes of murdered children","OSWIECIM, Poland (AP)  In a modern conservation laboratory on the grounds of the former Auschwitz camp, a man wearing blue rubber gloves uses a scalpel to scrape away rust from the eyelets of small brown shoes worn by children before they were murdered in gas chambers. Colleagues at the other end of a long work table rub away dust and grime, using soft cloths and careful circular motions on the leather of the fragile objects. The shoes are then scanned and photographed in a neighboring room and catalogued in a database. The work is part of a two-year effort launched last month to preserve 8,000 childrens shoes at the former concentration and extermination camp where German forces murdered 1.1 million people during World War II. Most of the victims were Jews killed in dictator Adolf Hitlers attempt to exterminate the Jews of Europe. The site was located during the war in a part of Poland occupied by German forces and annexed to the German Reich. Today it is a memorial and museum managed by the Polish state, to whom the solemn responsibility has fallen to preserve the evidence of the site, where Poles were also among the victims. The Germans destroyed evidence of their atrocities at Treblinka and other camps, but they failed to do so entirely at the enormous site of Auschwitz as they fled the approaching Soviet forces in chaos toward the wars end. Eight decades later, some evidence is fading away under the pressures of time and mass tourism. Hair sheared from victims to make cloth is considered a sacred human remain which cannot be photographed and is not subjected to conservation efforts. It is turning to dust. 
        
     But more than 100,000 shoes of victims remain, some 80,000 of them in huge heaps on display in a room where visitors file by daily. Many are warped, their original colors fading, shoe laces disintegrated, yet they endure as testaments of lives brutally cut short.  The tiny shoes and slippers are especially heartrending. Childrens shoes are the most moving object for me because there is no greater tragedy than the tragedy of children, said Mirosaw Maciaszczyk, a conservation specialist from the museums conservation laboratories.  A shoe is an object closely related to a person, to a child. It is a trace, sometimes its the only trace left of the child. Maciaszczyk said that he and the other conservation workers never lose sight of the human tragedy behind the shoes, even as they focus on the technical aspects of their conservation work. Sometimes they are overcome by emotion and need breaks. Volunteers working with adult shoes in the past have asked for new assignments. Elbieta Cajzer, head of the Collections, said conservation work always turns up some individual details of those killed at the camp  suitcases, in particular, can offer up clues because they bear names and addresses. She expects that the work on childrens shoes will also reveal some new personal details. They also open a window into a bygone era when shoes were a valuable good passed from child to child. Some have traces of mended soles and other repairs. The museum is able to conserve about 100 shoes a week, and has processed 400 since the project began last month. The aim is not to restore them to their original state but to render them as close to how they were found at wars end as possible. Most of the shoes are single objects. One pair still bound by shoelaces is a rarity. Last year, workers conserving adult shoes found an Italian 100 lire banknote in a ladys high-heeled shoe that was also imprinted with the name Ranzini, which was a shoe manufacturer in Trieste. The owner was likely Italian, but nothing else is known about her.  They also found the name of Vra Vohryzkov on a childs shoe. By coincidence, a museum worker had noticed that family name on a suitcase and the museum was able to piece together details about the family. Vera was born Jan. 11, 1939, into a Jewish Czech family and was sent to Auschwitz in a transport from the Theresienstadt ghetto in 1943 with her mother and brother. Her father, Max Vohryzek, was sent in a separate transport. They all perished. Cajzer described the shoes as powerful testimony also because the huge heaps of shoes that remain give some idea of the enormous scale of the crimes, even though what is left is only a fraction of what was. Before the SS men sent people into the gas chambers, they ordered them to undress and told them they were going into showers to be disinfected. We are able to imagine how many people came here, hoping that they would be able to put those shoes back on after a shower. They thought they would take their shoes back and keep using them. But they never returned to their owners, Cajzer said. In most cases, the shoes and other possessions were collected and the material used to help the Third Reich in its war effort. The 110,000 shoes in the museums collection  while massive  most likely came from only the last transports to the camp, Cajzer said. The projects cost of 450,000 euros ($492,000) is funded by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, to which Germany has been a key donor, as well as the International March of the Living, a Holocaust education program. Both Cajzer and Maciaszczyk said that it is impossible to save the shoes forever, but the goal is to preserve them for more years to come.  Our conservation today slows down these processes (of decay), but for how long, its hard to say, Maciaszczyk said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the APs collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

"As another cheetah dies in India, authorities try to get ambitious conservation project on track","BENGALURU, India (AP)  An eighth cheetah death in Indias Kuno National Park last Friday has raised new questions about a project that reintroduced the big cats to the country 10 months ago and has been mired in controversy since its inception.  The latest death was caused by an infestation under a cheetahs radio collar due to humid and wet weather conditions in central India, according to veterinarians from South Africa who are closely involved with the project. The Indian government said the cheetah deaths being caused by an infection under their radio collar is speculation and hearsay. Maggot wounds, dehydration, infighting and kidney disease have been some of the causes of death of five adults and three of the four cubs born to a female cheetah earlier this year. Earlier last week, another adult cheetah was found dead, likely also due to an infestation. Since then, local forest authorities are trying to tranquilize the remaining cheetahs to check for any diseases. Local media reports say a few more of the animals have similar infections. One South African veterinary wildlife specialist who was instrumental to the animals relocation said vets were treated like window dressing for the project  rather than being consulted about any health issues  until recently.  Adrian Tordiffe said things changed after Y.V. Jhala, an Indian scientist who devised the reintroduction program, was terminated from his role in the project in February. 
        
     Ever since Professor Jhala was suddenly removed from the project, the Indian authorities have completely shut us out, said Tordiffe. This lack of information meant the diagnosis was delayed which potentially puts other cheetahs at risk. In a press statement last week, Indias environment ministry said consultation with international cheetah experts is done on a regular basis. Tordiffe said communications between him and other scientists and officials has improved in the last few days.  Its important to have a constant line of communication with people in Africa who have expertise with these animals, said N.V.K. Ashraf, chief veterinary officer at Wildlife Trust of India. The cheetah will be a difficult species to relocate and make a viable population grow. The project garnered concern even before the cheetahs arrival on Prime Minister Narendra Modis birthday in September last year when wildlife experts questioned the viability of the animals surviving in India.  Controversies around the project only increased as several of the animals died and many cheetahs strayed outside the national park only to be tranquilized and brought back repeatedly.  Indias grasslands conservation policies  which include the relocation project  are inadequate, said Abi T Vanak, of the Bengaluru-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment.  The country enacted several conservation laws to protect wildlife in the 1970s, but these were focused on charismatic species like the tiger or elephant, and neither grasslands nor other species dependent on the ecosystem got the same protection. Most savannah grasslands continue to be classified as wastelands and that needs to change, Vanak said. As things stand, this is shaping up to be a novelty project. Other endangered species could use all this attention and conservation funds. Critically endangered species such as the Great Indian Bustard as well as other endangered species such as the black buck or Indian antelope, chinkara or Indian gazelle, the lesser florican and many other wildlife depend on the existence of Indian grasslands for their survival. The national park where the cheetahs are at was also originally meant as relocation spot for lions from the Gir forest in Indias western Gujarat state.  The lions are the last of the Asiatic lion species that once spread all the way to Iran. Scientists have long warned that the isolated population is at risk of extinction due to threats ranging from disease to climate extremes. To me this project is not about conserving cheetahs but rather stalling the translocation of lions, said Ravi Chellam, a wildlife biologist and conservation scientist with more than four decades of experience with big cats. In April 2013, Indias top court ordered that some lions from the Gir forest should be moved to Kuno National Park further inland within six months. The court also ruled that introducing African cheetahs to Kuno before the Asiatic lion is arbitrary and illegal and a clear violation of the statutory requirements provided under Indias wildlife protection act. The lions remain in Gujarat and plans are being reviewed. Tordiffe, the South African veterinarian, is still optimistic about the cheetah project and said some deaths are to be expected.  By no means are we at a critical level yet where the project is doomed to failure. But there are certainly areas where we must improve in terms of active management and if we do so, I still believe that the project can succeed, he said. There are less than 7,000 adult cheetahs left in the wild globally, and they now inhabit less than 9% of their original range. Speaking to The Associated Press in September last year, Vincent van der Merwe, manager of the Cheetah Metapopulation Initiative said the long-term goal was to have a cheetah population of at least 500 which meant sending up to a dozen animals every year to India from South Africa.  But at least 4,000 square kilometers of good quality habitat needs to be prepared before any more cheetahs are brought into India, Chellam said. The Kuno national park is 748 square kilometers.  Lessons need to be learnt from the experience so far, so that we dont lose more animals, he said. ___ Associated Press writer Aniruddha Ghosal in Hanoi, Vietnam contributed to this report.  ___ Follow Sibi Arasu on Twitter at @sibi123 ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Scientists tinker with evolution to save Hawaii coral reefs,"COCONUT ISLAND, Hawaii (AP)  Scientists at a research center on Hawaiis Coconut Island have embarked on an experiment to grow super coral that they hope can withstand the hotter and more acidic oceans that are expected with global warming. The quest to grow the hearty coral comes at a time when researchers are warning about the dire health of the worlds reefs, which create habitats for marine life, protect shorelines and drive tourist economies. When coral is stressed by changing environmental conditions, it expels the symbiotic algae that live within it and the animal turns white or bright yellow, a process called bleaching, said Ruth Gates, director of the Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawaii. If the organisms are unable to recover from these bleaching events, especially when they recur over several consecutive years, the coral will die. Gates estimated that about 60 to 80 percent of the coral in Kaneohe Bay has bleached this year. The bleaching has intensified and got much more serious, said Gates of the coral around the bay. Where they once looked for the bleached coral among the healthy, Gates said her team is now looking for the healthy individuals in a sea of pale corals. Gates and her team are taking the coral to their center on the 29-acre isle, once a retreat for the rich and famous and home to televisions Gilligans Island, and slowly exposing them to slightly more stressful water. 
        
     They bathe chunks of coral that theyve already identified as having strong genes in water that mimics the warmer and more acidic oceans. They are also taking resilient strains and breeding them with one another, helping perpetuate those stronger traits. The theory they are testing is called assisted evolution, and while it has been used for thousands of years on other plants and animals, the concept has not been applied to coral living in the wild. Weve given them experiences that we think are going to raise their ability to survive stress, Gates said. She said they hope to see these corals, which will soon be transplanted into the bay, maintain their color, grow normally and then reproduce next summer. In early October, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that coral reefs worldwide are experiencing bleaching, calling the event extensive and severe. We may be looking at losing somewhere in the range of 10 to 20 percent of the coral reefs this year, NOAA coral reef watch coordinator Mark Eakin said when the report was released. Hawaii is getting hit with the worst coral bleaching they have ever seen. And this is the second consecutive year Hawaii has experienced widespread bleaching. Scientists say some coral has already fallen victim to global warming. About 30 percent of the worlds population has already perished as a result of above average ocean temperatures, El Ninos effects and acidification. Gates and her team understand the challenges of scalability and time. Having success locally does not necessarily mean they will be able to scale their project to address a massive, global marine crisis before much of the worlds coral reefs are already gone. Tom Oliver, a marine biologist and team leader at NOAAs Coral Reef Ecosystem Division, said the project is scalable with the requisite amount of effort and funding. He said, the question is not can they do it, its can they do it fast enough? Oliver said that many reef restoration projects struggle because of the cost and time involved with raising standard coral and planting it in the ocean. Restoration needs to have brood stock that can handle the changing conditions on reefs, he said. Gates said more research needs to be done before they can begin to address scalability. In 2013, Gates and her Australian counterpart Dr. Madeleine van Oppen, who does coral research at the Australia Institute of Marine Science, won the $10,000 Paul G. Allen Ocean Challenge for their proposal to assist coral evolution. Allens foundation then asked them for a proposal to fully fund the idea, which they eventually did with a $4 million grant in June. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, has various climate-related projects in his philanthropic portfolio. Hawaiis Gates said that while the goal of their project is to help coral survive global warming, there is still a need to end humans reliance on fossil fuels and to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gasses that cause global warming. Even if we stopped all greenhouse gas emissions today, there is still this lag in the atmosphere where climate change will continue for probably hundreds of years, Van Oppen said. Its hard to imagine its not going to get worse. ___ Follow Caleb Jones: https://twitter.com/CalebAP",https://apnews.com/article/environment-hawaii-animals-biology-science-e0313f73cea244e9917f4cb1ffc9f316,science
Fossil footprints puzzle scientists: Bear or ancient human?,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Prehistoric footprints that have puzzled scientists since the 1970s are getting a second look: Were they left by extinct animals or by human ancestors?  When famed paleontologist Mary Leakey first uncovered the footprints in Tanzania 40 years ago, the evidence was ambiguous.  Leakey focused her attention instead on other fossil footprints that could be more clearly linked to early humans. Those footprints, found at a site called Laetoli G, are the first clear evidence of early humans walking upright.  Decades later, a new team re-excavated the confusing footprints, found at a site called Laetoli A, and made photos and 3-D scans available for other researchers to continue the debate.  The research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. These footprints have been in the mystery category for 40 years, said Rick Potts, who directs the Smithsonian Institutions Human Origins Project. Its a really exciting idea to re-exhume them and study them again, added Potts, who was not involved in the research. Whats long perplexed scientists is that those tracks  broad footprints with enlarged fifth toes and estimated to be around 3.7 million years old  dont closely match anything scientists have elsewhere identified. They didnt have the right weight and foot movement to be easily identified as human, so other explanations were sought, including that they may belong to an extinct species of bears, said co-author and Dartmouth paleoanthropologist Jeremy DeSilva.  
        
     He and other researchers returned to the site in 2019 and used Leakeys original maps to locate the enigmatic prints, preserved in a layer of volcanic ash that had cooled and hardened.  Co-author Ellison McNutt of Ohio University studied the foot mechanics of black bear cubs at a wildlife rescue center in New Hampshire to see whether a small bear walking on hind legs could leave similar footprints. She held a tray of apple sauce to lure the cubs into walking toward her. Each footstep was recorded in a track of mud, to be analyzed.  Bears walking upright first put weight on the heels of their feet, like humans, she said. But the foot proportions arent the same. She concluded that the fossil footprints were not left by bears. Other factors, such as the spacing of the footprints, led the study authors to conclude that that the footprints were left by a previously unknown species of a very early human ancestor. Not everyone is convinced.  Smithsonians Potts said its a toss-up between an ancient bear or an ancient human, adding that an ancient bear may have walked differently than a modern black bear.  William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the research, said he was convinced that it wasnt a bear, but wasnt certain it was an early human.

Spacewalking astronauts replace antenna after debris scare,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Spacewalking astronauts replaced a broken antenna outside the International Space Station on Thursday after getting NASAs all-clear for orbiting debris.  U.S. astronauts Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron were supposed to complete the job Tuesday, but NASA delayed the spacewalk because of potentially threatening space junk. NASA later determined the astronauts were safe to go out, despite a slightly increased risk of a punctured suit from satellite wreckage.  But soon after the spacewalk ended, Mission Control notified the crew that the station would need to move into a slightly lower orbit Friday to avoid an old U.S. rocket fragment.  Last month, Russia destroyed an old satellite in a missile test, sending pieces everywhere. NASA isnt saying whether that event was the source of the junk that delayed the spacewalk. During the first National Space Council meeting under Vice President Kamala Harris this week, top U.S. government officials joined her in condemning Russias extensive debris-scattering last month. More than 1,700 sizable pieces of the shattered satellite are being tracked, with tens if not hundreds of thousands too small to see. Barron reported at least 11 small debris strikes to the failed antenna that was removed during the spacewalk, with some of the holes looking old. The device  up there for more than 20 years  malfunctioned in September. 
        
     Marshburn, 61, became the oldest person to conduct a spacewalk. It was the fourth of his career. Barron, a 34-year-old space rookie, ventured out on her first. They flew up on SpaceX last month for a six-month stay. Two other Americans are aboard the space station, along with two Russians and one German. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASAs 10 new astronauts: pilots, doctor, physicist, cyclist","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA selected 10 new astronauts Monday, half of them military pilots, as it looks ahead to the moon and Mars.  The space agency introduced the six men and four women during a ceremony in Houston, home to Mission Control and the astronaut corps.  More than 12,000 applied for the coveted spots. The 10 selected are in their 30s and 40s, and face two years of training before becoming eligible for spaceflight.  Besides the combat and test pilots, the astronaut candidates include a medical physicist, drilling specialist, maritime roboticist, NASA-turned-SpaceX flight surgeon and bioengineer who was a champion cyclist. Two astronauts from the United Arab Emirates will train with them. One of the pilots  Air Force Maj. Marcos Berrios, whos from Puerto Rico  volunteered during a question-and-answer session to fly a life-size successor to NASAs mini helicopter at Mars.  I know Deniz, the other helicopter pilot here, and I would love to take it for a spin for science, he said, drawing laughs and applause from the audience. Navy Lt. Deniz Burnham, an Alaskan, manages drilling projects throughout North America.  NASA has accepted 360 people into its astronaut corps since the original Mercury Seven in 1959. The previous astronaut selection was in 2017. With SpaceX sending astronauts to the International Space Station and other private companies launching tourists on short rides, and NASAs Artemis moon-landing program on the horizon, we are in the golden age right now of human spaceflight, said NASA chief astronaut Reid Wiseman.

High wind delays Michael Strahans space trip with 5 others,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  TV celebrity and former football great Michael Strahan is going to have to wait another few days before rocketing into space.  Strahan was supposed to blast off Thursday from West Texas with five others for the 10-minute flight. But on Wednesday, Jeff Bezos space travel company, Blue Origin, bumped the launch to Saturday because of high wind.  Strahan is a co-host of ABCs Good Morning America and former NFL player. Joining him on the short hop will be Laura Shepard Churchley, the oldest daughter of Americas first astronaut, Alan Shepard, as well as four paying customers. The company hasnt disclosed the price.

"FAA: No more commercial astronaut wings, too many launching","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Heads up, future space travelers: No more commercial astronaut wings will be awarded from the Federal Aviation Administration after this year. The FAA said Friday its clipping its astronaut wings because too many people are now launching into space and its getting out of the astronaut designation business entirely. The news comes one day ahead of Blue Origins planned liftoff from West Texas with former NFL player and TV celebrity Michael Strahan. He and his five fellow passengers will still be eligible for wings since the FAA isnt ending its long-standing program until Jan. 1. NASAs astronauts also have nothing to worry about going forward  theyll still get their pins from the space agency. All 15 people who rocketed into space for the first time this year on private U.S. flights will be awarded their wings, according to the FAA. That includes Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos and Virgin Galactics Richard Branson, as well as the other space newbies who accompanied them on their brief up-and-down trips. The companies handed out their own version of astronaut wings after the flights. All four passengers on SpaceXs first private flight to orbit last September also qualified for FAA wings.  Adding Blue Origins next crew of six will bring the list to 30. The FAA s first commercial wings recipient was in 2004. Earlier this year, the FAA tightened up its qualifications, specifying that awardees must be trained crew members, versus paying customers along for the ride. But with the program ending, the decision was made to be all-inclusive, a spokesman said. 
        
     Future space tourists will get their names put on a FAA commercial spaceflight list. To qualify, they must soar at least 50 miles (80 kilometers) on an FAA-sanctioned launch. The U.S. commercial human spaceflight industry has come a long way from conducting test flights to launching paying customers into space, the FAAs associate administrator Wayne Monteith said in a statement. Now its time to offer recognition to a larger group of adventurers daring to go to space. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Strahan flies to space with astronauts daughter: Wow!,"Football star and TV celebrity Michael Strahan caught a ride to space with Jeff Bezos rocket-launching company Saturday, sharing the trip with the daughter of Americas first astronaut. TOUCHDOWN has a new meaning now!!! he tweeted after landing. Blue Origins New Shepard rocket blasted off from West Texas, sending the capsule on a 10-minute flight with the two VIP guests and four paying customers. Their automated capsule soared to an altitude of 66 miles (106 kilometers), providing a few minutes of weightlessness before parachuting into the desert. The booster also came back to land successfully. It was five minutes and 50 miles (187 kilometers) shorter than Alan Shepards Mercury flight from Floridas Cape Canaveral on May 5, 1961. His eldest daughter, Laura Shepard Churchley, took along a tiny piece of his Freedom 7 capsule as well as mementos from his Apollo 14 moonshot. She also packed some golf balls; her dad hit a couple on the lunar surface. A co-host of ABCs Good Morning America, Strahan bubbled over with excitement in updates for the show all week. He took along his Super Bowl ring and retired New York Giants jersey No. 92. Bezos stashed a football on board that will go to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. As soon as he emerged from the capsule, Strahan said he wanted to go again. But Bezos joked hed have to buy his own ticket next time. In a video he posted later, Strahan called the experience surreal and unbelievable: Wow! Thats all I can say. Wow!  
        
     At the launch complex near Van Horn, Bezos had Light this candle painted on the launch towers bridge, borrowing from Alan Shepards famous gripe from inside Freedom 7 as the delays mounted: Why dont you fix your little problem and light this candle? Shepard Churchley  who volunteered for Blue Origins third passenger flight  borrowed her late fathers phrase, yelling Lets light this candle! while awaiting takeoff. Fierce wind held up her flight for two days. She heads the board of trustees for the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. I thought about Daddy coming down and thought, gosh he didnt even get to enjoy any of what Im getting to enjoy, Shepard Churchley said following touchdown. He was working. He had to do it himself. I went up for the ride! Saturdays launch marks the last one this year by private U.S. companies as space tourism finally takes off. Virgin Galactic kicked it off in July, sending up its billionaire founder, Richard Branson, followed by Blue Origin and SpaceX. So many are flying that the Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday it will no longer designate who is a commercial astronaut or give out wings. Bezos, who founded Amazon six years before Blue Origin, was on his companys debut launch in July. The second, in October, included actor William Shatner  Captain James Kirk of TVs original Star Trek. The late Leonard Nimoys daughter sent up a necklace with a Vulcan Salute charm on Saturdays flight, in honor of the shows original Mr. Spock. Among the the four space tourists paying unspecified millions each were the first parent-child combo: financier Lane Bess and his son Cameron. Also flying: Voyager Space chairman and CEO Dylan Taylor and investor Evan Dick. Blue Origin dedicated Saturdays launch to Glen de Vries, who launched into space with Shatner, but died one month later in a plane crash. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"NASA craft touches sun for 1st time, dives into atmosphere","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  A NASA spacecraft has officially touched the sun, plunging through the unexplored solar atmosphere known as the corona.  Scientists announced the news Tuesday during a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  The Parker Solar Probe  actually flew through the corona in April during the spacecrafts eighth close approach to the sun. Scientists said it took a few months to get the data back and then several more months to confirm.  Fascinatingly exciting, said project scientist Nour Raouafi of Johns Hopkins University. Launched in 2018, Parker was 8 million miles (13 million kilometers) from the center of the sun when it first crossed the jagged, uneven boundary between the solar atmosphere and outgoing solar wind. The spacecraft dipped in and out of the corona at least three times, each a smooth transition, according to scientists. The first and most dramatic time we were below for about five hours ... Now you might think five hours, that doesnt sound big, the University of Michigans Justin Kasper told reporters. But he noted that Parker was moving so fast it covered a vast distance during that time, tearing along at more than 62 miles (100 kilometers) per second. The corona appeared dustier than expected, according to Raouafi. Future coronal excursions will help scientist better understand the origin of the solar wind, he said, and how it is heated and accelerated out into space. Because the sun lacks a solid surface, the corona is where the action is; exploring this magnetically intense region up close can help scientists better understand solar outbursts that can interfere with life here on Earth.  
        
     Preliminary data suggest Parker also dipped into the corona during its ninth close approach in August, but scientists said more analyses are needed. It made its 10th close approach last month. Parker will keep drawing ever closer to the sun and diving deeper into the corona until its grand finale orbit in 2025. The latest findings were also published by the American Physical Society. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

More information will be available later this week, officials said. Webb is awaiting launch aboard an Ariane rocket at the European Space Agencys spaceport in French Guiana. The telescope had been put on top of the rocket last Saturday. Liftoff had been scheduled for Dec. 22.

NASA confirms next Friday for Webb Space Telescope launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA is shooting for next Friday  Christmas Eve  to launch its newest space telescope.  NASA Administrator Bill Nelson confirmed Friday that the James Webb Space Telescope will attempt to blast off on Dec. 24. A European Ariane rocket will provide the lift from South Americas French Guiana.  The $10 billion Webb  considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope  was supposed to soar Saturday, but was jolted by a clamp during launch preparations, resulting in a four-day delay. Then a bad communication link on the rocket had to be fixed, postponing the launch another two days.  U.S. and European space officials signed off Friday on the launch date, following one last round of testing. Nelson expects a smaller crowd at the launch site because of the holidays. Liftoff is scheduled for 7:20 a.m. EST. Since its Christmas Eve, all the congressional delegations that were going down, all of that has evaporated, he told The Associated Press. Even the NASA and contractor team has dwindled, he noted. But hell be there. Already years late in flying, Webb will look back to almost the beginning of time, to when the first stars and galaxies were forming, while also examining the atmospheres of planets orbiting stars closer to home. NASA is partnering with the European and Canadian space agencies on the mega project. Theres so much riding on this, Nelson said, opening up just all kinds of new understanding and revelations about the universe. 
        
     Is there a better Christmas present than seeing the telescope launch? Nelson answered by breaking into song: All I want for Christmas are not my two front teeth, but for the success of JWST -- referring to the telescope by its acronym. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"SpaceX launches Christmas presents, supplies to station","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  SpaceX launched Christmas gifts, goodies and supplies to the International Space Station on Tuesday and got a present in return: the companys 100th successful rocket landing.  The predawn liftoff from NASAs Kennedy Space Center was barely visible in the fog and clouds, as the Falcon rocket hoisted a Dragon capsule loaded with more than 6,500 pounds (2,950 kilograms) of gear for the stations seven astronauts. Several minutes later, the first-stage booster landed upright on an ocean platform, six years to the day that Elon Musks company accomplished its first booster touchdown in 2015.  This particular booster was making its first flight. A few days ago, a SpaceX booster made its 11th flight. Its critical to lower the cost of spaceflight to continue to reuse these boosters more and more times. A hundred is a big milestone, so were excited about that, said SpaceXs Sarah Walker, a mission manager. Were also excited to see how few new boosters we have to produce as the years go by. Among the items due to arrive at the space station Wednesday: Christmas presents from the astronauts families, as well as smoked fish and turkey, green beans and fruitcake for a holiday feast. NASAs space station program manager Joel Montalbano wouldnt divulge anything else. I wont get in front of Santa Claus and tell you whats going to be sent up, he told reporters on the eve of launch. The delivery also includes a laundry detergent experiment. Station astronauts currently trash their dirty clothes; Procter & Gamble Co. is developing a fully degradable detergent for eventual use at the station, on the moon and beyond.

Oil and gas companies would pay more to drill on public lands under new Biden rule,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Oil and gas companies would have to pay more to drill on public lands and satisfy stronger requirements to clean up old or abandoned wells under a new rule announced Thursday by the Biden administration. A rule proposed by the Interior Department raises royalty rates for oil drilling by more than one-third, to 16.67%, in accordance with the sweeping climate law approved by Congress last year. The previous rate of 12.5% paid by oil and gas companies for federal drilling rights had remained unchanged for a century. The federal rate was significantly lower than what many states and private landowners charge for drilling leases on state or private lands. The new rule does not go so far as to prohibit new oil and gas leasing on public lands, as many environmental groups have urged and as President Joe Biden promised during the 2020 campaign. But officials said the proposal would lead to a more responsible leasing process that provides a better return to U.S. taxpayers. The plan codifies provisions in the climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as the 2021 infrastructure law and recommendations from an Interior report on oil and gas leasing issued in November 2021. The new rule provides a fair return to taxpayers, adequately accounts for environmental harms and discourages speculation by oil and gas companies,' said Laura Daniel-Davis, principal deputy assistant Interior secretary for land and minerals management. 
        
     Interior is committed to creating a more transparent, inclusive and just approach to leasing and permitting that serves the public interest while protecting natural and cultural resources on our public lands, she added. The new royalty rate set by the climate law is expected to remain in place until August 2032, after which it can be increased. The higher rate would increase costs for oil and gas companies by an estimated $1.8 billion in that period, according to the Interior Department. The rule also would increase the minimum leasing bond paid by energy companies to $150,000, up from the previous $10,000 established in 1960. The higher bonding requirement is intended to ensure that companies meet their obligations to clean up drilling sites after they are done or cap wells that are abandoned. The previous level was far too low to force companies to act and did not cover potential costs to reclaim a well, officials said. As a result, taxpayers frequently end up covering cleanup costs for abandoned or depleted wells if an operator refuses to do so or declares bankruptcy. Hundreds of thousands of orphaned oil and gas wells and abandoned coal and hardrock mines pose serious safety hazards, while causing ongoing environmental damage.  The Interior Department has made available more than $1 billion in the past two years from the infrastructure law to clean up orphaned oil and gas wells on public lands. The new rule aims to prevent that burden from falling on taxpayers in the future. Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning, whose agency issued the new rule, said the proposal aims to ensure fairness to the taxpayer and balanced, responsible development as we continue to transition to a clean energy economy. It includes common-sense and needed fiscal revisions to BLMs program, many directed by Congress. The BLM, an Interior Department agency, oversees more than 245 million acres of public lands, primarily in the West. Environmental groups hailed the rule change as overdue and said the Biden administration recognized that business as usual by the oil and gas industry is incompatible with increased risks from climate change  a crisis the oil industry played a large role in creating. These changes were badly needed  to put it mildly  and will help make onshore leasing more fair to taxpayers and hold industry accountable for its harms,' said Josh Axelrod of the Natural Resources Defense Council. But he and other advocates said Biden should keep his promise to end new drilling on public lands. In addition to making polluters pay with these fiscal reforms, its time for the Biden administration to align our federal fossil fuel program with Americas transition to a clean energy economy,' said Mattea Mrkusic of Evergreen Action, another environmental group.  The oil industry said the rule change would discourage oil and gas production in the United States. Responsible development of federal lands is critical for meeting the growing demand for affordable, reliable energy while reducing (greenhouse gas) emissions,' said Holly Hopkins, vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group. Amidst a global energy crisis, this action from the Department of the Interior is yet another attempt to add even more barriers to future energy production,' she said.  The proposal issued Thursday follows an Interior report on federal oil and gas leasing issued in November 2021. Biden ordered the report soon after taking office in January 2021 as he directed a pause in federal oil and gas lease sales, citing worries about climate change. The moratorium drew sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry, even as many environmentalists and Democrats urged Biden to make the leasing pause permanent. The moratorium was overturned by the courts, and oil and gas lease sales have resumed, including some mandated by the climate law in a compromise with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. A separate Biden administration proposal would put conservation on equal footing with industry on public lands. A BLM plan would allow conservationists and others to lease federally owned land to restore it, much the same way oil companies buy leases to drill and ranchers pay to graze cattle.  Environmentalists say the plan would benefit wildlife, outdoor recreation and conservation, but critics, including Republican lawmakers and the agriculture industry, say it could exclude mining, energy development and agriculture.  The rules on oil and gas and public lands use are both expected to become final next year.",https://apnews.com/article/oil-gas-drilling-public-lands-climate-wells-ceb61d62aecf09d9ba4cb72d0d7f39f4,science
High wind postpones launch of NASAs newest space telescope,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Dangerously high wind will keep NASAs newest space telescope on the ground for at least an extra day, with the launch now targeted for Saturday  Christmas Day  at the earliest. NASA announced the latest delay Tuesday. Upper-level high wind could force a rocket off-course or even damage or destroy it. The James Webb Space Telescope will soar from French Guiana on South Americas northeastern coast, aboard a European Ariane rocket. Launch managers will meet again Wednesday to assess the weather.  The $10 billion infrared observatory is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, in orbit since 1990. During a news conference Tuesday, NASA officials said the rocket and telescope were in good shape, and that the only lingering, though tolerable problem was an intermittent communication relay between the two. The issue earlier forced a two-day delay; a clamp that inadvertently jolted the telescope at the launch site had prompted a four-day slip.  These last-minute snags come after years of delays and cost overruns for Webb, the biggest and most powerful science observatory ever built for space.

A travel guides warning to avoid Lake Tahoe may jolt the region into managing huge tourist crowds,"SAND HARBOR, Nev. (AP)  Lake Tahoe tourism officials were surprised, and a bit miffed, when a respected international travel guide put the iconic alpine lake straddling the California-Nevada line on its list of places to stay away from this year because of the harmful ecological effects of overtourism.  But with an influx of visitors and new full-time residents due to the COVID-19 pandemic already forcing local leaders to revisit the decades-old conversation about overcrowding, Fodors No List 2023 may have served as a wake-up call that some sort of change is necessary.  I cant go to my own beaches anymore, said Susan Daniels, 70, a lifelong resident of Kings Beach, California, whose parents met at a Tahoe-area ski resort in 1952. That includes her favorite, Sand Harbor, which lies just across the Nevada border and is known for its turquoise water and rock formations. I cannot go to Sand Harbor, where I grew up, unless I get in line at 7 in the morning.  Since Fodors declared last November that Lake Tahoe has a people problem, some unlikely voices have expressed a new willingness to consider taxes or fees on motorists  a nonstarter not long ago.  Meanwhile, local business and tourism officials are lining up behind a new effort to persuade people to check out less trafficked parts of the lake and to visit outside of high season.  The idea is to preserve a $5 billion local economy built around the tourists who come to hike, camp, boat, bike, ski and gamble, while also easing their impact on the environment and communities. Roughly one-third the size of the Sierra Nevadas also-crowded Yosemite National Park, the Lake Tahoe Basin gets about three times as many visitors  around 15 million each year.  We know that we really need to get out of the tourism marketing business and get into the tourism management business, said Carol Chaplin, CEO of the Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority.  Visitors to Lake Tahoe fill a section of Sand Harbor in the Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park in Incline Village, Nev. (AP Photo/Andy Barron) Visitors to Lake Tahoe fill a section of Sand Harbor in the Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park in Incline Village, Nev. (AP Photo/Andy Barron) And that has a lot to do with the Fodors article, really. How are we managing our tourism? she said. Not that it is overtourism  I think that was a little bit shocking. But we are not denying some of that.  This month saw the unveiling of the Lake Tahoe Destination Stewardship Plan, a 143-page document backed by a broad coalition of more than a dozen conservation, business, governmental and private entities that prioritizes sustainably preserving the goose that lays the golden egg  the twinkling cobalt waters that turn blue-green near the lakes 72 miles (115 kilometers) of shoreline.  Two years in the works and full of ideas but short on specifics, the document has as one emphasis easing traffic gridlock, which causes not only parking nightmares but increased air pollution and lake sedimentation.  The plan also considers measures adopted by other tourist destinations, such as requiring reservations, timed-entry permits and capacity limits. But were not a national park, said Amy Berry, CEO of the nonprofit Tahoe Fund. We dont have gates. Were not going to ever shut the door on folks. The document does not carry the weight of law, and there is no enforcement mechanism to ensure the aspirations it lays out come to fruition. Traffic moves along Tahoe Boulevard in Stateline, Nev. (AP Photo/Andy Barron) Traffic moves along Tahoe Boulevard in Stateline, Nev. (AP Photo/Andy Barron) Tahoe officials have talked this way before. But they insist this times different. Congestion has reached such a critical point that its time to adopt user or roadway pricing to limit the vehicles in the basin and incentivize the use of public transit, said Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill in Reno, Nevada, the closest major city, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the lake.  One of an increasing number of people to take that view, Hill knows the idea that would have been dismissed out of hand a decade ago by hotels, casinos, ski resorts and other business concerns opposed to anything that might discourage visitors.  And she acknowledged it wont be easy, especially because of the multiple jurisdictions involved, including five counties in two states, individual towns, regulators, the Coast Guard and the U.S. Forest Service. But honestly, I think people may have recognized we may already be getting to the point of unsustainability, Hill said. When you have folks like Fodors say, `Dont go to Lake Tahoe, thats not good for us as a region. We need folks to visit here, but we need a system to manage them, she said.  Lake Tahoe isnt the only destination to grapple with how to more effectively manage visitors. Hawaii earlier this year debated, but failed to pass, a measure that would have required tourists to pay to visit state parks and trails, with revenue going to maintenance and protection. Berry, Chaplin and others believe two key strategies for managing tourism are encouraging midweek and off-season visits and promoting hidden gems that many tourists have never seen  such as Spooner Lake, an underutilized site above the east shore where a new visitors center and parking lot recently opened.  Theres a lot to explore in the Tahoe Basin, Berry said. You know, its over 200,000 acres. Theres trails. Theres lakes. Lots of things to do.  Theres skepticism, however, about how easily tourists can be nudged off the beaten path.  I dont think it will work, said Jason Kenneweg, 43, a longtime Reno-Sparks resident who has spent more than 25 years boating and snowmobiling at Tahoe. They dont want to get out of their cars. Daniels is one of those convinced that some sort of user fee for motorists is inevitable. If you hit peoples pocketbook, it usually has an effect, Daniels said.  So far, few appear to have heeded the travel guides suggestion that one of the worlds deepest lakes, whose contents would be enough to cover the state of California with 14 inches (35 centimeters) of water, could use a break in order to heal and rejuvenate.  Hotel occupancy between December and April, the height of the ski season, was up 12% from last year, Chaplin said, and that included a stretch when visitation fell off or was flat as one of the wettest winters on record snowed in neighborhoods and businesses and buried roads and highways.  The stakes are high for Tahoes ecosystem and way of life, with some longtime residents already having left, fed up with the traffic jams, packed supermarkets and soaring housing costs.  After years of joining Daniels at public meetings to advocate for the protection of the lake, Ellie Waller finally had enough and moved to the Carson Valley, south of Reno.

"GOP measures would undo protections for endangered lesser prairie chicken, northern bat","WASHINGTON (AP)  Congress has approved two measures to undo federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken and northern long-eared bat  two endangered animals that have seen their populations plummet over the years.  In separate votes Thursday, the House gave final legislative approval to rescind protections for the lesser prairie chicken  a rare prairie bird once thought to number in the millions, but now hover around 30,000, officials said  and the long-eared bat, one of 12 bat types decimated by a fungal disease called white-nose syndrome. The legislative actions, backed mostly by Republicans, represent rare congressional involvement in matters usually left to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The Endangered Species Act tasks the agencies with deciding which animals and plants to list as endangered or threatened and how to rebuild their populations. The lesser prairie chicken, which belongs to the grouse family, is found in parts of the Midwest and Southwest, including one of the countrys most prolific oil and gas fields  the oil-rich Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas. The birds range also extends into parts of Colorado, Oklahoma and Kansas, but has diminished across about 90% of its historical range, officials said. The House voted 221-206 to reverse protections for the prairie bird.  A separate 220-209 vote would overturn protections for the northern long-eared bat, which has seen its population reduced by 97% or more in some areas because of white-nose syndrome. The bat is found in 37 eastern and north-central states, plus Washington, D.C., and much of Canada. 
        
     The House votes follow similar action in the Senate in May and send both plans to President Joe Biden, who has threatened to veto both resolutions.  Overturning protections for the lesser prairie chicken would undermine Americas proud wildlife conservation traditions, risk the extinction of a once-abundant American bird and create uncertainty for landowners and industries who have been working for years to forge the durable, locally led conservation strategies that this rule supports, the White House said in a statement. In a separate statement, the White House said bats are critical to healthy, functioning ecosystems and contribute at least $3 billion annually to the U.S. agriculture economy through pest control and pollination.' Overturning protections would risk extinction of a species. Environmentalists have long sought stronger federal protections for the prairie bird, which they consider severely at risk due to oil and gas development, livestock grazing and farming, along with roads and power lines.  The crow-size, terrestrial birds are known for spring courtship rituals that include flamboyant dances by the males as they make a cacophony of clucking, cackling and booming sounds.  White-nose syndrome, meanwhile, has spread across about 80% of the northern bats range and caused a precipitous decline in bat populations. Critics of the endangered listing contend it would hamper logging and other land uses that arent responsible for the bats sharp decline. Rep. Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, called the Endangered Species Act an important but outdated part of U.S. history. The unavoidable truth about the ESA is that a listing means less private investment, which harms conservation efforts,' he said. In the case of the lesser prairie chicken, the protected status is a tool for Fish and Wildlife to go implement the Biden administrations none-of-the- above energy policy,' Westerman said on the House floor. Its another attack on low-cost energy for the American taxpayers. Its an attack on jobs in America and its making us more dependent on hostile countries in the Middle East and South America, he said. Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, the top Democrat on the natural resources panel, said the GOP measures give industry and not science the upper hand in making decisions about endangered species.' He labeled Republican opposition to the Endangered Species Act a vendetta. He also said the two votes on Thursday were egregious since the GOP-controlled House has not taken action to address climate change, even as Arizona and other states suffer through one of the most brutal summers in this countrys recorded history.' Climate change isnt about some distant warning about melting icecaps in the far-off future. The climate crisis is here, it is now,' Grijalva said, noting that Phoenix has set a record with a 27-day streak of temperatures over 110 degree Fahrenheit. People are suffering. People are dying, and the GOP isnt doing a thing about it,' he said. The Republican majority has had zero hearings on climate change since taking over in January and has introduced zero bills to seriously address climate change,' Grijalva said. The House votes follow actions by Congress earlier this year to block a clean water rule imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency and a separate Labor Department measure that allows retirement plan managers to consider the effects of climate change in their investment plans. Biden vetoed both legislative measures.",https://apnews.com/article/prairie-chicken-long-eared-bat-endangered-gop-reverse-protections-0dfd1ea00b4cba0abe39d6893805cf61,science
"6 days after fuel spill reported, most in Tennessee city still cant drink the tap water","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)  Its been six days since residents of a Tennessee city were told that diesel fuel spilled into a local reservoir, and most of them still cant drink their tap water. Many of the 40,000 people who live in the Memphis suburb of Germantown remained under an order Wednesday to avoid using water for everything except flushing toilets. They cant drink or boil tap water, or use it for showering or bathing. Officials advised using bottled water for personal use and the city has been distributing bottled water since Friday. It was not immediately clear when tap water would be deemed safe for use. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation wants to see water samples come back clear of diesel before the advisory is lifted, spokesperson Eric Ward said in an email Wednesday. There have been no reports from officials about people getting sick. The city first told residents on July 20 that a diesel fuel spill at a treatment plant tainted the water supply system. The order came after residents reported a fuel smell in their water. A generator being used at the plant because the facility lost power during recent storms spilled diesel fuel into a reservoir, officials said. A small section of Germantown has been allowed to resume using water. There have been no reports from officials about people getting sick. On Tuesday evening, officials said tests at the plant showed water there was clear of contamination and the city would continue testing the water and begin flushing its system. The announcement was framed by officials as good news  but it was not enough to lift the order. 
        
     We know this situation has been an incredible inconvenience, disrupting the everyday lives of our families and businesses. And we apologize for that, Germantown Mayor Mike Palazzolo said in a video message Tuesday. Frustrated residents have taken to social media to complain about the problems and request a town hall meeting. Michael Wyrick, a 39-year-old accountant who lives with his wife and two daughters in Germantown, said living without tap water has been an adjustment for sure. He said the laundry and dirty dishes have started to pile up  enough for him to take dishes to his Memphis office to clean them. You dont realize how much water you use each day until you are constantly pouring it out of water bottles, Wyrick said via email. Not being able to bathe or shower has been challenging, especially with two young children, but friends and family have been very gracious and opened their homes to us. About 100 gallons of diesel contaminated about 4.2 million gallons of water that was held at the plant, officials have said. A city consultant on Tuesday discovered contamination in soil immediately surrounding a pipe carrying clean water from the treatment plant into the underground reservoir. A breach in the pipe was found and fixed, and the contaminated soil was removed, Public Works Director Bo Mills said. Contaminated water from the fuel spill has been pumped into the Wolf River through stormwater ditches, but officials say that wont seriously harm the river. Based on the amount of diesel fuel involved, total water in the system, and stream flow rate, TDEC does not believe this incident will have any significant impact to the water quality of the Wolf River, said Ward, the environment and conservation department spokesperson. Sarah Houston, executive director of the Protect Our Aquifer water conservation organization, questioned Germantowns decision to put a diesel fuel tank on top of the reservoir. There are lessons that we hope that Germantown takes away from this, and also other utilities in Shelby County, making sure that infrastructure that contains hazardous materials like diesel fuel is sited far away from interaction with drinking water supplies, Houston said. City officials have held a two news conferences, while also releasing video messages and posting details about the water distribution site on social media. But some residents have found the response and information distribution lacking, including answers about when the problem will be resolved, what the fire department does if a house catches fire, and how the problem affects hospitals, said Wyrick, the city resident. While he says he feels lucky to live in Germantown  a predominantly affluent suburb known for good schools  Wyrick does question whether creating a backup plan for the current situation or improving roads has taken a back seat to business expansion and city growth. The city has added restaurants and apartment complexes in recent years, Wyrick noted. This situation has me looking forward to the next election, Wyrick said.",https://apnews.com/article/germantown-fuel-spill-water-advisory-46090a5d57c83238ad56a997781f8515,science
Pope overhauls key institute to reflect his vision of family,"ROME (AP)  Pope Francis has overhauled the Vatican institute most closely associated with the conservative sexual morals promoted by St. John Paul II, saying it was necessary to adapt and expand its mission to address the reality of todays Catholics. Officials said Tuesday the revamped John Paul II Theological Institute for the Marriage and Family Sciences will offer degrees in the social sciences  such as sociology, anthropology, psychology  as well as biology and other sciences, reflecting a vision of the family that goes well beyond strict Catholic theology. The new mission takes its inspirational cues from the vision of marriage and family life contained in Francis controversial 2016 document The Joy of Love. That document called for the church to accompany even those Catholics living in imperfect family situations such as divorce and cohabitation, confirming Francis vision of the church as more of a field hospital for wounded souls than a privileged home for the perfect. As a result, speculation had mounted about the fate of the John Paul II institute. Its founding 1982 mission statement said it was needed to illustrate to the faithful the most perfect image of marriage and family. The institute is affiliated with the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome, but has branches around the world, including in the United States and Australia. Its new mission statement says the church, while remaining faithful to Christs teaching, must look with the understanding of love and wise realism, to the reality of families today in all their complexities, in their light and shadows. 
        
     The inclusion of biological sciences in the curriculum, and a mission statement that cites a focus on human regeneration and care for the planet, suggests that the revamped institute will address human sexuality, the environment and the churchs position on artificial contraception. Already, Francis has authorized a historical study of the 1968 document Humanae Vitae, which articulated the churchs opposition to artificial contraception at a time when the church was under attack by population control activists. The institutes leadership insisted that Francis reboot was evidence of his firm dedication to the institute and not a break from its past. Its a strong gesture that means the institute isnt just tolerated but is relaunched, said the president, Monsignor Pierangelo Sequeri. It wasnt clear how the changes would affect the institutes international branches, some of which have already started the 2017-2018 academic year and offer graduate degrees in theological-focused disciplines that will apparently longer exist.",https://apnews.com/article/marriage-religion-europe-biology-pope-francis-eb25c11280a74abd9453039108df7669,science
Nobel-winning technique like Google Earth for molecules,"NEW YORK (AP)  Three researchers won a Nobel Prize on Wednesday for developing a microscope technique that lets scientists see exquisite details of the molecules that drive life  basically providing a front-row seat to study these tiny performers in their biological dance. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said molecules can be captured down to the level of their atoms, and snapshots can catch them in mid-movement. That can help reveal how they interact. This method has moved biochemistry into a new era, the academy said in awarding its chemistry prize to Switzerlands Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne, German-born U.S. citizen Joachim Frank at New Yorks Columbia University, and Briton Richard Henderson of MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. The detailed images may pave the way for developing new medicines, vaccines and industrial chemicals, but experts said such payoffs are largely in the future. This is a technique that is just starting to find its way into the research community, said Allison A. Campbell, president of the American Chemical Society. It was recently used to reveal the structure of the Zika virus. The method is called cryo-electron microscopy. Its like Google Earth for molecules, Campbell said, because it allows the scientist to zoom in down to the fine detail (giving) that fine resolution that you want to have. 
        
     Other methods have been used before to determine structures of some biological molecules, but they run up against fundamental limitations. The three winners of the $1.1 million (9 million kronor) prize adapted another technique, electron microscopy, which uses a beam of electrons rather than ordinary light to inspect samples. Between 1975 and 1986, Frank developed mathematical models to turn fuzzy two-dimensional images into sharp, three-dimensional ones. Henderson, in 1990, was able to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at atom-level resolution, showing the technologys potential, the Nobel committee said. Dubochet, in the early 1980s, found a way to cool the water in a biological sample so quickly that it solidified without forming the ice crystals that can disrupt the electron beam. Those early advances were followed by others that have greatly improved the technique, the Nobel committee said. Its the first time that we can see biological molecules in their natural environment and how they actually work together down to the individual atoms, said Nobel chemistry committee member Heiner Linke. Henderson said Dubochet kicked off the field; he invented this method of making specimens we now use. Speaking to reporters in Cambridge, England, Henderson also said he felt the three of us have been awarded the prize acting on behalf of the entire field. Frank said he was fully overwhelmed and speechless upon hearing he had won a share of the prize. I thought the chances of a Nobel Prize were minuscule because there are so many other innovations and discoveries that happen almost every day, he said. He said he hasnt yet thought about what to do with the prize money, but added: I was telling my wife that we dont have to worry about a dog sitter anymore. The chemistry prize was the third Nobel announced this week. The medicine prize went to three Americans studying circadian rhythms: Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young. The physics prize went to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for detecting gravitational waves.

Not so sweet: 75 percent of honey samples had key pesticide,"WASHINGTON (AP)  When researchers collected honey samples from around the world, they found that three-quarters of them had a common type of pesticide suspected of playing a role in the decline of bees. Even honey from the island paradise of Tahiti had the chemical. That demonstrates how pervasive a problem the much-debated pesticide is for honeybees, said authors of a study published Thursday in the journal Science. They said it is not a health problem for people because levels were far below governments thresholds on whats safe to eat. What this shows is the magnitude of the contamination, said study lead author Edward Mitchell, a biology professor at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, adding that there are relatively few places where we did not find any. Over the past few years, several studies  in the lab and the field  link insecticides called neonicotinoids (nee-oh-NIH'-kuh-tih-noyds), or neonics, to reduced and weakened honeybee hives, although pesticide makers dispute those studies. Neonics work by attacking an insects central nervous system; Bees and other pollinators have been on the decline for more than a decade and experts blame a combination of factors: neonics, parasites, disease, climate change and lack of a diverse food supply. Honeybees dont just make honey; about one-third of the human diet comes from plants that are pollinated by the insects. Bees pick up the pesticide when they feed on fields grown from treated seeds. As part of a citizen science project, the Swiss researchers asked other experts, friends and relatives to ship them honey samples. More than 300 samples arrived and researchers tested 198 of them for five of the most common types of neonics. 
        
     Overall, 75 percent of the samples had at least one neonic, 45 percent had two or more and 10 percent had four or more. Results varied by region. In North America, 86 percent of samples had the pesticide; Asia, 80 percent; Europe, where theres a partial ban, 79 percent; Africa 73 percent; the Australian region, 71 percent and South America, 57 percent. The study found that nearly half of the honey samples exceeded a level of the pesticide that some previous research said weakens bees, but the pesticide makers say otherwise. An outside expert, University of Nebraskas Judy Wu-Smart, said the study used too few honey samples to make the broad conclusions the researchers did. Ann Bryan, spokeswoman for Syngenta which makes the neonic thiamethoxam, said the amount of the pesticide found in honey samples are 50 times lower than what could cause possible effects on bees. Jeffrey Donald, a spokesman for Bayer Crop Science which makes the neonic clothianidinsaid, said the study perpetuates the myth that exposure to low levels of neonicotinoids implies risk, even though there is no compelling scientific evidence to support this conclusion. The study authors likened neonics to DDT, the pesticide in the 1960s linked to declines in bald eagles and other birds. They said neonics are dangerous to all sorts of insects, even ladybugs. University of Illinois bee expert Sydney Cameron and other scientists said those comparisons arent right because neonics dont stay in an animals system like DDT did and are applied to seeds and not sprayed in mass quantities. This is an important paper if for no other reason that it will attract a great deal of attention to the mounting problem of worldwide dependence on agrochemicals, the side effects of which we know relatively little, Cameron said in an email. She wasnt part of the study. One side benefit of collecting honey is that researchers could sample some. Mitchells favorite is a dark and bitter honey from Africa. He called the honey fantastic, but added I couldnt eat it all the time. It was just too strong. ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

DNA analysis of elephant ivory reveals trafficking networks,"WASHINGTON (AP)  As few as three major criminal groups are responsible for smuggling the vast majority of elephant ivory tusks out of Africa, according to a new study. Researchers used analysis of DNA from seized elephant tusks and evidence such as phone records, license plates, financial records and shipping documents to map trafficking operations across the continent and better understand who was behind the crimes. The study was published Monday in the journal Nature Human Behavior. When you have the genetic analysis and other data, you can finally begin to understand the illicit supply chain  thats absolutely key to countering these networks, said Louise Shelley, who researches illegal trade at George Mason University and was not involved in the research.  Conservation biologist Samuel Wasser, a study co-author, hopes the findings will help law enforcement officials target the leaders of these networks instead of low-level poachers who are easily replaced by criminal organizations. If you can stop the trade where the ivory is being consolidated and exported out of the country, those are really the key players, said Wasser, who co-directs the Center for Environmental Forensic Science at the University of Washington.  Africas elephant population is fast dwindling. From around 5 million elephants a century ago to 1.3 million in 1979, the total number of elephants in Africa is now estimated to be around 415,000.  
        
     A 1989 ban on international commercial ivory trade hasnt stopped the decline. Each year, an estimated 1.1 million pounds (500 metric tons) of poached elephant tusks are shipped from Africa, mostly to Asia. For the past two decades, Wasser has fixated on a few key questions: Where is most of the ivory being poached, who is moving it, and how many people are they? He works with wildlife authorities in Kenya, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and elsewhere, who contact him after they intercept ivory shipments. He flies to the countries to take small samples of tusks to analyze the DNA. He has now amassed samples from the tusks of more than 4,300 elephants trafficked out of Africa between 1995 and today. Thats an amazing, remarkable data set, said Princeton University biologist Robert Pringle, who was not involved in the study. With such data, it becomes possible to spot connections and make strong inferences, he said. In 2004, Wasser demonstrated that DNA from elephant tusks and dung could be used to pinpoint their home location to within a few hundred miles. In 2018, he recognized that finding identical DNA in tusks from two different ivory seizures meant they were harvested from the same animal  and likely trafficked by the same poaching network.  The new research expands that approach to identify DNA belonging to elephant parents and offspring, as well as siblings  and led to the discovery that only a very few criminal groups are behind most of the ivory trafficking in Africa.  Because female elephants remain in the same family group their whole life, and most males dont travel too far from their family herd, the researchers hypothesize that tusks from close family members are likely to have been poached at the same time, or by the same operators. Such genetic links can provide a blueprint for wildlife authorities seeking other evidence  cell phone records, license plates, shipping documents and financial statements  to link different ivory shipments. Previously when an ivory shipment was intercepted, the one seizure wouldnt allow authorities to identify the organization behind the crime, said Special Agent John Brown III of the Office of Homeland Security Investigations, who has worked on environmental crimes for 25 years. But the scientists work identifying DNA links can alert us to the connections between individual seizures, said Brown, who is also a co-author. This collaborative effort has definitely been the backbone of multiple multinational investigations that are still ongoing, he said. They identified several poaching hotspots, including regions of Tanzania, Kenya, Botswana, Gabon and Republic of Congo. Tusks are often moved to warehouses in another location to be combined with other contraband in shipping containers, then moved to ports. Current trafficking hubs exist in Kampala, Uganda; Mombasa, Kenya; and Lome, Togo. Two suspects were recently arrested as a result of one such investigation, said Wasser.  Traffickers that smuggle ivory also often move other contraband, the researchers found. A quarter of large seizures of pangolin scales  a heavily-poached anteater-like animal  are co-mingled with ivory, for instance. Confronting these networks is a great example of how genetics can be used for conservation purposes, said Brian Arnold, a Princeton University evolutionary biologist who was not involved in the research. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Birds learn another language by eavesdropping on neighbors,"WASHINGTON (AP)  For birds, understanding neighborhood gossip about an approaching hawk or brown snake can mean the difference between life or death. Wild critters are known to listen to each other for clues about lurking predators, effectively eavesdropping on other species chatter. Birds, for example, can learn to flee when neighbors cluck hawk!  or, more precisely, emit a distress call. The fairy wren, a small Australian songbird, is not born knowing the languages of other birds. But it can master the meaning of a few key words, as scientists explain in a paper published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. We knew before that some animals can translate the meanings of other species foreign languages, but we did not know how that language learning came about, said Andrew Radford, a biologist at the University of Bristol and co-author of the study. Birds have several ways of acquiring life skills. Some knowledge is innate, and some is acquired from direct experience. Radford and other scientists are exploring a third kind of knowledge: acquiring information from peers. Radford and colleagues at Australia National University wandered around the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra with customized tweeter speakers affixed to their waists, looking for solitary fairy wrens. They wanted to be certain that the birds would react only to sounds, not other birds behavior. 
        
     The scientists first played the birds two unfamiliar recorded sounds. One was the alarm cry of an allopatric chestnut-rumped thornbill, a bird not native to Australia. The other was a computer-generated bird sound dubbed buzz. On first hearing these sounds, the 16 fairy wrens had no particular reaction. The scientists then trotted around the park and continued to play customized recordings. They attempted to train half the birds to recognize the thornbills alarm cry as a warning sound, and the other half to recognize the computer-generated buzz as a distress call. They did that by playing the previously unfamiliar sounds in conjunction with noises that the birds already associated with danger, such as fairy wrens own distress cry. After three days, the scientists tested what the birds had learned  and their feathered pupils passed the test. The two sets of fairy wrens responded to the sound they had been trained on by fleeing for cover, but remained indifferent to the other sound. Twelve of the 16 birds fled at every playback; the other four birds fled in response to two-thirds or more of the playbacks. To put it in human terms, its as though a person who only speaks English had learned that Achtung means attention or danger in German simply by listening to people yell phrases with similar meanings in multiple languages at once. Until this study, we had limited knowledge about how an animal learns what calls from other species actually mean, said Christopher Templeton, a biologist at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, who was not involved in the study. Previous research had shown that fairy wrens can learn the meaning of distress calls when actually encountering a predator. What this new study does is remove the predator entirely. It shows that these birds can learn to associate new sounds with danger, without having to learn through trial and error, said Templeton. In other words, one birds distress tweet can go viral. If you can only learn in the presence of a predator, thats quite dangerous, said Radford, the study co-author. The capacity to learn by associating sounds with meaning makes sense, biologically. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Billionaire who flew SpaceX last year going back into orbit,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The billionaire who launched on his own SpaceX flight last year is headed back up, aiming for an even higher orbit and the chance to take part in a spacewalk. Tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman announced Monday that he will make another private spaceflight launching from NASAs Kennedy Space Center, alongside two SpaceX engineers and a former Air Force fighter pilot.  Its the first of three planned flights to try out new tech  including still-in-the-works spacewalking suits  culminating in the first flight with people of SpaceXs new Starship, which is intended for moon and Mars travel. Isaacman paid undisclosed millions for last Septembers three-day spaceflight for himself and three others, the first space tourism flight for Elon Musks SpaceX. On Monday, Isaacman told reporters that he and the company are sharing costs for the upcoming flight, but declined to elaborate. Plans call for the four to blast off aboard a Falcon rocket no earlier than November. They will circle Earth for up to five days, higher than any previous Dragon capsule or NASA shuttle  the September flight reached more than 360 miles high (585 kilometers), far higher than the International Space Station.  Isaacman would not specify how high his next capsule would reach, but said it would be around the altitude of NASAs two-astronaut Gemini flights in the mid-1960s. Gemini 11 holds the record for the highest astronaut mission outside of the Apollo moonshots: 853 miles (1,373 kilometers). 
        
     For the spacewalk, the entire Dragon capsule will be depressurized just as the Gemini capsules were, with each crew member in pressurized suits. Isaacman declined to say who or how many would venture, tethered, outside the capsule. If we are to have a more permanent presence on the moon and some day build a colony on Mars, we have a lot to learn, including better suit designs, he said. Theyll also use Starlink internet satellites launched by SpaceX to test communication from orbit. Last week, Musk showed off the Starship, the tallest and most powerful rocket built. Hes awaiting clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration before launching it empty from Texas on its first orbital test flight. The FAA said Monday it wont finish its environmental review of the Boca Chica launch and landing site, at the southern tip of Texas, until the end of March. Isaacman indicated that hed like to be aboard the second spaceflight in this program named after the triple-star system Polaris  another Dragon mission  and on the first Starship crew as well.  Lets get Polaris Dawn right and then well think about the next mission, he said. Isaacman hand-picked his three passengers, each of whom helped carry out his September flight: SpaceX employees Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, whose husband was chosen by NASA in December as an astronaut; and Scott Poteet, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel. Poteet also worked for Isaacmans Shift4 Payments company and Draken International, a high-performance aircraft company that Isaacman co-founded. SpaceX plans multiple Starship flights before using the sleek, steel, bullet-shaped rocketship to land NASA astronauts on the moon by around 2025. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Nearly half of US bald eagles suffer lead poisoning,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Americas national bird is more beleaguered than previously believed, with nearly half of bald eagles tested across the U.S. showing signs of chronic lead exposure, according to a study published Thursday.  While the bald eagle population has rebounded from the brink of extinction since the U.S. banned the pesticide DDT in 1972, harmful levels of toxic lead were found in the bones of 46% of bald eagles sampled in 38 states from California to Florida, researchers reported in the journal Science.  Similar rates of lead exposure were found in golden eagles, which scientists say means the raptors likely consumed carrion or prey contaminated by lead from ammunition or fishing tackle.  The blood, bones, feathers and liver tissue of 1,210 eagles sampled from 2010 to 2018 were examined to assess chronic and acute lead exposure.  This is the first time for any wildlife species that weve been able to evaluate lead exposure and population level consequences at a continental scale, said study co-author Todd Katzner, a wildlife biologist at U.S. Geological Survey in Boise, Idaho. Its sort of stunning that nearly 50% of them are getting repeatedly exposed to lead. Lead is a neurotoxin that even in low doses impairs an eagles balance and stamina, reducing its ability to fly, hunt and reproduce. In high doses, lead causes seizures, breathing difficulty and death.  
        
     The study estimated that lead exposure reduced the annual population growth of bald eagles by 4% and golden eagles by 1%. Bald eagles are one of Americas most celebrated conservation success stories, and the birds were removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2007. But scientists say that high lead levels are still a concern. Besides suppressing eagle population growth, lead exposure reduces their resilience in facing future challenges, such as climate change or infectious diseases. When we talk about recovery, its not really the end of the story  there are still threats to bald eagles, said Krysten Schuler, a wildlife disease ecologist at Cornell Universitys College of Veterinary Medicine, who was not involved in the study.  Previous studies  have shown high lead exposure in specific regions, but not across the country. The blood samples from live eagles in the new study were taken from birds trapped and studied for other reasons; the bone, feather and liver samples came from eagles killed by collisions with vehicles or powerlines, or other misfortunes. Lead is present on the landscape and available to these birds more than we previously thought, said co-author Vince Slabe, a research wildlife biologist at the nonprofit Conservation Science Global. A lead fragment the size of the end of a pin is large enough to cause mortality in an eagle.  The researchers also found elevated levels of lead exposure in fall and winter, coinciding with hunting season in many states.  During these months, eagles scavenge on carcasses and gut piles left by hunters, which are often riddled with shards of lead shot or bullet fragments.  Slabe said the upshot of the research was not to disparage hunters. Hunters are one of the best conservation groups in this country, he said, noting that fees and taxes paid by hunters help fund state wildlife agencies, and that he also hunted deer and elk in Montana.  However, Slabe said he hopes the findings provide an opportunity to talk to hunters about this issue in a clear manner and that more hunters will voluntarily switch to non-lead ammunition such as copper bullets. Lead ammunition for waterfowl hunting was banned in 1991, due to concerns about contamination of waterways, and wildlife authorities encouraged the use of nontoxic steel shot. However, lead ammunition is still common for upland bird hunting and big game hunting.  The amount of lead exposure varies regionally, with highest levels found in the Central Flyway, the new study found. At the University of Minnesotas Raptor Center, veterinarian and executive director Victoria Hall said that 85 to 90% of the eagles that come into our hospital have some level of lead in their blood, and X-rays often show fragments of lead bullets in their stomachs.  Eagles with relatively low levels can be treated, she said, but those with high exposure cant be saved.  Laura Hale, board president at nonprofit Badger Run Wildlife Rehab in Klamath County, Oregon, said shell never forget the first eagle she encountered with acute lead poisoning, in 2018. She had answered a residents call about an eagle that seemed immobile in underbrush and brought it to the clinic.  The young bald eagle was wrapped in a blanket, unable to breathe properly, let alone stand or fly.  There is something hideous when you watch an eagle struggling to breathe because of lead poisoning  its really, really harsh, she said, her voice shaking. That eagle went into convulsions, and died within 48 hours. Lead on the landscape affects not only eagles, but also many other birds  including hawks, vultures, ravens, swans and geese, said Jennifer Cedarleaf, avian director at Alaska Raptor Center, a nonprofit wildlife rescue in Sitka, Alaska.  Because eagles are very sensitive to lead, are so well-studied and attract so much public interest, bald eagles are like the canary in the coal mine, she said. They are the species that tells us: We have a bit of problem. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Weather satellite rockets to orbit to monitor US West,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Americas newest weather satellite blasted off Tuesday to improve wildfire and flood forecasting across the western half of the country. Its the replacement for a satellite launched exactly four years ago, which ended up with a cooling line blockage that hindered its main camera. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the new model is redesigned to avoid the problem. It will be designated GOES-18 after reaching an equatorial orbit 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) up. The first images should come next year, following months of testing. This is the third in a nearly $11.7 billion series of four GOES weather satellites that are among the most advanced ever built; the cost includes decades of operation. The first soared in 2016 to track Atlantic hurricanes and other East Coast weather, while the second lifted off March 1, 2018. The fourth is set to launch in 2024. The first two satellites in the series captured video of the rocket soaring out over the Atlantic from Cape Canaveral. The NASA-supported satellites provide the only continuous coverage of weather and hazardous environmental conditions in the Western Hemisphere said NOAA program director Pam Sullivan. Having these multiple ways of looking at the Earth gives us a lot more and a lot better information for these critical forecasts to save lives, protect property, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said following liftoff.  
        
     GOES-17  which is losing as much as 10% of its data because of overheating camera detectors  will be moved aside as an orbiting spare, once the newly launched craft is ready to take its place next year over the Pacific. Each is the size of a small school bus, weighing more than 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilograms). Besides observing conditions here on Earth, the satellites also monitor solar flares and the resulting space weather.  Despite its flaw, GOES-17 beamed back stunning pictures of the Tonga volcanic eruption in January. The new satellite should provide even better images of such events, according to NOAA scientists. Tuesdays liftoff aboard United Launch Alliances Atlas V rocket coincided with the opening of the so-called meteorological spring. The three-month season begins March 1, as defined by meteorologists and climatologists for record-keeping. This years spring equinox falls on March 20. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Space junk on 5,800-mph collision course with moon","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  The moon is about to get walloped by 3 tons of space junk, a punch that will carve out a crater that could fit several semitractor-trailers. The leftover rocket will smash into the far side of the moon at 5,800 mph (9,300 kph) on Friday, away from telescopes prying eyes. It may take weeks, even months, to confirm the impact through satellite images. Its been tumbling haphazardly through space, experts believe, since China launched it nearly a decade ago. But Chinese officials are dubious its theirs. No matter whose it is, scientists expect the object to carve out a hole 33 feet to 66 feet (10 to 20 meters) across and send moon dust flying hundreds of miles (kilometers) across the barren, pockmarked surface. Low-orbiting space junk is relatively easy to track. Objects launching deeper into space are unlikely to hit anything and these far-flung pieces are usually soon forgotten, except by a handful of observers who enjoy playing celestial detective on the side. SpaceX originally took the rap for the upcoming lunar litter after asteroid tracker Bill Gray identified the collision course in January. He corrected himself a month later, saying the mystery object was not a SpaceX Falcon rocket upper stage from the 2015 launch of a deep space climate observatory for NASA. Gray said it was likely the third stage of a Chinese rocket that sent a test sample capsule to the moon and back in 2014. But Chinese ministry officials said the upper stage had reentered Earths atmosphere and burned up. 
        
     But there were two Chinese missions with similar designations  the test flight and 2020s lunar sample return mission  and U.S. observers believe the two are getting mixed up. The U.S. Space Command, which tracks lower space junk, confirmed Tuesday that the Chinese upper stage from the 2014 lunar mission never deorbited, as previously indicated in its database. But it could not confirm the country of origin for the object about to strike the moon. We focus on objects closer to the Earth, a spokesperson said in a statement. Gray, a mathematician and physicist, said hes confident now that its Chinas rocket. Ive become a little bit more cautious of such matters, he said. But I really just dont see any way it could be anything else.  Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics supports Grays revised assessment, but notes: The effect will be the same. Itll leave yet another small crater on the moon. The moon already bears countless craters, ranging up to 1,600 miles (2,500 kilometers). With little to no real atmosphere, the moon is defenseless against the constant barrage of meteors and asteroids, and the occasional incoming spacecraft, including a few intentionally crashed for sciences sake. With no weather, theres no erosion and so impact craters last forever. China has a lunar lander on the moons far side, but it will be too far away to detect Fridays impact just north of the equator. NASAs Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will also be out of range. Its unlikely Indias moon-orbiting Chandrayaan-2 will be passing by then, either.  I had been hoping for something (significant) to hit the moon for a long time. Ideally, it would have hit on the near side of the moon at some point where we could actually see it, Gray said. After initially pinning the upcoming strike on Elon Musks SpaceX, Gray took another look after an engineer at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory questioned his claim. Now, hes pretty thoroughly persuaded its a Chinese rocket part, based not only on orbital tracking back to its 2014 liftoff, but also data received from its short-lived ham radio experiment. JPLs Center for Near Earth Object Studies endorses Grays reassessment. A University of Arizona team also recently identified the Chinese Long March rocket segment from the light reflected off its paint, during telescope observations of the careening cylinder.  Its about 40 feet (12 meters) long and 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, and doing a somersault every two to three minutes. Gray said SpaceX never contacted him to challenge his original claim. Neither have the Chinese. Its not a SpaceX problem, nor is it a China problem. Nobody is particularly careful about what they do with junk at this sort of orbit, Gray said.  Tracking deep space mission leftovers like this is hard, according to McDowell. The moons gravity can alter an objects path during flybys, creating uncertainty. And theres no readily available database, McDowell noted, aside from the ones cobbled together by himself, Gray and a couple others.  We are now in an era where many countries and private companies are putting stuff in deep space, so its time to start to keep track of it, McDowell said. Right now theres no one, just a few fans in their spare time. ___ Associated Press video producer Olivia Zhang and video journalist Sam McNeil in Beijing contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Ed Dwight was to be the first Black astronaut. At 90, hes finally getting his due","NEW YORK (AP)  Ed Dwight grew up in segregated 1930s Kansas on a farm on the edge of town. An airfield was within walking distance, and, as a boy, hed often go to marvel at the planes and gawk at the pilots. Most were flying back from hunting trips and their cabins were messy with blood and empty beers cans on the floor. Theyd say to me, Hey kid, would you clean my airplane? Ill give you a dime, Dwight, 90, recalls. But when he was 8 or 9, Dwight asked for more than a dime. He wanted to fly.  My first flight was the most exhilarating thing in the world, says Dwight, smiling. There were no streets or stop signs up there. You were free as a bird. It would be years before Dwight entertained the idea of himself becoming a pilot. It was the white mans domain, he says. But while in college, he saw in a newspaper, above the fold, an image of a downed Black pilot in Korea. I said, Oh my God, theyre letting Black people fly, Dwight says. I went straight to the recruitment office and said, I want to fly. With that decision, Dwight set in motion a series of events that would very nearly lead to him being among the first astronauts. As Dwight progressed through the Air Force, he was handpicked by President John F. Kennedys White House to join Chuck Yeagers test pilot program at Edwards Air Force Base in Californias Mojave Desert.  Dwight in the cockpit at the beginning of his flight training in 1954. (Courtesy of Ed Dwight/National Geographic via AP)  Dwight in the cockpit at the beginning of his flight training in 1954. (Courtesy of Ed Dwight/National Geographic via AP) That fabled astronaut breeding ground, site of The Right Stuff, might have turned Dwight into one of the most famous Americans and the first Black man in space. But at Edwards, Dwight was discriminated against even with Kennedy championing him. After Kennedy was assassinated, Dwights path to NASA disappeared and he was never selected for the space program. Dwight departed for civilian life and largely receded from history. 
        
     But in recent years, Dwight is finally being celebrated. The new National Geographic documentary The Space Race, which premieres Monday on National Geographic Channels and streams Tuesday on Disney+ and Hulu, chronicles the stories of Black astronauts  and their first pioneer, Dwight. When I left, everyone said, Well, thats over. We got rid of that dude. Hes off the map, Dwight said in an interview by Zoom from his home in Denver. Now it comes back full force as one of these I-didnt-know stories. Its almost amusing to me that all this furor could come up. But Im kind of glad it did because something happened here. It wasnt until 1983 that the first African American, Guion Bluford, reached space. But two decades earlier, Dwight found himself at a fulcrum of 20th Century America, where the space race and the struggle for social justice converged. In The Space Race, astronaut Bernard Harris, who became the first Black man to walk in space in 1995, contemplates what a difference it might have made if Dwight had become an astronaut in the tumultuous 60s. Space really allows us to realize the hope thats within all of us as human beings, Harris says. So to see a Black man in space during that period in time, it would have changed things.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) Ed is so important for everyone whos followed after, to recognize and embrace the shoulders they stand on, says Lisa Corts, who directed the film with Diego Hurtado de Mendoza . Theres the history we know and the history thats not had the opportunity to be highlighted. Dwight had experience at a young age with that. His father, known as Eddie Dwight, played in the Negro Leagues for the Kansas City Monarchs. He remembers sitting on Satchel Paiges lap as a child  just one more connection to history running through Dwights life. In 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into orbit, it jolted its Cold War rival into action; NASA was formed the following year. But Dwight still wasnt thinking about becoming an astronaut. Not in the slightest, he says. I thought these dudes going into space was the craziest thing I had ever heard in my life. But as the U.S. began pursuing a space program, political leaders were conscious of the image its astronauts could project of American democracy. The first astronauts, the Mercury Seven, were all male and white. In September 1961, Edward R. Murrow, then Director of the U.S. Information Agency, wrote to NASA administrator James Webb. Why dont we put the first non-white man in space? wrote Murrow. If your boys were to enroll and train a qualified Negro and then fly him in whatever vehicle is available, we could retell our whole space effort to whole non-white world, which is most of it. When the Aerospace Research Pilot School was established that November, the White House urged the Air Force to select a Black officer. Only Dwight met the criteria, which included 1,500 hours of flying jet airplanes, a bachelors degree in science or engineering (Dwight graduated with an aeronautical engineering degree from Arizona State University in 1957) and three consecutive outstanding ratings from military superiors. That November, Dwight received a letter out of the blue inviting him to train to be an astronaut. Kennedy called his parents to congratulate them.  And I thought, Hell no. Why in the world would I ruin a wonderful, career to go and hang out with these guys didnt know what the hell they were doing at the beginning? says Dwight. NASA was only two-years-old and they were talking about putting a Black guy in space? But he joined up. While at Edwards, Dwight was celebrated on the covers of Black magazines like Jet and Sepia. Hundred of letters hailing him as a hero poured in. But in training, he was treated with hostility by officers who resented his inclusion in the program and the White Houses involvement. They were all instructed to give me the cold shoulder, Dwight says. Yeager had a meeting with the students and the staff in the auditorium and announced it  that Washington was trying to shove this N-word down our throats. Dwight describes one incident when he was the only pilot sent out to fly when film producers, along with Jimmy Stewart, came to the base to film the officers. He recounts private sessions with Yaeger telling me how good the white guys were and how I shouldnt be there. All that kind of stuff didnt really bother me, Dwight says. The mission was the main thing. What people didnt know was that I was being handled out of the West Wing of the White House the whole time I was there. Either every day or every other day: Hows it going? Whats happening? What do you need? Yeager, who died in 2020, maintained Dwight simply wasnt as good as the other pilots. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote: From the moment we picked our first class, I was caught in a buzz saw of controversy involving a black student. The White House, Congress, and civil rights groups came at me with meat cleavers, and the only way I could save my head was to prove I wasnt a damned bigot. The tensions were also described in Tom Wolfes The Right Stuff. Every week, it seemed like, a detachment of Civil Rights Division lawyers would turn up from Washington, from the Justice Department, which was headed by the presidents brother, Bobby, wrote Wolfe. The lawyers squinted in the desert sunlight and asked a great many questions about the progress and treatment of Ed Dwight and took notes.

(Ryan Dearth/National Geographic via AP Dwight during the filming of the documentary The Space Race, which chronicles the stories of Black astronauts. (Ryan Dearth/National Geographic via AP Dwight was among the 26 potential astronauts recommended to NASA by the Air Force. But in 1963, he wasnt among the 14 selected. Dwight astronaut future took a more drastic turn when Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963. Everybody was wondering, Whats going to happen with Dwight? says Dwight. Everything changed.  Kennedy was killed on a Friday. By Monday, Dwight says, he had papers in his mailbox shipping him out to Germany. He quickly met with Bobby Kennedy in Washington, who had the Pentagon cancel those orders. A day after that, he had papers sending him to Canada. Ultimately, Dwight was stationed at Wright-Patterson in Ohio in January of 1964. He graduated the program and totaled some 9,000 hours of air time, but never became an astronaut. He left the Air Force in 1966.  Asked if he was bitter about his experience, Dwight exclaims, God no! Here you get a little 5-foot-four guy who flies airplanes and the next thing you know this guy is in the White House meeting all these senators and congressmen, standing in front of all these captains of industry and have them pat me on the back and shake my hand, Dwight says. Are you kidding me? What would I be bitter about? That opened the world to me. Dwight initially landed at IBM, then he started a construction company. In 1977, he earned his Master of Fine Arts in Sculpture from the University of Denver. Much of his work is of great figures from Black history such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Barack Obama. Several of his sculptures have been flown into space, most recently one aboard the vessel Orion. NASA named an asteroid after him.

(AP Photo/Ed Andrieski, File) To the Black astronauts who followed in his footsteps, Dwight braved their path.  When you talk to the other astronauts, its never about them. They all want to make sure you understand that for them to do their job, they needed the people who came before and paved the way for them, says Hurtado de Mendoza. For them, it was really important to include Ed in the story. They all had a story of when they first met Ed Dwight or the first time they heard about Ed Dwight. Dwight, with a little bemusement at how fate has worked out, acknowledges hes proud to be considered a pioneer for Black astronauts.  Its good for them in that they didnt have to go through this crap that I went through. It was a goddamn distraction. Its like wanting to have eyes in the back of your head for all the stuff that was coming at you. I had to absorb that graciously, Dwight says. If I talked about it  Oh, crybaby! You couldnt do this and you couldnt do that. Thats what would have happened if I stepped up to the mic and complained. But complaining wasnt Dwights nature then, and it isnt now, either. Hes not even mad at Yeager. This guy was being honest to what he was trained to do. The structure of his life, his culture, his personality, all were implanted in Chuck when he was a kid. He didnt know anything about social liberalism. It was foreign to this man, Dwight says. He adds: That doesnt make what they were doing right. Instead, Dwight is filled with gratitude. His one recommendation is that every congressman and senator be flown on a sub-orbital flight so they can see the Earth from above. Everyone, he thinks, would realize the absurdity of racism from that height. Id advise everybody to go through what I went through, and then theyd have a different view of this country and how sacred it is, Dwight says.

Are we about to find out the moons origin? Japans space agency says it may now have clues,"TOKYO (AP)  An unmanned lunar spacecraft has captured and transmitted data analyzing 10 lunar rocks, a greater-than-expected achievement that could help provide clues about the origin of the moon, a Japan space agency official said Wednesday. For four days, the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM  which landed on the moon last month  has used its multi-band spectral camera to study rock composition, and worked on examining lunar rocks, said Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency project manager Shinichiro Sakai.  The lunar mission is Japans first. The spacecraft made a historic precision touchdown on Jan. 20, though it landed the wrong way up, with its solar panels initially unable to see the sun and was turned off after a brief communication with Earth. But on the eighth day, it started working, allowing it to successfully reestablish communication with the command center at JAXA on Earth.  A black-and-white photo transmitted soon after SLIM was reactivated showed the bumpy lunar surface, including six rocks. The craft eventually obtained data from 10 rocks altogether, all of which have been given the names of dog breeds, such as Akitainu, Beagle and Shibainu. We are hoping that the rock analysis will lead us to the origin of the moon, Sakai said. By comparing the mineral compositions of moon rocks and those of Earth, they could find out if the rocks have common elements, he said. According to the giant-impact hypothesis, the moon is believed to have formed as a result of the Earth colliding with another planet, and a smaller mass spinning off of them. The JAXA team expected SLIM to study and analyze only one rock, so having data on 10 rocks was a cause for celebration, propelling the team to pursue studying the moons origins.  
        
     SLIM is currently hibernating in another lunar night that will last till late February. It remains unknown if the probe and its spectroscope will survive the severe cold night temperatures and be able to wake up once sunlight returns. The spacecraft had landed about 55 meters (60 yards) away from its target, near the Shioli crater, a region covered in volcanic rocks. Its the most precise landing compared to previous moon missions that typically aimed for flat areas at least 10 kilometers (6 miles) wide.  If the lander had not encountered a last-minute failure in one of the two main engines that caused a harder-than-planned landing, SLIMs touchdown was estimated to be within meters of the target, JAXA said. SLIM carried two autonomous probes which were released just before touchdown, recording the landing, surroundings and other lunar data. The two small probes had completed their mission of recording SLIMs initial work and have since stopped working.  The landing made Japan the worlds fifth country to reach the moon, after the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India.",https://apnews.com/article/japan-jaxa-moon-origin-landing-slim-5cedd3d0e0caf844c480f8b6b9d5cd93,science
"Octopus ancestors lived before era of dinosaurs, study shows","WASHINGTON (AP)  Scientists have found the oldest known ancestor of octopuses  an approximately 330 million-year-old fossil unearthed in Montana.  The researchers concluded the ancient creature lived millions of years earlier than previously believed, meaning that octopuses originated before the era of dinosaurs. The 4.7-inch (12-centimeter) fossil has 10 limbs  modern octopuses have eight  each with two rows of suckers. It probably lived in a shallow, tropical ocean bay.  Its very rare to find soft tissue fossils, except in a few places, said Mike Vecchione, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist who was not involved in the study. This is a very exciting finding. It pushes back the ancestry much farther than previously known. The specimen was discovered in Montanas Bear Gulch limestone formation and donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada in 1988.  For decades, the fossil sat overlooked in a drawer while scientists studied fossil sharks and other finds from the site. But then paleontologists noticed the 10 tiny limbs encased in limestone. The well-preserved fossil also shows some evidence of an ink sac, probably used to squirt out a dark liquid cloak to help to evade predators, just like modern octopuses, said Christopher Whalen, an American Museum of Natural History paleontologist and co-author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The creature, a vampyropod, was likely the ancestor of both modern octopuses and vampire squid, a confusingly named marine critter thats much closer to an octopus than a squid. Previously, the oldest known definitive vampyropod was from around 240 million years ago, the authors said. 
        
     The scientists named the fossil Syllipsimopodi bideni, after President Joe Biden.  Whether or not having an ancient octopus  or vampire squid  bearing your name is actually a compliment, the scientists say they intended admiration for the presidents science and research priorities. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Endurance: Explorer Shackletons ship found after a century,"Researchers have discovered the remarkably well-preserved wreck of polar explorer Ernest Shackletons ship, Endurance, in 10,000 feet of icy water, a century after it was swallowed up by Antarctic ice during what proved to be one of the most heroic expeditions in history. A team of marine archaeologists, engineers and other scientists used an icebreaker ship and underwater drones to locate the wreck at the bottom of the Weddell Sea, near the Antarctica Peninsula.  The Falklands Maritime Heritage Trusts search expedition Endurance22  announced the discovery on Wednesday.  Images and video of the wreck show the three-masted wooden ship in pristine condition, with gold-leaf letters reading Endurance still affixed to the stern and the ships lacquered wooden helm still standing upright, as if the captain may return to steer it at any time.  This is by far the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen, said Mensun Bound, the director of the exploration. Bound noted the wreck is still upright, clear of the seabed and in a brilliant state of preservation. The discovery is a titantic find in one of the worlds most challenging environments, said maritime historian Steven Schwankert, who was not involved in the expedition.  The combination of deep, dark waters  no sunlight penetrates to 10,000 feet  frigid temperatures and sea ice have frustrated  past efforts to find Endurance, but also explain why the wreck is in such good condition today.  
        
     The bottom of the Weddell Sea is a very inhospitable environment for just about everything  especially the kind of bacteria, mites and wood-eating worms that would otherwise enjoy munching on a wooden shipwreck, said Schwankert. The expedition Endurance22 embarked from Cape Town, South Africa, in early February in a ship capable of breaking through 3-foot (1-meter)-thick ice.  The team, which included more than 100 researchers and crew members, deployed underwater drones that combed the seafloor for two weeks in the area where the ship was recorded to have sunk in 1915. We have made polar history with the discovery of Endurance, and successfully completed the worlds most challenging shipwreck search, said expedition leader John Shears.  The British explorer Shackleton never achieved his ambition to become the first person to cross Antarctica via the South Pole. In fact, he never set foot on the continent during the failed Endurance expedition, though he did visit Antarctica during earlier voyages.  Despite being designed to resist collision with ice floes and to break through pack ice, Endurance could not withstand being crushed by heavy sea ice, said Ann Coats, a maritime historian at the University of Portsmouth. Shackleton himself noted the difficulty of the endeavor in his diary.  The end came at last about 5 p.m., he wrote. She was doomed, no ship built by human hands could have withstood the strain.  Before the ship disappeared 3,000 meters below icy waters, Shackletons crew loaded food and other provisions into three lifeboats to escape and set up camp on ice floes, where they used sled dogs to carry their provisions, according to Shackletons diary.  Shackleton and his captain, Frank Worsley, then sailed across 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) of treacherous icy waters in a 22-foot (7-meter) ship to the island of South Georgia, a remote whaling community, to get help. That successful trip is considered a heroic feat of fortitude, and Shackletons decisive response to imminent tragedy is still held up today as a model of how to lead in difficult circumstances.  Shackleton was very good at planner and a good improviser  I have a feeling that the polar explorers of today would not survive the same kinds of things he endured, said Anna Wahlin, a polar researcher at the University of Gothenburg, who just returned from a two-month mission studying ice shelves and warming ocean currents in Antartica. In Antartica, everything is gray or white, and after only a few weeks, explorers start to miss smelling Earth, walking in the forest, hearing birds chirp, seeing things that are green, she said.  The expedition to find Endurance comes a century after Shackletons death in 1922. British historian and broadcaster Dan Snow, who accompanied the researchers, tweeted that the wrecks discovery on Saturday happened 100 years to the day since Shackleton was buried.  The ship is protected as a historic monument under the 6-decade-old Antarctic Treaty that is intended to protect the regions environment. Researchers filmed the wreck, but nothing was recovered or disturbed. Instead, expedition organizers say they want to use laser scans to create a 3-D model of the ship that can be displayed in both traveling exhibits and a permanent museum exhibit.  Shackleton, we like to think, would have been proud of us, the expeditions Bound wrote in a blog post. ___ Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina  and Jill Lawless at @JillLawless ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

US astronaut to ride Russian spacecraft home during tensions,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei has made it through nearly a year in space, but faces what could be his trickiest assignment yet: riding a Russian capsule back to Earth in the midst of deepening tensions between the countries. NASA insists Vande Heis homecoming plans at the end of the month remain unchanged, even as Russias invasion of Ukraine has resulted in canceled launches, broken contracts and an escalating war of words by the Russian Space Agencys hardline leader. Many worry Dmitry Rogozin is putting decades of a peaceful off-the-planet partnership at risk, most notably at the International Space Station. Vande Hei  who on Tuesday breaks the U.S. single spaceflight record of 340 days  is due to leave with two Russians aboard a Soyuz capsule for a touchdown in Kazakhstan on March 30. The astronaut will have logged 355 days in space by then, setting a new U.S. record. The world record of 438 continuous days in space belongs to Russia. Retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, Americas record-holder until Tuesday, is among those sparring with Rogozin, a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin. Enraged by whats going on in Ukraine, Kelly has returned his Russian medal for space exploration to the Russian Embassy in Washington. Despite the deadly conflict down here, Kelly believes the two sides can hold it together up in space. We need an example set that two countries that historically have not been on the most friendly of terms, can still work somewhere peacefully. And that somewhere is the International Space Station. Thats why we need to fight to keep it, Kelly told The Associated Press. 
        
     NASA wants to keep the space station running until 2030, as do the European, Japanese and Canadian space agencies, while the Russians have not committed beyond the original end date of 2024 or so.  The U.S. and Russia are the prime operators of the orbiting outpost, permanently occupied for 21 years. Until SpaceX started launching astronauts in 2020, Americans regularly hitched rides on Russian Soyuz capsules for tens of millions of dollars per seat. The U.S. and Russian space agencies are still working on a long-term barter system in which a Russian would launch on a SpaceX capsule beginning this fall and an American would fly up on the Soyuz. That would help ensure a U.S. and Russian station presence at all times. Vande Hei, 55, a retired Army colonel, moved into the space station last April, launching on a Soyuz from Kazakhstan with Pyotr Dubrov and another Russian. He and Dubrov stayed twice as long as usual to accommodate a Russian film crew that visited in October. As the situation 260 miles (420 kilometers) below intensified last month, Vande Hei acknowledged he was avoiding conversations about Ukraine with Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov, their Russian commander. Three more Russians will blast off from Kazakhstan on Friday to replace them.  We havent talked about that too much. Im not sure we really want to go there, Vande Hei told a TV interviewer in mid-February. Space station operations continue as always  in orbit and on Earth, according to NASA. It would be a sad day for international operations if we cant continue to peacefully operate in space, said NASAs human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders, who noted it would be very difficult to go it alone. To mark Tuesdays milestone, NASA turned to Twitter to gather questions for video-recorded responses, and some asked whether Vande Hei might switch to an American ride home. SpaceX is taking three wealthy businessmen and their ex-astronaut escort to the space station at the end of March for a brief visit. Then in mid-April, SpaceX will deliver four astronauts for NASA before bringing back four who have been on board since November. NASAs space station program manager Joel Montalbano, during a press briefing Monday, said Russias space agency has confirmed that theyre ready to bring all three back  Vande Hei and the two Russians. A NASA plane and small team will be on hand in Kazakhstan, as usual, to whisk Vande Hei back home to Houston. Former NASA astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, whose father was born in Ukraine, concedes its a difficult situation. Were sanctioning Russia. Companies are pulling out of doing business in Russia. But then yet you still have the U.S. government  the space agency  doing business with the Russians, she said. You cant push a button and separate the two sides of the space station. Besides threatening to pull out of the space station and drop it on the U.S., Europe or elsewhere, Rogozin had the flags of other countries covered on a Soyuz rocket awaiting liftoff with internet satellites earlier this month. The launch was called off, after the customer, London-based OneWeb, refused his demands that the satellites not be used for military purposes and the British government halt its financial backing. The European Space Agency also is reeling. After missing a 2020 launch deadline for its Mars rover  a joint European-Russian effort  the project was on track for a September liftoff from Kazakhstan. Now its most likely off until 2024, the next opportunity for Earth and Mars to be properly aligned. And Russia has pulled its staff out of the French-run launch site in South America, suspending Soyuz launches of European satellites. All this comes on top of the Russian governments antisatellite missile test in November that added countless pieces of junk to the debris already encircling Earth and put the space stations four Americans, two Russians and one German on alert for days. Jeffrey Manber, now with the private Voyager Space company, helped forge U.S. and Russian ties back in the mid-1990s, with the first piece of the space station launching in 1998. He sees the outpost as one of the final holdouts of collaboration between the two countries. But, he added, there is no going back if the partnership is ended and the result is a premature ending of the ISS program. Regardless of how things play out at the space station, John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University, expects it will mark the end of large-scale space cooperation between Russia and the West. Russia has been moving toward China already, and the current situation will probably accelerate that move, he said. While Vande Hei has been silent on Twitter, Kelly and others have gone into overdrive, taking offense at Rogozins threats. Elon Musks private SpaceX took a swipe at Rogozin after he said Russia would stop supplying rocket engines to U.S. companies  Northrop Grumman and United Launch Alliance  adding they could use broomsticks to get to orbit.  At a launch last week, a SpaceX official responded: Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Scientists figure out how vampire bats got a taste for blood,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Scientists have figured out why vampire bats are the only mammals that can survive on a diet of just blood. They compared the genome of common vampire bats to 26 other bat species and identified 13 genes that are missing or no longer work in vampire bats. Over the years, those gene tweaks helped them adapt to a blood diet rich in iron and protein but with minimal fats or carbohydrates, the researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances. The bats live in South and Central America and are basically living Draculas, said co-author Michael Hiller of Germanys Max Planck Institute. About 3 inches (8 centimeters) long with a wingspan of 7 inches (18 centimeters), the bats bite and than lap up blood from livestock or other animals at night. Most mammals couldnt survive on a low-calorie liquid diet of blood. Only three vampire species of the 1,400 kinds of bats can do that  the others eat mostly insects, fruit, nectar, pollen or meat, such as small frogs and fish. Blood is a terrible food source, said Hannah Kim Frank, a bat researcher at Tulane University, who was not involved in the study. Its totally bizarre and amazing that vampire bats can survive on blood  they are really weird, even among bats.  Some other creatures also have a taste for blood, including mosquitoes, bedbugs, leeches and fleas. The latest work expands upon research by another team that pinpointed three of the 13 gene losses. 
        
     The new paper shows how different vampire bats are from even other closely related bats, which eat nectar and fruit, said Kate Langwig, a bat researcher at Virginia Tech, who had no role in the study. With such a low-calorie diet, vampire bats cant go long without a meal. In a pinch, well-fed ones will regurgitate their food to share with a starving neighbor. They seem to keep track of who has helped them in the past, said Hiller, noting that vampire bats have complex social relationships. Its not a kin thing, said Tulanes Frank. They just notice and remember: Youre a good sharer, I will reward you.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

US astronaut ends record spaceflight with Russian ride home,"A NASA astronaut caught a Russian ride back to Earth on Wednesday after a U.S. record 355 days at the International Space Station, returning with two cosmonauts to a world torn apart by war. Mark Vande Hei landed in a Soyuz capsule in Kazakhstan alongside the Russian Space Agencys Pyotr Dubrov, who also spent the past year in space, and Anton Shkaplerov. Wind blew the capsule onto its side following touchdown, and the trio emerged into the late afternoon sun one by one.  Vande Hei, the last one out, grinned and waved as he was carried to a reclining chair out in the open Kazakh steppes.  Beautiful out here, said Vande Hei, putting on a face mask and ballcap.  Despite escalating tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Vladimir Putins war with Ukraine, Vande Heis return followed customary procedures. A small NASA team of doctors and other staff was on hand for the touchdown and planned to return immediately to Houston with the 55-year-old astronaut. Even before Russias Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Vande Hei said he was avoiding the subject with his two Russian crewmates. Despite getting along fantastically ... Im not sure we really want to go there, he said. It was the first taste of gravity for Vande Hei and Dubrov since their Soyuz launch on April 9 last year. Shkaplerov joined them at the orbiting lab in October, escorting a Russian film crew up for a brief stay. To accommodate that visit, Vande Hei and Dubrov doubled the length of their stay. 
        
     Before departing the space station, Shkaplerov embraced his fellow astronauts as my space brothers and space sister.  People have problem on Earth. On orbit ... we are one crew, Shkaplerov said in a live NASA TV broadcast Tuesday. The space station is a symbol of friendship and cooperation and ... future of exploration of space. The war tensions bubbled over in other areas of space with the suspension of European satellite launches on Russian rockets and the Europe-Russia Mars rover stuck on Earth for another two years. Vande Hei surpassed NASAs previous record for the longest single spaceflight by 15 days. Dubrov moved into Russias top five, well short of the 437-day, 17-hour marathon by a cosmonaut-physician aboard the 1990s Mir space station that remains the world record. Broken records mean were making progress, said NASAs previous space endurance champ, retired astronaut Scott Kelly, whose 340-day mission ended in 2016. Like Kelly, Vande Hei underwent medical testing during his long stay to further NASAs quest to get astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars. He said daily meditation helped him cope during the mission, twice as long as his first station stint four years earlier.  Ive had an indoor job 24-7 for almost a year so I am looking forward to being outside no matter what kind of weather, Vande Hei said in a recent series of NASA videos. As for food, hes looking forward to making a cup of coffee for himself and wife Julie, and digging into guacamole and chips. Remaining on board: Three Russians who arrived two weeks ago and three Americans and one German, who have been aboard since November. Their replacements are due in three weeks via SpaceX. Next week, SpaceX will fly three rich businessmen and their ex-astronaut escort to the station for a weeklong visit arranged by the private Axiom Space. Elon Musks SpaceX began transporting NASA astronauts to the station in 2020, nine years after the shuttle program ended. During that gap, Russia offered the lone taxi service, with NASA shelling out tens of millions of dollars per Soyuz seat. Vande Heis ride was part of a barter exchange with Houston-based Axiom. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Twinkle, twinkle giant star, astronomers see how far you are","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  Astronomers have discovered the farthest star yet, a super-hot, super-bright giant that formed nearly 13 billion years ago at the dawn of the cosmos.  But this luminous blue star is long gone, so massive that it almost certainly exploded into bits just a few million years after emerging. Its swift demise makes it all the more incredible that an international team spotted it with observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. It takes eons for light emitted from distant stars to reach us. Were seeing the star as it was about 12.8 billion years ago, which puts it about 900 million years after the Big Bang, said astronomer Brian Welch, a doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the study appearing in Wednesdays journal Nature. We definitely just got lucky. He nicknamed it Earendel, an Old English name which means morning star or rising light  a fitting name for a star that we have observed in a time often referred to as `Cosmic Dawn.   The previous record-holder, Icarus, also a blue supergiant star spotted by Hubble, formed 9.4 billion years ago. Thats more than 4 billion years after the Big Bang.  In both instances, astronomers used a technique known as gravitational lensing to magnify the minuscule starlight. Gravity from clusters of galaxies closer to us  in the foreground  serve as a lens to magnify smaller objects in the background. If not for that, Icarus and Earendel would not have been discernible given their vast distances.  
        
     While Hubble has spied galaxies as far away as 300 million to 400 million years of the universe-forming Big Bang, their individual stars are impossible to pick out.  Usually theyre all smooshed together ... But here, nature has given us this one star  highly, highly magnified, magnified by factors of thousands  so that we can study it, said NASA astrophysicist Jane Rigby, who took part in the study. Its such a gift really from the universe. Vinicius Placco of the National Science Foundations NOIRlab in Tucson, Arizona, described the findings as amazing work. He was not involved in the study.  Placco said based on the Hubble data, Earendel may well have been among the first generation of stars born after the Big Bang. Future observations by the newly launched James Webb Space Telescope should provide more details, he said, and provide us with another piece of this cosmic puzzle that is the evolution of our universe. Current data indicate Earendel was more than 50 times the size of our sun and an estimated 1 million times brighter, outsizing Icarus. Earendels small, yet-to-mature home galaxy looked nothing like the pretty spiral galaxies photographed elsewhere by Hubble, according to Welch, but rather kind of an awkward-looking, clumpy object. Unlike Earendel, he said, this galaxy probably has survived, although in a different form after merging with other galaxies. Its like a little snapshot in amber of the past, Rigby said. Earendel may have been the prominent star in a two-star, or binary, system, or even a triple- or quadruple-star system, Welch said. Theres a slight chance it could be a black hole, although the observations gathered in 2016 and 2019 suggest otherwise, he noted. Regardless of its company, the star lasted barely a few million years before exploding as a supernova that went unobserved as most do, Welch said. The most distant supernova seen by astronomers to date goes back 12 billion years.  The Webb telescope  100 times more powerful than Hubble  should help clarify how massive and hot the star really is, and reveal more about its parent galaxy. By studying stars, Rigby said: We are literally understanding where we came from because were made up of some of that stardust. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Dress rehearsal: NASA moon rockets last test before launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASA kicked off a critical countdown test Friday for its new moon rocket, a 30-story behemoth that could make its first lunar test flight by summer. The two-day demonstration  the final major milestone before liftoff to the moon  will culminate Sunday as teams load nearly 1 million gallons of super-cold fuel into the rocket on the pad. The countdown will halt at the 9-second mark before engines ignite. NASA plans to set a launch date after analyzing the results of the dress rehearsal for the Space Launch System rocket  SLS for short. Officials have indicated the rocket could blast off as early as June, sending the attached Orion crew capsule hurtling toward the moon. The capsule will spend at least a month in space before returning to Earth. No one will be on board for the first moonshot since NASAs Apollo lunar landings a half-century ago. Astronauts will strap in for the second test flight slated for 2024, looping around the moon and back. That would pave the way for astronauts landing on the moon around 2025, according to NASA. The U.S. Government Accountability Office recently warned, however, that technical challenges remain  primarily with the lunar lander and spacesuits  that could further delay the moon landing, already years behind schedule. The GAO also cited billions in escalating costs. Towering 322 feet (98 meters), the rocket made its debut at the Kennedy Space Center launch pad two weeks ago. Since then, all of its systems have been powered up in preparation for this weekends test. Officials stressed that possible thunderstorms or technical problems could drag out the rehearsal. 
        
     NASA promised to provide updates throughout the weekend, but the public wont be able to listen in. The space agency cited security concerns. We are being cautious  an abundance of caution  and thats particularly in the environment that were in nowadays, said Tom Whitmeyer, head of NASAs exploration systems development. NASA expects to announce the crews for the initial lunar missions this summer. The pool of candidates includes nine men and nine women; two are at the International Space Station and two are due to arrive there in a few weeks. Twenty-four astronauts flew to the moon during Apollo from 1968 through 1972; 12 landed on the lunar surface. Unlike Apollo, NASA is partnering with private business for its moon program, named Artemis after Apollos twin sister in Greek mythology. While NASAs rocket and capsule will get astronauts into lunar orbit, SpaceXs still-in-development Starship will carry them down to the lunar surface, at least for the first mission. NASA is seeking additional companies for later landings. The space agencys goal is to develop a sustainable moon presence, then aim for Mars. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson recently cited 2040 as the target for a Martian expedition with astronauts.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"More delays for NASAs moon rocket test, fueling stalled","CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  NASAs dress rehearsal for its mega moon rocket is off until at least this weekend because of a pair of technical problems that kept stalling a fueling test. Launch managers tried twice  once Sunday and again Monday  to load nearly 1 million gallons of fuel into the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket known as Space Launch System, or SLS. Balky fans at the launch pad thwarted the first effort, while an improperly closed valve halted the second attempt. The countdown test is the last major milestone before the rockets long-awaited launch debut. The Orion crew capsule atop the rocket will be hurled to the moon in a passenger-less test flight, looping around but not landing before returning to Earth. NASA is targeting June, depending on how the demo goes. We didnt get through everything we wanted, but certainly learned a great deal that well take into our next attempt, said NASAs Jim Free, whos in charge of exploration systems development. Speaking Tuesday at the Space Foundations annual conference in Colorado Springs, Free said the launch team will wait until SpaceX launches four private passengers to the International Space Station before taking another crack at the fueling test. Liftoff is scheduled for Friday from Kennedy Space Center, barely a mile from the pad holding the SLS rocket. Managers declined to specify a date for the next SLS fueling attempt, but noted they would not have to start the test from scratch.  
        
     The dress rehearsal began Friday and should have lasted just two days. A severe thunderstorm resulted in four lightning strikes at the pad Saturday, but officials did not believe that caused any of the technical problems. They described the problems as nuisances  not design issues.  The rocket is fine. The spacecraft (capsule) is fine. Weve just got to get through the test and the test objectives, mission manager Mike Sarafin told reporters.  After this first moonshot in NASAs Artemis program, NASA will send a crew around the moon in 2024 and then attempt the first lunar landing by astronauts in 2025 or so. Astronauts last walked on the moon in 1972 during NASAs Apollo program. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

"Blue blood from horseshoe crabs is needed for medicine, but a declining bird relies on crabs to eat","PORTLAND, Maine (AP)  A primordial sea animal that lives on the tidal mudflats of the East Coast and serves as a linchpin for the production of vital medicines stands to benefit from new protective standards. But conservationists who have been trying for years to save a declining bird species  the red knot  that depends on horseshoe crabs fear the protections still dont go far enough. Drug and medical device makers are dependent on the valuable blue blood of the crabs  helmet-shaped invertebrates that have scuttled in the ocean and tidal pools for more than 400 million years  to test for potentially dangerous impurities. The animals are drained of some of their blood and returned to the environment, but many die from the bleeding. Recent revisions to guidelines for handling the animals should keep more alive through the process, regulators said. The animals  not really true crabs but rather more closely related to land-dwelling invertebrates such as spiders and scorpions  are declining in some of their East Coast range. They were here before the dinosaurs, said Glenn Gauvry, president of Ecological Research & Development Group, a Delaware-based nonprofit that advocates for horseshoe crab conservation. And theyre having problems because the new kids on the block, us, havent learned to appreciate the elders. Horseshoe Crabs spawn during at Pickering Beach in Dover, Del., Sunday, June 11, 2023.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) The harvest of horseshoe crabs, which are also caught for bait in the commercial fishing industry, has emerged as a critical issue for conservationists in recent years because of the creatures role in coastal ecosystems. The crabs eggs are vitally important food for a declining subspecies of a bird called the red knot  a rust-colored, migratory shorebird listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The birds, which migrate some 19,000 miles (30,577 kilometers) roundtrip from South America to Canada and must stop to eat along the way, need stronger protection of horseshoe crabs to survive, said Bethany Kraft, senior director for coastal conservation with the Audubon Society. Kraft and other wildlife advocates said the fact the guidelines for handling crabs are voluntary and not mandatory leaves the red knot at risk. Making sure there is enough to fuel these birds on this massive, insanely long flight is just critical, Kraft said. Theres very clear linkage between horseshoe crabs and the survival of the red knot in the coming decades. 
        
     The horseshoe crabs are valuable because their blood can be manufactured into limulus amebocyte lysate, or LAL, that is used to detect pathogens in indispensable medicines such as injectable antibiotics. The crabs are collected by fishermen by hand or via trawlers for use by biomedical companies, then their blood is separated and proteins within their white blood cells are processed. It takes dozens of the crabs to produce enough blood to fill a single glass tube with its blood, which contains immune cells sensitive to bacteria. There are only five federally licensed manufacturers on the East Coast that process horseshoe crab blood. The blood is often described by activist groups as worth $15,000 a quart (liter), though some members of the industry say that figure is impossible to verify. Regulators estimate about 15% of the crabs die in the bleeding process. In 2021, that meant about 112,000 crabs died, said Caitlin Starks, a senior fishery management plan coordinator with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The bait fishery for horseshoe crabs, which are used as bait for eels and sea snails, killed more than six times that, she said.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Still, the fisheries commission in May approved new best management practices for the biomedical industrys harvesting and handling of the crabs. Those include minimizing exposure to sunlight and keeping crabs cool and moist, Starks said. The goal is to give the crabs that are bled a better chance of surviving and contributing to the ecosystem after they are released, she said. Thats exactly what the new guidelines will do, said Nora Blair, quality operations manager with Charles River Laboratories, one of the companies that manufactures LAL from horseshoe crab blood. Blair was a member of a working group that crafted the updated guidelines alongside other industry members, conservationists, fishery managers, fishermen and others.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Blair said the industry is working toward a synthetic alternative  an outcome conservationists have been pushing for years. However, for now the wild harvest of horseshoe crabs remains critically important to drug safety, Blair said. The critical role of horseshoe crab in the biopharmaceutical supply chain and coastal ecosystem makes their conservation imperative, he said. The Atlantic horseshoe crab, the species harvested on the East Coast, ranges from the Gulf of Maine to Florida. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the species as being vulnerable based on a 2016 assessment. One of the most important ecosystems for horseshoe crabs is the Delaware Bay, an estuary of the Delaware River between Delaware and New Jersey. The bay is where the crabs breed and the red knots feed. Allen Burgenson turns over a capsized horseshoe crab at Pickering Beach in Dover, Del., Sunday, June 11, 2023.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) The density of horseshoe crab eggs in the bay is nowhere near what it was in the 1990s, said Lawrence Niles, an independent wildlife biologist who once headed New Jerseys state endangered species program. Meanwhile, the population of the rufa red knot, the threatened subspecies, has declined by 75% since the 1980s, according to the National Park Service. The birds need meaningful protection of horseshoe crab eggs to be able to recover, Niles said. He tracks the health of red knots and horseshoe crabs and has organized a group called Horseshoe Crab Recovery Coalition to advocate for conservation measures. Niles and volunteers he organizes have been counting the horseshoe crab eggs since the 1980s and tagging birds since the 1990s. In mid-June, as he was wrapping up this years tracking in southern New Jersey, he described the eggs as good and consistent through the month. What we want is the harvest to stop, the killing to stop, and let the stock rebuild to its carrying capacity, Niles said. The horseshoe crabs have been harvested for use as bait and medicine from Florida to Maine over the years, though the largest harvests are in Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts and Virginia. According to federal fishery statistics, the crabs were worth about $1.1 million in total at the docks in 2021.

Environmentalists sue to stop Utah potash mine that produces sought-after crop fertilizer,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Environmentalists filed a lawsuit on Monday to prevent the construction of a new potash mine that they say would devastate a lake ecosystem in the drought-stricken western Utah desert. The complaint against the Bureau of Land Management is the latest development in the battle over potash in Utah, which holds some of the United States largest deposits of the mineral used by farmers to fertilize crops worldwide. Potash, or potassium sulfate, is currently mined in regions including Carlsbad, New Mexico and at Utahs Bonneville Salt Flats, where the Bureau of Land Management also oversees a private companys potash mining operations. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance argues in Mondays complaint that, in approving a potash mining operation at Sevier Lake  a shallow saltwater lake about halfway between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas  the Bureau of Land Management failed to consider alternatives that would cause fewer environmental impacts. They say the project could imperil the regional groundwater aquifer already plagued by competing demands from surrounding cities, farms and a nearby wildlife refuge. Industrial development of this magnitude will eliminate the wild and remote nature of Sevier Lake and the surrounding lands, significantly impair important habitat for migratory birds, and drastically affect important resource values including air quality, water quality and quantity and visual resources, the groups attorneys write in the complaint. The Bureau of Land Managements Utah office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
        
     The complaint comes months after Peak Minerals, the company developing the Sevier Lake mine, announced it had secured a $30 million loan from an unnamed investor. In a press release, leaders of the company and the private equity firm that owns it touted the projects ability to support long-term domestic fertilizer availability and food security in North America in a product. Demand for domestic sources of potash has spiked since the start of the war in Ukraine as sanctions and supply chain issues disrupted exports from Russia and Belarus  two of the worlds primary potash producers. As a fertilizer, potash lacks of some of climate change concerns of nitrogen- and phosphorous-based fertilizers, which require greenhouse gases to produce or can leach into water sources. As global supply has contracted and prices have surged, potash project backers from Brazil to Canada renewed pushes to expand or develop new mines. That was also the case in Utah. Before the March announcement of $30 million in new funds, the Sevier Playa Potash project had been on hold due to a lack of investors. In 2020, after the Bureau of Land Management approved the project, the mining company developing it pulled out after failing to raise necessary capital. Peak Minerals did not immediately respond to request for comment on the lawsuit. In a wet year, Sevier Lake spans 195 square miles (506 square kilometers) in an undeveloped part of rural Utah and is part of the same prehistoric lakebed as the Great Salt Lake. The lake remains dry the majority of the time but fills several feet in wet years and serves as a stop-over for migratory birds. The project is among many fronts in which federal agencies are fighting environmentalists over public lands and how to balance conservation concerns with efforts to boost domestic production of sought-after minerals for goods ranging from agriculture to batteries to semiconductors. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance opposed the project throughout the environmental review process, during which it argued the Bureau of Land Management did not consider splitting the lake by approving mining operations on its southern half and protecting a wetland on its northern end. ___ This story was first published on Aug. 1, 2023.

Bark beetles are eating through Germanys Harz forest. Climate change is making matters worse,"CLAUSTHAL-ZELLERFELD, Germany (AP)  Nestled in the spruce trees in the Harz mountains of northern Germany is a bark-eating pest not much bigger than a sesame seed. Known as book printers for the lines they eat into the bark that fan out from a single spine resembling words on a page, these eight-toothed beetles have always been part of the local forest. Officials expect the bugs to typically kill a few spruces each summer as they find suitable trees to lay their eggs  they burrow into the trees cambium, or growing layer, hampering it from getting the nutrients it needs to survive. But the tiny insects have been causing outsized devastation to the forests in recent years, with officials grappling to get the pests under control before the spruce population is entirely decimated. Two-thirds of the spruce in the region have already been destroyed, said Alexander Ahrenhold from the Lower Saxony state forestry office, and as human-caused climate change makes the region drier and the trees more favorable homes for the beetles larvae, forest conservationists are preparing for the worst.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) Since 2018, weve had extremely dry summers and high temperatures, so almost all trees have had problems, said Ahrenhold. Spruce trees in particular need a lot of water so having less of it weakens their defenses, and theyre not able to produce their natural tree resin repellent, he said.  
        
     As the planet warms, longer droughts are becoming more common around the world, with hotter temperatures also drying up moisture in soil and plants.  And even though the beetles tend to target weakened trees, in dry years the population can reproduce so much that the beetles were even able to attack healthy spruce in large numbers, he said. In some regions there are now no more spruces. Experts say theres no easy solution, but forest managers work to remove trees that might be susceptible to beetles as early as possible and use pesticides where theyre needed.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) Michael Mller, the Chair of Forest Protection at the Technical University in Dresden, said there are very strict requirements for the use of pesticides which can be very effective in getting rid of the bugs, although the chemicals are sometimes frowned upon for their potentially harmful environmental side effects. Its of course preferable to take the raw wood out of the forest and send it for recycling or to store it in non-endangered areas outside the forest, he said, but noted that requires a separate logistical operation. On trees that are still standing, he said, its not really possible to remove the beetles. Mller added that forest conservation measures can sometimes take decades from being implemented to taking effect and other factors, like storms and drought, and other species, such as game and mice that can also hamper plant growth, are potentially more damaging to the forest in the long run than the bark beetle.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) But he said that conservation efforts are limited by external factors, like the changing climate. After all, we cant irrigate the forests, he said.  In the longer term, mixing other tree species into the forest could be a solution, Ahrenhold said. It makes sense to plant other conifers that can cope better with these conditions, especially on south-facing slopes and on very dry soil, he said. Having too many spruce trees in the Harz is a result of centuries of planting big concentrations of the tree, according to Richard Hlzl, an environmental historian at the University of Goettingen and at Five Continents Museum in Munich.  Clausthal-Zellerfeld is one prime example of a mining area in the Harz where they very early on tried to establish artificial reproduction for spruce to have it for mining construction works, said Hlzl.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) Officials realized by the 19th century that planting just one type of tree over and over again wasnt a good idea ecologically, but the economy countered that realization because spruce was such an attractive species, he said. Spruce was the preferred tree for industrial forestry, paper mills and pulp. Still, without the warmer and drier weather from climate change, the bark beetles wouldnt be flourishing in all that spruce. There is a long, long prehistory, but theres also the (climatic) change now, said Hlzl. We cant really blame our forefathers for that.
