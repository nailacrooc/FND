Old Men Will Dream Dreams,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/old-men-will-dream-dreams/,"If not ‘everyone’ how about the Christians take God at His Word and live like His promises can be trusted?
In business, we often hear the ‘late start in life’ stories about guys like Colonel Sanders. But what about Christians daring to use the phase of life where you’ve got ‘all the time in the world’ to unleash God’s Kingdom here on Earth?
Maybe it’s a business idea. Or an art project. Or the Great American novel. Maybe it’s mentoring. Or starting a ministry or outreach to people in need. Maybe developing a new skill set so that it can be used to bless others… or using what you already know.
There are as many answers to the ‘what if’ question as there are people to ask it.
Is the God we believe in — REALLY believe in — cut down to size so that he can be squeezed into our comfortable lives? Or are we going to dare the God who can carry galaxies in his pocket to trust us with a plan Worthy of His name… a summit-or-plummet task that is doomed to fail unless HE shows up to keep his promises.
Whoever said that the last chapters in life had to be boring? They can be the greatest adventure of your life.
Before you wave that away as some kind of an over-hyped pep talk, look at what the Word itself has to say about exactly this issue:

COVID Fraud Squad Slaps Criminal Charges On Husband Of AOC’s ‘Squad’ Co-Belligerent,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/covid-fraud-squad-slaps-criminal-charges-on-husband-of-aocs-squad-co-belligerent/,"There was SOME work in that regard, but maybe you noticed that other than some lip service to the question, getting answers for where the money REALLY went never quite seemed to be huge priority for the political class.
Nobody could have predicted the appearance of DOGE, as it is currently running, to show up on the scene and spot the sort of complicated webs of deceit that are specifically spun to make forensic audits almost impossible to follow. Algorithms can the movement of numbers with a speed and clarity that people cannot. Money is just another kind of number that it’s tracking.
Since DOGE came to town, it has been said that one of the safest bets in the whole process is that there will be close family, business, or romantic connections between the politicians putting a pen to the wasteful policy, and the politicians cashing in on it.
Enter Cori Bush, the former Congresswoman — and member of AOC’s so-called ‘Squad’– whose husband is being charged with misuse of pandemic money."
"Loose Sex, Impure Acts & Greed",https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/loose-sex-impure-acts-greed/,"Shouldn’t at least SOME of Christ’s way of life rub off on us? Of course it should, if we’re doing the Christian thing right.
Of course, anything that requires commitment that involves saying yes to one thing will automatically require saying ‘no’ to something else.

Faith is no different. If we’re walking the walk with Jesus, there will have to be some changes in how we live our lives.

AUTOPEN: Could This Be A Critical Clue In Their Plot To Hide The Decline?,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/autopen-could-this-be-a-critical-clue-in-their-plot-to-hide-the-decline/,"They protected Joe from public appearances, they rigged the game in press conferences, and limited direct access to the President himself… but if they were going to keep his decline a secret, there was still one glaring problem staring everyone in the face that they absolutely HAD to solve.
Let’s return to the beginning, before Joe became the presidential candidate.
Questions about Joe being corrupt and compromised were already part of the conversation. Authors had written books about it. Joe was caught red-handed — in his own voice — holding up a billion dollars in Ukrainian aid unless he got what he wanted, which just so happened to be exactly what his son’s benefactor Burisma ALSO wanted.
But that ‘perfect phone call’ where Trump put a pause on Ukraine funding for 30 days? The pause that let him verify that money was going where it was supposed to in one of the world’s most corrupt countries? That was ‘impeachable’.
The web of Biden lies has been laying in plain sight for so long, it’s easy to forget the strands from which its woven.
We have long since taken for granted that Hunter’s incriminating laptop was ‘forgotten’ at a repair shop while Feds were already investigating some of shady business associates at the very moment his father was launching a presidential bid was just an astonishing coincidence. Do NOT call it a sloppy attempt at destroying evidence in a way that results in plausible deniability until it ran into a legally blind repairman who chose NOT to wipe the contents and resell the hardware.
Heavens, no. Not that.
And let’s not look too carefully into any lingering questions about what in the HELL was going on with that creepy as all get-out sound-stage replica of the White House.
This one:
It was complete with a green-screen window loaded with *whoops* a scene from the wrong time of year.. Details matter.
Even leaving all of that aside, we’ve got an exchange between Keith Ablow (Hunter Biden’s shrink) and Hunter Biden in January of 2019 discussing dear old dad’s … wait for it… dementia. This was BEFORE he launched his presidential campaign.
Pages 143-144 Texts between Hunter Biden and Dr. Keith Ablow, from Hunter’s now confirmed to be authentic laptop, in January of 2019, MONTHS before Joe announced he was going to run in 2020, seemingly confirm his dementia.
WHO WAS RUNNING THE COUNTRY for 4 years?
— 🔴 P𝕠𝐔𝔫Ⓒ𝓔г (@bloodless_coup)
The dementia was known, at least by the inner circle, very early in the game.
We will pick up the data point of the signature on Hunter Biden’s pardon. We have, at this point, no reason to doubt the authenticity of the signature on Hunter’s pardon. Barring any reason other than the autopen question that its validity would be challenged, that pardon is likely to stand, even if others are successfully negated.
Look carefully at the difference between the two signatures, not just the style, but their quality.
By definition, dementia, in any of its forms, is a progressive disease. One of the ways that progress manifests itself is in a visible deterioration of handwriting quality. Notice how he struggled to write the ‘B’ in his own signature, and how different the faltering childlike letters are from the stylized signature captured by the autopen at some undetermined time beforehand.
Now that Biden’s political capital is spent, rival factions can speak freely about things that could not be said while he was in office. Even Jake Tapper, who once defended Joe Biden’s mental state has since written a book exposing just how far gone his decline really was.
It was the worst-kept secret in Washington. But it was still closely guarded until the very minute last June when Joe Biden’s chance of beating Trump was proven to be zero. After rigging the game in Joe’s favor, they rigged it again in Kamala’s. (All in the name of ‘defending Democracy’, of course!)
Anyone who dared tell the truth (before the truth was allowed to be spoken) took a beating over it. Just days before the wheels fell of of Biden’s campaign bus, media types were still trying to gaslight us with words like ‘cheap fakes’.
There’s an upper limit on what they could do to control the mental fitness narrative.
They can control access to him, and hide that. They can limit his speech, and hide that symptom. But some things are hard to fake.
Like when one of the most important and public parts of your job involves signing documents into law. Eventually, someone will look closely at that signature…
if there is reason to believe he’s mentally impaired.
Four years is a long time for a symptom like dysgraphia to progress in its decline. Unlike some of the other things that can be controlled for or coached, handwriting really cannot be faked.
That’s why people like yours truly wanted to see Joe Biden draw a clock. Not that we WANTED a Kamala Presidency, we just didn’t think that Joe was really running the show any more than President Wilson was after his stroke.
JOETUS was little more than a blank canvas that political operatives could fill with whatever they wished. He was an empty figurehead. POTUS in name only.
Having watched the lengths these deep-state clowns are willing to go to deceive us, it would be one HUNDRED percent on-brand if that now-infamous Autopen was introduced for the
purpose of disguising the impairment in Joe Biden’s handwriting so that we would not have an excuse to force a cognitive test that could result in Dems having to invoke the 25th Amendment.
Invoking the 25th so late in the game would raise far to many of the awkward ‘what did you know and when did you know it’ questions, giving the GOP a chance at power.
And POWER was the one thing these Dems truly care about."
WHISTLEBLOWER: Deep Staters Trying To Destroy Evidence Before Trump Appointees Can Get To It,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/whistleblower-deep-staters-trying-to-destroy-evidence-before-trump-appointees-can-get-to-it/,"Under ordinary circumstances, I’d be using this space to invoke the newly-revealed sex talk channels that ‘intelligence community’ personnel have been using to chat among themselves. In an environment where people are fired for using the wrong pronoun, this gives a little window into how far down the rabbit hole we’ve already fallen.
But we can’t stop and talk about this right now, because we’re talking about the reports we’re hearing about people within the FBI furiously destroying records whose breadcrumbs would lead us to … what, exactly?
If we don’t stop them soon, we might never know.
But it sure sounds like the kind of behavior that would land someone in the center of a criminal investigation.
What do we know about THAT story?
We began with a story about CIA firings being ‘dangerous’ because the fired members could take sensitive information and sell it to our adversaries.
To which most of us would say, if that’s even a serious temptation they feel, they ought not be within a 1000 yards of any such sensitive information.
But that conversation led to others claiming there was a data purge going on in response to Trumpian promises to make that information public.
Which led to the following reply:"

We may never have a full accounting of who absconded with how much in that scheme or any of a dozen like it.
Joy almost never missed a chance to invoke every divisive wedge issue one could imagine, from race, to politics, to gender, to vax status — and did we mention race, because she did. Unendingly.

ANDREW LINN: On The Arrest of Sloan Rachmuth,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/andrew-linn-on-the-arrest-of-sloan-rachmuth/,"On October 31, 2024, Rachmuth went to a supermarket named Harris Teeter (a subsidiary of Kroger) when she saw one of its employees named Amira M. Fattah wearing a keffiyeh. After Fattah said she was wearing it to support the Palestinian cause, Rachmuth (who is Jewish and a supporter of Israel) complained to the store’s manager Sheronna Irick, who dismissed her concern. A complaint to the Harris Teeter corporate office was also dismissed.
Rachmuth then took to social media about the incident, posting a photo of Fattah wearing her keffiyeh on X. Someone (perhaps Irick) notified the police.
Soon afterwards, three police officers- Elliott Warren, Benjamin Marino, and Edgar Hernandez, showed up at Rachmuth’s house with a warrant for her arrest. The charge: a bias-motivated offense (whatever that is). When Rachmuth asked what she was being arrested for, Officer Marino replied that it was something that made Fattah uncomfortable. And Officer Warren (who obtained the warrant), accused Rachmuth of using her cellphone to “harass, embarrass, and terrify” Fattah.
At any rate, Rachmuth’s arrest (which was recorded on video) showed her being handcuffed and paraded through the neighborhood. And even though she was charged for a misdemeanor that did not mandate being arrested, her bail was set at $1,000 in cash- an amount usually reserved for more serious offenses. She was also treated like a violent criminal while being booked.
Meanwhile, the liberal media and various leftists got wind of the incident and launched a smear campaign against Rachmuth."
EPSTEIN SHOWDOWN: Pam Bondi Turns Kash Loose Against Rogue FBI Office In New York,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/epstein-showdown-pam-bondi-turns-kash-loose-against-rogue-fbi-office-in-new-york/,"That ‘last stand’ is being made on absolutely indefensible ground: concealing the evidence that would lead to incrimination and potentially the conviction of Jeffrey Epstein’s associates and criminal co-conspirators.
Trump has long promised transparency on issues the government has never quite come clean on. The big ones include JFK, 9/11, and of course the Jeffrey Epstein files. We remember, after Epstein died, how the world called BS on the contents of the safe on his island unaccountably going ‘missing’. Something about the warrant not covering the contents of the dead man’s safe.
Sure, Jan.
Fast forward to Feb 2025. Trump is in office, Mayorkas and Wray have packed their bags. Bondi and Patel are sworn in. An order went out to produce all of the information relevant to the Epstein case. Bondi, with a certain amount of fanfare, prepared a document for public release of the information we have so far.
It was anticlimactic. But a letter sent from Bondi to Kash Patel shines a lot of light on WHY there was so little meat on that bone: the New York office of the FBI has gone rogue, and is refusing to comply with lawful orders.
Here’s what the letter Pam Bondi sent him says:
Dear Director Patel,
Before you came into office, I requested the full and complete files related to Jeffrey Epstein. In response to this request, I received approximately 200 pages of documents, which consisted primarily of flight logs, Epstein’s list of contacts, and a list of victims’ names and phone numbers.
I repeatedly questioned whether this was the full set of documents responsive to my request and was repeatedly assured by the FBI that we had received the full set of documents.
Late yesterday, I learned from a source that the FBI Field Office in New York was in possession
of thousands of pages of documents related. to the investigation and indictment. ofEpstein.
Despite my repeated requests, the FBI never disclosed the existence of these files. ‘When ydii
and I spoke yesterday, you were just as surprised as I was to learn this new information.
By 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, February 28; the FBI will deliver the full and complete Epstein files to my office~ including all records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of how such information was obtained. There will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your access. The Department of Justice will ensure that any public disclosure of these files·will be done in a manner to protect the privacy of victims and in accordance · with law, as I have done my entire career as a prosecutor."
Journos Lose It As White House Shatters Their Press Pool Monopoly,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/journos-lose-it-as-white-house-shatters-their-press-pool-monopoly/,"The crowd of the ‘free’ press has often shown its true colors by gleefully swallowing disreputable hoaxes (Russiagate, Russian bounties, Hunter’s laptop isn’t real etc) while refusing to acknowledge actual accomplishments (like the Abraham Accords) that would be genuinely historic if anyone NOT named Trump could be credited for them.
Contrast that to the Biden years when not a one of them said a peep about Biden’s obvious decline, or the pre-screened questions and scripted ‘pressers’ in which Biden routinely followed instructions written on his cue cards… to the letter. Often saying how he would be ‘in trouble’ if he deviated from pre-arranged plans.
The White House Press Corps has long been an incestuous little members-only club that jealously gate-kept which journos were serious enough to be included in their number. Not surprisingly, this group is so uniform in their beliefs as to be practically interchangeable.
No wonder they were upset when Trump’s PressSec told them the days of their Media Monopoly of the White House Access were coming to an end.

@PressSec announces changes to the “press pool” that covers President Trump:
“For decades, a group of D.C.-based journalists — the @WHCA — has long dictated which journalists get to ask questions of @POTUS in these most intimate spaces. Not anymore.”
There is a longstanding practice of the Press Pool being self-selecting, but there is nothing in law or the Constitution that gives them preferential access to the President to which other journalists are not entitled.
This is an old boys’ club that goes back to the Coolidge administration… and like so many other old boys’ clubs, it has a tendency to be exclusionary and self-perpetuating.
Having seen the partisanship, showboating, and rampant misbehavior in recent years (looking at YOU Jim Acosta), it’s about time the old boys’ club is forced to update their membership rules to include people that would NOT be invited to their insufferable DC cocktail parties.

ICYMI: Italy’s PM On Why She Still Believes In Western Civilization… When Others Don’t,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/icymi-italys-pm-on-why-she-still-believes-in-western-civilization-when-others-dont/,"The secular left was blind to the irony of their own rhetoric in the past week while they both denounced Trump for ‘failing to defend the West’ (as they saw it) relative to NATO and the Ukraine war… while also raging at JD Vance for the speech he gave in Germany, calling out Western leaders for abandoning the core values that make ‘The West’ worth defending.
It’s one thing to defend that which is precious and good… quite another when it is diseased, decayed, ruined, looted, or burned to the ground. JD Vance called out our European counterparts for becoming the very thing we spent so much of the last 80-some-odd years trying to oppose.
Both the Nazis and the Soviet represented a threat to the Western way of life. The world celebrated when the Berlin Wall came down, and the East Germans need no longer fear being reported to the Stasi by their neighbors, or being shot for trying to see a relative just a few blocks beyond the border.
In the place of the Nazis and Soviets, new overlords have sprung up in Europe, with new demands insisting on limits to our natural freedoms. People are arrested for speech and religious expression. Thought crimes are no longer a hypothetical, when a person can be charged for ‘silent prayer’ stemming from regret of an abortion in the past the accused was personally involved with."
BREAKING: Zelensky Gets HUMBLED In Firey White House Meeting With Trump,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/breaking-zelensky-gets-humbled-in-firey-white-house-meeting-with-trump/,"Trump was NOT going to let Zelensky lose sight of the fact that Ukraine is the supplicant and America is the great power whose favor he is hoping to curry.
Zelensky showed up for an Oval Office meeting, and started to hash out his complaints with Trump and Vance. He is used to making demands of world leaders as Ukraine serves as the battleground for what has become little more than a proxy war between Russia and the Western powers.
He probably made exactly this kind of ultimatum to Biden. And all we have to show for that is a lot of dead bodies and 130 Billion added to the debt burden of Americans yet unborn.
Trump forced Zelensky to face the fact that any strength he thinks he has in this position is owed ONLY to the strength of American strength and support. He is taking that support for granted, betting that the taxpayers will keep signing blank checks forever just to keep the war with Putin going.

Rumors Swirl Around Claims Of US Sinking Important Iranian Ship In Red Sea… Here’s What We Know,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/rumors-swirl-around-claims-of-us-sinking-important-iranian-ship-in-red-sea-heres-what-we-know/,"With Iran’s proxies kicking into high gear in the region — especially the Houthis who have declared open season on US vessles — Trump has made it clear that Iran will be held personally responsible for any escalation on the part of its surrogates.
With Iran chasing a nuke, and Trump trying to keep them from getting there, we’re fast approaching the ‘find out’ phase of this international conflict, with neither side apparently willing to blink.
Yemen has announced that it is willing to fire on American ships passing through the Red Sea. America has a role in keeping international shipping lanes open. Piracy is not a threat that Trump can easily ignore. Historically, fighting with a militant Islamist nation over issues of piracy is among the earliest martial memories America has as a nation, one memorialized every time we hear the words ‘shores of Tripoli’ sung in the Marines’ Hymn.
With the Houthis forcing our hand again, Trump is directing his attention to the wellspring on which the Islamists have relied… Iran.
Not only have they been working with groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others to destabilize the region and subvert their rivals giving them access to gear and expertise they could not manage on their own (helping Hamas coordinate the October 7 massacre, for instance), Iran has a history of helping coordinate their efforts, including intel. Even the UN admits this in

It was during action in the Red Sea in January 2024 that
bound for the Houthis.
There have been claims of attempted strikes by Yemeni Houthis against American targets, including, this past week,
. (Unsuccessful.) American forces have struck at Houthi targets, including JPost reports of successfully taking out Yemen’s Security Chief.
The rumor being reported on some social media channels — and some of the news sites that lean heavily on such reports — is that the Americans have sunk a critical new addition to Iran’s fleet… the Zagros. (Examples:
,
,
Launched only in January of this year, the Zagros is an important addition to the navy of a country like Iran that relies so heavily on cyber warfare and disposable guerrilla proxies fighting at arms’ length.
According to information published by Tasnim on January 15, 2025, the Iranian Navy has officially commissioned the Zagros, a combat reconnaissance destroyer, into its fleet. The Zagros destroyer is designed to perform both combat and intelligence missions.

Intelligence ships, often called spy ships, are specialized naval vessels designed to gather intelligence through sophisticated electronic surveillance and data collection. Operated by navies or intelligence agencies, these ships play a crucial role in national security by intercepting signals, monitoring communications, and gathering information on foreign military operations.
Equipped with advanced technologies, intelligence ships house state-of-the-art antennas and communication systems to intercept a broad range of electronic transmissions. Their satellite communication links enable real-time data sharing with command centers, enhancing situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. While primarily focused on intelligence gathering, these vessels also carry defensive systems for self-protection, ensuring operational safety in contested waters.
Operating in international waters, intelligence ships position themselves strategically to monitor sea and air activity, intercept signals, and observe military exercises. They provide a more focused and sustained intelligence-gathering capability compared to satellites, offering an invaluable asset in modern defense strategies. Many of these ships are camouflaged as civilian vessels to minimize detection and suspicion, blending seamlessly into their environment while performing critical tasks. —
We at ClashDaily will continue to treat this report as an ‘unconfirmed rumor’ until either confirmed or disproven. Unless and until there is confirmation that it has been sunk, we will treat this as another ‘fog of war’ rumor.
That said, the rumor itself is important to the larger story about this conflict. With Trump promising to escalate and make Iran pay a heavy toll, he may take a page from Ronald Reagan’s playbook. Especially if he uses their history of piracy as a justification. Specifically, we are referring to, Operation Praying Mantis, where Reagan sank Iran’s entire navy and bases after an American ship hit an Iranian mine.
If Trump wants to hold back a little so that he’s still got room to escalate, turning a shiny new intelligence gathering ship like this one into a hole in the ocean would go a long way to sending a message that we’re getting a little tired of the Iran regime’s bull***t — especially after Iran hired people to murder Trump before he could take office.
As for escalation? It’s a little difficult for a totalitarian regime like Iran to pay for terrorism from their oil field profits if the entire oil infrastructure has been blown to atoms… isn’t it?"

Judge Vs.

Now that the courts are their only path to exercising any political power at all, they suddenly can’t get enough of them.
And their hand-picked activist judges seem to understand the assignment. In a little more than a month, they have already passed as many or more Temporary Restraining Orders against Trump’s executive action that they passed in the entirety of Biden’s 4 year term.
With their once-reliable bureaucratic firewall being torn down to the studs, Dems are getting desperate. They are suddenly opposed to absolutely everything. This time, it’s the deportation of criminal terrorists in the Tren De Aragua gang.
Here’s the headline summing up the key facts of the issue:
Here’s Bondi’s reply:
“Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump’s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk. The Department of Justice is undeterred in its efforts to work with the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and all of our partners to stop this invasion and Make America Safe Again.”
What does that mean? Well, here’s a hint, from the President of the country to which they were headed:
Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country. They were immediately transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center, for a period of one year (renewable).

The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us.
Over time, these actions, combined with the production already being generated by more than 40,000 inmates engaged in various workshops and labor under the Zero Idleness program, will help make our prison system self-sustainable. As of today, it costs $200 million per year.
On this occasion, the U.S. has also sent us 23 MS-13 members wanted by Salvadoran justice, including two ringleaders. One of them is a member of the criminal organization’s highest structure.
This will help us finalize intelligence gathering and go after the last remnants of MS-13, including its former and new members, money, weapons, drugs, hideouts, collaborators, and sponsors.
As always, we continue advancing in the fight against organized crime. But this time, we are also helping our allies, making our prison system self-sustainable, and obtaining vital intelligence to make our country an even safer place. All in a single action.

As longtime fans of Bongino, ourselves, Bill might be right on target with that insight. What’s the word he came up with? Here’s a hint, it hails back the days of knights and chivalric codes… and it’s not a word we hear used every day.

If you want a hint, I can tell you this much: Bill introduces the term at about the 2:00 minute mark.

Trump Gets Last Laugh As ANOTHER Fake News Flunkie Gets The Pink Slip,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/trump-gets-last-laugh-as-another-fake-news-flunkie-gets-the-pink-slip/,"From the very first days of Trump’s first term in office, he was at war with the Fake News merchants. Now, he’s watching them drop like flies.
With Biden taking office in 2021, Trump’s digital presence going dark, and the Mar-A-Lago raids triggering a cascade of criminal cases against him, the usual suspects on the left cheered his demise, little imagining that HE should be the one laughing at THEIR fall into obscurity.
And fall they have. One by one like dominoes. Think of all the names we used to see ripping on Trump back in 2017? Where did they all go? They died with their ratings. They pushed the lies too hard for too long, and the world realized they had nothing to say.
Jim Acosta, Chris Wallace, Don Lemon, Chuck Todd, Chris Cuomo, Brian ‘The Potato’ Stelter… the list of media failsons of former ‘resistance’ journos goes on and on."
Journo Asks The ‘Old Law’ Question To Homan… Instantly Regrets It,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/journo-asks-the-old-law-question-to-homan-instantly-regrets-it/,"Tom Homan is nothing like the sort of GOP appointee journos of yesteryear set up with ‘do you still beat your wife’ trap questions.
The media flunkies are the same old stale routine. They still ask the questions that are intended to scare the interviewee into complacency, intimidate them into rubbing the rough edges off of a ‘contoversial’ policy (‘controversial’, of course, as deemed by the standards of the coastal chattering class).
But something has changed since Trump came down that golden elevator. Instead of just a few stalwarts like Ted Cruz going toe to toe with media and beating them at their own game, Trump set a precedent of publicly humiliating them on their own turf again and again and again.
The press are no different than the Wizard of Oz. The SEEM to have the power to destroy their victims, but in reality, they have no more power than such power as we give them.
Not only did he stand up, he has inspired a whole crew of other voices to do the same. Better still, he went looking for people who were already wired with that temperment, and put them in positions of responsiblity. They are exactly the kind of people who cannot be bullied by media types.
When some journo picked up the ‘zombie law’ talking point about Trump using a 200yo law to send foreign-born criminals off to El Salvadore, where both countries benefit from the transaction, Tom Homan doesn’t get panicky. He doesn’t break a sweat.
He looks the journo right in the eye and gives him a pitch-perfect answer that no serious person can refute.
Reporter: ""That law is 200 years old!""
Tom Homan: ""Well, the Constitution is a lot older than that and we still follow it""
— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness)
He makes his point, grins, and walks away.
If that wasn’t enough to kick the hornets’ nest, how about another media interaction. This time, on the topic of the flights themselves he answers a friendly media face from FoxNews who seems a little flabbergasted about the long odds Homan has stacked against him. Homan does not share Lawrence’s nervous apprehension.

BEN & JERRY’S CEO FIRED: Cancel Culture Warrior Gets Taste Of Own Medicine,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/ben-jerrys-ceo-fired-cancel-culture-warrior-gets-taste-of-own-medicine/,"There’s a reason ‘go woke go broke’ has become axiomatic. Even institutions as big as Disney and Bud Light have learned they are not too big to feel the sting of a spurned public returning the favor.
As for politics, there aren’t many corporate political attention whores louder than Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.
Ben & Jerry’s sold their company to Unilever in 2000, with the expectation that they could continue their political grandstanding. It looks like, 25 years later, reality has finally caught up with them.
In a legal complaint filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday night, Ben & Jerry’s alleged that Unilever dismissed chief executive David Stever after he failed to comply with the parent company’s efforts to prevent it from speaking out on political issues.
“Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry’s personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever’s efforts to silence the Social Mission,” the filing read.
“On March 3, 2025, Unilever informed the Independent Board that they were removing and replacing Mr. Stever as Ben & Jerry’s CEO.” —
A related case, from 2024, detailed the fights over Ben & Jerry’s fighting for the right to push their pro-Palestine, Anti-Israel positions, including donating money to groups like CAIR, who was once named
The old CEO has now been fired, and the case cited above involves claims that Unilever is attempting to disband the activist group steering B&J’s activism. The subsidiary is taking the case to court. Again.
It said Unilever chastised Stever in a January performance review for “repeatedly acquiescing” to Ben & Jerry’s promotion of social goals, and has repeatedly warned personnel not to defy its efforts to “silence the social mission.”
Ben & Jerry’s also said Unilever’s attacks on its social mission have reached “new levels of oppressiveness.”
It said Unilever blocked it in February from honoring Black History Month, and more recently from supporting the release from detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. legal permanent resident active in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University and who the Trump administration wants to deport. —
He gives a big thumbs-up to using financial pressure to force countries to bend to his will, and it doesn’t occur to this clown that his own obnoxious petulance can trigger the same response against the brand he claims to represent? Or that 25 years of this increasingly radical activism could poison all value of the brand to the company that bought it in the first place, turning it into a potential net-negative for the company’s bottom line?"
Trump Unleashing Autopen Nightmare Against Biden’s NeverTrump Cabal,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/trump-unleashing-autopen-nightmare-against-bidens-nevertrump-cabal/,"There were rumblings in recent days that the Biden Autopen story would set up a constitutional crisis. Now, it has endangered the very people it was intended to protect.
First, it was noticed that the signatures on some of his orders were identical. That’s a problem, pointing to the use of an autopen. Making matters worse, some of Biden’s orders were signed while he was out of town. That’s a pretty serious problem.
Not to mention that Joke Biden was in the Virgin Islands when ""someone"", in Washington DC, used autopen to sign those pardons.
— Linda Traitz (@LindaTraitz)
The Constitution required the president to be personally involved and present:
Is the ""autopen"" allowed for presidential pardons? NO!
The ""autopen"" is NOT constitutionally protected because it requires the president to be present at the signing of the pardon.
Joe Biden was on vacation in another state when the pardons were signed.

Needless to say, Trump has been feeding the memes since this came to light with social media posts like this one.
And getting in on them himself:
All joking aside, this has very serious implications for people who may have been abusing their authority to the detriment of other people. Especially those who may have thought they were free and clear, as explained in

The potential consequences are bad enough for the Biden Crime family, and the bad actors in his administration who thought they need never pay a price for all they have done.
But with today being the day that no less than Dan Bongino is being sworn in as Kash Patel’s deputy, with a LOT of questions he still wants answered about Russiagate, the Jan 6 committee hearings, the pipe bomb, and other questions that had been quietly swept under the rug…

what I mean when I say:
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. In Cold War terms, Dems were moving to Defcon 2 when they heard that Kash Patel somehow survived every attempt on their part to deep-six his candidacy.
The guy who discovered and exposed the plot to take down a sitting president, as Devon Nunes’s staffer has a really good idea of where all the bodies are buried. If you’re wondering why swamp critters like Schiff and Swalwell are sweating his appointment, that’s got something to do with it.
But that was just the beginning.
Did you happen to hear about ATF? Oh, you’re about to.
Dems are about to lose their freaking minds over that story. Not only is Kash in charge of the FBI… he’s been given an interim role on top of that.
President Donald Trump’s newly-confirmed FBI director, Kash Patel, is expected to take on another top law enforcement role in the administration as head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to a White House official and two other sources familiar with the plan.
Patel’s appointment could be made official as soon as next week with a swearing-in ceremony, the sources said.
The ATF, a law enforcement agency housed in the Department of Justice, is responsible for enforcing federal laws regarding the illegal use, sale and trafficking of firearms and explosives, as well as the illegal diversion of alcohol and tobacco products. —

One of the wrinkles left out of that conversation is that the names of the victims themselves will be among the names of the offenders, and the last thing any honest citizen would want to do is revictimize the girls who have been trafficked on Epstein Island, his planes, and anywhere else he would ‘entertain’ his VIP guests.
But the long wait to know who’s on that list could be ending sooner than we thought, according to Pam Bondi herself, who said the list has made it to her desk.

And with the current budget reconciliation rules, Democrats can’t even stop it in the Senate so long as 50 senators back it.
This vote opens up the process, and each committee will come back with specific budget proposal that put flesh on the bones of the priorities as outlined here.
As of last night, we were one step closer to that ‘big beautiful bill’ that Trump was hoping for to put his 2025 mandate into law. That includes keeping the Trump-era tax cuts from disappearing. But we’ve still got a long way to go.
It also includes other things like slashing the taxes on tips and overtime. Naturally, Democrats opposed it. Every last one of them.
By their own rules, ones that they make the GOP play by, we get to tag them with their opposition to ‘no tax on tips’ and ‘no tax on overtime’, no matter WHAT the other reasons they may have been opposed to the bill. If they can use that sketchy tactic to slander the GOP, they’d best be ready to have it bounce back at them.

Why is it Elon and the Donald?,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/why-is-it-elon-and-the-donald/,"In theory, we asked our representatives and senators to do the same thing. We saw our politicians make speeches to an empty chamber saying the right things. What is different this time, and why did Democrats call the Trump team
The short answer is that
They received kickbacks. Some of the money was in the form of campaign contributions from Non-Profit Non-Government Organizations. Some of the payoffs were in fees for sitting on the board of an NGO. Tens-of-thousands of non-profit organizations were funded with our tax dollars. That money went to politicians like Clinton and Obama, to party officials, and to the money-men like Bloomberg and Soros. Very little of our tax money went to fund the poor.
Trump and Musk are billionaires. They can’t be bought with money. Neither is an outstanding character, but it appears the CIA can’t threaten to expose their flights on the Epstein “Lolita Express”. That made them unique on the political stage. They were smart enough to find the corruption. They were also too rich to bribe and too straight to blackmail.
Democrat politicians were right. The Don-and-Elon team are a real “threat to democracy as we know it,” and they arrive just in time. It is funny to watch low-level federal judges issue injunctions against DOGE while

What is NOT as obvious to the electorate is how important a Wisconsin vote that is already underway will play in whether Dems can run that exact play in Wisconsin during the lead-up to the Midterm elections.
The electorate is not the only part of Wisconsin that’s split pretty nearly down the middle. Their courts have the same dynamic. Whichever candidate (and therefore party) wins the vote today will hold the majority in State politics there… which can have implications on anything from election rules to the daily aspects of living our lives.
Here’s Ted Nugent’s recent appeal for conservatives to get involved in voting, or persuading their conservative friends in the area to do the same.

The post he was quote-tweeting (

The first day of Wisconsin, early in-person voting is in the books, and each candidate has something to like.
🔵Susan Crawford – Turnout for day one was a little light. 34,036 voters showed up, more than double the first day in 2023 but short of what Schimel wants to see. A modest turnout ensures Dane County’s oversized influence and prevents R’s from running up the numbers in the rural.
🔴Brad Schimel – Where the vote came from yesterday was good news for Republicans. Waukesha led all counties in raw vote turnout (a rarity), and Ozaukee + Washington counties led overall turnout rates compared to previous general elections.
If you’re a Republican, you love to see where the early vote comes from. If you’re a Democrat, you love to see that the volume is modest, at best.
Susan Crawford remains in pole position, and early voting continues through Sunday, March 30th.

Not everything we might have asked for, true. But mistakes made during Trump 1.0 have taught us the dangers inherent in letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Here is Speaker Johnson shortly before the vote, telling us he has the votes (he did) and that the bill was going to pass with or without any help from the Democrats (It passed without.)
He calls out the lies that Dems have been telling about Social Security. It takes 60 votes in the Senate to pass this bill, which means that success or failure of this bill will once again be a decision made by a certain Chuck U. Schumer. Mike has something to say about that, too:

WEF Puppet Trudeau Is Gone… Meet The WEF String-Puller Who Replaced Him,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/wef-puppet-trudeau-is-gone-meet-the-wef-string-puller-who-replaced-him/,"It’s a different system that plays by different rules.
Canadian voters have no direct say on which person becomes leader of the country. Like so many countries whose system mirrors that of the UK, each party picks their party leader, and whichever party has the most seats gets to run the country. The leader of the party is, by default, the leader of the country.
Most of the time, votes for a leadership change happen when a party is OUT of power. But Trudeau was on the ropes, and there was a real possibility that a non-confidence vote would have thrown his sorry ass and that of his government out ont its keister. Conservative (by Canadian standards, anyway) Pierre Poilievre was on track to lead the biggest electoral ass-kicking since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Justin Blackface Trudeau had to DO something.
Here’s an
, riffing off the video of Carney being announced as new party leader:
For those who keep trying to tell me I don’t understand how this all works, allow me to help you understand what’s happened here: There was about to be a be vote of no-confidence in Parliament, which would have forced Trudeau’s resignation and an election, which Poilievre was guaranteed to win. Knowing this and to avoid this, Trudeau froze parliament for two and a half months so he and the party could gin up another “emergency,” which only the Liberals and their new chosen leader, Carney, who shares Trudeau and his team’s agenda, can fight. Trump is their invented enemy, who they are working very hard to paint as exactly like Poilievre. Isn’t that convenient? Anyway, many Canadians have fallen for this and now the Liberals are up in the polls thanks to their plan, fear-mongering, and propagandizing. The party was done, now they’re back, and the economy is about to get even more fucked that it already was because the Liberals care about power, not Canadians.
Carney has not held elected office. Period. And as of today, he will be sworn in as Prime Minister.
Ok, so libs gamed the system in more or less the same way their Democrat cousins wanted to in the installation of what’s her name with the coconut tree branding.
We know that Trudeau was a good little choirboy singing from the songsheet of every globalist initiative around. What do we know about the new guy?
Well, if Trudeau is best understood as a puppet of the WEF, Mark Carney has spent the last decade or so as one of the insider puppeteers.

I’m glad you asked, because we’ve got a couple of guys who have already seen what success looks like. And it’s nothing like what so many of the authors with their slick hair would have you think.
The problem with so many of the opportunities God puts in front of us is that it looks an awful lot like hard work. And if you aren’t motivated for the end result the way that Jesus was when he ‘despised the cross but endured the shame’ specifically because of the redeemed people who would be waiting for Him on the other side of His obedience… most of us are going to give up long before we see any real results.

As for the ‘Climate Change Holy Grail’ he’s sending to the scrapheap of history? It was Obama’s secret weapon to force-feed his climate change agenda down America’s throats… by calling carbon a ‘pollutant’.
I’ve been told that reconsidering the 2009 Endangerment Finding would be viewed as an attack on the Holy Grail of the climate change religion. Today’s announcement, without the slightest amount of apology or regret, is about following the constitution and rule of law.

HEY LIBS: What Trump Said About Canada’s Conservative Will Melt Your Brains,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/hey-libs-what-trump-said-about-canadas-conservative-will-melt-your-brains/,"Surely Trump will throw Pierre Poilievre a lifeline to help him out, right? He’s a Conservative, after all.
Trump’s tariff agenda caught everyone in Canada flat-footed, and it’s a big reason Mark Carney (pictured below with Epstein’s girl) rushed in to fill a sudden and unexpected Trudeau vacancy.
In the same way that the Dems have yet to figure out exactly how to unify in their opposition to Trump, as he moves like a bulldozer through so many of their favorite things, Canadians are scrambling to find a response to the existential threat tariffs will cause the Canadian economy.
Trump may be joking about the 51st state thing. Mostly. But there’s a kernel of truth at the heart of it. Canada’s economy has been characterized by some who know as a house of cards, largely propped up by protectionist trade policy.
Remember the conservative Canuck with the apple who was so popular a while back? He’s the leader of the Conservatives. With an election coming up, and the message of ‘Trudeau is corrupt and can’t lead worth a damn’ suddenly irrelevant with Trudeau leaving, he has to convince a nervous Canadian public that he’s ‘doing someting’.
Leftwing media in Canada (almost oll of it) wants voters to see Poilievere as ‘little Trump’, and uses the same king of ‘pulling his strings’ puppet imagery about their relationship that the Presstitutes try to use in calling Trump subservient to Putin. *Yawn*
Because Canada does not yet see through their lying press, many are believing what they’re being told… which is turning independents away from Pierre, in favor of the shiny new guy from Davos who was just sworn in to replace Trudeau. (Majority Leader gets to be Prime Minister. Just like England. It’s messy, but it’s the system they’ve got.)
Here’s Trump’s chance to set the record straight, to denounce the new guy and smile on Pierre Poilievre, who is a fiscal conservative who believes in many of the same principles that energize MAGA.
Given a chance to make nice with Pierre, what did he do? He said nicer things about the Big Lib than he did about the Conservative who ‘said some bad things’ about him.

Lydia Mugambe, High Judge in Uganda, a Criminal Trubunal judge for the United Nations, a student at Oxford, and someone who is listed as a ‘fellow’ at the Institute for the Study of Human Rights, has just been found guilty of one of the more heinous crimes a person can be accused of… a conviction only made worse by the nature of her role in society.
If others look to HER to be the arbiter of justice, to whom shall those she has wronged in the most grievous of ways turn?
Prosecutors said Lydia Mugambe “took advantage of her status” over her victim by preventing her from holding down steady employment while forcing her to work as her maid and provide childcare for free.
The 49-year-old, who is also a High Court judge in Uganda, was found guilty of conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law, facilitating travel with a view to exploitation, forcing someone to work, and conspiracy to intimidate a witness..
She will be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on May 2.
In footage released by Thames Valley Police, Mugambe appeared shocked when an officer said he was arresting her under the Modern Slavery Act.
She then had a conversation with the officer, in which she said: “I am a judge in my country, I even have immunity. I am not a criminal.” —
Not a criminal? That’s pretty wild for someone who will be getting her sentencing in about 6 weeks.

Trump Doubles Down On Canada… They Are In Even Worse Shape Than We Thought,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/trump-doubles-down-on-canada-they-are-in-even-worse-shape-than-we-thought/,"In one of his classic ‘allow me to unconfuse you’ moments, Trump spells out exactly what he meant when he made his most provocative statements about Canada being absorbed into the United States.
“I’m not going to bend at all.”
‘Canada only works as a state’, he says.
Trump: “Canada Should Be a U.S. State – We Don’t Need Them, They Need Us!”
Trump: “Look, We’ve been ripped off for years, and we’re not gonna be ripped off anymore. No. I’m not gonna bend at all—aluminum, steel, cars—we’re not gonna bend. We’ve been ripped off as a country for…
— Open Source Intel (@Osint613)
He’s even talking up how great it would be as a state. But the flip side of that coin is simple: Canada, as it is currently being run, cannot continue to exist without being propped up by sales to US markets.
Sure, that’s part of the argument. So is the argument that Canadians have the social programs they like to brag about only because they are standing under the protective umbrella of the US military who has been protecting them through the Cold War.
Without the access they have to US markets, their economy would be in the toilet. That’s the REAL reason Canadians are getting so uppity since Trump came to office. But it’s worse than that.
There have been recent stories detailing the Canadian military as being in dire shape, not only inadequate for cooperative multi-nation exercises with, say, NATO allies (a long-standing problem), but also in the ability to provide the most basic notion of national defence.
I recently had a conversation with Lt.-Gen. Michel Maisonneuve (ret.), and what he told me about Canada’s military was nothing short of alarming. He didn’t mince words—our armed forces are in dire straits. If we don’t act now, Canada will not only be unable to defend itself, but it will cease to be taken seriously by our allies, many of whom are already losing patience with our military decline.
Maisonneuve has seen firsthand what a functioning military looks like. He has served at the highest levels, working alongside our allies in NATO, and he knows exactly what Canada is failing to do. “We are no longer at the table when major defence decisions are made,” he told me. “The Americans don’t ask us what we think anymore because they know we can’t contribute.” That is a stunning indictment of where we now stand—a country that was once respected for its ability to punch above its weight militarily has been reduced to an afterthought.
The problem, as Maisonneuve laid out, is both simple and staggering: Canada doesn’t take its defence seriously anymore. The government has allowed our forces to wither. The Air Force is still flying CF-18s from the 1980s because the long-delayed F-35 procurement is years behind schedule. The Navy, once a competent maritime force, is barely functional, with no operational submarines and a fleet that is nowhere near what is needed to patrol our vast coastlines. Meanwhile, the Army is struggling to recruit and retain soldiers, leaving its numbers dangerously low. “We have an Army in name only,” Maisonneuve said. “If we were called upon tomorrow to deploy a fully operational combat force, we couldn’t do it.” —"

LIZZO V. DISNEY: How One Learned From Past Mistakes And The Other Never Will,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/lizzo-v-disney-how-one-learned-from-past-mistakes-and-the-other-never-will/,"Two stories this weekend offer an opportunity for the political right to better navigate that difficult path of holding moral principles while also leaving an invitation to the path of redemption.
With Disney and Lizzo, we see two very vocal and bellicose icons of movements on the political left, not merely believing toxic ideas, but proudly and loudly insisting others should share in embracing them… to the point of being hostile to anyone who did not bend the knee to their worldview.
News from this weekend gives us an opportunity to revisit that fork in the road, and see how those choices have played out.
For decades, now, the soulless husk of the grand vision of its namesake has been looking for every opportunity to not only abandon the family-friendly values of its progenitor, but to declare war upon them.
Here’s a quote from an LGBT source in early 2024 cheering Disney’s announcement to double down on the woke agenda (in this case, the LGBT flavor of it) rather than responding to parental petitions to leave the gender questions out of the kids shows.
Disney CEO Bob Chapek when intervened by LGBTQ+ activist said that the company will focus on increasing LGBTQ characters and stories.
Chapek said that Disney strongly believes in reflecting the creative content to the majority of audience and that they will have an increased commitment to move forward with the implementation of LGBT in their characters and stories. He said, “We want to tell stories that our audience wants to hear, that reflects their lives.” (
, March 2024)
They’ve done a little backpedaling since then, dropping a trans character from a project, and shoehorning a Christian character into the story as something of an olive branch. But it’s tough to take such overtures seriously when you look at how they’ve handled projects like Snow White.
The title character — whose appearance is literally baked right into the name — has been cast by someone who has been jokingly called by many other names in the vein of “snow tan” or “dirt white” has been blasted a little more on the nose as ‘Snow Woke’ which fits with her now-infamous savaging of the origninal beloved film. “”The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so. There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! Weird! So we didn’t do that this time.”
Fans rightly noted how it was a bad idea for someone who clearly hates the original story to be chosen as the face of the live-action remake.
The big test for what the public thought of this offering would come where people voted with their wallets. It failed that test.
Trouble is a brewin’ for the controversy-laden Snow White, the live-action remake of the iconic 1937 animated film that put Walt Disney‘s film empire on the map.
The big-budget tentpole opened to $43 million domestically, enough for a first-place finish but behind even the most modest of expectations after getting battered by so-so audience scores and underwhelming reviews. That’s even less than Tim Burton’s Dumbo, which came in at $45 million in 2019. Overseas, Snow White took in $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million after hoping to clear $100 million. —
Many in our audience might be surprised even to read a mention of Lizzo, with a ‘who cares what Lizzo thinks’ kneejerk reaction to news about a personality they don’t follow in a music genre they don’t care about.
But if any of us are serious in our desire to see the culture transformed, we WILL have to interact with the people in it, and that includes influencers.
In this case we see someone who had been leading those who followed her down a dangerous path, has rethought her life choices and is now leading — by here own example, no less — anyone who looks up to her in a much better direction.
It wasn’t so long ago that Lizzo was, in some literal sense, the poster girl for what has been dubbed ‘body-positivity’.
She describes herself as fat and says she wants to normalize and destigmatize larger bodies. Yet, in an interview with People magazine in 2022, she said she’s gotten tired of people constantly talking about her body size. “I know I’m fat. It doesn’t bother me. I like being fat, and I’m beautiful and I’m healthy. So can we move on?” —
Fast forward to this past weekend, where she was in the news for different reason. We’ll not include the photo of her wearing fishnet stockings. (You’re welcome.) But her update is worthy of notice:
“I did it,” she captioned an Instagram post. “Today when I stepped on my scale, I reached my weight release goal. I haven’t seen this number since 2014! Let this be a reminder you can do anything you put your mind to. Time for new goals!”
In one photo, Lizzo posed in a maroon sports bra and matching leggings. In another, she shared a screenshot of her progress, which showed that her BMI was down 10.5 and that she had lost 16% of her total body fat. —"
UKRAINE: Trump Moves One Step Closer To Keeping That Peace Deal Promise,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/ukraine-trump-moves-one-step-closer-to-keeping-that-peace-deal-promise/,"Anyone looking at the war reports in the Ukraine/Russia conflict will see they are still trading punches. That’s PART of the story, but not the whole story. Opportunities for peace — however unlikely they might seem to the casual observer, are budding like the first crocus of spring.
Most media types failed to understand the real reason Zelensky’s failed Oval Office visit bothered Trump so much. They chalked it up to ego and personality, when their ‘yass Queen’ hero Zelensky told the big bad Orange bully to pound sand right in his own house.
That wasn’t even CLOSE to what was eating at Trump. He has one goal and one goal only: use the tools at his disposal to keep the Ukraine conflict from spiraling out of control to become the next Archduke Ferdinand scenario, dragging the entire world into a nuclear-enabled Great Powers free-for-all.
We know that’s Trump’s concern. How do we know it? Because he keeps talking about how important it is that we avert WWIII. This is, in all probability, an even higher priority to him than any one preferred resolution of the current conflict.
Trump and Zelensky were SUPPOSED to come out of that meeting as the united voice calling for a path to peace, so that America’s energies could be spent on bringing Putin to the negotiating table.
The fact that Trump has done some very public arm-twisting policy announcements affecting both Zelensky AND Putin has shown that his first loyalty is not to one side or the other, so much as a path forward to peace.
With US military support on hold until Trump is convinced Zelensky is willing to negotiate peace in good faith, it wasn’t very long before Ukraine realized this isn’t a fight they can win without America in their corner.
That was the old story. Now, we’re turning the page to open up new possiblities.
Zelensky has not only sent a written letter of apology for how things played out in the Oval Office (a mistake many still lay at the feet of Democrats who had been quietly urging him to be hostile to Trump), but he has shown himself open to a period of ceasefire while negotiators from both sides look for some kind of an off-ramp from the conflict.
After the fallout and reconciliation, Ukrainian diplomats signaled their willingness to agree to a 30-day preliminary ceasefire with Russia as part of their negotiations with American officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday."
Beware of the DOGE!,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/beware-of-the-doge/,"With DOGE racking up one win after another as they overturn rocks in the DC swamp and find out what’s REALLY been lurking under there, you’d think the DOGE team would be celebrated with a ticker tape parade.
Instead, they’re being hailed as the worst kind of villain. And that makes no sense at all.
Unless, that is, there is something about the waste and abuse they’re uncovering that politicians actually approve of and want to keep hidden from the public eye.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD: Baby Parts Whistleblowers Get Last Laugh Over Manhattan Abortion Mill,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/planned-parenthood-baby-parts-whistleblowers-get-last-laugh-over-manhattan-abortion-mill/,"His story became a real scandal to Planned Parenthood. The GOP was starting to wake up not just to the fact that they were taking a lot of their federal funding, and dumping it back into the political campaigns that would get Democrats elected.
Worse than their abuse of tax dollars to flip elections was the way they flaunt laws governing what can and cannot be done in an abortion process. Under people like Rubio, these videos were being used to energize a movement that would put Planned Parenthood under the microscope and prompt changes in law.
Enter Kamala Harris, California’s AG, who went out of their way to criminalize that reporting, slapping them with 15 indictments, raiding their apartments and seizing footage, including some that had not been released. It wasn’t until January of this year — a decade later — that California dropped the charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, despite a Texas court ruling that these videos were in no way ‘deceptively edited’ as the Planned Parenthood people would have claimed.
Fast forward to March of 2025, and the same Manhattan Planned Parenthood site that was featured in the baby parts videos, and you see THIS news:
Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, amid mounting financial pressure, is looking to sell its SoHo building and shutter the clinic there, a move that will leave the nonprofit with no services in Manhattan, the reproductive health care provider told Gothamist.
[…]
“It is a building that requires more and more expensive maintenance, and it’s not designed to support the health care needs of the future,” Stark said of the SoHo building. Planned Parenthood moved into the site in the early 1990s. It once bore the name of the organization’s founder, Margaret Sanger.
The move comes amid financial troubles that have already forced Planned Parenthood to shut down four clinics across the state in recent months, including one on Staten Island, and cut some services. The nonprofit stopped providing abortions after 20 weeks at its Manhattan health center and discontinued the option of deep sedation for IUD placements. —
This announcement was not lost on David Daleiden, as evidenced in the post he attached to the Gothamist story cited above.

"Hacktivists, The Russia-Ukraine Conflict, X, And The Possibility of WW3",https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/hacktivists-the-russia-ukraine-conflict-x-and-the-possibility-of-ww3/,"The recent
, originating from a Ukrainian IP address, has set off alarm bells. Is this the work of rogue Ukrainian actors furious about peace negotiations? Or a classic Russian false-flag operation? Or maybe, just maybe, it’s an entirely unrelated third party stirring the pot for their own reasons? Either way, it’s yet another reminder that in the digital age, wars aren’t just fought with bullets and bombs—they’re waged in cyberspace, too.
Since Russia rolled into Ukraine in 2022, hacktivism has become an unofficial front in the war. Ukrainian-aligned groups like the
have been launching attacks on Russian infrastructure, hitting everything from government websites to financial institutions.
Meanwhile,
, the infamous decentralized hacking collective, declared “cyber war” against the Russian government, claiming responsibility for various leaks and service disruptions. These groups operate outside traditional chains of command, driven by ideology rather than state orders. And as peace negotiations tiptoe forward, there are bound to be factions—on both sides—who see compromise as betrayal.
Which brings us to the cyberattack on X. The attack was traced back to a Ukrainian IP, but let’s not kid ourselves—that doesn’t tell us much. Cybersecurity experts know that IP addresses can be spoofed as easily as a high schooler faking a doctor’s note. The
, which has historically focused on targeting Israeli and NATO-linked organizations, took credit for the attack.
That’s interesting because, on paper, they have little direct stake in Russia and Ukraine’s peace talks. But this is where things get tricky: could Dark Storm be acting as a proxy for another power? Could this be a Russian effort to frame Ukraine? Or an entirely separate party using an ongoing geopolitical crisis as a smokescreen for their own agenda?
Regardless of who’s behind it, the implications are dangerous. A single cyberattack, especially one that disrupts communication or infrastructure, could tank already fragile negotiations. It’s the digital equivalent of lobbing a grenade into a peace summit.
If we’ve learned anything from modern cyber warfare, it’s that false-flag operations are standard practice. Russia has a well-documented history of using cyber tactics to create confusion and misdirection. Their state-sponsored hacker groups—often referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)—are notorious for operations that masquerade as hacktivism.
, a GRU-linked hacking unit, has a long rap sheet of digital sabotage, including attacks on the U.S. Democratic National Committee and European governments. The goal? Sow discord, destabilize narratives, and create plausible deniability.
If Russian actors wanted to slow down or derail Ukraine’s negotiations with the West, launching an attack from a Ukrainian IP address would be a brilliant (if not predictable) move. Western governments, wary of cyber aggression, might second-guess their support for Ukraine if they believed Kyiv was behind a high-profile cyber assault. And if this attack on X isn’t the last—and it won’t be—expect more digital smokescreens designed to confuse, divide, and inflame tensions.
Now, let’s zoom out. The world isn’t just dealing with a Ukraine-Russia cyber problem. Hacktivists, cybercriminals, and state-sponsored cyber terrorists like
are thriving in this chaotic environment. And the damages are not limited to public sector, as the recent
, for example, is just one of thousands of phishing schemes targeting individuals.
Cryptocurrency markets, which President Trump has recently championed, are also under siege, with scams like the
draining digital wallets faster than you can say “blockchain.” Meanwhile, ransomware gangs like Black Basta are holding businesses hostage, exposing the internal workings of cybercrime syndicates that operate more like Fortune 500 companies than rogue groups of hackers.
This is the new reality: cyber threats aren’t just hitting governments and corporations—they’re trickling down to everyday people. If a hacker group can compromise a major social media platform, imagine what they can do to financial institutions, healthcare systems, power grids, or even small businesses. Cyber warfare is no longer an abstract, futuristic concept. It’s here, it’s happening, and it’s evolving at breakneck speed.
With hacktivism on the rise and geopolitical tensions playing out in cyberspace, here are some possible remedies:
– Countries need stronger digital forensics capabilities to track and expose real culprits. Without definitive attribution, false flags will continue to muddy the waters.
– Just as nuclear weapons have strict international oversight, cyber weapons need better global regulation. We’re way past the point of treating these threats as mere “hacker problems.”"
WATCH: Trump Signs Education Order In The Trump-iest Way Possible,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/watch-trump-signs-education-order-in-the-trump-iest-way-possible/,"That anniversary, technically, falls on the weekend. But, close enough.
Then, after greeting some of the various governors who are looking forward to assuming responsibility for administering education in their respective states, and talking briefly about the Executive orders he signed into law earlier in the day he began laying out just how dire the status quo has become for the American public school system.
He talks about how far the educational standards have fallen when compared to other countries, and how nobody pays more per pupil than the American system.
Then he lays out a solution — specifically debunking the left’s favorite talking point about the dismantling of the Department of Education leaving students with disabilities or student loans in the lurch. (About the 8 minute mark.) He brags on how well some of the States are sure to adapt to this new system, and promises to come along and help any states that take longer to get themselves up to speed.
He lingers on what that will look like, breaking into districts, and dropping off an enormous amout of expenses.
At around 11 minutes, he takes a minute to praise teachers and the work they do as immensely valuable.
At 13 minutes, it’s he wind-up. We’re going to sign a very, very important document, on we’ve wanted to sign for years (which, Reagan at least as far back as ’82, if not from the very beginning of his presidency wanted to make this change, but didn’t have control of the House to get it done.
And then he walks over to the desk where he’s going to sign the order itself, where he is flanked by aa bunch of children sitting in school desks ready to sign their own copy of an order just like the original.
They all sign their orders, and hold them up for the camera… getting the children involved in taking charge of their own future, which just ‘happens’ to be a perfect snapshot and soundbite representation of the message he was trying to get across, about shifting the responsibility for education AWAY from the central powers in DC and into the hands of the people who actually have a stake in seeing real results.
Since most lib news outlets are already getting their talking points wrong, we might as well include the full text of his order to correct the record:
Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  Our Nation’s bright future relies on empowered families, engaged communities, and excellent educational opportunities for every child.  Unfortunately, the experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars — and the unaccountable bureaucracy those programs and dollars support — has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.
Taxpayers spent around $200 billion at the Federal level on schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of the more than $60 billion they spend annually on Federal school funding.  This money is largely distributed by one of the newest Cabinet agencies, the Department of Education, which has existed for less than one fifth of our Nation’s history.  The Congress created the Department of Education in 1979 at the urging of President Jimmy Carter, who received a first-ever Presidential endorsement from the country’s largest teachers’ union shortly after pledging to the union his support for a separate Department of Education.  Since then, the Department of Education has entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that Federal control over education is beneficial.  While the Department of Education does not educate anyone, it maintains a public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 million per year.
Closing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them.  Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows.  This year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math.  The Federal education bureaucracy is not working.
Closure of the Department of Education would drastically improve program implementation in higher education.  The Department of Education currently manages a student loan debt portfolio of more than $1.6 trillion.  This means the Federal student aid program is roughly the size of one of the Nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo.  But although Wells Fargo has more than 200,000 employees, the Department of Education has fewer than 1,500 in its Office of Federal Student Aid.  The Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America’s students.
Ultimately, the Department of Education’s main functions can, and should, be returned to the States.
Sec. 2.  Closing the Department of Education and Returning Authority to the States.  (a)  The Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.
(b)  Consistent with the Department of Education’s authorities, the Secretary of Education shall ensure that the allocation of any Federal Department of Education funds is subject to rigorous compliance with Federal law and Administration policy, including the requirement that any program or activity receiving Federal assistance terminate illegal discrimination obscured under the label “diversity, equity, and inclusion” or similar terms and programs promoting gender ideology.
Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals."

"CANADA: One Leader ‘Gets’ The Tariff Strategy, Others Are Boarding The FAFO Train",https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/canada-one-leader-gets-the-tariff-strategy-others-are-boarding-the-fafo-train/,"To bring anyone up to speed on what he’s trying to accomplish, so far as Canada goes, part of the confusion comes from two different stated objectives. One objective is tied to security concerns with a border nation, the other addresses what Trump sees as unfair financial practices.
The border issue is less complicated, so let’s get that out of the way first. Canada has announced a Border Czar. But big deal. As you recall, so did Biden. Trump is taking what might be argued as a Reaganesque ‘trust but verify’ approach to Canada and the border.
Canadian leaders have talked the talk, but
making specific statements about the ‘walk the walk’ we are waiting for them to take.
If you follow the link to the video, you will find she’s making specific and clear demands about US access to law enforcement information concerning would-be border-crossers, and specific changes to tighten up the border inspection process.
As for the financial side, long before Trump ever ran for office, he was on record complaining about the trade imbalances, about jobs leaving the country, and about currency manipulation keeping the price of foreign goods artifically low. Add protectionist policies keeping American goods from competing in the other country’s markets and you’ve got a pretty good list of the concerns that have Trump annoyed with Canada.
Remember, when he went on the world stage, telling friendly countries through Europe and the Indo-Pacific that reciprocal tax rates would be assessed and set as reciprocal to foreign countries based on how well they are willing to play ball with America (potentially lowering the tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers in both countries and resulting in a freer market in each direction).
In a sense, he’s throwing the ball in the other country’s court: we have a market to which you want access, do you want it badly enough that you are willing to drop your Anti-American protectionist trade policies?
Alberta is the closest analog Canada has to Texas, rich in oil and natural resources, lots of farmers and ranchers, generally conservative-leaning (except for the cities), and is generally taken for granted by, and at odds with, all the stupid leftwing policies churned out in the national capital after being fleeced by Ottawa for their revenues. As mentioned, basically Alberta’s Texas.
The Provincial Premier understands the game Trump is playing, and cares enough about her province to get on the winning side of that equation. She’s walking a line that keeps meeting Trump’s demands and pushing back to preserve Alberta’s interests in careful tension. The provincial government made a few moves to respond — buy Canadian provisions on government contracts for example — but has come out against retaliatory tariffs:
A sensible middle ground from someone in the country being hammered by tariffs and who is expected to ‘do something’ by citizens whipped up into a froth by various state-owned, or ‘captured’ media outlets.
Of course, many other Canadians would rather treat Alberta as a sacrificial lamb, throwing a bomb into Alberta’s oil economy just to spite Trump with some higher prices.
The newly-minted replacement for Justin Trudeau, Mark Carney, is among them:
He wants to keep tariffs on
‘. At this rate, that’s going to be a cold day in hell, Mark.
That’s really not how this works, guys.
The Premier of Ontario (the province North of everything from Minnesota through New York State) is doubling down. He wants to put a surcharge on electricity being exported to the US. (Yes, that’s a thing. Yes, there’s a lot of it.)
First off, that surcharge will mainly hurt blue states in the North East. If Canucks want to see blue states actually rally behind Trump and rage against their liberal neighbo(u)rs to the North, that just might do it.
But really, Canada’s economy is far more dependent on Americas than vice versa. The countries are financially integrated, sure. Without Canada, America takes a step backward, adapts, and continues forward. Without America, Canada’s economy is in free-fall."
Criminal COVID Fraudsters Just Got Some VERY Bad News… Time Is NOT On Your Side,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/criminal-covid-fraudsters-just-got-some-very-bad-news-time-is-not-on-your-side/,"At least ONE category of criminal grifters will NOT be getting away with it… or at least, now that the DOJ is prioritizing prosecutions of the kind of scams that make political insiders fat and happy, they can’t count on indifferent politicians looking the other way while the clock winds down on the window of opportunity to prosecute.
For the many, many people with their hands in the cookie jar during COVID, that ‘window of opportunity’ just got a LOT bigger.
Remember how testy Dems got when anyone suggested clawing back the unspent COVID money even AFTER the pandemic was declared ‘over’? The states got almost 200 Billion from the Biden/Pelosi/Schumer administration. And there was a LOT of unspent money that hadn’t even been set aside for any particular use:
As of September 30, 2023, the latter group “reported obligating 73 percent ($142.4billion)” of their total and “spending 53 percent ($103.7 billion).”
In other words, state and D.C. governments are sitting on $92 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief money, more than $53 billion of which has not even been earmarked for anything. —
Dems were eventually shamed into taking back $30B. But that still leaves a lot of money unaccounted for…
We know where some of it went…
Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the $579 billion in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.
“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.” —"
SPLASHDOWN: Dolphins Greet Stranded Astronauts As SpaceX Brings Them Home Again,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/splashdown-dolphins-greet-stranded-astronauts-as-spacex-brings-them-home-again/,"In a moment where so much of our attention is spent at tearing each other’s throats out over politics, here’s a moment were we can appreciate the safe return — from the hostile environment of space — some astronauts whose original ride was giving them them some serious trouble.
It FEELS like we’re celebrating an event. And we are. But at the heart of that story are a couple of real people, who were facing an uncertain fate.
Welcome home Suni and Butch!
Thank you Space X, NASA, and Elon Musk!
— Mr. Nasty Tesla (@TeslaQuirk)
People who were a long way from home and completely out of the reach of any medical care. We were receiving conflicting reports on just how big a toll being in space was having on their bodies — reports range from tolerable risk to life-threatening.
Welcome home to Terra Firma!
The Boeing/NASA rocket that first brought them to space was fraught with technical glitches. There were concerns about whether it could take them home safely again. In hindsight, they could have survived the trip, but when you’re gambling with human lives, there’s a kind of maybe that pushes us just a little too far.
The White House posted it on social media as a promise kept:
PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months.
Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to

, and

— The White House (@WhiteHouse)
And did you notice that the video (courtesy NASA, possibly?) described the splashdown in the Gulf Of America.
NASA posted footage with a surprise appearance of a pod of dolphins:
The unplanned welcome crew!
Crew-9 had some surprise visitors after splashing down this afternoon.🐬
— NASA's Johnson Space Center (@NASA_Johnson)
As a kid who just barely missed the Space Race — and who watched the rise and fall of the Shuttle program — I have to admit to having a soft spot in my heart for stories like this one.
Especially when we hear former astronauts saying that Elon’s little company that could may have just saved the US space program.
Former NASA astronaut Charles Camarda just gave HUGE props to Elon Musk for what he's done in the space industry:
""Elon Musk saved the U.S. space program.""
""If it weren't for Elon Musk, we would not be able to fly U.S. Astronauts from U.S. soil to the International Space…"
"DOGE Ragers Taking Big ‘L’s, While One Intended Victim Just Racked Up A YUGE Win!",https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/doge-ragers-taking-big-ls-while-one-intended-victim-just-racked-up-a-yuge-win/,"A lot has changed since the Summer of 2020, not only are the tactics of the militant mobs losing their persuasive force and becoming tiresome… the risks they take in playing them have completely changed.
You’ve seen all those stories about people targeting the one car on the market with the most cutting edge tech features… keying the cars, shoving their hands into their butt crack before then wiping it on the car, shooting at them and setting them on fire. Only to discover they’ve been filmed with the car’s own hi-definition camera while it waited in sentry mode.
You’ve heard of the websites organizing and encouraging acts of violence. Owners being doxxed and threatened. Charging stations and dealerships being targeted for acts of vandalism and violence.
The chickens have not taken long to come home to roost for such people, resulting in felony charges, some of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. All 3 in this post used an incendiary device, which puts you squarely in the terrorist category. Don’t go looking for THIS Veep to help you raise bail money on that one.
Reduce their bravado to ridicule, and make them wear the consequences of their choices around their necks like an albatross.
Similar story with the rash of SWATing calls that have brought calls of bogus dangerous situation calls that mobilized available police against one conservative influence after another. It’s organized. And it’s a crime.
On one side, we’ve begun to catch at least SOME of the people inciting violence against political targets. But what about people on the receiving end?
Should they cower in fear, like some Tesla owners have already begun to do? If terrorists have used fear to intimidate people into compliance to accomplish one political goal or another, this response guarantees the bad guys will win.
It doesn’t matter if bad guys are lurking behind every bush or not, you have internalized the threat and are doing their work for them in intimidating yourself.
There’s another response."
Why ENORMOUS Judgment Against Greenpeace Should Have Dem Dark Money In A Cold Sweat,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/why-enormous-judgment-against-greenpeace-should-have-dem-dark-money-in-a-cold-sweat/,"What could a North Dakota jury judgment handed down against Greenpeace over a pipeline have to do with dark money politics-for-hire across the country? Quite a lot, actually.
At issue were the pipeline protests in North Dakota like the one where environmental activists cared so DAMNED much about the land that it took a state of emergency and the Army Corps of Engineers to avert an environmental catastrophe:
“Warm temperatures have accelerated snowmelt in the area of the Oceti Sakowin protest camp … Due to these conditions, the governor’s emergency order addresses safety concerns to human life as anyone in the floodplain is at risk for possible injury or death,” said the statement.
However, “the order also addresses the need to protect the Missouri River from the waste that will flow into the Cannonball River and Lake Oahe if the camp is not cleared and the cleanup expedited,” the statement read.
…Just how much waste and trash did the environmentally conscious DAPL protesters leave? “Local and federal officials estimate there’s enough trash and debris in the camp to fill about 2,500 pickup trucks,” reported AP. —
Not surprisingly, months-long protests are chosen because they can cause both damage and harm, depending on the group, the tactics, and their intent.
The owner and operator of the pipeline, who lost an enormous contract as a result of their actions, took the protesters to court. They suffered serious financial harm and those who caused it should bear the responsibility for making them whole. Modern notions of protest notwithstanding, that’s how the court system was designed. When they took Greenpeace and the Red Warrior Camp (who the plaintiff claimed was their proxy) to court on exactly this principle, the jury agreed.
After two days of deliberation, the New York Times reported, the jury returned the verdict. Energy Transfer, the owner and operator of the pipeline, filed the lawsuit in North Dakota state court against Greenpeace and Red Warrior Camp, which Energy Transfer claimed was a front for Greenpeace, and three individuals.
The lawsuit alleges that Greenpeace had engaged in a misinformation campaign with mass emails falsely claiming that the Dakota Access Pipeline would cross the sovereign land of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. In court filings, Energy Transfer claimed protesters engaged in a campaign of “militant direct action,” including trespassing on the company’s property, vandalizing construction equipment, and assaulting employees and contractors. —
This comes at a very bad time for violent leftwing activists. For years, the establishment left has been somewhere between indifferent to, or even happy to see violence on the streets, so long as that violence aligns with causes on the political left.
You never hear the kind of breathless language they establishment use when describing, for example ‘the Proud Boys’ when they describe, say, Antifa, BLM, Jayne’s Revenge (violent abortion activists), Palestinian Protesters, trans extremists, or (now) anti-Tesla crowds embracing forms of violence ranging from rioting on the streets, storming a building and threatening a young woman inside it, holding universities hostage, or vandalizing/firebombing Christian pro-life institutions, threatening churches, or most recently attacking anyone or anything with a Tesla connection.
The one thing so many of these movements including the current organized attacks against Tesla — have in common is copious amounts of financial backing. Efforts like what we have seen in DOGE, not to mention an FBI interested in prosecuting such crimes instead of helping them raise bail money — will be a game-changer on the investigation side of this problem.
AG Bondi, and those working with her have made it clear that investigating these firebombings (and the SWAT-ings) will be treating the use of incendiary devices under statutes listing such actions as a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison."

Naturally, the Democrats are incensed.
Senators posted this online:
Followed immediately by this, without even a hint of self-awareness:
Mahmoud Khalil is not mere protester. He’s an organizer. The protests he has been organizing have been the kind that result in property damage and violent clashes. He has shown open support for Hamas, and and their tactics. His group is posting calls to action like this one:
Mahmoud Khalil supports terrorism, supports October 7. His group openly supports the murder of civilians and the, um, overthrow of Western civilization. Or something.
You can insist on this neo-Nazis-marching-in-Skokie debate, sure. It's America. The commitment to free speech…
— Haviv Rettig Gur (@havivrettiggur)
Others have specifically invoked language connected to the October 7th Massacre with an urge to ‘look to the tactics of the Palestinians’.  When an American citizen breaks America’s laws, they face charges.
When someone from abroad does, they can be removed from the country. Dems have tipped their hand by showing which side of this issue they have sided with in Khalil’s case. That’s exactly the question Trump’s Press Sec addressed in a question about Khalil and charges."
First 40 Days,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/first-40-days/,"Forty days in, we can evaluate how Trump did on executing the plan that drove his 2024 campaign, and won over even many of the most unlikely demographics to his cause.
How did he do? The ‘come in like a wrecking ball’ promises, to salt the ground from which many worthless, wasteful, and unaccountable government departments spring, and to expose the freeloaders and frauds who have been fleecing the taxpayer for personal gain for who and what they really are.
Was he able to advance that plan despite the best efforts of the activist left and their friends and allies in the media, deep state, and some courthouses to derail him?

MARK LEVIN: Chief Justice Called Out By NAME With SCATHING Rebuke On Live TV,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/mark-levin-chief-justice-called-out-by-name-with-scathing-rebuke-on-live-tv/,"When yet ANOTHER lower-court judge tried to interfere in powers that are clearly defined as being within the four corners of the Executive Branch, and beyond the power of a petty potentate judge to decide — going so far as demanding that a plane already in the air and on its way to El Salvadore turn around to satisfy his injunction, Mark Levin had something to say about it.
He ought to, since the relevant precedent requiring a judge to write an order before it becomes binding was successfully argued by Mark Levin’s Landmark Legal in a dispute with the federal government some two decades ago.
Levin and Chief Justice Roberts know each other, and both worked in the Republican administrations in the 80s. Levin does not mince words when it comes to the squishy decisions Roberts makes and how he believes many of those decisions are aimed at pleasing the people who write newspapers and history books so that he will be remembered fondly by them as one of the ‘good’ guys, more than one of the tough-but-fair who was more interested in interpreting disputes by what laws, contracts, and the Constitution itself would indicate as implications of the plain reading of their texts.
Since the barrage of court battles has been unleashed against Trump pursuing his mandate has been unleashed, Roberts has been uniquely positioned as official head of the judicial branch, to tell judges what they ought to do in order to ‘stay in their lane’.
He his NOT so specially qualified to speak to powers that fall under the elected branches of government, such as the checks and balances members of other branches are permitted to exercise within their official powers. Trump, for example, does not have the power to ‘impeach’ anyone. That’s a power reserved for Congress. But nothing prevents him from urging Congress to make use of their oversight powers, any more than he is prevented from lobbying for appointments to be taken, budgets to be passed, or treaties to be ratified.
Justice Roberts took umbrage at Trump’s call for the rogue and conflcited judge who ordered the plane to El Salvadore turned around (as Trump views him) to be reigned in with the legitimate powers Congress has for exactly such times as judges exceed their just powers. Instead of reigning in a judge, he scolded Trump.
This is where Mark Levin comes into the story, having been invited onto Martha McCallum’s show ever since the issue of low-level judges giving high-level restraining orders came onto the scene. This week, he was able to make the invite work, and he made it count:
🔥HOLY SMOKES: Mark Levin just ROASTED Chief Justice John Roberts:
""It's time to GROW A PAIR, JUDGE!""
""How the HELL are we going to have 680 individual unelected federal judges…all sitting there behind their desks…saying, you know, I don't like this idea!"""

GAZA Protests Escalate In American Colleges… Here’s One Hamas Leader Saying The Quiet Part Out Loud,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/gaza-protests-escalate-in-american-colleges-heres-one-hamas-leader-saying-the-quiet-part-out-loud/,"And old footage from leaders of Hamas themselves are exposing as lies the cornerstone argument we hear in defending the legitimacy of Gazan claims against Israel… a bonus we will add at the end of this story.
Under Joe Biden, none of the particpants in the protests that included property destruction and in at least one instance, kidnapping, had the slightest concerns that they would be bounced out of the country like a sloppy drunk might be bounced out of a bar.
The Trump administration sees a student visa as a privilege — one that can be easily revoked if the person coming here is a detriment to society. The FAFO principle is rolling on, and one of the foreign born student protesters has already moved to the ‘finding out’ phase of that equation.
As Bill Melugin
:
BREAKING: Per a senior State Department official, yesterday, the State Dept. revoked the first visa for an “alien who was previously cited for criminal behavior in connection with Hamas-supporting disruptions”.
I’m told this person was a university student, and “ICE will proceed with removing this person from the country.”
The official says the State Dept. reviewed over 100,000 visas, and records showed the Biden administration canceled zero visas for pro Hamas activities or associated criminal behavior, despite the wave of protests on college campuses that broke out after the 10/7/2023 terror attacks on Israel.
The student’s name is Mahmoud Khalil.
An administration spokesperson gave some clarifying details:
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, confirmed Khalil’s arrest in a statement Sunday, describing it as being “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.”
Khalil’s arrest is the first publicly known deportation effort under Trump’s promised crackdown on students who joined protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. The administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas.
McLaughlin signaled the arrest was directly connected to Khalil’s role in the protests, alleging he “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.” —
With schools having their funding yanked, and protesters poised to resume the smash-and-occupy tactics we saw last year, this deportation may be the harbinger of more to come.
The entire basis of the justification of the conflict between Gaza and Israel hinges on questions of legitimacy and prior claim to the land. The pro-Gazan claim asserts that a distinct and unique people living on the land now called ‘Gaza’ have a history going back hundreds of generations. On that basis, they will insist that they have as much legitimacy — or possibly more — than the Jews returning to the ancient homeland.
Jews, obviously, would reply that is their ancient homeland, from which they were displaced by military might of successive invading forces. Their ancient homeland is one where the actual tombs of the patriarchs named in their scriptures can still be found… not to mention the central hub of religious life for Israel: Jerusalem, on which some part of their ancient temple still stands.
What happens to the Gazan claims if the idea of a distinctively Palestinian population is more myth than reality, if even their family names testify against them that their homelands were from many nearby Arab countries, especially Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
You might dismiss such a claim if it were only a Western writer with clear sympathies to the Israeli cause posing such questions. But what about when it comes from a Hamas leader’s own lips… one who himself claims to be of Egyptian descent?
All it took was 46 seconds to torpedo a key claim in the legitimacy of his own cause:"

"SCHUMER BLINKS: For All His Fiery Bluster, He Folds Like A Lawn Chair When The Shutdown Vote",https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/schumer-blinks-for-all-his-fiery-bluster-he-folds-like-a-lawn-chair-when-the-shutdown-vote/,"When the GOP took over the House a couple of years ago, responsiblity for drafting the budget fell on their shoulders. The first year, some Senate Republicans signed a Continuing Resolution deal with the Dems that negated any budgetary control the GOP could have in the first year.
Games were played, a leadership change came into place at the most inopportune time, and there was another deal with the devil made that kicked the can down the road. Budgets were being drafted, some even passed by the house… but Schumer refused to even take them up… because the guy who force-fed obnoxiously partisan (and patently deceptive) policy down everyone’s throats at every turn suddenly cared about bills being ‘bipartisan’. More likely, he was just holding out to get another CR stuffed with pork to fund all of the pet projects which just happen to serve as the financial equivalent of a Human Centipede (do NOT look that phrase up) recycling tax dollars into Democrat issues and back into Democrat pockets and/or campaigns.
Trump’s big win spoiled their party. And DOGE shone a light on all the dark places the rest of us were never supposed to see.
With the latests Government shutdown upon us unless federal funding is extended, the GOP took a gamble, passed a CR that fully funded the border wall and deportations (exactly the issue Schumer shut the government down over when Ryan’s budget was ready to pass).
It’s the Biden budget, with a few tweaks, but a LOT of changes are going to happen between now and when the new budget is revealed. We’ll see how the new-look leaner and more efficient Trump administration plays out, how much can be saved, and how big a difference those tariffs and tax cuts make in the economy.
Despite the fact that this CR would be (definitionally!) the same CR budget they passed just a few months ago when BIDEN’s name was on it, they were suddenly deeply opposed to everything in it, openly saying they would gladly shut down the government to oppose it.
Nobody said exactly what was different, there was just a lot of hand-waving and apocalyptic language. One after another they declared their vehement opposition to the Continuing Resolution that would keep the government funded.
Then Social Media — X, Rumble, and Truth Social — did their thing… digging up old clips of these very same Democrats denouncing government shutdowns as cruel, heartless, and unjust… making them own this shutdown and the moral bankruptcy they had already invested such shutdowns with.
They found themselves boxed in by their own words, and it really didn’t matter how cynical and insincere those words might have been when they were uttered, the other guys voted to keep Government open, and the party that was marching — by the dozens(!) — just days ago to protest federal firings at places like USAID is suddenly agreeing to send ALL but the most essential government workers home again.
And since Dems don’t have any levers of power here, they can’t sneak in any poison pills that would make a win or a loss equally useful to the Democrat narrative. Here he is trying to save face for capitulating only one day after taking his bold stand:
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., indicated Thursday he would vote to advance Republicans’ six-month funding bill that passed the House to avert a government shutdown Friday night."
COVID: State Wins Multi-BILLION Damages Judgment Against China — Here’s The 411,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/covid-state-wins-multi-billion-damages-judgment-against-china-heres-the-411/,"It could be decades before we finally figure out the extent of the ways America and the world were crippled by the Wuhan Wheezer. But one judge has affixed a particularly LARGE figure to the damages… and the State AG is not waiting around for them to pay up.
It began as a lawsuit taken up in 2020 by then-Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt. Cases like this one are not quick in resolving, especially when trying to moved them forward in the middle of a pandemic.
The judgement was not quick in coming, but come it has… with the federal judge ruling in Missouri’s favor. To the tune of $24 BILLION dollars.
The specific complaint concerned the well-documented case of China quietly buying up much of the global supply of Personal Protective Gear while keeping quiet about the true nature and extent of the illness that had already begun its spread from Wuhan China.
A federal judge on Friday ruled in favor of Missouri in the state’s $24 billion lawsuit against China’s Communist Party that accused it of hoarding protective supplies during the coronavirus pandemic.
“This is a landmark victory for Missouri and the United States in the fight to hold China accountable for unleashing COVID-19 on the world,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in a statement.
“China refused to show up to court, but that doesn’t mean they get away with causing untold suffering and economic devastation. We intend to collect every penny by seizing Chinese-owned assets, including Missouri farmland.”  —"

After the Oval Office dust-up with Zelensky last week and the attempt of other Western leaders to rally around him and distance themselves from America over the weekend, we were told that Trump has blown his one and only chance to be the adult in the room bringing a lasting peace to the region.
The world was passing America by, we were told, and European leaders would rise up to take America’s place.
As the saying goes, ‘big if true’. With a heavy emphasis on ‘if’.
Well, as Trump walked us through the foreign policy wins and plans for what’s next, he took us through a quick update on what’s been going on in Ukraine. When he pivoted from the Middle East to the hundreds of billions in Ukraine funding that came ‘with no security with no anything’ the Democrats stood up to give the one-and-only applause response to anything Trump said that night.
Congressional Dems hadn’t the slightest idea of what trap Trump had just baited them into springing on themselves… Liz Warren, most of all.
Trump responded to that applause and called out Democrats and specifically Elizabeth Warren — using her old nickname, ‘Pocahontas’ which has now been immortalized in the Congressional Record. “Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Pocahontas says yes.” Here she is clapping enthusiastically with a smug grin on her face in reply:

Education Secretary Makes HUGE ‘Final Mission’ Announcement Immediately After Confirmation,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/education-secretary-makes-huge-final-mission-announcement-immediately-after-confirmation/,"Because, as anyone who’s been paying attention to the educational results in American students — especially with benchmarks like literacy — just throwing more money at the problem has NOT been working.
We have some of the highest cost-per-pupil price tags and some of the worst learning results among modernized nations. To say we’ve been ‘lagging behind’ doesn’t begin to cover it. We are absolutely failing our basic responsibilities to entire generations of children.
Whatever the right solution might be, it is NOT ‘more of the same’. Centralizing education so that it could be run by the DC swamp has shown itself to be a catastrophic error in judgment.
Stripping away layers and layers of administrative bureaucracy that have little if anything to do with success in learning is just one of the steps that will breathe new life into a faltering system. Another is decentralizing educational authority so that it can be more responsive to the demands of parents at the local. and state level.

HILARIOUS: Hunter Biden Cries Poor As He Calls Off Laptop Lawsuit,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/hilarious-hunter-biden-cries-poor-as-he-calls-off-laptop-lawsuit/,"Ties to foreign countries that were common knowledge to the press pools and yet *somehow* more carefully buried by the complicit media that the Barack Obama Farrakahn photo… until so late in the game such revelations no longer mattered.
Well, we THINK they’re pardoned. We’ll have to see what the courts do about the case being made by Missouri’s AG about the legitimacy of Joe Biden signing off on policies that he may or may not have actually understood… let alone ordered. But that’s a whole other issue.
Right now, we’re talking about Hunter Biden having the rug pulled out from under the case he was bringing against the people who made the contents of his laptop public.
Hunter Biden legally forfeitted the contents of the laptop and it’s contents when he signed the repair shop policy about abandoned machines. The timing of these repairs was jaw-droppingly suspicious, coming as it did so close to the launch of Biden’s Presidential run, while the proverbial
‘walls were closing in’ on some of Hunter’s other misadventures, including some of his partners facing criminal prosecution and the suspiciously close connections Hunter had to the now-deceased ‘f***ing spy chief of China’ (Hunter’s own words).
One might almost believe Hunter was trying to use his addiction and irresponsible behavior as a cover for deliberately putting damning information beyond the reach of any supboena, by ‘forgetting’ it in the shop of a visually-impaired computer repairman who (under typical circumstances) would likely have given the machine a factory reset and sold it as refurbished.
If that WAS the plan, it fell apart when the repairman took an interest in his new laptop, and that information was, in turn, shared with others.
Joe went on to become President, and it wasn’t long before Hunter was once again flush with cash, selling art (despite misgivings by an Obama-era ethics officer) and living the high life in fancy digs.
Fast forward to 2025, and fortune’s wheel has turned again, this time, against him.
Hunter Biden said he has racked up “significant debt in the millions of dollars range” after watching his art sales dry up at the end of his father’s presidency, according to court documents filed this week.
Former President Joe Biden‘s son made the admission when he asked a judge in California to dismiss a lawsuit he brought against one of the top disseminators of his laptop data, saying he no longer has the financial resources to continue litigation despite still believing in the merits of his case.
[…]
Hunter Biden sued Garrett Ziegler and his company, Marco Polo, in September 2023, calling Ziegler a “zealot who has waged a sustained, unhinged and obsessed campaign” against the Biden family."

SpaceX had been to the Space Station before. More than once. But rather than call on Elon and risk him getting the chance to be a hero in cleaning up the mess that Boeing and NASA left behind, they did not give the go-ahead.
Under Trump, that policy is being reversed. Elon’s got a green light to bring them back to Earth, and so long as the mission goes smoothly, he thinks he can bring them home in about 4 weeks.

Jewish holiday Purim offers timely lesson to American Church,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/jewish-holiday-purim-offers-timely-lesson-to-american-church/,"Briefly, in the story, which can be found in
, an exalted adviser to King Xerxes of Persia named Haman set an evil plot in motion to have all the Jews in the kingdom murdered. Esther, secretly a Jew, had a cousin named Mordecai who caught wind of the scheme and advised Esther to approach King Xerxes and beg for the life of their people. However, Esther was well aware of the protocol: a person could not approach the king unless officially summoned, because if the king did not find favor with a royal subject, that person could immediately be dragged out and executed.
Queen Esther asked her cousin to round up all the Jews and have them fast, repent of their sins, and pray for three days before she made her risky approach into the king’s chambers. At the end of the three days of fervently seeking the Lord’s face and favor, Esther felt confident to approach the king. Through a series of thoughtful, wise and timely events that followed, Esther was able to turn the tables on Haman. Haman was not only ready to wipe out the entire Jewish population, but he had ordered gallows constructed to hang Mordecai, since Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.
However, because Mordecai had previously saved the king’s life by exposing an assassination plot, the king felt compelled to honor him. And Haman was the person assigned to dress Mordecai in royal robes and parade him on the king’s own horse through the streets of the kingdom so that everyone could cheer and honor him!
In mid-March this year, Jews and many Christians alike will be celebrating Purim, the events in Jewish history where Queen Esther put her life on the line to save her people from certain death. , the story ends with Haman himself being hanged from the very gallows he had built for Mordecai — and all of his wealth and power was given to Queen Esther and her cousin Mordecai.
Does any of this story have significance for us today in America? Could the example of Queen Esther be used by those of us in the Church to benefit our own nation?
On Ash Wednesday, the Lenten season begins for Christians throughout the world. During the 40 days, believers are encouraged to humble themselves, fast and pray, and to focus on personally drawing closer to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
This period of reflection and repentance can lead to a renewed spirit and focus on what God desires from our lives. And with lives that are changed and attuned correctly on the things of God, the lives of others, even an entire nation, can be affected for the good.
One of the key verses and ideas that come from Queen Esther’s heroic life is a word of encouragement spoken to her by her cousin Mordecai:
“Who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14, NKJV).
God did not make a mistake in Esther’s life, nor in the words spoken to her by her cousin, her wise adviser.
From this story we must all be assured that each and every one of us was born for such a time as our own. Why? Because we know that God does not make mistakes, and we in our time are not an exception. God doesn’t look down on a person and say, “Oops! Bill has not used his life properly. I should have had him born in the mid-1880s in America and he could have stopped Abraham Lincoln from being assassinated! Ugh! My bad!”
Whether we use our life, the gifts God has given us and the time he has given us in which to use them, to honor our Creator, is up to us.
And what a time and place in which we find ourselves today!
There is a window of opportunity for each one of us to be used to take America from its state of “fundamental transformation” that has played out over the past 16 years and participate — in great and small ways — to “foundationally restore” it to what our Founding Fathers envisioned.
Pastor
recently delivered a powerful, prophetic message at the
attended by members of Congress in Washington, D.C. In that message he challenged Christians to use this window of opportunity to heed the plea of 2 Chronicles 7:14 (NIV):
“If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from Heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”
Many Scriptures encourage us in this journey to restoration. For example, in Galatians 5 St. Paul provides two verses that work together to help point the way:
“It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.”
Followed by, “So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.”
And when it comes to dealing with “the sin that so easily entangles” (Hebrews 12:1) Paul says:
“No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it” (1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV).
Casting Crowns, a Christian rock group, has a wonderful song that helps focus the lives of Christians on the true purpose and focus of life. In their song, “Only Jesus,” are these lyrics:
And I, I don’t want to
a legacy
I don’t care if they
me
Only Jesus
And I, I’ve only got one life to liveI’ll let
second
to Him
Only Jesus.

For some, it is a life-changing miracle remedy to infertility. For others, the process itself, and the ‘surplus’ fertilized eggs tacks on a multiplier to the abortion problem.
Whatever your personal views on IVF might be, in the last election cycle, it was used as a political football. It all came down to an Alabama Supreme Court ruling made in a damages suit when some fertilized embryos were unintentionally destroyed by the clinic responsible for storing them. For the purposes of the lawsuit, the court decided that ‘wrongful death’ was the appropriate category for a damages suit.
This touched off a firestorm in which the Dems and their various proxies — already throwing their full weight behind the abortion question — chose to leverage this issue against the GOP, claiming that the GOP would ‘outlaw’ IVF. Here’s an
from leftwing group ‘American Progress’:
The Alabama IVF decision did not occur in a vacuum. Every abortion ban, every personhood law, every appointment of a far-right judge, and every recent post-Dobbs case on reproductive freedom helped pave the way for this decision. Limits on abortion access both endanger the ability of people to decide if, when, and how to grow their families and restrict reproductive health decisions. These three cases are just a few of many that highlight how anti-abortion activists’ efforts to commandeer the judiciary are succeeding. Extreme judges are supplanting medical science with personal and political ideologies, at the expense of the health, safety, and rights of all Americans—and, now, their right to start a family.
Here are Joe and his spokesmuppet politicizing the issue about a year ago:
Here is evidence of the Dems refusing to pass IVF legislation that does NOT contain poison pills in it.
Trump’s campaign was explicitly supportive of IVF, even if it was an issue that could potentially divide part of his pro-life base.
Fast forward to yesterday, and Trump made good on yet another promise.
From the
:
LOWERING COSTS AND REDUCING BARRIERS TO IVF: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order expanding access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) for Americans.
The Order directs policy recommendations to protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments.
The recommendations will focus on how to ensure reliable access to IVF.
Priority will also be placed on addressing any current policies, including those that require legislation, that exacerbate the cost of IVF treatments.
The Order recognizes the importance of family formation and that our Nation’s public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children.

Maine’s Gov Should Have Looked Up THIS State Stat Before Slamming Trump,https://clashdaily.com/2025/02/maines-gov-should-have-looked-up-this-state-stat-before-slamming-trump/,"Dems haven’t figured this out yet, but there’s an OBVIOUS reason they got their asses kicked even among groups that used to march blindly to support them in the polls.
Some of their policies are so damned crazy that even the activist left can’t keep a straight face in defending them anymore.
Two of the big ones that flipped independents and even some Dems in a BIG way were the immigration/economy/crime issue which has become so intertwined, it’s hard to tease out where one issue ends and the next begins.
The other big one is the ‘dudes in dresses’ lie we’ve been increasingly force-fed since the 2nd half of the Obama years. Parents of school-age daughters have had enough of watching some mediocre male athlete get celebrated as ‘stunning and brave’ for donning a dress and stepping on the faces, scholarships, and dreams of hardworking young female athletes on the way to the top of a podium for unearned accolades.

Six hours after Gov Janet Mills picked that fight, Maine was being investigated for Title IX violations.
Oops.
Yes, that’s a pretty big story, to be sure. But not the biggest one to be found in Maine’s maladministration.
What did NOT make big headlines — even if it should have — is the sorry state of Maine’s education system, and the role immigration has played in those numbers.
A new report shows academic performance in Maine’s public schools is tanking. At the same time, Maine’s illegal alien population is rising as a result of expanding sanctuary policies. It’s an inverse relationship that deserves some honest examination. Unfortunately, given that most public officials, educators, and members of the media in Maine support sanctuary policies, they have little interest in exploring, let alone acknowledging that any nexus might exist between mass immigration and classroom quality. Nor is there much discussion of how taxpayer funds used to support illegal aliens in the sanctuary-urban areas of the state could be used instead to enhance education more broadly in the rest of the state.

We’ve got a thread from America First Legal making the case online that Judge McConnell, the Rhode Island judge who put an end to Trump’s spending freezes, ought never to have heard that case in the first place.
The reason? He is *Personally* benefitting financially from his own ruling.
If the money gets cut, so does funding from a group whose board he has served on for as long as he’s held federal office — much of that time, serving as chair.
The Trump administration has violated a court order by refusing to reverse a freeze of billions in government funds, a judge ruled Monday.
The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government.
US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress.
On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. —
It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist:
Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse."

The Democrats, as evidenced by their loud protests against DOGE, don’t se dubious ethics and financial mismanagement as disqualifying. You might almost see them as credentials.
Stacey Abrams herself — despite her known track record for outrageous lies about ‘winning’ an election she lost by some 54,000 votes, only to get jackhammered by nearly 300k votes on the rematch a few years later — has been something of a folk hero on the left.
Her lies were rewarded by her party, with special prominence and speaking opportunities. She set up some activist groups, as noted above.
None of that gives a satisfactory explanation for why she, of all people, ought to be overseeing another $2B in Taxpayer Largesse. And yet, that’s exactly what DOGE uncovered.

While others may have dunked on Pete, thinking he was reacting to the Delta flight that wound up on its roof in Toronto, the accident happened AFTER he posted this.
That means, Mayor Pete was most likely popping off about the two crashes at the end of January, just days after Trump took office.
What’s that old saw about how asking questions to which you don’t already know the answer gets you in trouble?
Yeah. It got him in trouble.
The question itself was dishonest… as the reply from Sean Duffy so ably demonstrates:
Mayor Pete failed for four years to address the air traffic controller shortage and upgrade our outdated, World War II-era air traffic control system. In less than four weeks, we have already begun the process and are engaging the smartest minds in the entire world.
Here’s the truth: the FAA alone has a staggering 45,000 employees. Less than 400 were let go, and they were all probationary, meaning they had been hired less than a year ago. Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel were let go.
Mayor Pete chose to use this amazing department—that is so critical to America’s success—as a slush fund for the green new scam and environmental justice nonsense. Not to mention that over 90% of the workforce under his leadership were working from home – including him. The building was empty!
When we finally get a full accounting of his mismanagement, I look forward to hearing from him.
In the meantime, I will not rest until I return the Department of Transportation and its incredible employees to its mission of efficiency and safety.
That did not end well for Preachy Pete.
Not at all.

July 1, 2024:
And a few months before that, we covered a speech she gave to a crowd in response to a regional dispute affecting Somali interests. Here’s a small sample of the conversation:
The back story behind this speech is an agreement between Ethiopia and a region of Somalia called Somaliland. (The aspect of her speech showing her casual agreement racial genocide in the country of her birth was explained here.)
Ethiopia is offered a sea port (which will be used to help fight Red Sea piracy) in exchange for (among other things) Ethiopia recognizing Somaliland’s independence.
Here, we’re going to look at the betrayal of her oath of office, elevating another country’s national interests above those of America.
We’re not even stopping to comment on what a half-assed Muslim she must be for saying (out loud!) that she is more devoted to Somalia than she is to her religion.
Here are a couple of spicy statement she made in this speech. Since the left loves pronouns so much, pay close attention to how she makes use of ‘we’ and ‘they’. It’s very telling about where she thinks her actual loyalty is owed:
— We are Somalians first, Muslims second…
— The US government will only do what the Somalians in the US TELL them to do. They will do what we want and nothing else they must follow our orders and that is how we will safeguard the interests of Somalia."

When Jesus Said ‘Blessed Are The Peacemakers’ — Did He Mean Trump?,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/when-jesus-said-blessed-are-the-peacemakers-did-he-mean-trump/,"Obama — the guy who history will remember for droning American citizens — was given a Nobel Peace Prize before he’d finished his first year in office.
His record at the end of that term had the Nobel Prize committee themselves
.
Meanwhile, Trump managed to negotiate peace deals all through the Middle East, most notably the Abraham Accords… and hardly anyone batted an eye. The Biden admin tried hard not to even mention the Abraham Accords by name, lest Trump get credit for it.
Biden’s team had a bad habit of leaving smoking craters everywhere they turned — Afghanistan, Ukraine, Gaza. Not to mention all of the embassies America fled from as one nation in his term after another destabilized.
Trump made big claims about how he was going to bring peace to Ukraine. He wasn’t going to approach this problem the way regular DC policy wonks would tell us to approach it.
He is applying a lifetime of experience in negotiating billion-dollar land deals where he would have to find the sweet spot of agreement between recalcitrant would-be business partners who might otherwise have almost nothing in common. Trump would have to listen — and actually HEAR — what the real underlying wishes of the various parties were, and get a sense of how far each party was willing to compromise on ‘y’ so long as their ‘x’ was satisfied.
The Art of the Deal, he calls it.
Zelensky was looking right at the solution he most wanted… and didn’t even know it. He tried to press Trump on ‘security guarantees’ but he was asking the wrong quesition.
What he THINKS he wants is for NATO to swarm in, boots on the ground, and chase Russia out of the country. Unfortunately for him, kicking off WWIII just isn’t a price most of us are willing to pay.
Trump has put his foot down, forbidding Ukraine to join NATO for exactly this reason. That doesn’t mean he’s out of ideas.
If Ukraine signs the minerals agreement, a few things happen.
First off, it kicks off a mining and manufacturing industry in a country that’s been shattered by war. This will go a long way to helping the rebuilding process, without America simply cutting a check.
Ukraine does not have the capital, materials, and expertise to launch all of these companies — not to mention the manpower shortage easily represented by the fact that their young males are being kidnapped by their own government like what would happen with the old British Navy Press-gangs.
You know… the manpower problem that JD mentioned in the Oval before Zelensky got all pissy? There are plenty of videos on social media out there for anyone who claims it isn’t happening. Some are faked, but not all of them. It’s a real problem.
But America has the manpower, the capital and the know-how. It can create the jobs, be a ready market for the materials (especially when China is threatening to cut off supply of some of the materials Americans need for their high-tech and military).
That, in turn, can give our military sector the latitude to supply arms that Ukraine and NATO might want to buy to defend themselves from military threats in the future.
Even the sticking point — the security guarantee — was implicit in the deal.
Russia was promised back in the GW Bush and Clinton days that NATO would not expand further and further toward Russian borders. They hated and feared us as much as we hated and feared them.
Even DEFENSIVE missiles in Eastern Europe make Russia skittish. If America puts boots on the ground in Ukraine — or worse, lets them join NATO — there will be NO peace deal to be had.
Like it or not, the only way to get a peace deal is if both sides — in this case, Ukraine/NATO/USA and Russia — walk away satisfied that the other side didn’t royally screw them over."
MEME OF THE DAY: Rashida Tlaib Gets SAVAGED For Her Dumb Sign,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/meme-of-the-day-rashida-tlaib-gets-savaged-for-her-dumb-sign/,"It isn’t as if they’ve never paid a price for making this mistake before… standing in front of a sign that can be turned into a meme template. It happens all the time. This game  goes back at LEAST as far as Michelle Obama’s ‘bring back our girls’… probably further.
Even the little paddle signs have been used against them. Remember her war criminal sign? It was shopped to have all the letters except the a in ‘war’ and the ‘nal’ in criminal removed.
That’s the kind of risk you take by holding up a sign in a world where digital editing is so easy these days.

It’s tantrum that ultimately stems from their party’s rejection of the will of the people because they did not approve of the outcome.
Unfortunately for the Dems, ‘we the people’ didn’t ask permission to vote for the other guy. They simply voted.
Even CNN had to admit that Karoline Leavitt’s main idea is entirely correct. After putting up a ‘divisive’ descriptor in their very first post-speech chyron, their own polls showed that even their own viewers thought it was a positive speech.

SICK: Journos Try To Leverage Celebrated Childhood Cancer Survivor To Dunk On Trump,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/sick-journos-try-to-leverage-celebrated-childhood-cancer-survivor-to-dunk-on-trump/,"There’s an expression that says ‘you don’t hate journos enough. You think you do… but you don’t.’ It’s moments like this one that make it a little easier to believe a claim like that one.
We’ll begin with the child that Trump celebrated, and then we’ll look at how the establishment media twisted it.
Trump said the boy, DJ Daniel, who was dressed in a Houston police uniform and sitting with his father in the gallery of the House of Representatives for the speech, had always dreamed of becoming a police officer.
“In 2018 DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months at most to live. That was more than six years ago,” Trump said, to loud applause from the room.
Since then, Trump said, DJ had been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer a number of times.
“Police departments love him. And tonight, DJ, we’re going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service.”
The boy’s eyes grew wide with surprise and his father lifted him up. Curran handed him what appeared to be a Secret Service credential, which the boy held up for the crowd to see, and then promptly put his arms around Curran’s shoulders in a hug. —
It was a sweet and tender moment… especially with the suprised look of joy on the child’s face as he holds up his agents’ badge.
It was a moment for which (tellingly) not a single Democrat applauded.
Their cold disdain of the moment looks almost warm and welcoming when compared to how MSNBC spun it after the speech was over:
Nicole Wallace just went after a little kid with cancer, saying “I hope he never has to defend the United States Capitol against Donald Trump’s supporters.”
Even Jen Psaki looks uncomfortable.

She goes out of her way to say the usual polite words of support for DJ before using him as an opportunity to dunk on Trump in a crazed way you would only find on the likes of MSNBC:"
Patel’s FBI Busts Soldiers Selling Secrets Abroad In Second Blockbuster Arrest Of The Week,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/patels-fbi-busts-soldiers-selling-secrets-abroad-in-second-blockbuster-arrest-of-the-week/,"Hard on the heels of an announcement that the guy behind the Abbey Gate suicide bombing had been extradited to face prosecution in America is an another announcement that they’ve arrested some soldiers selling secrets to a foreign power.
Not surprisingly, the story involves China. From the
:
Jian Zhao, and Li Tian, active-duty U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, along with Ruoyu Duan, a former U.S. Army soldier, were arrested today following indictments by federal grand juries in the District of Oregon and the Western District of Washington. Tian and Duan were charged in the District of Oregon for conspiring to commit bribery and theft of government property. Zhao was charged in the Western District of Washington for conspiring to obtain and transmit national defense information to an individual not authorized to receive it, and also for bribery and theft of government property.
“The defendants arrested today are accused of betraying our country, actively working to weaken America’s defense capabilities and empowering our adversaries in China,” said Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi. “They will face swift, severe, and comprehensive justice.”
“While bribery and corruption have thrived under China’s Communist Party, this behavior cannot be tolerated with our service members who are entrusted with sensitive military information, including national defense information,” said FBI Director Kash Patel. “The FBI and our partners will continue to work to uncover attempts by those in China to steal sensitive U.S. military information and hold all accountable who play a role in betraying our national defense. The FBI would like to thank U.S. Army Counterintelligence for their close partnership during this investigation.”
[…]
The indictment in the District of Oregon alleges that beginning on or about Nov. 28, 2021, and continuing to at least on or about Dec. 19, 2024, Duan and Tian along with others, known and unknown to the grand jury conspired with each other to surreptitiously gather sensitive military information related to the United States Army’s operational capabilities, including technical manuals and other sensitive information, and that Tian transmitted this information to Duan in return for money, in violation of his official duties as an active-duty U.S. Army officer. Specifically, Tian was tasked with gathering information related U.S. military weapon systems, including information related to the Bradley and Stryker U.S. Army fighting vehicles, and transmitting them to Duan.
The indictment in the Western District of Washington alleges that beginning in or about July 2024, and continuing to the date of the arrest, Jian Zhao, an active-duty U.S. Army Supply Sergeant, conspired with others known and unknown to the grand jury to obtain and transmit national defense information to individuals based in China. Zhao is further alleged to have committed bribery and theft of government property.
Specifically, Zhao was charged for his conspiracy to collect and transmit several classified hard drives, including hard drives marked “SECRET” and “TOP SECRET”, negotiating with individuals based in China for their sale, and agreeing to send the classified hard drives to the individuals in China. In exchange for the sale of the classified hard drives, Zhao received at least $10,000. Zhao is further alleged to have conspired to sell an encryption capable computer that was stolen from the U.S. Government, and sensitive U.S. military documents and information, including information related to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), and information related to U.S. military readiness in the event of a conflict with the People’s Republic of China. Zhao is alleged to have violated his duties as a U.S. Army Soldier and public official to protect sensitive military information in exchange for money. In total, Zhao is alleged to have corruptly received and accepted payments totaling at least $15,000."
OOPS: Zelensky’s Last Blast Pushed Trump Too Far… Now ‘Z’ Is About To ‘Find Out’,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/oops-zelenskys-last-blast-pushed-trump-too-far-now-z-is-about-to-find-out/,"Trump was pretty clear what the stakes are in this conflict: find a way to stop the killing without dragging America into World War III with a nuclear power.
For Trump, the path forward for that involved interlinking Ukraine’s economy with Americas. That solves some immediate needs in both countries, and gives America grounds to push back on Russian expansionism that AREN’T wrapped up in historical bad blood between NATO and the old Warsaw Pact rivals.
It’s entirely reasonable for American diplomats to insist that Russian interests NOT blow up America men and women working in Ukrainian industries… and those industries would not represent a military escalation of NATO countries into Russia’s backyard. Win-Win-Win.
But Zelensky — who apparently met with key Democrats before his meeting with Trump — decided it would be a good idea to poke his benefactor in the eye. If Dems coached him to do that, it was perhaps the worst advice they could have given him. (Unless of course, setting Trump up for failure so they could bludgeon him for it was their REAL goal.)
There was already distrust with Zelensky from the fact that he helped Kamala campaign in a battleground state just a few months ago. Further inflaming differences with Trump — especially with a televised spat in a meeting that was supposed to be little more than the official signing of a business contract between both countries was stunningly short-sighted on Zelensky’s part.
Fast forward a couple of days. Zelensky does his world tour. European countries have a grand plan of negotiating without US involvement… offering military and security guarantees. Anyone reading the fine print will notice such guarantees hinge on the involvement of American blood and or treasure.
All of that posturing ignores one critical fact: Trump, whose chief concern is NOT walking into WWIII, set a very clear choice before Zelensky in the Oval office: take a ceasefire and negotiate for peace from there with American help — or keep fighting without American help.
“The problem is I’ve empowered you (turning toward Zelenskyy) to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave. But you’re either going to make a deal or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty, but you’ll fight it out. But you don’t have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position, but you’re not acting at all thankful. And that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest. That’s not a nice thing. —
When Trump told Zelensky that he didn’t have the cards… that’s EXACTLY what he meant. Zelensky’s bluster presumes upon limitless US aid with no strings attached. And if Zelensky is working at cross purposes with US interests (ie: avoiding an expensive forever war that could precipitate WWIII), he will have to go it alone.
In terms of the ‘FAFO’ equation, Zelensky is doing the F*** Around part here:
The Find Out portion did NOT take long at all:
Trump’s reaction…
Had a policy consequence…
President Donald Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine following his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week, a White House official said, deepening the fissure that has opened between the two one-time allies.
[…]
“President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” said the official on Monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The White House had no immediate comment on the scope and amount of aid affected or how long the pause would last. The Pentagon could not provide further details. —"
Global Left Tries To ‘Own’ MAGA By Going All-In With Zelensky — Who’s Gonna Tell Them?,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/global-left-tries-to-own-maga-by-going-all-in-with-zelensky-whos-gonna-tell-them/,"Trudeau — who is on his way out as party leader, and whose government has been shut down since the 6th of January while Libs coronate a new
party leader, has made a decision (with zero consultation with the government) that Canada is going all-in to support Ukraine, even if Trump and America don’t.
Asked if he’s willing to put Canadian boots on the ground, he answered: “everything is on the table.”
The pseudo-soviet from the UK set aside a couple of billion dollars and added ‘planes in the air’ to Justin’s ‘boots on the ground’.
Meanwhile, NATO is looking at ways to raise the money to help Ukraine without America sending another red cent.
World leaders are imagining an America-less mutual defense cabal.
That’ll REALLY show those Americans.
No, no. PLEASE don’t act like nations of grown-ups and take up the responsibility of defending European interests on your own dime. No, no. Anything but that.
The Polish leader put it in perspective when he said that 500 million Europeans are asking 300 million Americans to protect them from 140 million Russians.
And yet, for all of that, it sounds like Zelensky came out of the weekend willing to play ball with Trump… on Trump’s terms.
President Zelensky has told the BBC the minerals deal between the US and Ukraine remains “ready” to sign despite the public showdown between him and the Trump administration on Friday.
He was asked about the future of the deal, which would grant the US access to Ukraine’s rare mineral reserves, by Laura Kuenssberg.
“It is our policy to continue what happened in the past, we’re constructive,” he continues, “if we agreed to sign the minerals deal, we’re ready to sign it.”
“The agreement that’s on the table will be signed if the parties are ready,” he concludes. —"
ABBEY GATE: Trump’s Big Terror Win Exposes Biden’s MASSIVE National Security Priority Failures,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/abbey-gate-trumps-big-terror-win-exposes-bidens-massive-national-security-priority-failures/,"Every time you turn around he did something else to make us less secure. Abbey Gate was just one of many examples. Raising bail for rioters while locking up praying grandmothers? That’s another one.
Selling off our oil reserves so voters could save a few cents a gallon just in time for an election? That was both cynical AND reckless. Flooding the country with unvetted people from around the world and doing nothing about it when even a feckless goober like Chris Wray is warning about all kinds of ‘blinking red lights’ on the metaphorical national security dashboard.
In August of 2021, Joe Biden made a bold statement after the suicide bomber wreaked havoc at Abbey Gate in Kabul:
“To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Mr. Biden said. “Our mission will go on. America will not be intimidated.” —
To prove how much he meant it, his administration droned ten civilians. And nobody was fired for it.
The Pentagon’s announcement will likely fuel more criticism of the Biden administration’s chaotic evacuation of Kabul and handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan more broadly. While McKenzie stressed Friday that future strikes will likely be held to a higher standard, confirmation of the civilian death toll also provides insight into the obstacles ahead for military and intelligence officials tasked with fulfilling President Joe Biden’s promise to make the terror group “pay” for its deadly suicide attack in Kabul.
The Pentagon had maintained that at least one ISIS-K facilitator and three civilians were killed in what Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley had previously called a “righteous strike” on the compound on August 29. The investigation released Friday found that all of those killed in the residential compound were civilians. —
From that time forward, the Biden admin treated the incident as if it didn’t exist. Families were never really acknowleged. The promise to bring people to justice was never followed through on.
One distraught father interrupted Biden’s last SOTU by shouting out a reminder about Abbey Gate. He faced serious charges from the Capital Police for interrupting the proceedings (in a somewhat less obnoxious way than Rep Al Green did). Those charges were eventually dropped.
Fast forward to the Trump administration.
Forty-two days into his Presidency, Trump is standing before the Joint Session of Congress, and has an announcement to make about — of all things — Abbey Gate.
What news could he POSSIBLY have to bring about Abbey Gate just a little more than one month into his presidency?
The sonofabitch responsible was already on his way to America where he would face justice.
Seb Gorka, Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel and others worked together to prioritize two things: bringing home Americans held hostage abroad, and making good on American promises to make terrorists pay for what they had done to American men and women.
Right there near the top of the list was the guy behind Abbey Gate.
Seb Gorka tells us the REAL reason Biden never caught him was simple: our spies knew exactly where some of the worst jihadis have been hiding… but Biden simply never cared enough to pull the tigger.
Here’s Seb Gorka telling Jesse how everything went down:
EXCLUSIVE:"
Missouri AG Action Could Overturn Some Critical Biden Legacies… Including His Pardons,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/missouri-ag-action-could-overturn-some-critical-biden-legacies-including-his-pardons/,"AG Bailey, with a couple of others, helped lead the charge on challenging the Biden Admin’s power grabs, lawless orders, and trampling of Constitutional Rights. Remember the court case challenging Biden for directing Silicon Valley to censor dissenting opinion on their behalf? Bailey led that charge. Among others.
Long-time readers will remember that yours truly had Bailey on the short list for DOJ with Kash Patel.
Bailey is looking at all the bad-faith orders, legislation, and pardons that were so prevalent in the final days and even hours of the Biden administration, and he wonders if they would hold up to scrutiny.
It’s
thing for Joe Sixpack to yap about this issue to his buddies over the back fence. It’s quite another when the sitting Attorney General of a state — one that has litigated and won major cases in which the past administration was found to be in violation of the Constitutional rights of American citizens — questions the validity of Biden’s recent orders.
It all comes down to what the press is finally admitting about Joe Biden’s compromised mental state. If HE is not actually calling the shots, were others unlawfully usurping authority that was not their own?
Here’s the tweet where he wrote about exactly this question:
🚨BREAKING: I am demanding the DOJ investigated whether President Biden’s cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval.
If true, these executive orders, pardons, and all other actions are unconstitutional and legally void.
For anyone who doesn’t want to click through, or look at low-quality cut and paste images, I had Grok summarize the letter he sent to the DOJ:
:
“RE: Legality of presidential actions in light of President Biden’s cognitive decline.”
Bailey requests a full investigation into whether President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to issue executive orders, pardons, and other actions without Biden’s knowing approval.
He argues that if Biden’s mental incapacity prevented him from understanding or approving these actions, they could be unconstitutional and legally void under the 25th Amendment.
Cites Biden’s “famous” mental decline, referencing Special Counsel Robert K. Hur’s February 2024 report, which described Biden as an “elderly man with a poor memory” who couldn’t recall key details, such as when he was Vice President or when his son Beau died.
Mentions House Speaker Mike Johnson’s January 2024 account, where Biden reportedly didn’t know what orders he was signing, including mistakenly believing he signed an order for a study on energy exports to Europe rather than a moratorium.
Highlights Biden’s post-election decisions, such as commuting the death sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates to life imprisonment, granting a retroactive blanket pardon to his son Hunter Biden (despite earlier denials), and claiming the Equal Rights Amendment was part of the U.S. Constitution (described as “legally frivolous”).
Notes these actions suggest exploitation by staffers pushing far-left policies without accountability or democratic legitimacy."
The Drain Game,https://clashdaily.com/2025/03/the-drain-game/,"The comparison of Washington DC to a swamp is more than warranted. However, with all the corruption, neglect of responsibility and outright theft DOGE is uncovering, DC is not a swamp. It’s a sewer.
We’ve all seen the man hole covers with the words “Sanitary Sewer” cast into the metal. This has got to be the best oxymoronic statement in the English language. If DC is a sewer, it can’t even qualify as vaguely “sanitary”. All the tax dollars that went to promote abortion and GLBT+ issues-IN OTHER COUNTRIES- are a waste of resources that most Americans don’t support here at home, let alone abroad. And the Demsheviks wonder how Trump got elected….
The dichotomy here is this: our freedom of choice in this country allows you to participate in any life style you choose, within legal limits. But when tax money is taken from the entire tax paying population to support agendas that are fringe, that’s not only a moral issue, it looks like it’s going to become a legal issue as well.
Perhaps the best example (along with gay comic books and trans themed theater) of tax revenue maleficence is the current scandal of some NSA employees spending more time in sex chat sites than in doing the jobs they were hired for. Definitely time to drain this.
A good part of the “draining” is also starting to remove the cancer that is DEI. The Biden/Harris administration was infested with DEI hires.
Academia and apparently a good percentage of the media has also been infiltrated by people whose only qualification is that they checked a certain diversity box on an application form. Before all of this nonsense hit, you never heard of misinformation; disinformation; deep fakes; more than two genders; or weird made up pronouns. My favorite is “trust the science”, which apparently is Demshevik speech code for daily changing of the narrative and/or information. Drain this please.
Unfortunately, the church also needs some draining. While it’s bad enough that we had pastors who completely caved to the Wuhan Kungflu Overreaction (i.e. COVID), I’m now seeing some believers buying into the idea that President Trump is the Antichrist.
Out of sheer curiosity, I did a Google search for how many world leaders have been called Antichrist. The results were impressive. The list I found was divided into living and dead leaders who share that distinction.
The list of 17 dead leaders throughout history included some of the usual suspects. Benito Mussolini and Adolph Hitler of course, as well as Saddam Hussein and Mikhail Gorbachev. Even the Roman Emperor Nero was included. There were two Popes on the list: Pope Gregory VII and Pope John Paul II. During the Middle Ages, it was common for non-Catholics to regard whomever was Pope to be the Antichrist.
In 1970, in Hal Lindsey’s “The Late Great Planet Earth”, it was suggested that French newspaper editor and politician Jean-Jacques Servan Schreiber was a candidate for the title.
The list includes three former U.S. Presidents. FDR, JFK and Reagan were each called Antichrist during their respective times in office.
The list of current Antichrist candidates is even longer at 19. It too includes U.S. Presidents, such as Obama, Biden, and now Trump. Other politicians include French President Macron, Tim Walz, Hillary Clinton, and Putin.
The list is also rounded out with a roll call of billionaires: George Soros, Bill Gates, Oprah, and of course Elon Musk. I guess you could also include President Trump.
The point of including this list of Antichrist candidates is that it’s nothing more than a distraction and is not Biblically sound. I get that there are a lot of believers who don’t like President Trump based simply on his personality, he calls people names and, (gasp!) occasionally utters a swear word or two. So what? He’s doing what we elected him to do.
In my last article, I pointed out that we should look at the Biden/Harris regime as a brief window into what the Demsheviks want to do to us and the entire country. It could get much worse if they get back into power."
