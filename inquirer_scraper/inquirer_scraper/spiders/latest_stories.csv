Joel Chua prefers campaigning over minding Sara Dutertes remark,"TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte Manila 3rd District Rep. Joel Chua prefers to focus on his reelection bid rather than discuss Vice President Sara Dutertes derogatory remark about shoving an apple down his throat until he dies. In a message to INQUIRER.net on Sunday, Chua said he would focus on his campaign first, especially with two weeks remaining before the 2025 midterm elections. Right now, I would focus first on my campaign. We have two weeks to go, Chua said when asked if he would seek legal action over Dutertes statements, which some consider a threat. Well stick to the campaign so we would not lose focus, he added. Chua, chairperson of the House of Representatives committee on good government and public accountability, was the subject of Dutertes speech during the campaign rally in Manila for the slate of former Mayor Isko Moreno. Morenos candidate for the seat of Manilas third congressional district is Councilor Apple Nieto. In her speech, Duterte said that she is giving the apple to Nieto for her to shove it down Chuas throat until he dies. READ: Sara Duterte vents anger at Rep. Chua during rally in Manila Duterte also referred to the Snow White fairytale, where the princess was sent to a deep, cursed sleep after biting a poisoned apple. Ang apple na yan, ibigay mo kay Snow White Joel Chua. Alam niyo, di ba si Snow White kumain ng apple tapos nabilaukan? Bigay mo yan sa kanya, saksak mo doon sa bibig niya, Duterte said. Chuas committee probed the issues hounding the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education under Duterte. During the course of the probe, irregularities regarding the OVP and DepEds confidential fund expenditures were discovered. At one point in the hearings, Antipolo City 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop noticed that one of the acknowledgement receipts for the OVPs CF expenditures was signed by a certain Mary Grace Piattos, whom he said bears a name similar to a restaurant and a potato chip brand. ARs are proof of payment, or that funding for projects reached its intended beneficiaries, and for the case of OVP and DepEd, these are informants who provided confidential information to authorities. Later on, Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong showed two ARs one for OVP and another for DepEd which were both received by a certain Kokoy Villamin. However, the signatures and handwriting used by Villamin in the two documents differed. Piattos and Villamins names did not appear on the Philippine Statistics Authority database. The committee also heard accusations from former DepEd undersecretary Gloria Jumamil Mercado, who admitted that she received envelopes containing money from Duterte, which she thinks may have been meant to influence her. Mercado used to head the DepEds procuring division. The committees findings then became the backbone of three impeachment complaints against Duterte, filed before the House in 2024. On February 5, 2025, the House impeached Duterte after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth complaint. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches SaraDuterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate Under the constitution, the Senate will act as an impeachment court with sitting senators being judges. Trial, however, has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5, which means Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. Duterte has also poked fun at Manila 2nd District Rep. Rolando Valerianos appearance, claiming that the lawmaker accuses her of everything without any evidence.

"Taal Volcano records 56 quakes, 14 tremors in past 24 hours","LUCENA CITY Taal Volcano in Batangas continues to exhibit signs of unrest, logging 56 volcanic earthquakes and 14 tremors over the past 24 hours, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology reported Monday. In its morning bulletin, Phivolcs said the volcanic tremors lasted between one and two minutes each. From April 8 to 26, Taal Volcano located in the middle of Taal Lake recorded a total of 126 volcanic earthquakes and 34 volcanic tremors, according to agency data. Phivolcs explained that volcanic earthquakes are generated by magmatic processes beneath or near an active volcano, differing from tectonic earthquakes, which are produced by faulting. Volcanic tremors, meanwhile, are continuous seismic signals with low frequencies, typically ranging from 0.5 to 5 Hz, that can last longer than a minute. These tremors may result from the flow of magma or magmatic gas through cracks and vents, overlapping low-frequency earthquakes, or minor eruptions. Phivolcs also reported a weak emission of 956 metric tons of sulfur dioxide from Taals main crater up from 348 metric tons recorded in previous days. No upwelling of hot volcanic fluids or vog was observed during the latest monitoring, the agency said. Phivolcs maintained Alert Level 1 over Taal, warning that the volcano remains in an abnormal state and unrest has not ceased. The agency cautioned that sudden steam-driven or minor phreatomagmatic eruptions, volcanic earthquakes, ashfall, and the accumulation or expulsion of volcanic gases remain possible, posing threats to areas within Taal Volcano Island.

Supreme Court decision to reverse ruling on commercial fishing sought,"MANILA, PhilippinesOne of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, a church leader, and environmental advocate on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to reverse a lower courts ruling allowing commercial fishingwithin 15-kilometer municipal waters, which are exclusively reserved for small-scale fishers under the countrys laws. Allowing commercial vessels to operate within municipal waters jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of subsistence fishers and accelerates the depletion of already fragile fish stocks, said the petitioners led by Atty. Christian Monsod, one of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, and Atty. Grizelda Mayo-Anda, a veteran environmental lawyer and advocate for coastal communities. The petition named Mercidar Fishing Corporation, Judge Zaldy Docena, the Department of AgricultureBureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and the Office of the Solicitor General as respondents. In their 31-page petition, they specifically sought reversal of the December 11, 2023 decision issued by the Regional Trial Court of Malabon City granting the petition filed by Mercidar Fishing Corporation to declare as unconstitutional Section 4 , Section 16, Section 1 and Section 18, Rule 181 of the Department of Agriculture Order No. 10 issued in 2015 as well as Section 4 , Section 16, and Section 18 of Republic Act 8550 or The Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998. The Malabon Court struck down local government jurisdiction over municipal waters and the laws mandate to give preferential access to small-scale fisherseffectively erasing what the petitioners describe as wholesale constitutional and statutory protections for coastal communities. READ: Romualdez vows to help challenge ruling on commercial fishing in municipal waters Petitioners said the trial courts decision threatens the constitutional rights of small-scale fishers and puts the countrys marine ecosystems at risk. Three grounds were specifically raised by petitioners: the failure of the DA-Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Office of the Solicitor General to discharge the public trust for the welfare of the people Malabon RTC Presiding Judge Zaldy Docena violated the doctrine o separation of powers, and failure of the respondent Mercidar Fishing Corporation to implead indispensable partices which rendered all proceedings and orders before the Malabon RTC branch 170 void. Petitioners said BFAR and the OSGmade a sluggish defense of the Fisheries Code that contributed to the RTC rulings far-reaching consequences. READ: DA appeals SC rule allowing commercial fishing in municipal waters As public service providers, the lackadaisical defense of the Public Respondents DA-BFAR and OSG of their mandates leave much to be desired, and the petitioners are now constrained to directly defend their own interests as Filipinos, concerned citizens, and stewards of nature, on behalf of the Filipino people, the petitioners said. The petitioners also branded the RTC ruling as ajudicial legislation and a gross violation of the constitutional separation of powers. As can be gleaned from the inordinate haste of the proceedings below, his procedural lapses, and his questionable conclusions, it is clear that Public Respondent Judge Zaldy Docena refused to extend any measure of deference to either Congress or the Executive, the petitioners stressed. Despite this, BFAR and several local governments have sought further legal remedies, citing the cases unresolved environmental and constitutional implications. The petitioners expressed hope that the Court will uphold constitutional principles, protect marine ecosystems, and reaffirm the rights of small-scale fishers.

Tolentino exposes link between Chinese embassy and troll farms,"Senator Francis Tolentino on Thursday dropped a bombshell as he presented evidence linking the Chinese Embassy to the Philippines to the proliferation of troll farm operations in the country. At the third hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Philippine Maritime and Admiralty Zones regarding espionage and underwater drones, Tolentino presented a copy of a service agreement contract between the Infinitus Marketing Solutions Inc. and the Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China in the Republic of the Philippines for the provision of keyboard warriors that will play a vital role in the overall effectiveness of the issue management project. This would reinforce reports from our security sector regarding the different hacking and spying activities conducted by Chinese nationals, he stressed. Tolentino who yesterday described the recovery of drones and espionage activities as just the tip of the iceberg said his revelations today uncover the breadth and depth of Chinas interference initiatives to the detriment of our country. Tolentino also presented a copy of a check issued by the Chinese Embassy to the order of Infinitus Marketing for the amount of Nine Hundred Thirty Thousand Pesos as payment for the activities mentioned in the service contract. Ito mismo ang nagpapatunay na China mismo ang nagbabayad, he said. These troll farms were engaged not only to openly provide information and convey the policies of the Chinese Government but also to act as a covert disinformation and influence operation against the Philippine government and the Filipino people, he added. Tolentino voiced disgust that such contracts threaten our national dignity. Hindi po ito simpleng kontrata, ito pong kontrata at kabayaran na ito ay pagyurak sa mga Pilipino pagyapak sa dignidad ng Pilipinas, the senator stressed. National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya supported Tolentinos revelations, saying that the latter is consistent with how the Peoples Republic of China operates. Tolentino, an international law expert, has stood fast in fighting for the Philippines sovereignty and maritime rights and championed Republic Act No. 12064 or the Maritime Zones of the Philippines Act, and Republic Act No. 12065 or the Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act in the Philippine Senate. # Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Visayan governors look to Gwen Garcias SMB for 20 rice program rollout,"Governor Gwendolyn Garcias Sugbo Merkado Barato program, which provides 20-per-kilo rice, is now being used as a reference by some provinces across the Visayas as they prepare for the implementation of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s campaign promise to provide affordable rice. The Department of Agricultures 20 rice program is set to begin rolling out in the Visayas next week. Governor Garcias SMB program, which has been running successfully in Cebu since October 2023, will serve as the model for neighboring provinces as they prepare to launch similar initiatives. READ: Speaker backs DAs plan to sell rice at P20 per kilo At a meeting with the governors of Regions 6, 7, and 8 on April 23, 2025, President Marcos discussed the 20 rice program, and how it will be implemented in the region. The Visayan governors acknowledged the success of Cebus SMB model, and many expressed that they are fortunate to have a proven template to follow. Aklan Governor Jose Enrique Miraflores said, Were lucky to have a template from Cebu. We will just adapt it to our own province. Siquijor Governor Jake Vincent Villa also noted that while Siquijor is smaller than Cebu, they plan to prioritize frontline workers and aim to cover 80% of their households, following Cebus example. The 20 rice program will see provinces purchasing rice from the Food Terminal Incorporated at 33 per kiloand selling it to locals at 20 per kilo, with the 13 difference being subsidized equally by the national government and the provinces. Governor Garcias SMB program has already proven to be an effective solution in Cebu for making rice affordable to low-income communities. Now, as President Marcos begins rolling out his 20 rice promise, other provinces are preparing to adopt Cebus SMB model to deliver the same benefit to their residents.

"Laguna Water, Laguna Aquatech switch to retail aggregation program, a first outside Metro Manila","Laguna Water and Laguna Aquatech , Manila Water Non-East Zone operating units in the Province of Laguna, have successfully transitioned to the electricity Retail Aggregation Program , marking the first-ever implementation of this initiative outside Metro Manila. This milestone highlights both the companies commitment to delivering clean, sustainable, and cost-efficient water services to the communities and businesses in Laguna. The RAP is an innovative program by the Energy Regulatory Commission which allows electricity consumers to aggregate and choose their power suppliers and negotiate competitive electricity rates. This transition enables Laguna Water and Laguna Aquatech to significantly reduce power costs, a major component of water production expenses. The resulting savings will help maintain affordable water rates while allowing the companies to reinvest in service enhancements, infrastructure development, and sustainability programs. This event, its a small, short quiet event, but really this allows us to proclaim to other audiences what we are doing. To our regulators, to our stakeholders that we are working tirelessly to try to improve operations and empower being what it is. Power, if you deal with it responsibly, you can work around it and make your operations good, said Manila Water President and CEO Jocot De Dios during the ceremonial switching event at the Laguna Water Head Office in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. But theres more, there are more things that we need to do. Theres more that we need to connect and other initiatives that we need to chase with our partners as well. And I think this is the spirit of really proclaiming not just in our country but in the international audience, how we can collaborate with partners, with power utilities and retail electricity suppliers, how we can make sustainability front and center of our water operations. he added. Its inspiring to see RAP expanding beyond Metro Manila. With Laguna Water and LARC following in the footsteps of Manila Water and making the switch, were taking another step toward a more competitive and consumer-driven power sector. This makes us more determined in making sure that all consumers effectively exercise their power to choose and enjoy the savings that come with it. The more participants we have in RAP, the stronger the competition is, and that means better prices and more options for everyone, said Atty. Monalisa Dimalanta, ERC Chairman and CEO. Currently, Laguna Water, a joint venture between Manila Water Philippine Ventures and the Provincial Government of Laguna, provides water, wastewater, and environmental services to municipalities of Santa Rosa, Cabuyao, Binan, Pagsanjan, several areas in Sta. Cruz, Pakil, Victoria and Calauan, and in various real estate developments in Laguna, which includes BellaVita , Amaia and Ayala Greenfield Estates Calamba. Meanwhile, LARC, a joint venture between MWPV and Laguna Water District, is dedicated to the rehabilitation, improvement, expansion, operation, and maintenance of the water supply system in the municipalities of Los Baos, Bay, Calauan, Victoria and Nagcarlan. The RAP transition includes LARCs twenty-five facilities, with a total of 900kW of power demand, and Laguna Waters sixty-seven facilities, with a total of 4.3 MW power demand. Through the RAP, the said operating units will now source electricity supply from PrimeRES Energy, distributed through Meralco. This landmark initiative establishes a new standard for energy-efficient water utility operations, underscoring Laguna Water and LARCs dedication to sustainability, affordability, and operational excellence, ensuring a dependable, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible water supply for the residents of Laguna.

Fire guts Makati restaurant stockroom causing P1.6M damage,"MANILA, Philippines A fire, probably sparked by an electrical malfunction, gutted the stockroom of a restaurant in Barangay La Paz, Makati, in the early hours of Friday, causing an estimated damage of P1.6 million. The fire started at around 1:30 a.m. in the stockroom of Peetchees Bulalo House on the ground floor of the five-story EGI 2 Condominium at the corner of Mola and Primo de Rivera Streets, according to a Makati Bureau of Fire Protection investigator, who declined to be identified as he was not yet authorized to speak about the incident. The restaurant owner, who refused to be interviewed, had earlier gone out to celebrate his birthday elsewhere, only to find out shortly that his business was burning, the fire investigator told INQUIRER.net. There were no injuries as the customers had already left by the time the fire started. READ: Fire in Tondo residential area extinguished after 9 hours Four minutes after the fire started, a resident in the area called the barangay hall for help, according to Eugene Clavejo, the night officer in charge at the La Paz Barangay Hall. In minutes, two firetrucks arrived, one from the Makati BFP and one from the barangay, along with several rescue vehicles loaded with several volunteers and Bantay Bayan personnel. They quickly helped the building residents evacuate to prevent them from suffocating from the smoke billowing out of the stockroom. There was no loud explosion as some bystanders reported, the fire investigator said. But there was big spark similar to what would be caused by an electrical gadget that had short-circuited. The restaurant had a total area of 40 square meters, but the firefighters were able to contain the spread of the fire to about 20 square meters, the fire investigator said. Fire was put under control at 2:07 a.m. and was declared out at 2:21 a.m., but some firefighters remained to keep hosing down the gutted area with water as a precaution.

The president, regardless of the rating whether high or low will continue doing his job. He will not be stopped by any survey, Castro said in Filipino. The 2,400 respondents do not reflect the sentiment of the more than 100 million Filipinos in the country. If these people did give their opinions, it was perhaps a result of fake news, she added. Asked whether the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte last March 11 may have affected the survey conducted more than a week later, Castro replied: This is something the administration will still look into. During a Cabinet meeting held the same day, Castro said that Marcos ordered intensified efforts against the spread of deceptive information. Fake news can derail the mindset of the public, which is why action is now being taken, Castro said. The palace officials further eased worries about the recent spate of kidnappings in the country.

Solon downplays Sara Dutertes alliance-building moves ahead of trial,"MANILA, Philippines La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V is not bothered by Vice President Sara Dutertes supposed attempt to build alliances in the 2025 midterm elections for her impeachment trial, noting that the evidence gathered against her is strong enough. Ortega was asked in an interview with reporters covering the House on Monday if he was still confident that the prosecution team would secure a conviction against Duterte, even after she has started to endorse senatorial candidates in the upcoming polls. According to Ortega, the evidence gathered during the House committee on good government and public accountability and at the budget briefings is strong enough. He noted that Duterte may just be trying to influence possible winners in the senatorial race. Well, we have strong evidence as seen during the committee hearings on good government and the previous budget briefings. But as I have said, we cannot help but think that this is an attempt to influence possible senator-judges, to have an influence should their endorsement result in wins, he said in Filipino. But for me, the obligation of senator-judges is to the people, not to a single person or politician. Their accountability is to the people, and the entire Philippines will see how they handle the proceedings like the impeachment, Ortega added. Ortega also said that it is not surprising that Duterte went back on her word to refrain from endorsing senatorial aspirants. He said this is not the first time that the Vice President said something only to do otherwise. We all know what she said since the pronouncements were made on television, that she will not endorse senatorial bets or other candidates because she will leave the decision to pick the right candidates to the people. But true to the same form, true to her form, she acted differently compared to her pronouncements, he said. Definitely thats their political strategy, he added. Duterte said in November 2024 that she would not endorse any candidate, whether for the local or national race, due to her experience in the 2022 national elections. Thats when she supposedly endorsed candidates who turned out to be bad for the country. READ: Sara says she wont endorse bets in 25 polls However, the 2025 midterm elections were seen to be crucial to the impeachment trial against Duterte, as the Senate of the 20th Congress would conduct the proceedings. No less than the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino , the party of Dutertes father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, appealed to voters to elect senatorial bets who would prevent a conviction, as they will sit as senator-judges. READ: PDP-Laban seeks votes to save Sara for 2028 Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. Under the Constitution, the Senate will act as an impeachment court with sitting senators serving as judges. The impeachment of Duterte was largely based on the House hearings conducted in 2024, where allegations of confidential fund misuse within the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education were revealed. At one point in the hearings, Antipolo City 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop noticed that one of the acknowledgement receipts for the OVPs CF expenditures was signed by a certain Mary Grace Piattos, who he said bears a name similar to a restaurant and a potato chip brand. ARs are proof of payment or that funding for projects reached its intended beneficiaries and in the case of OVP and DepEd, these are informants who provided confidential information to authorities. Later on, Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong showed two ARs one for OVP and another for DepEd which were both received by Villamin.However, the signatures and handwriting used by Villamin in the two documents differed. Both Piattos and Villamins names did not appear on the Philippine Statistics Authority database.

Koko Pimentel backs shoemakers; vows to uphold Mundings Marikina legacy,"MANILA, Philippines Millennial entrepreneur Mia Santos, owner of Niffty Shoes in Barangay Malanday, Marikina, still recalls the joy in the eyes of the 1,000 top-performing grade school students who received free Marikina-made shoes last year under the Libreng Sapatos program. It was Santos and her team who were tapped to organize the projectsourcing, producing, and fitting the shoes, all proudly crafted in their local workshop. That initiative didnt just help children, Santos said. It also helped the shoemakers. For Santos, whose shop is among the roughly 200 registered manufacturers and retailers still active in Marikina as of 2025, programs like these are lifelines in an industry long battered by neglect and competition from imports. Marikeos are naturally skilledwe wouldnt be called the Shoe Capital of the Philippines if our craftsmanship and talent werent world-class, she said. What we need now are leaders who walk in rhythm with our struggles. We need champions. Were here to stayand we will never give up on Marikina. With the 2025 elections approaching, Santos said shes not just looking at platformsshes looking for someone who has puso para sa mga sapatero. Decades ago, Marikina was synonymous with quality shoes. Known as the Shoe Capital of the Philippines, it was once home to over 1,300 registered manufacturers and employed more than 300,000 workers at its peak. That golden era was largely credited to Mayor Osmundo Munding de Guzman, who served for over 26 years starting in 1959. It was de Guzman who institutionalized the citys reputation by founding the Marikina Shoe Trade Commission in 1967 and spearheading the First National Footwear Industry Workshop-Convention in 1974. Then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos regularly graced local trade fairs and promoted Marikina-made shoes on the international stage. READ: Marikina shoemakers: Still here, still fighting But as decades passed, the lack of support pushed the industry to the brink of collapse. Now, Santos and hundreds of others are hoping that the citys legacy can still be salvaged. On April 22, 2025, the city will mark a renewed push. The exhibit titled Marikina: Pamana ng Sapatos Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas will open at Freedom Park. Free to the public, the event will showcase locally made products and celebrate the citys shoe heritage. Shoemakers, bag craftsmen, MSMEs, and food entrepreneurs will take parta reminder that the spirit of Marikinas industries is still alive, if only waiting to be fully supported. The legacy of Mayor de Guzman lives on in his granddaughter, Special Envoy to the UAE Kathryna Yu De Guzman Pimentel, and her husband, Senator Aquilino Koko Pimentel III. Last year, they distributed free locally made shoes to 1,000 top-performing public school students in District 1 of Marikina and about 800 public school teachers. Surprisingly, it was the first initiative of its kind in a city celebrated as the Shoe Capital of the Philippines. The former Senate President, now running for congressman of the first district, has taken the advocacy further by filing Senate Bill No. 2994a measure that proposes the creation of modern Shoe Manufacturing Hubs nationwide, with Marikina as the pilot site. The goal is to bolster the countrys footwear industry by supporting MSMEs through access to shared service facilities and modern infrastructure, Pimentel said. His bill includes tax incentives, subsidies, R&D support, and a Buy Local, Wear Local campaignan ambitious, comprehensive attempt to revive an industry that helped define a city. Locally, he is promoting the BTS Program, short for Baha, Trabaho, at Sapatos , a platform that ties flood mitigation, employment, and industrial revival into one cohesive plan for Marikinas future. Under the proposed measure, the Department of Trade and Industry , in coordination with local government units, will be tasked with identifying strategic locations nationwide for the establishment of these hubs. A Shoe Industry Development Program will also be created, to be led by the DTI in coordination with the Department of Science and Technology and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority . A nationwide Buy Local, Wear Local campaign will be implemented under the Consumer Awareness Program to promote Filipino-made footwear and encourage public support. This bill seeks to revitalize the Philippine shoe industry by instituting a comprehensive framework to enhance its competitiveness in both domestic and international markets, Pimentel said.

"Solon asks whats the basis of alliances, for people or for endorsers?","MANILA, Philippines If President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. touts the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas slate as a line-up not associated with the bloody war on drugs and other controversial actions taken by the past administration, does Vice President Sara Dutertes endorsement of some candidates say otherwise? This was the question raised by Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel during an online press briefing on Monday, noting the flaws in Alyansas unity slate as Deputy Speaker Camille Villar and Senator Imee Marcos get Dutertes backing. Villar is part of the Alyansa slate. At the same time, Senator Marcos left the lineup because she said she could not bear the administrations actions against Dutertes father, former president Rodrigo Duterte. On the part of the Alyansa slate, we think this only shows how rough their version of unity is, because at the start of the campaign the sitting President is claiming that their slate is not tainted with any connection to bloody hands, to killers, something like that, Manuel said in Filipino. So what now that for example, Camille Villar gets endorsed by Sara Duterte, with that the sitting President is no longer consistent with his bases for including candidates in his admin slate, he added. At the start of the campaign season for the 2025 midterm elections, Marcos shocked observers by taking a more aggressive stance against his predecessor, former president Duterte, and the lineup that he is endorsing. At Alyansas proclamation rally at the Centennial Arena in Ilocos Norte last February 11, Marcos said that none of the senatorial candidates in Alyansa are associated with Oplan Tokhang, the Duterte administrations house-to-house campaign against illegal drugs. That gained notoriety due to bloody killings and allegations of human rights violations. READ: Marcos on admin slate: Theyre not tainted by tokhang, Pogo, pro-China Marcos also claimed that no one from their slate is tainted by the corruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, by a pro-China stance, and by the illegal activities surrounding Philippine offshore gaming operators.

It seems to be all confusing now. Thats why I hope it would be clear to our people what these candidates basis are for being together and making an alliance, is it about for the people or for those who are endorsing them? he asked. Alyansa on the other hand has thanked Duterte for backing Villar, with campaign manager and Navotas City Rep. Toby Tiangco saying that those endorsing their candidates share their vision of a peaceful and prosperous country. Tiangco in a separate statement on Monday said that turning this vision, however, requires a steady leadership and a track record of delivering results. We are glad that they share our goal for a peaceful and prosperous Philippines. But turning that vision into reality takes more than words.

According to Barbers, the PNP must build on these gains, and make the public feel safe. This swift action by the PNP proves that under the leadership of President Marcos, our law enforcement agencies are working with greater precision and efficiency in solving crimes, he said. This development shows the growing capacity of our law enforcement agencies to resolve cases with professionalism and restraint. We should encourage this kind of performance from our police officers, he said. We must continue building on this. The public deserves to feel safe, and that comes from knowing that justice is being served through due process. On Saturday, PNP spokesperson Brig. Gen.

"QC bans disposable, single-use plastics at city hall, city-run facilities","MANILA, Philippines Taking a firm and aggressive stance to reduce plastic waste, Quezon City will prohibit disposables and single-use plastic bags, packaging, and cutleries within the Quezon City Hall compound and city government-run establishments. Through Executive Order No. 3, Series of 2025, the use of plastic bags and packaging, styrofoam , disposable dishware such as paper plates, plastic utensils, PET bottles, plastic and paper cups will no longer be allowed inside Quezon City Hall buildings and other city-owned facilities starting April 21, 2025. Non-biodegradable and single-use plastics take thousands of years to break down, polluting our land and waterways in the process. Studies now show that microplastics have made their way into our food, drinking water, and even our soilposing serious health risks to our communities, said Mayor Joy Belmonte. Plastic waste clogs our drainage systems and contributes to severe flooding, as seen during recent typhoons. Plastic pollution is a growing crisis that endangers our health, our economy, and especially the well-being of our most vulnerable communities. Plastic even chokes our marine animals. This is precisely why the city government is pioneering policies and long-term solutions to reduce plastic use and advance sustainability, she added. Employees will have to bring their reusable eco-bags when buying food and products outside the building facilities. They should also bring their reusable take-out containers when purchasing food from vendors and food stalls within and around the City Hall compound. Likewise, single-use cutlery will be prohibited for employees within the workplace. For clients and visitors, food from vendors may be served in disposable take-out containers, including utensils upon request. However, these items must not be brought inside the building. Food deliveries will still be allowed inside city government buildings provided that recipient offices are required to recover the food containers and trade them at the Trash to Cashback booth. Deliveries that use plastic packaging, on the other hand, will not be permitted inside city government buildings. The EO also reinforces the provisions of the Quezon City Green Public Procurement Ordinance , which sets the guidelines for eliminating single-use plastics and disposable materials in all city-led activities, promoting the use of reusable and recyclable alternatives. To ensure effective and comprehensive rollout of the policy, the Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability Department and the General Services Department have conducted orientation sessions to discuss the policys provisions and address concerns and suggestions of affected concessionaires and stakeholders. Ambulant vendors who fail to comply with the EO within city government premises will face penalties. Employees and officials found violating the rules will be issued formal reprimands or memoranda.

"DICT to enhance free WIFI in MRT 3 stations, trains","MANILA The Department of Information and Communications Technology looks to enhance the existing free WIFI coverage in the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 stations and boost rail line services by adopting cashless fare payments and better security. In a statement on Tuesday, DICT Secretary Henry Aguda said the enhanced free WiFi would be implemented across all MRT-3 stations, with a long-term goal to expand the free WiFi even inside trains. To make this happen, the DICT is working closely with major telecommunications providers to ramp up bandwidth and improve coverage in critical transit zones. These upgrades will include in-station fiber networks and enhanced signal infrastructure, Aguda said. He said initial improvements would be felt by the public within the next month, and Internet speed would continue to increase in the months to follow. To date, he said, the expansion of the free WIFI program to the Light Rail Transit Line 1 and Line 2 is still being studied. This makes MRT-3 the pilot for a broader digital transformation across the countrys major train lines, with lessons learned here shaping future rollouts, he said. Cashless fare payments In addition to better free WiFi, the DICT and the Department of Transportation are collaborating on the implementation of contactless fare payments via credit and debit cards, e-wallets, and smartphones. The DICT is also eyeing the use of artificial intelligence or AI-powered security screening systems to speed up safety checks. By combining strengthened inter-agency partnerships with people-first digital solutions, the DICT and DOTr are paving the way for commutes that are not only more efficient, but more dignified transforming daily train rides into daily wins, Aguda said.

Furthermore, being featured in the April issue of the magazine is particularly special for him, as it coincides with his birthday this month, making the celebration even more meaningful. During the event, Grace Bondad Nicolas posed the question, FPJ Panday Bayanihan, what are the objectives of the foundation? To which Brian thoughtfully responded, Nung 2013 nagsimula tayo bilang isang foundation na tumutulong tuwing may sakuna. Eventually, itong 2024 cinonvert naming into partylist because Senator Grace Poe, my mom, is graduating from the Senate and she cant run anymore for another term.

He underscored the importance of their commitment to aiding those in need while tackling the complexities of such a role.

He emphasized the significance of understanding the diverse needs of various communities before formalizing their objectives, ensuring that their initiatives are relevant and effective. With this partylist, we decided to be a pro-poor party list, to help the different sectors because the commonality between all of them is the economic struggle that everyone faces, he continued.

PCO to revise newly-released accreditation guidelines,"MANILA, Philippines The Presidential Communications Office will revise its recently released new guidelines for reporters covering Malacaang and the President. This came after PCO officials and officers of the Malacaang Press Corps Inc. held a meeting on Monday to discuss some provisions in the guidelines that appeared to limit newsrooms autonomy in assigning reporters to the beat. READ: SC rules media accreditation guidelines must not infringe free speech One of these is the requirement that reporters must have at least five years of experience covering politics. During the meeting, MPC officers also raised the need to clarify vague terms in the guidelines, such as false reporting, which is cited as one of the grounds for the revocation of a reporters accreditation. In a statement released after the meeting, MPC officers said that, PCO officials led by Secretary Jay Ruiz were open to the suggestions of the MPC, but maintained that stricter accreditation rules are needed because of the nature of Malacaang as a prime beat. The two sides agreed to work together to achieve a middle ground that will ensure the efficiency and integrity of the accreditation process while preserving the autonomy of Palace reporters. The statement also said that PCO officials asked MPC officers to submit a position letter by Friday so the PCO could craft a clearer and more acceptable set of guidelines. Pending the revision of its guidelines, the PCO agreed to defer the submission period of the accreditation requirements, which was supposed to take place from April 29 to May 2, the statement read. The MPC will continue to vigorously promote the interests of its members, contribute to the strengthening of self-regulation among media groups and stand by efforts promoting independent, critical and ethical reporting, it also said.

Internal affairs: 674 complaints only 1% of total police work force,"MANILA, Philippines The public may be more motivated now to file complaints against police officers for violating law enforcement rules, according to Philippine National Police Internal Affairs Service Inspector General Brigido Dulay. He said this in a press conference at Camp Crame on Wednesday, sharing with reporters that as of April 22, 2025, there had been 674 complaints against erring police officers. You can also look at it this way. Are they more confident in filing complaints now? Maybe the reason it went up is people are now more motivated to file charges, Dulay said. For comparison, according to Dulay, there were 1,897 cases against cops for the entirety of 2023; and 2,073 cases for the whole of 2024. If you were to do it on the basis of the total workforce, its around one percent of the total workforce of the PNP. The 99 percent are actually dedicated policemen, Dulay said. The PNP is not defined by this one percent. IAS has yet to provide a detailed breakdown of the complaints statuses and the nature of the offenses for which theywere lodged. In all honesty, for us at IAS, if our citizens have a complaint, they should file the complaint. If they dont, we cant do anything about it, unless we do a motu proprio , Dulay stressed.

This was the response of the National Police Commission and the Philippine National Police Internal Affairs Service to a recent series of alleged violations by several Quezon City Police District officers. Baka kailangan pa mas stringent [M]ahigpit na ang recruitment processes ng PNP. Pero given this spate of incidents na hindi naman natin pwedeng sabihing isolated, baka kailangan pa natin mas silipin pa, Napolcom Vice Chairperson Rafael Calinisan said in an interview on Wednesday over dzBB.

Baka hindi nila gaanong naiintindihan yung gaano kalaki yung responsibilidad ng pagsuot ng ganyang uniporme, Calinisan added. One case involved a police officer breaking into three homes, threatening residents, and harming a grandmother and a minor in Barangay Damayan, Quezon City.

Sen. Legarda reiterates call: Earth Day must be every day,"In the face of a worsening climate crisis, Senator Loren Legarda underscored the need for daily actionbeyond ceremonial observanceas the true spirit of Earth Day. Earth Day should not be observed only once a year. It must be a daily reminder of our shared responsibility to protect and preserve our environment, Legarda stressed, urging Filipinos to embrace sustainable living and support clean energy policies. Aligning with this years Earth Day theme, Our Power, Our Planet, the Senator called for nationwide action to accelerate the energy transition. The energy transition cannot be left to industry alone. Our energy transition must include every Filipino. When a household installs a solar panel, participates in net-metering, or when a business chooses the green energy option, it is not merely adopting a new technologyit is asserting its right to clean air, lower costs, and a livable future. Community microgrids bring not just power to homes but economic gains to businesses, lower bills for everyone, and stronger resilience during crises, she said. Legarda, author and co-sponsor of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 and principal author and co-sponsor of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act , highlighted how energy choices directly impact public health. Cleaner energy means fewer emissionsand fewer lives lost to asthma, heart disease, and maternal complications linked to pollution. It means protecting women and children, who are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation, she noted. Beyond legislative work, Legarda appealed to the public to adopt simple but impactful habits: This Earth Day, I call on every Filipino to take partat home, in the barangay, at work. Plant trees. Turn off what you dont need. Choose LED lights. Explore solar technologies and local microgrids. Demand clean energy choices from providers and support policies that bring us closer to a decentralized, democratized energy future. Our shift to cleaner energy is more than a change in infrastructureit reflects a deeper shift in values. Throughout her public service, Legarda has championed major environmental laws, including the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act , the Climate Change Act of 2009 , and the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 forming the backbone of the countrys climate resilience and environmental protection strategy.

Romualdez: Govt can shift from cash aid to rice subsidies,"MANILA, Philippines The government can transition from providing direct cash ayuda to allocating its funds for aid to rice subsidies so that people can buy grains at P20 per kilogram, House of Representatives Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez said on Friday. In a statement, Romualdez said that it seems possible now for the government to fulfill President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s campaign promise of bringing rice prices down to P20 per kilogram, as the Department of Agriculture started such a program in Visayas. With this initiative, the Speaker said the government can be assured that funds allocated to poverty alleviation really translates into food and anti-hunger measures. Providing affordable rice directly addresses hunger and ensures that assistance reaches the dining tables of Filipino families. This approach guarantees that government support translates into actual food security for our citizens, Romualdez said. Instead of giving out cash that may not go directly to food, this system ensures the ayuda reaches the dinner table, Romualdez said. Mas mainam kung bigas ang mismong naipapamigaynakakabusog, nakakatulong, at tiyak ang patutunguhan. While conditional cash transfer and social amelioration programs were important safety nets for families below or within the poverty line, one major criticism of these ayuda is the huge uncertainty that cash grants are actually used to purchase basic and necessary needs. It has been a usual scene for politicians overseeing aid distributions to remind beneficiaries that these financial assistance should be spent on food, and not on gambling platforms like online cockfighting or e-sabong hence the Tagalog phrase ang ayuda hindi para sa tupada which literally translates to aid should not be for illegal cockfighting. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, 10 individuals from Palayan City, Nueva Ecija were arrested for gambling hours after the city government distributed cash assistance to families. A Luzon-wide lockdown was in place during that time. READ: 10 nabbed for gambling after receiving cash assistance from Ecija town govt Last Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. announced the availability of P20 per kilogram rice in the Visayas, adding that this development came after Marcos held a closed-door meeting with governors from the Western Visayas, Central Visayas, and Eastern Visayas. READ: DA will start selling rice at P20 per kilo Tiu Laurel According to Laurel, the program will run until December but it may be extended until February 2026. Romualdez noted that the provincial government of Camiguin has also successfully implemented a similar measure, where local government units , the Department of Social Welfare and Development , and local retailers partnered to make rice accessible sold at half of usual market prices. Under the DA program, the department in partnership with the Food Terminal Inc. and participating LGUs will shoulder the price difference between the market rate and the subsidized P20 per kilogram rice. In Camiguin, the cost of the rice was brought down through LGUs coordinating with DSWD and local retailers. This initiative from Camiguin Governor Xavier Jesus Romualdo and Rep. Jurdin Jesus Romualdo, Romualdez said, has already helped hundreds of families buy affordable rice. The Camiguin model demonstrates the effectiveness of coordinated efforts among national agencies, LGUs, and private sector partners in delivering tangible benefits to the people. Its a blueprint worth replicating nationwide, he said. If it works in Camiguin, it can work across the country. This is a clear example of how the national government, LGUs, and private retailers can come together to deliver direct, practical relief to Filipino families, he added. Romualdez said the House is prepared to push for additional funding in the 2026 national budget to institutionalize this rice subsidy system. Ang panawagan ko sa ating mga LGU: pag-aralan ninyo ang modelong ito. Kami sa Kongreso ay handang tumulong sa pagbuo ng pondo at patakaran para mailunsad ito sa inyong mga komunidad, he said. This is not just a subsidyits a signal that we are serious about food on every Filipinos table, Romualdez said.

Senate President Francis Escudero earlier estimated the expenses for the impeachment trial to be less than a million pesos only, excluding lawyer fees.

In a statement, Adiong also said that former President Rodrigo Dutertes administration even sold rice that was infested with weevils, or bukbok, which former Agriculture Secretary Manny Piol said was safe to eat. At one point during the Duterte administration, rice prices surged from P50 to P70 in some areas, forcing towns like Zamboanga City to declare a state of calamity. In August 2018, Piol denied it, but he eventually admitted that rice prices went as high as P80 per kilogram in Tawi-tawi. READ: Piol: No P70 per kilo rice in Zamboanga City It is ironic that the Vice President is mocking efforts to lower rice prices to P20 per kilogram when, during the administration of her father, rice prices even soared to P70 per kilo in some areas, said Adiong, an assistant majority leader of the House of Representatives. It was under the Duterte government that we saw imported rice shipments infested with bukbok, when her fathers appointed Agriculture Secretary, Manny Piol, oversaw rice importation. Before pointing fingers, it would be better for her to look back at the failures of the administration she proudly represents, he added. Adiongs statements came after Vice President Duterte, in an ambush interview in Negros Occidental last Wednesday, criticized President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s administration for selling P20 per kilogram rice in Visayas during an election season. According to Duterte, the program comes too late, adding that the Marcos administration is just resorting to rice subsidies because they know that Marcos Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas slate performs badly in Visayas. You know that is just for the elections and for their senators who are part of their alliance to win, she said in Filipino. I dont know what their motive is.But yes, they are tricking the people with that P20 per kilo of rice.And you will be confused why Visayas only, arent the people from Luzon and Mindanao hungry also? [] Maybe they have problems with votes from Visayas, she added. The P20 per kilogram rice was Marcos campaign during the 2022 elections when his Uniteam tandem with the Vice President was still alive. Last Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. announced the availability of P20 per kilogram of rice in Visayas through the government subsidies meant to shoulder higher market prices. READ: DA will start selling rice at P20 per kilo Tiu Laurel Adiong said Vice President Duterte should just support initiatives that seek to ease the peoples burden. Rather than criticize, the vice president should support every effort that aims to provide relief to the Filipino people, especially when it involves making basic necessities more affordable, Adiong said. What a leader should do, if he or she really cares for the people, is to support steps to make peoples lives comfortable, not to hit on initiatives that help them, he added. We should be working together to find solutions, not tearing down every attempt simply because it comes from another administration. Alyansa candidates like former Senate president Vicente Tito Sotto and Makati Mayor Abby Binay also opposed Vice President Dutertes suggestions. During a press briefing in Pangasinan last Friday, Sotto asked Duterte where she wants the funds to go to rice subsidies that would benefit people or the pockets of corrupt officials? Theres a saying that its better late than never, right? And maybe they failed to figure this out immediately, Sotto said. As I said earlier, there were concerns about the government shouldering subsidies for rice. So what? That should be the case, because thats taxpayers money, it should be consumed by the people also. Instead of being given to the corrupt only, right?Where do they want the funds to go, to the pockets of corrupt officials?Let us give that subsidy to our people so that they would not go hungry and to reduce prices of goods, he added.

Binay, on the other hand, said the government is being criticized whatever it does, even when it provides solutions to problems.

"CitizenWatch PH official alarmed over surge in online scams, fraud","MANILA, Philippines CitizenWatch Philippines has expressed concern over the growing threat of online scams that take advantage of gaps in digital security. It also warned that trust in internet services is weakening at a time when the countrys digital economy is rapidly expanding. READ: AFP assures systems in place amid report of Chinese hacking on PH With that, Atty. Tim Abejo, co-convenor of CitizenWatch Philippines, called on government authorities to crack down on the malicious use of International Mobile Subscriber Identity catchers, also known as Cell Site Simulators or Fake Base Stations. These devices mimic real cell towers to intercept phone signals and trick users into sharing personal and financial information. These IMSI catchers act like telco cell sites, Abejo said in a press release on April 25. They trick your phone into thinking its connected to a real telecom network, then send you messages that look like theyre from your bank or mobile service provider. One click on a malicious link, and youre either handing over your private info or unknowingly downloading malware that gives hackers full access to your device, he explained. READ: Garcia: Hackers fail to breach Comelec website, OVCS He also noted that these devices are now small in size, just enough to fit in a backpack and mobile enough to be transported to various locations. Thats what makes them dangerous. Theyre stealthy, mobile, and outside the control of our telcos because they dont need to access the legitimate mobile networks, Abejo said. The CitizenWatch Philippines also recognized government efforts in intercepting some IMSI catchers, but Abejo said the masterminds behind these operations remain at large. Our digital economy was worth $35.4 billion in 2023about 8.4 percent of GDP. But that growth is at risk, he said. People wont use online banking, e-wallets, or e-commerce if they dont feel safe. And if they lose trust in digital transactions, it could also undermine the eGovernment initiative and other digital efforts meant to boost the economy. If trust keeps falling, digital adoption will stall, he added. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

"Francis life challenges Christians: Stand with suffering, shun comforts","TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte Pope Francis life is a challenge to Christians to stand with the suffering and marginalized while at the same time leaving ones comfort zones, Monsignor Ramon Stephen Aguilos said during the thanksgiving mass offered here on Saturday. In his homily, Aguilos said Francis visit to Tacloban in January 2015 ten years ago should remind Filipinos to be like the yellow raincoat that the pontiff wore before, shielding other people during times of tribulation. One of the notable images during that papal visit was Francis, donning a yellow translucent raincoat, continued to flash a smile while blessing people, and delivered his message despite strong winds and rains. Francis life challenges us to live as he did, to stand with the suffering, to dance the curacha of joy amid sorrow, to sing with a choir, to be a church that goes out to the peripheries, to the margins, Aguilos told mass-goers near the tarmac of the Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport where Francis also held the mass in 2015. Let this apron or this tarmac symbolize our faith taking flight, carrying Francis message of mercy and resilience to the world. Let us also be the yellow raincoat for others, a sign of Gods presence in their storms, he added. As we honor him today, in union with the church in Rome, let us commit to living his legacy of love. Aguilos also remembered several things that Francis did, which meant a lot to the people of Tacloban and Eastern Visayas who were still recovering during that time from the impact of Super Typhoon Yolanda. According to Aguilos, Francis opted to set aside his prepared homily for a more personal message that resonated with Yolanda survivors. Who can forget the image of Pope Francis stepping off the plane, clad in his white cassock, which would later be covered with a simple yellow raincoat? His warm smile cutting through the storm can you imagine, a smile through the storm? It was a profound humility, as if he were saying, I am here in the rain, I am here in your suffering. I am here with you. He circled the apron in his popemobile, greeting the faithful, his presence, a bomb to our wounded hearts. When he celebrated mass here, he set aside his prepared homily, moved by the spirit, and spoke from the depths of his heart. His off-the-cuff words reminded us that God weeps with us, that Jesus is close in our pain aqui estoy, he said, I am here to be with you, he added. These simple words, Aguilos said, helped the people of Leyte and the entire Eastern Visayas to move forward. Even as Typhoon Amang cut his visit short, his message endured God is near, even in the storm. The faithful were soaked in the rain, but they were steadfast, he said. And that embodied the truth, standing firm as they had in the aftermath of Yolanda, he added. Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, passed away last April 21 morning in the Vatican or just a day after the Catholic world celebrated Easter Sunday to commemorate Jesus Christs resurrection. He was 88. Francis passing came after making a much hoped-for appearance at Saint Peters Square. Prior to his return to his duties, Francis suffered from a bout with pneumonia. He spent 38 days in hospital before he was discharged on March 23. But aside from what happened during the papal visit to Leyte and Manila, Filipinos also remembered Francis for ushering change in a Church riddled by controversies, a hardline stance on conservatism, and allegations of indifference for the poor and marginalized. People from all over the globe have thanked Francis for being kind, and for opening the church to people from diverse backgrounds, regardless of age, sexual orientation, financial status, religion, and history. On Facebook, different clips and quote cards of Francis giving blunt but practical and wise answers to questions, especially on hard-pressing issues, have resurfaced. At one point, Francis was asked by journalists about Islamic violence, after a priest in France was killed in an attack claimed by Isis, an extremist organization considered as a terrorist organization by many states. Francis gave a sharp response, noting that if he were to talk about Islamic violence, he would also discuss Catholic violence as he saw news stories about people in Italy baptized as Catholics committing grave crimes against their relatives.

Pope Francis showed us how to lead with compassion Romualdez,"TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte More than giving hope to people from Eastern Visayas, Pope Francis showed how it is to lead by example and with compassion, House of Representatives Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez said on Saturday. In a statement after the thanksgiving mass here for Francis funeral rites at the Vatican, Romualdez said that the pontiffs 2015 visit allowed the people of Leyte and the entire Eastern Visayas to rise again after the extensive damage caused by Super Typhoon Yolanda. Pope Francis gave us more than hope, Romualdez, who represents the first district of Leyte, said. He showed the world how to lead with compassion. He stood with usnot just as a Pope, but as a father to the suffering. His presence gave us strength to rise. He gave us the courage to begin again. When we felt forgotten, he remembered. When we were broken, he came to bless the brokenness. That is something no people ever forget, he added. According to Romualdez, the people of Tacloban and Eastern Visayas would never forget these invaluable actions from the late pontiff. His presence was a comfort to our grief, a spark to our resilience and a reminder that even in the darkest storms, the light of compassion can shine through, he said. Hindi po kailanman mababayaran ng salita o panahon ang ginawa ng Santo Papa para sa mga taga-Tacloban at buong Eastern Visayas. Ang kanyang pagyakap sa ating lungkot ay nagsilbing paalala ng pagmamahal ng Diyos sa mga nawalan at nasalanta ng bagyo, he added. Romualdez said the yellow raincoat that Francis wore which became iconic as he was seen wearing it while smiling and blessing the people despite strong winds and rains became a symbol of Eastern Visayas residents unwavering faith. That yellow raincoat became our banner of faith. We saw in him not a distant leader, but a loving father: present, soaked in our sorrow, and filled with love, he said. Hindi lang siya nakiramay. Pumunta siya, nakiiyak at nakisama sa paghihirap ng mga taga-Tacloban City at buong Eastern Visayas. Hindi lang po ito pag-alala, ito ay pasasalamat. Isang dekada na ang lumipas, pero sariwa pa rin sa alaala namin ang pagmamahal na kanyang ipinadama. Kaya ngayong araw na ito, sinasabi naming muli: Damo nga salamat, Pope Francis, he added. Romualdez was one of the several government officials who welcomed Francis into Tacloban City during the January 2015 papal visit, along with then-senator and now President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Monsignor Ramon Stephen Aguilos, who officiated over the thanksgiving mass on Saturday, was also present when Francis went to Tacloban. Earlier, Aguilos said in his homily that Francis life is a challenge to Christians to stand with the suffering and marginalized while at the same time leaving ones comfort zones.

Tacloban City sends off Pope Francis with gratitude,"TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte Saturday morning in this coastal city starts out like it usually does initially foggy, followed by a gentle breeze, and then with a blistering heat of the summer sun by noon. The city has been on a steady path of recovery ever since Super Typhoon Yolanda barreled through Eastern Visayas in 2013, which led to thousands of deaths, massive destruction, and displaced families. Memories haunt residents though, with some people still refusing to recall details of the harrowing ordeal. But as if a reminder that 10 years ago, someone stood by them to remind them that they are not alone rain fell down in Tacloban, just like when the head of the Roman Catholic Church visited to share in the pain of his flock. Pope Francis may have passed away, but Tacloban residents would forever be grateful for the simple yet touching gesture of listening to their pleas and understanding their suffering. On Saturday, Tacloban and Eastern Visayas come together again to remember Francis, as funeral rites will be held in the Vatican for the late pontiff. Maribeth dela Pea, a member of a church organization in Leyte, said that Francis visit in January 2015 enabled them to continue fighting for their future, and having faith that things will be better. Naaalala namin si Pope Francis nang dumating po siya dito sa Tacloban, naramdaman namin yong pagmamahal na ipinakita niya sa amin, tapos yong parang kahit na malayo siyang tao, pinuntahan niya pa rin, dela Pea told reporters covering the thanksgiving mass here near the Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport. Ipinakita niya na may pag-asa kami, nabigyan kami ng pag-asa, she added. Francis visit to Tacloban, at the height of another storm, was one of the highlights of his visit to the Philippines.

Padasas met Francis after the Pope honored his daughter, 27-year-old Kristel Mae, during another mass at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. I am really in sorrow now.

Reluao, founder of RepublicAsia and lead of the Pay IT Forward: A Digital Transformation Advocacy campaign, is expanding the program to Marawi with the help of key agencies and private partners. The initiative provides free gadgets, internet devices, and training to schools that need them most. Reluao on Friday inked a memorandum of agreement with the Department of Budget and Management led by Sec. Amenah F. Pangandaman, iACADEMY, GMA Kapuso Foundation, and Sparkle GMA Artist Center. Why Marawi? Because digital access remains a real challenge in the area, Reluao said. Marawi, a city still rebuilding from conflict, deserves more than just infrastructure it deserves empowerment. And for that, we bring tools, training, and most importantly, hope. Digital transformation should not be a privilege but a right accessible to all, Reluao said. By providing tools and training to underserved schools, we are creating a foundation for a digitally empowered future. Pangandaman, who is from Mindanao, welcomed the initiative and underscored the importance of investing in childrens education. It is my great honor and privilege to join all of you today and take part in the launch of Pay IT Forward, a digital transformation advocacy.

I would like to laud the efforts of Republic Asia, iACADEMY, and the DBM for this very noble endeavor of Pay IT Forward, Gozon-Valdez said. Truly, to use modern technology to further education is something that everyone should aspire for. iACADEMY President and COO Raquel Perez Wong highlighted the power of collaboration in addressing deep-rooted educational challenges. This shows the power of collaboration. When government and private partners work hand in hand with genuine commitment, meaningful change becomes possible, she said. At iACADEMY, weve always believed in the powerful merge of education and technology. In todays rapidly evolving world, access to technology is no longer a privilegeit is a necessity. Thats why Pay IT Forward initiative is so close to our hearts. It may not solve the digital divide entirely but our hope is that our small steps will later turn to bigger resolve and greater hope for others so each and everyone of us will have our fair chance to shine in this digital world, she added. Reluao thanked Pangandaman for her unwavering support and acknowledged the special significance of bringing the program to Marawi.

Mayor Abby Binay leads opening of Makati Life Medical Center,"MANILA, Philippines Makati City Mayor Abby Binay on Thursday led the inauguration of Makati Life Medical Center , showcasing an innovative public-private partnership model that will transform how healthcare services are delivered in the Philippines. When we first dreamed of Makati Life, we werent just planning another hospital. We reimagined what is possible when government purpose meets private sector agility. When compassion meets innovation. When we refuse to accept that any Filipino deserves less than first-class care, Binay said. Starting May 8, MLMC will officially open its doors for key hospital services including Emergency Care, Critical Care, Surgical Services, Admissions and Womens Health. These, together with its existing ancillary services are also now made available through inpatient care. In the coming months, Makati Life will open its specialty centers and advanced programs, expanding the hospitals footprint in subspecialty care and complex case management. The MLMC model, recently named Integrated Healthcare Provider of the Year at the Healthcare Asia Awards 2025, provides a scalable blueprint for cities nationwide. Makati is only the beginning. My visionmy absolute commitmentis to see every Filipino family, regardless of where they live, accessing the same quality healthcare weve made possible here, Binay added. Since launching its 24/7 Outpatient Department in May 2023, Makati Life has seen over 300,000 patient visits from more than 46,000 unique patients in Makati. Yellow Card holders receive all MLMC services and medicine free of charge. These include: 24/7 primary care and emergency services; advanced diagnostics ; specialized clinics ; same-day laboratory results; preventive care including vaccinations and screenings; maternal and child health services; chronic disease management; minor surgical procedures; rehabilitation therapy; and telemedicine follow-ups. The hospital now offers expanded inpatient and specialized services like 24-hour emergency care, imaging services, elective and emergency surgical capabilities, and intensive care. The hospital ward has 72 beds available. Makati Life was also the first in the Philippines to acquire an AI-powered digital PET/CT scanner.

Sotto claps back: Fund rice subsidy for people or lose it to corruption?,"DAGUPAN CITY, PangasinanFormer Senate President Vicente Tito Sotto III has asked critics of the governments latest P20-per-kilogram rice initiative whether they want funds for this project to benefit people or go to the pockets of corrupt officials instead. During the press briefing at the CSI Stadia on Friday, Sotto and other senatorial candidates from the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas slate were asked about criticisms of the rice subsidy program,particularly from Vice President Sara Duterte, who said that the initiative is too late and reeks of electioneering. Theres a saying that its better late than never, right? And maybe they failed to figure this out immediately, said Sotto in mixture of Filipino and English. As I said earlier, there were concerns about the government shouldering subsidies for rice. So what? That should be the case, because thats taxpayers money, it should be consumed by the people also. READ: Romualdez: Govt can shift from cash aid to rice subsidies Instead of being given to the corrupt individuals, right?Where do they want the funds to go, to the pockets of corrupt officials? Let us give that subsidy to our people so that they would not go hungry and to reduce prices of goods, he added. When asked about Dutertes claim that the timing of the initiative, which will be initiated in Visayas,stems from the Alyansas supposed low numbers in the area, Sotto said he enjoys good support from Visayas since Cebu is his home province. I know Im strong in Visayas, Im from that area eh, Sotto said. Thats always the case, whatever timing it is, even if you announce that last year she will still say its connected to the elections. Thats how it is, you will never be able to please everyone. The important thing is you do what is right, and do it for the benefit of the people, whether its elections or not, he added. Sottos fellow Alyansa member and Makati Mayor Abby Binay also stressed that the government cannot tell the people to wait until the end of the elections for them to enjoy cheaper rice. The timing is suspicious? Will you tell the people that well just give this lower-priced rice after the elections, because they might accuse us of politicking. Thats not how the government works, Binay explained in Filipino. If you can give it now, do it. You cannot say that we will wait for a good timing, she added. According to Binay, it is never too late because President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. who promised to bring down rice prices to P20 per kilogram during the 2022 elections campaign season is just in his third year in office. I dont agree when we say its too late because the President has only been this is a mid-year, its only been three years so thats an accomplishment already that he was able to do something in the first three years of his administration, she said. You also have to remember that there are a lot of problems that are beyond the control of the President when it comes to inflation, when it comes to cost of electricity, cost of gas and diesel which are really beyond his control, and that is the reason why government has to step in with the subsidy, she added. Duterte in an ambush interview on Wednesday said that the administration is resorting to rice subsidies because they know that the Alyansa slate is performing bad in Visayas. You know that is just for the elections and for their senators who are part of their alliance to win, she said in Filipino. I dont know what their motive is. But yes, they are tricking the people with that P20 per kilo of rice. And you will be confused why Visayas only, arent the people from Luzon and Mindanao hungry also? [] Maybe they have problems with votes from Visayas, she added. Last Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. announced the availability of P20 per kilogram of rice in Visayas, adding that this development came after President Marcos held a closed-door meeting with governors from the Western Visayas, Central Visayas, and Eastern Visayas. READ: DA will start selling rice at P20 per kilo Tiu Laurel According to Laurel, the program will run until December but it may be extended until February 2026. Earlier, House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez also mentioned that the provincial government of Camiguin also successfully implemented a similar measure, where local government units , the Department of Social Welfare and Development , and local retailers partnered to make rice accessible sold at half of usual market prices. Under the DA program, the department in partnership with the Food Terminal Inc. and participating LGUs will shoulder the price difference between the market rate and the subsidized P20 per kilogram of rice.

2 resorts near Chocolate Hills still closed,"TAGBILARAN CITY Two mountain resorts built within the protected area of Bohols famous Chocolate Hills have remained closed to the public for over a year now. The Captains Peak Garden and Resort as well as the Sagbayan Peak, both located in Sagbayan town, ceased operations when the local government ordered its closure in March last year to protect the Chocolate Hills, the tourism signature of Bohol province and the countrys first geopark declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization . Captains Peak was left in a state of deterioration and disarray when the Inquirer visited the place on April 16. The resorts slides and cottages were dismantled while grasses and plants overshadowed the large swimming pool filled with rainwater. We were supposed to spend our vacation here, but its closed, said Nia, a resident of Cebu who begged off from revealing her family name, in an interview. She and her companions thought the resort had already reopened. But Nia said the resort, which was once swarmed by tourists especially during summer, looked horrible and creepy. Literally, it is abandoned, so we hurriedly left. No one is in there, she said. READ: DILG task force digs into how Chocolate Hills resort was built Another recreation center in the town, the Sagbayan Peak, also remained closed. A tarp placed at the entrance read Sagbayan Peak Resort is closed to all commercial activities due to non-compliance [with] requirements. Until further notice. Bud Agta, another tourist destination located in Carmen town, is still open to the public. However, it was limited only to an all-terrain vehicle ride. The staircase made of scaffolding and wood to get to the viewing deck at the top of the hill was demolished last year. Board Member Jamie Aumentado Villamor, chairman of the committee on tourism and environment of the Provincial Board, reiterated the need to protect the Chocolate Hills. More than taking pride as a prime tourist destination, the provincial government of Bohol is committed to protect the Chocolate Hills to ensure the preservation of biodiversity, prevention of environmental degradation, and sustaining the livelihoods that depend on tourism, she told the Inquirer via Messenger. Villamor said the Chocolate Hills are not only a geological treasure but a cultural icon and a vital driver of sustainable tourism, where the local economy also depends. With that, we are fully dedicated to strengthening the enforcement of environmental regulations, eco-friendly tourism practices, and investing in community education on conservation, she said. Villamor said the provincial government will also collaborate with scientists and local stakeholders for sustainable development, without forgetting the needs and interests of the Boholanos for livelihood and opportunities. Bohol recorded 1.3 million visitors last year, with the Chocolate Hills as the provinces most popular tourist destination. Given its popularity, large crowds are expected, especially during the dry season. A geological wonder, the 1,776 hills look like chocolates during summer. These hills spread over the towns of Sagbayan, Batuan, Carmen, Bilar, Sierra Bullones, Catigbian and Valencia. According to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources , the hills were named and protected under the Expanded National Integrated Areas Protected System Act or Republic Act 7586, as amended by Republic Act No. 11038. The Chocolate Hills were declared a national geological monument in the country on June 18, 1988. Declared as a protected area in 1997 by then president Fidel Ramos, the Chocolate Hills natural monument is considered one of the World Heritage Sites by Unesco. It is also the first and only Unesco geopark in the Philippines. Several establishments were earlier constructed at the protected area to accommodate tourists who would like to see the thousand hills. According to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources , a total of 558 establishments within the Chocolate Hills, most of which were sari-sari stores, were operating without the proper permits. Captains Peaks operations were closed because it was built within a protected area and for operating without an environmental compliance certificate. The resort was granted a business, building, and locational permit by the mayor for the years 2020 to 2024 despite repeated failures in obtaining permits and clearances from the DENR. The resort was closed on March 14, 2024, after its business permit was revoked by the local government. This action was taken due to concerns about its operation within a protected area and for violating environmental regulations. At the height of the controversies, the local government of Sagbayan also closed the Sagbayan Peak last year. Bohol Gov. Erico Aristotle Aumentado and 68 other officials were earlier ordered suspended by the Office of the Ombudsman for six months due to the illegal construction of Captains Peak. But Aumentados suspension was cut short to two months after the anti-graft office found out that the governor was unaware of the development of Captains Peak.

Operations continue in Negros Occidental town to contain molasses spill,"BACOLOD CITY Cleanup operations continued Wednesday, April 23, in Binalbagan, Negros Occidental, as the local government worked to contain and rehabilitate the Binalbagan River after a molasses spill from a local sugar mill. Mayor Alejandro Mirasol said the main priority now is cleaning and rehabilitating the river after the April 19 spill from the Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Co. affected at least four barangays: Canmoros, Progreso, Marina, and San Juan.

School ordered to pay damages for failing to address bullying case,"MANILA, Philippines The Supreme Court has ordered a school to pay P650,000 in damages and attorneys fees for its failure to address a bullying incident during class eight years ago. By failing to address the harm committed by one student against another and by negligently handling the punching incident after it had already happened, Mother Goose School failed to exercise the diligence of a good father of the family in providing a safe learning environment to its students, the Supreme Court said in a decision written by Associate Justice Mario V. Lopez. The incident happened during a computer class when an argument about a mechanical pencil led to two students repeatedly punching a classmate while the teacher was in the comfort room. READ: DepEd probes alleged student bullying in Quezon City Despite reporting the incident, no action was taken, prompting the parents to raise the matter to the schools administration. However, the school concluded that the incident was mere teasing or rough play and took no disciplinary action. The victims parents then filed a complaint for damages against the school, teachers, and other students parents. The Regional Trial Court ruled that both the school and the teacher-in-charge were both liable stressing their duty of protecting the students during school hours. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower courts ruling but cleared the teacher who was not in the classroom when the incident occurred. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals ruling stating that the school was negligent for its lack of proper protocols, failure to inform the victims parents promptly, and inaccuracies in its investigation. Notably, every parent who entrusts their child to a learning institution does so with the assurance that the school, owing to its obligation not only to provide but also to maintain a safe learning environment, will protect the child from harm or will promptly address similar incidents after its occurrence, the Supreme Court said. The Court also recognized the incident as bullying in its general sense and not as defined under the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, which was not yet in effect at the time.

VP Dutertes optimism puzzles solon: You cant even explain spent funds,"MANILA, Philippines Tingog party-list Rep. Jude Acidre is puzzled over Vice President Sara Dutertes confidence in the face of an impending impeachment trial, because she cannot even explain where chunks of confidential funds within her offices went. Acidre in a statement on Tuesday said that Dutertes confidence may be misplaced because months after the House of Representatives committee on good government and public accounts started its investigation on the CFs, the Vice President has not yet given any clear explanation. Furthermore, the lawmaker reminded Duterte that she cannot claim vindication if she has not addressed the issues yet. Whats puzzling is the arrogance of certainty coming from the Vice President, Acidre said. You cannot claim vindication when you have yet to offer a full and truthful accounting of public funds entrusted to your office. Public officials are stewards of taxpayer money. When questioned, the proper response is transparency, not evasion. Its not enough to say I did my job. She must show us how, when and where those millions were spent, he added. Acidres remarks came after Duterte, in an ambush interview on Tuesday, said that her lawyers are confident that she will win her impeachment trial before the Senate and be acquitted of the impeachment charges pressed by the House. Duterte made the pronouncement when asked about her recent endorsement of senatorial candidates, which led to speculation that it was an attempt to build alliances with possible senator-judges. According to Duterte, she is confident about the abilities of her lawyers. Ang aking impeachment, sinasabi ng mga lawyer, they are more than confident na mananalo sila sa impeachment, Duterte said in a chance interview in Cebu. Ako naman , I am most confident with the lawyers working on my impeachment case, she added. READ: Sara Duterte says lawyers confident shell win impeachment case But Acidre said it appears Duterte still treats the issues raised against her as a political drama. The Vice President continues to treat this as a political drama. But for the people who pay their taxes every day, this is about accountability and trust, he said. If she truly believes in the strength of her case, then she should welcome the trial as an opportunity to lay all her cards on the table. But right now, were hearing a lot of posturing and very little substance, he added. Dutertewasimpeachedby the House last February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourthimpeachmentcomplaint.The articles ofimpeachmentwere immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trialto start forthwith if at least one-thirds of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate Under the Constitution, the Senate will act as animpeachmentcourt with sitting senators being judges. Trial however has yet to start as the articles ofimpeachmentwere not forwarded to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5 which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. Dutertes impeachment was largely brought about by the House committee hearings, where allegations of CF misuse within the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education were revealed. At one point in the hearings, Antipolo City 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop noticed that one of the acknowledgement receipts for the OVPs CF expenditures was signed by a certain Mary Grace Piattos, whom he said bears a name similar to a restaurant and a potato chip brand. ARs are proof of payment, or that funding for projects reached its intended beneficiaries and for the case of OVP and DepEd, these are informants who provided confidential information to authorities. Later on, Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong showed two ARs one for OVP and another for DepEd which were both received by Villamin.However, the signatures and handwriting used by theVillamin in the two documentsdiffered. Both Piattos and Villamins names did not appear on the Philippine Statistics Authority database. READ: House probe: OVP, DepEd CFs received by same man, different signatures Acidre said that while Duterte has the right to defend herself, the burden to disprove the findings of the House committee now rests on her. The impeachment complaint did not materialize in a vacuum. It came after exhaustive hearings, testimonies and evidence pointing to clear irregularities, Acidre said. This is not a popularity contest: it is a constitutional process grounded in facts, he added. Hindi sapat ang tapang sa salita. Ang kailangan ng taong-bayan ay tapang na magsabi ng totoo at magpaliwanag. Hindi nga niya maipaliwanag nang maayos kung saan napunta ang pondo.

BOC cracks down vs P3.26B illicit vape shipments in major sweep,"The Bureau of Customs has launched a major operation to destroy approximately P3.26 billion worth of seized illicit vape products, reinforcing its commitment to combat smuggling and protect public health. MANILA, Philippines Following President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s directive, the BOC began large-scale condemnation on April 7, 2025, targeting unauthorized and unsafe vape items at waste facilities in Bulacan. This initiative, driven by the Manila International Container Port and Port of Manila, underscores governments focus on curbing illicit trade while prioritizing consumer safety and regulatory compliance. Since the ceremonial condemnation led by President Marcos, the BOC has destroyed over one million vape products deemed unfit for public use or lacking proper clearances. The operations, conducted at RCU Waste Collection Services in Marilao and Barba Waste Management in Bocaue, are overseen by the Auction and Cargo Disposal Division, the Enforcement and Security Service, and the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service.

Pope Francis in PH: Things to remember,"MANILA, PhilippinesI felt that I had to be here. This was Pope Francis in 2015, expressing his love to thousands of Filipinos hit by a typhoon that killed over 6,300 people and left damage worth P571 billion. He had said in a Mass in Tacloban City, considered as ground zero of Supetyphoon Yolanda which unleashed a seven-feet high storm surge, that when I saw from Rome that disaster [] I decided to come here. READ: Oh, what a beautiful mornin but storm Amang cuts trip short A little bit late, I have to say, but Im here, he told 200,000 to 500,000 people drenched in rain, as no one left. They all wanted to see Pope Francis. It was all worth it the Vicar of Christ consoled them, saying that we have a Lord who is able to weep with us, who can be at our side through lifes most difficult moments. READ: Pope Francis in PH: A look back at his 2015 trip to Manila, Leyte Ill be with you silently, with my heart, he said. Pope Francis visit to the province of Leyte, and in the Philippines, was indeed a sparkle of hope. As Archbishop Socrates Villegas of Lingayen-Dagupan said, we knew that in him, Jesus was in our midst. READ: At lunch with survivors, Pope reduced to silence He left for Rome on Jan. 19, ending his five-day pastoral visit that was concluded with a Mass at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila, which was attended by six to seven million people a crowd that would later be regarded as the largest in history. But theres a lot more to remember about his stay in the Philippines 10 years ago, such as the food prepared for him and the vehicles he rode to traverse the streets of the metropolis and the province of Leyte. A Filipino chef, Jessie Sincioco, was chosen to serve Pope Francis throughout his stay at the Apostolic Nunciature, and has prepared four different menus for the four meals that he had at the residence. One of the dishes prepared for him was the Chicken Chimichuri, which reminded him of home, or Argentina, and the Philippines. A special ube was likewise served as his dessert. He liked everything, Sincioco said. Interestingly, when Pope Francis visited the United States the same year, a Filipino-American executive chef of the White House, Cristeta Comerford, served him food, too. The altar where Pope Francis celebrated Mass at the Quirino Grandstand a day before he left the Philippines for Rome was not decked with blooms but with San Francisco and Pandan plants that are a mainstay in rural backyards. READ: Pope Francis: Around PH without leaving Luneta altar Rev. Fr. Alex Bautista, who designed the papal chair, said in the design consideration [] the concept is to serve the liturgical purpose and to have Filipino character and reflect the simplicity of the Vicar of Christ. For his five-day stay in the Philippines, three popemobiles have been prepared: one for Manila, one for Tacloban City, and one backup vehicle. Throughout his travels in Manila, Pope Francis rode a white converted single cab vehicle, except when he used a Volkswagen Touran for his state visit to Malacaang as the head of the Vatican City. READ: Why Pope Francis didnt ride popemobile on the way to Malacaang The vehicle he used in Tacloban City was the same one he rode when he went to South Korea in 2014 for the celebration of the World Youth Day. Pope Francis took a jeepney ride at the Rizal Park when he said Mass before millions of people who gathered for the second to the last day of his pastoral visit. READ: Jeepney popemobile drives to history The vehicle was built on a brand-new jeepney chassis, converted to a secure platform to give the faithful a good view of the Pope. Pope Francis, then 78 years old, exhibited his lighter side as he responded to the bishops, priests, and religious men and women who answered yes to the first words of his homily. Celebrating his first Mass in the Philippines, the Pope started his homily at the Manila Cathedral by saying do you love me? The people immediately answered and said yes. Pope Francis laughed and said thank you very much, but eventually explained that he was actually reading the word of Jesus, as stated in the Gospel of John: Do you love me? [] Tend my sheep.

"Online sexual abuse of kids rising; better rescue, rehab measures pushed","MANILA, Philippines The reported cases of online sexual abuse and exploitation of children rose to more than 2.7 million since 2019, according to the Commission on Human Rights , which called for stronger protection and rehabilitation measures. This was based on their Child Rights Center report published on February 11, the CHR said in a press release on Tuesday READ: Pope Franciss thorniest challenge: clerical sex abuse In 2019, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children recorded 426,000 cyber tipline reports. This figure nearly tripled in 2020 to 1,297,000 cases and continued to escalate in 2023, with 2,740,905 reported incidents, it said, citing the report. The rise in cases was mainly attributed to poverty, with many incidents involving family members as perpetrators. The CHR noted that the trauma caused by abuse made worse by fear, shame, and stressful legal processes often prevents child victims from asking for help or seeking justice. Despite local and international measures meant to protect children from such abuses, it said significant challenges persist in the reporting of cases and in rehabilitation and reintegration efforts for victims. This prompted the CHR to press the government for stronger child protection and rehabilitation measures. The CHR calls on the government and all concerned institutions to uphold the principle of the best interests of the child as a paramount consideration in all proceedings involving children, the CHR said. Rescue and rehabilitation efforts must adopt a child-sensitive and trauma-informed approach, ensuring sufficient resources for psychosocial recovery and long-term support, it also suggested. The CHR also wants appropriate psychological and financial interventions, not only for the victims but also for family members who might have committed abuse to break cycles of exploitation. To prevent re-traumatization during legal proceedings, the CHR also recommends the use of pre-recorded testimonies in place of repeated in-person recounting of abuse, it said. READ: Trust a factor: More women than men convicted for child abuse since 2019 The CHR also recommended a boost in the ongoing OSAEC awareness campaigns, poverty and livelihood programs, stronger ties with internet providers to stop online abuse, and more community activities for children.

Former OP staff attests how Popes mere gaze calmed troubled souls,"MANILA, Philippines It is not uncommon for people to feel shy or to just retreat into a cocoon after having the chance to meet well-known people, like celebrities or politicians who have larger-than-life personalities. Some may even feel unworthy of their idols attention. This was what Katherine Adraneda, a former officer at the Office of the President, felt when she had the chance to meet Pope Francis, as she was part of the team preparing for the pontiffs visit to the Philippines in 2015. May parating na bagyo non, but the Pope decided na itutuloy niya, so as part of the National Secretariat, minabuti ng boss namin na pumunta kami don ahead, parang advance, to check yong dadaanan ni Pope, yong lahat ng mga pupuntahan niya, dahil nga may paparating na bagyo [] but yong pinunta ko don is work, hindi ko naman naisip na magkakaron ng chance, she said. READ: Pope Francis was guiding light for Filipinos after YolandaRomualdez But you know, habang nandon ka, parang iniisip mo, mami-meet mo ba, may chance ba, kasi minsan mafi-feel mo parang hindi ka worthy kasi you know, marami tayong may nagagawang . But nagkataon na kung saan kami nag-aabang, doon siya dumaan, she added. However, Adraneda said Francis never made her feel unworthyeven if she thought she was. Instead, what she felt was a sense of peace after looking into the Popes eyes. So na-realize ko, well, siguro, ito yon, napagbigyan kami and siyempre yong opportunity na yon hindi mo malilimutan kasi very humbling siya parang sometimes na feeling mo unworthy, but meron ka pa ring chance na ito yon, humingi ka ng tawad, isipin yong mga bagay [] Surreal pero very humbling talaga, she said. Sobra-sobrang overwhelming [] hindi ka talaga makakapaniwala, so nanginginig ka pa, malamig yong kamay mo pero kapag nakatingin ka sa kanya, pag nag-eye to eye, parang may sense of peace, hindi ko rin ma-explain. Parang in a way kakalma ka, she added. Adraneda also believes that this meeting with Francis had a lasting and immediate impact on her life, as she was inside the second plane that was supposed to fly after the one carrying the Pope left Tacloban, Leyte. READ: Pope Francis consoled him in his grief, now he mourns his passing Instead of following the Popes plane, the aircraft carrying Adraneda and other officials of the Aquino administration faced problems while taking off and skidded through the runway. Dahil ang sama ng panahon so ang naging usapan, okay, dahil pasama nang pasama ang panahon, paunahing mag-take off yong plane ni Pope papuntang Manila. So nauna si Pope and then sumunod yong sa amin. Pero [] nag-take off kami nang kaunti pero sumabog yong gulong and yon na yong aksidente na nangyari, so pa-ikot ikot kami, akala ko katapusan ko na dahil nakikita ko na yong dagat eh, she said. Feeling ko don na kami papunta, so lahat nagdadasal. So I think yon yung test din nong faith, so lahat lang kami nagdasal, humingi ng kapatawaran and all. Tapos biglang huminto yong plane, and then buhay kaming lahat, walang major na nasaktan, but of course may mga pasa-pasa. Pwede kong masabi na second life eh, she noted. Catholics from around the world are mourning Francis death, which came just a day after he participated in the Easter Sunday Mass at the Vatican. Tributes also poured in, including from Filipinos who thanked the late pontiff for standing with the country, particularly Eastern Visayas, which was still reeling at that time from the effects of Super Typhoon Yolanda. Yolanda barreled through the country, leaving extensive damage over Eastern Visayas in 2013, a few months after Francis took over the papacy. Earlier, Filipino priest Francis Lucas recalled the popes humility, as he still asked for prayers even if he was already the highest official in the Roman Catholic Church.

It was agreed that only his lawyers will speak on any developments in the case, she added. It was not immediately clear if Sara met with any local officials during her visit to the province.

7 cops linked to Kerwin Espinosa shooting to face administrative raps,"TACLOBAN CITY Administrative charges are being prepared against the seven police officers considered persons of interest in the April 10 shooting of confessed drug lord and mayoral candidate Rolan Kerwin Espinosa. Colonel Dionisio Apas Jr., Leyte provincial police director, said he expected the administrative charges to be resolved sooner than the criminal cases. During our command conference, it was emphasized that administrative charges must also be filed against them, and if found guilty, they should be dismissed from service, he said in an interview. We anticipate that once the administrative proceedings are in motion, they will move faster than the criminal complaints, he added. The Leyte police filed on April 14 charges of illegal possession of firearms and violation of the Commission on Elections gun ban against the seven police officers before the Leyte Provincial Prosecutors Office. This came after nine of the 14 firearms surrendered by the arrested police officers, who were just about 200 meters away from the crime scene when the shooting happened, were found unregistered and lacked proper documentation. But paraffin tests conducted on the seven police officers showed no traces of gunpowder on their hands. Apas stressed that the cases they filed against the respondents were just initial as investigators continued to pursue leads for the possible filing of frustrated murder complaints against the seven police officers. These police officers were inside a private compound in Barangay Tinag-an, Albuera town, Leyte to reportedly serve an arrest warrant against a certain individual on April 10the same day Espinosa was shot and wounded. It was still unclear if the seven police officers, who were under restrictive custody at the Philippine National Police-Eastern Visayas regional headquarters in Palo town, Leyte, had a hand in the shooting of Espinosa. Apas said the investigators were careful in preparing the cases so that the prosecutors or judges would not dismiss them for lack of evidence. There must be certainty of conviction, he said, stressing that complete and credible evidence should back any case. Apas called on the Espinosa camp to cooperate by presenting any witnesses who could help prove that the seven police officers had something to do with the shooting, which also injured the sister of the mayoral candidate and running mate, Mariel Espinosa Marinay, and a daughter of one of their candidates for councilor. If they have witnesses, they should send them to us so we can resolve this incident early, he said. Apas said they had yet to determine the motive behind the attempt on Espinosas life. We are looking into several possible motives. As of now, we cannot establish or ascertain a particular motive, he said. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

"Benhur Abalos reflects on loss, love, and enduring faith","MANILA, Philippines This Easter, Benjamin Benhur Abalos Jr. reflects on the pain of loss, the power of love, and a faith that continues to lead him forward. Abalos looked back on the silence that surrounded him in the hospital room where his daughter lay unconscious in 2005 and the kind of silence that enveloped his familys home in 2021, when they learned that their beloved mother, Corazon Abalos, had died alone in a hospital bed, in the middle of a pandemic. These two moments, years apart, left a permanent hole in his heart and changed everything. Walang mas matindi kaysa sa mailibing mo ang sarili mong anak, Abalos said. And to lose your mother without even saying goodbyeits a grief you carry in silence. READ: Corazon Abalos, wife of ex-Comelec chairman Benjamin Abalos, dies Its the children who bury their parents and not the other way around. Dapat mas mahaba ang buhay ng mga bata [The young ones should live longer], he said. He prayed for a miracle. But when it did not come, he surrendered everything to God. Ang dasal ko noon ay simple lang, he recalled. Panginoon, ako na lang po. Pero natutunan ko rinkahit anong gawin mo, may mga bagay talagang ang Diyos lang ang nakakaalam. For a grieving parent, the pain never truly ends. There are moments of denial, anger, and deep longingand often, questions that have no answers. You begin to ask: Will I ever see my daughter again? Where is she now? Makikita ko pa ba ang anak ko? Nasaan na siya? Nawawala ba siya? Makikilala pa ba niya ako kung magkita kami? Masaya ba siya ngayon? Abalos recalled. Just thinking about those questions is enough to break you all over again, he added. Faith is what gives him strength, according to Abalos. And when I see others go through the same loss, I assume theyre asking the same silent questions. Thats when we need to reach out and connect with the grieving. Years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, his family lost their matriarch, Cora Abalos. Abalosthen serving as MMDA chair and leading the governments vaccination rollout in Metro Manilafaced the same heartbreaking reality endured by thousands of Filipino families during the pandemic: they could not be with their loved ones in their final moments. Hindi ko man lang siya nayakap. Hindi namin siya naihatid. Wala kaming pagkakataon na magpaalam, Abalos recalled. Isa ito sa pinakamabigat na naramdaman ko bilang anak. Napakahirap, he said. Hindi mo siya mahawakan. Hindi mo siya mayakap. Wala kang magawa kundi umiyak sa harap ng telepono. Abalos finds solace in the time he was able to spend with her mother before she passed. Before she died, I made sure to be with my mother and my father as much as I could, he said. Whenever I traveledwhether out of town or abroadI brought them along. Im grateful for those years. But the truth is, kahit gaano ka pala kahanda, kahit sineguro ko na kasama ko sila sa kanilang pagtanda, losing a parent still breaks you. Abalos thus has an advice to all the sons and daughters: Habang naririyan pa ang mga magulang nyo, dapat ipadama na natin ang pagmamahal at pasasalamat, he said. Huwag nating ipagpaliban. Ang mamaya na ay maaaring huli na. For Abalos, in those moments, only two things held him together: his faith, and his family. Tinanggap ko na. Sa huli, ang kalooban pa rin ng Diyos ang masusunod. Doon ko nakita na sa gitna ng matinding sakit, may pagkakataon pa ring lumalim ang pananampalataya. After everything he had been through, he found himself asking a question that many people ask during times of loss. What, then, is the purpose of life? he asked. For him, the answer is simple. READ: Abalos urges DPWH to construct motorcycle and bicycle lay-bys nationwide Its not about money or power. Its about taking caring of your family and others. What truly matters are the people we love and the lives weve touched. More than anything, life is about making a difference every single day.

In a 50-page ruling, the CA Second Division affirmed the lower courts decision convicting PO1 Jefrey Perez of planting drugs and a gun on Carl Arnaiz. Perez received three life imprisonment sentences. READ: Caloocan cop found guilty for drug war deaths of two teens Nineteen-year-old Arnaiz, a student at the University of the Philippines Diliman, and 14-year-old de Guzman were neighbors in Cainta, Rizal. On the evening of Aug. 18, 2017, they went out for a snack and disappeared. Arnaizs body was found at a funeral home in Caloocan 10 days later, while de Guzmans body was discovered in a creek in Nueva Ecija on September 6, 2017. He had sustained 25 stab wounds. The CA lamented the loss of the two teenagers lives, saying: The cases of Carl and Kulot highlight the harsh reality of police misconductwhere those meant to safeguard us become abusers. Kulot, a minor, and Carl, a promising young man, lost their futures due to a system that permits torture, murders, and the fraudulent planting of evidence, it also said. It also emphasized that achieving justice requires not just punishing offenders, but eradicating the culture of impunity that enables these violations. The heartbreaking losses of their lives should act as a rallying cry for reforming law enforcement, enhancing judicial oversight, and ensuring that no further lives are claimed by those who are meant to protect, the CA also said.

"Pope always asked people to pray for him, Filipino priest recalls","MANILA, Philippines Catholics from all over the world flock to popes official apostolic trips, with the belief that having a pontiff intercede for someones requests to Godwhether it be for physical and spiritual healing, fortune, personal successwould be the strongest prayer one can make. People see popes to ask for guidance, not to hand out prayers for an already holy man. But Pope Francis, while he was here in the Philippines in 2015, asked people to pray for himbaffling many Filipinos, according to Catholic priest Francis Lucas. READ: Pope Francis has died aged 88 Vatican What many people did not know, Lucas said, was that Francis, whose visit to the Philippines came less than two years after he assumed papacy, was on the verge of making many radical changes within the Roman Catholic Church. I remember in my interviews when the Pope left from the Philippines, one of the things he always said, and ended in his speeches is, please pray for me. And I was asked why he kept on saying that, Lucas, president of the Catholic Media Network, said in an interview with INQ Today on Monday, after the Popes death. Because there were a lot of changes [] when the Pope visited us. But you know, we are so forgetful that the changes might just be blown by the wind, he said. Lucas said Francis showed extraordinary strength and courage as he was not afraid to visit Leytewhich was battered by Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013despite another storm looming and bringing strong winds and heavy rains. But if we keep on praying for the Pope and what he showed us, his mettle, when he went to Taclobanimagine a pope wearing a kapote, and taking the risk, amid another very strong and rainy storm, Lucas said. In fact the second plane that accompanied him almost did not make it. But he was there. He was blessed by God. Why? Because simply he was stouthearted, to take time to really be with the people, with the people who are suffering from the disaster, he added. READ: Pope Francis consoled him in his grief, now he mourns his passing The Filipino priest also believes God sent Francis to prepare the world, as his papacy coincided with different conflicts and economic woesnoting that Francis was present when the world most needed a voice of reason. Well, the way I see it, he must be a preparation for all of us, before the violent things that happened in the world. And he even said before that we have to continuously love, love one another. Because he said thats the only solution that Christ showed us, love, Lucas explained. And he always mentioned the poor, the oppressed, the injustice that is happening in the world today. And he visited, I think he had something like 47 apostolic visits all over the world. And he was so humble, he showed him humility. The first act that he did was he did not even wear the fancy shoes of a pope, out of respect that we gave the Pope, the special shoes. He just wore his own shoes, he added. Tributes from all around the world poured in after Pope Francis died at the Vatican City on Monday morningjust a day after his anticipated return to celebrate Easter Sunday with the Catholic faithful in St. Peters Basilica.

Local Korean community pays tribute to shooting victim in Angeles City,"ANGELES CITY South Korean consulate officials and members of the Korean community gathered to pay their respects to a fellow Korean national who was fatally shot during a robbery on April 20 in broad daylight in Barangay Anunas. South Korean Consul General Sang Seun-man led the solemn tribute on Tuesday at the site where Kim Il Dong, a Korean tourist, was gunned down by one of two motorcycle-riding suspects. Flowers, candles, and fruits were offered and laid in the victims memory. A message addressed to the assailant was left on a signboard at the scene: The bullet you fired didnt just take a life. It shattered a familys future. He didnt resist. Police reports show the incident occurred around 1:50 a.m. along Fil-Am Friendship Highway in the Korean Town area. Two unidentified men on a motorcycle approached Kim, and the back rider attempted to snatch his bag. When Kim resisted, he was shot in the torso. The assailants fled immediately after the shooting. Both suspects were reportedly wearing jackets, reflectorized vests, pants, and helmets. Kim was rushed to a nearby hospital but was declared dead on arrival. In response, the Korean Community Association of Angeles City offered a P200,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of the suspects, according to a statement released by the city government on Monday, April 21. Mayor Carmelo Lazatin Jr. has given the local police 72 hours to solve the case. The city government is urging residents to come forward with any relevant information.

Lawmaker slams DOTr chief for lack of talks on Roxas City Airport plan,"MANILA, Philippines Pinuno Rep. Ivan Howard Guintu on Monday criticized Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon for his alleged failure to consult stakeholders concerning the redevelopment of Roxas City Airport in the province of Capiz. In a statement, Guintu welcomed the renewed pledge of support Dizon made for the redevelopment of the Roxas City Airport in Capiz, Panay, however, the lawmaker also pointed out that Dizon failed to actually consult him and other stakeholders regarding the project. Guintu pointed out that he has been an open advocate for the project, raising concerns about the airport and how it has never received any major upgrade since its construction almost 70 years ago. READ: Lawmaker wants two major transport hubs in Roxas City renovated Why Secretary Dizon failed to at least give due course to calls and representations made by Congressman Guintu to the DOTr relative to this important advocacy remains a puzzle to the partylist representative, his office said. Unless, it is the intention of the good Secretary to disregard the efforts of a sitting member of the House of Representatives and discount Congressman Guintus efforts to assist the DOTr in improving the facilities of an airport under its care, which is hoped to be not, it added. Guintu then noted that he understands the complexity of Dizons job as cabinet secretary, but insisted that the official should still be thorough in his inspections, conducting proper consultations involving all stakeholders. It is expected that this lightning of a visit by Secretary Dizon to the airport should not in any way define his commitment to redevelop the facility and disappear as quick as the sound of thunder, Guintus office said. More importantly, it should not be a propaganda to promote a person who for the longest time has not hinted at any concern on the development of the airport until this visit by the Transportation Secretary, it added.

Solon to new BFP head: Ensure personnel get advanced training,"MANILA, Philippines The new chief of the Bureau of Fire Protection must ensure that officers and staffers within their ranks get advanced training so that they can respond to different situations, Bicol Saro party-list Rep. Brian Raymund Yamsuan said. Yamsuan in a statement said this after the Department of the Interior and Local Government announced that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has appointed Jesus Piedad Fernandez as the new BFP chief. According to Yamsuan, it is not enough that BFP personnel get the adequate protective gear and equipment, as all of these advancements will be for naught if they cannot properly use them. READ: Marcos appoints new BFP chief As we welcome the appointment of BFP Director Jesus Fernandez, we are also optimistic that under his leadership, the agency would be able to boost its modernization efforts, starting with providing each city and municipality with modern firetrucks and our firefighters with adequate protective equipment, Yamsuan, a former DILG assistant secretary, said on Monday. Fulfilling these goals should be complemented by continuous advanced training programs for BFP personnel to enable them to effectively carry out their responsibilities not only as firefighters but also as first responders during disasters and other emergencies, he added. Having the personnel equipped with new skills should be part of BFPs modernization program, the lawmaker noted. Ensuring that the emergency response capabilities of our fire personnel are on par with international standards should form part of the BFPs modernization program, Yamsuan said. In a statement last Thursday, the DILG said Fernandez was designated to the post last April 11 and will lead the modernization efforts of the BFP. Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla previously assigned Fernandez to be BFPs officer-in-charge, after the mandatory retirement of former Fire Chief Louie Puracan last December 2024. Fernandez used to be BFPs director for logistics in 2016, before assuming the role of director for comptrollership a year after. Yamsuan hopes the BFP can coordinate with lawmakers on how to improve their services, like in discussing bills. One bill that the BFP can provide inputs, the lawmaker said, is a proposal to require at least one BFP personnel per fire station to be certified medical first responders and emergency medical technicians. Yamsuan said under House Bill No. 6512, BFP regional directors will be required to designate the medical first responder in every fire station.

Senate panel shows undersea drones found off PH coast,"MANILA, Philippines The Senate panel on maritime and admiralty zones presented the actual submersible drones and a buoy found by Filipino fishermen off the Philippine coast at a public hearing on Wednesday. At the hearing presided by panel chair Sen. Francis Tolentino, Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad, Navy spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, discussed the undersea drones discovered ashore by Filipino fishermen. The first was a yellow submersible drone labelled HY 119 that was found off the coast of Ilocos Norte, Zambales, Cagayan, Misamis Oriental, and Masbate. Yung yellow drone is designed to collect data [such as] depth of water, salinity, and oxygen content, said Trinidad. The other one is a military-grade drone discovered in Sabtang, Batanes. Yung black [one] has the same capability, but it also has a sensor that can take up sound, how it propagates, and travels underwater. Sound propagation is very critical when it comes to undersea water pero lahat ng mga nakukuhang information ng mga drone na ito have different uses, Trinidad explained. Pwede itong commercial, pwedeng academic, pwedeng scientific research at pwede ring military use. Ang sinasabi this is purely for military ibat ibang gamit ng information, kasama doon sa kanyang gamit ang military purposes, he added. According to Trinidad, the military-grade submersible has a China telecom subscriber identity module, which means that the equipment can send a signal to China. We are just saying the results of the forensic examination points to China. Ang sinasabi namin based sa forensic examination, nagbato siya ng signal sa China, said Trinidad.

Propelling the ESG agenda across Asia,"SINCE its establishment, the Asia ESG Positive Impact Consortium has been dedicated to fostering ESG knowledge-sharing, industry collaboration and meaningful engagement across the region. Over the past year, its consortium members, which consist of media powerhousesStar Media Group , KG Media and the Inquirer Group of Companies have been building a strong foundation by rolling out national-level ESG initiatives tailored to their respective markets. Each country has seen the introduction of programmes aimed at raising awareness on ESG issues and driving corporate sustainability efforts, further highlighting the influence of media in shaping public discussions on such matters. In August 2024, the second edition of the ESG Positive Impact Awards honoured Malaysian winners for embedding environmental, social and governance values into their business strategiesdemonstrating that profitability and purpose can go hand-in-hand. The increased participationsubmissions rose by 38%reflected growing momentum and a broader shift toward responsible business. Star Media Group then hosted its inaugural ESG Summit in November, convening industry leaders, investors and regulators to explore real-world solutions and innovation under the theme Shaping Aseans Sustainable Future. From policy to technology, the summit examined how practical tools are being deployed to future-proof organisations across the region. Beyond the main events, targeted platforms such as the ESG PIA Winners Showcase enabled meaningful dialogue between finalists and ESG leaders, further encouraging knowledge-sharing around regulatory shifts, long-term value creation and implementation challenges. To further strengthen ESG capabilities, the ESG Reporting and Carbon Management Workshop 2024held in March last yeardelivered hands-on training for businesses navigating reporting standards, emissions tracking and carbon management strategies, equipping participants with the tools to meet rising expectations in a data-driven landscape. In Indonesia, KG Media activated its Lestari platform to spearhead national-level conversations on sustainability. In June 2024, the Lestari Forum gathered leaders from government, business, investment, academia and civil society to address urgent environmental and social challenges, while fostering dialogue on corporate responsibility and ESG integration. This was followed by the Lestari Summit in August, which expanded the conversation under the theme Fostering Sustainability Through Inclusivity in Policy & Practices. The event explored a wide range of critical topicsfrom empowering local changemakers and unlocking financing for green industries to rethinking how policies shape sustainable outcomes. The summit culminated in the inaugural Lestari Awards 2024, celebrating companies and public sector institutions demonstrating leadership, innovation and measurable impact in advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals . Meanwhile in the Philippines, Inquirer Group of Companies has continued to grow its ESG Edge initiative, using its media platforms to highlight ESG stories, facilitate discussions and spotlight programmes aligned with its readers values. Its commitment was formalised in March 2024 through a Memorandum of Understanding signed with 11 cross-sectoral partners from business, education, environment and civil societyestablishing a shared pledge to champion best practices, promote corporate accountability and enhance community engagement on ESG matters. The engagements expanded further in September with the launch of the ESG Edge Connect Networka quarterly forum series convened to foster collaborative conversations around thematic priorities. Past sessions have addressed key issues such as quality education and gender equality, as well as hybrid energy adoption, which was explored in a session held in November 2024. Each session offers a platform for stakeholders to explore actionable strategies and co-create solutions for a more resilient and inclusive future. Each country brings unique challenges and opportunities in the sustainability landscape, and it is through these localised efforts that the true impact of ESG principles is realised, said Inquirer Group of Companies president and chief executive officer Rudyard Arbolado. In the Philippines, we focus on fostering strong networks that enable collaboration between businesses and local communities. In Indonesia, KG Medias efforts have demonstrated how media can elevate sustainable practices within industries. Meanwhile, Malaysias initiatives through Star Media Group have underscored the importance of integrating sustainability into national-level dialogues. These local engagements serve as building blocks to a stronger regional network, where shared knowledge and collective action drive the sustainability agenda forward. This is where A-EPICs success liesby creating a platform that connects local initiatives, amplifies their impact and propels the ESG movement regionally. Building on this momentum, A-EPIC is now entering its next phase of growth.This year, the consortium will scale up its impact by deepening local engagements and expanding its regional footprint. > Star Media Group : ESG Positive Impact Awards 2024, ESG Positive Impact Awards 2024 Winners Showcase, ESG Positive Impact Awards 2024 Power Breakfast > KG Media: Lestari Awards 2025, Lestari Summit 2025, Lestari Forums > Inquirer Group of Companies: The Inquirer ESG Edge Impact Awards 2025, ESG Connect Network: Sustainable Ecosystems, ESG Connect Network: Good Health and Wellbeing, ESG Connect Network: Talent Management and ESG Connect Network: DEI KG Media chief executive officer Andy Budiman said, A-EPICs role is to provide a powerful, regional platform that brings together diverse industries to collaborate on the future of sustainability.

Cease and desist order ignored: Surigao mining operations resume under cover,"SURIGAO CITYSuspended illegal mining operations in Barangays Mat-i and Mabini have quietly resumed, shocking residents and igniting fresh outrage in communities already burdened by environmental damage and government inaction. Just months ago, these operations sparked widespread condemnation as rivers turned murky, homes and livelihoods were endangered, and over 1,300 residents signed a petition demanding immediate action. Following intense scrutiny by local and national media, investigations by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Mines and Geosciences Bureau uncovered illegal practices and serious safety violations incurred by Chinese operators, resulting in a cease-and-desist order and a dramatic police raid that temporarily halted the operations. Yet today, residents and local officials watch in disbelief and frustration as excavation quietly resumeshidden behind tarps, shielded by darkness, and seemingly immune to accountability. A recent inspection led by Provincial Board Members Jeff Larong and Elvira Egay together with local media, confirmed residents fears: machinery is back at the mining site, operating covertly and guarded aggressively. Journalists who previously investigated the site in January noted stark changes. What was once an open site is now shielded by heavy tarps, guarded closely, and inaccessible to scrutiny. Forced to use drones and covert camera setups, media teams documented the renewed excavation activity and interviewed residents to find out more. They said they would backfill the area, but theyre still digging, shared a resident from Barangay Mat-i, dispersing claims that the provincial and city government had begun rehabilitating the area. Their machinery runs at night, keeping us awake, worrying about our lands and rivers. This resident asked to remain anonymous out of fear for their safety. This isnt just about noise or inconvenienceits about the very survival of local communities. During a recent inspection, Mat-i Barangay Councilor Nolan Zuares, chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, expressed deep concern. During our last session, I insisted that we inspect the area because I couldnt understand why our river had started to become murky again when operations were supposedly stopped after the raid, he explained. We saw the operations ourselves, shared Zuares. There were some backhoes that werent operating, but there were others that were actively digging again. This activity has seriously affected our agricultureour new irrigation system is already clogged with sediment, damaging rice fields and threatening our harvests. Provincial Board Member Jeff Larong emphasized the severity of the situation, highlighting that the mining operations elevated locations significantly heighten the risk of disaster. From what we saw earlier, there was a tailings pond being emptied out into a small stream. Given the elevated nature of these mining operations, any containment failure could result in catastrophic flooding, similar to tragic events weve seen in Placer and Tubod, where tailings dams collapsed, sending torrents of toxic sludge through communities that had no chance to escape, Larong warned. He urgently called for expert intervention from licensed mining engineers and official assessment by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau . The mining operations at Placer and Tubod had properly engineered facilities yet these deadly incidents still occurred. How much greater is the risk when potentially unregulated operations are situated at elevations that would turn any containment failure into a devastating downhill flow toward unsuspecting communities? Board Member Elvira A. Egay also raised the question wondered by all: Wasnt this operation supposed to be stopped already? Why has it started back again? The rivers have again turned murky with silt, choking farmers livelihoods and threatening residents homes downstream. Despite repeated pleas to city and provincial officials, and even direct appeals to the DENR and MGB, residents say their calls have been met with silence, leaving them feeling hopeless and abandoned. Adding to residents suspicion, Erwin Coleta, caretaker and semi-broker involved with the land acquisition for the mining operations, admitted during an ambush interview that both sand and gravel were extracted. This contradicts earlier claims that only sand was collecteda clear violation of their stated permit conditions, now expired. Councilor Zuares further noted the increased dangers of continued excavation. Its much more dangerous now because the excavation has gotten deeper, he said. If heavy rains come, water could collect in these deeper pits and potentially burst, causing catastrophic flooding downstream. Are we waiting for another deadly incident like Placer, where families were swept away in their sleep? How safe are the barangays nestled beneath these questionable quarrying operations in Mati and Mabini? Larong asked. The risk escalates with each passing dayand each additional meter of excavation at these elevated sitesyet community complaints appear to be systematically downplayed by authorities. It seems clear that those in power prefer to protect mining interests rather than the people who elected them, one frustrated barangay official remarked. This silence and inaction by the provincial and city government raises troubling questions: Who truly benefits from these operations? Why do officials appear indifferent or complicit in environmental abuse? The illegal mining saga in Surigao City is not new. Investigative reports from the Inquirer highlighted these illicit activities months ago, prompting significant public backlash and official responses. Yet, with operations stealthily resuming despite heavy scrutiny and documented violations, residents are beginning to suspect deeper collusion between illegal mining operators and local authorities. We have lost hope in the current administration, said another resident, expressing sentiments echoed by many. Change has to come from somewhere else. Our officials have shown us they dont care. As the May elections approach, Surigaonons now face an urgent choice. Will they continue to tolerate an administration that ignores their safety, livelihoods, and the environment, or will they demand accountability and vote for real change?

PGMNs CJ Hirro challenges Rep. Rillo to live debate over P71-M accusation,"MANILA, Philippines Peanut Gallery Media Network anchor CJ Hirro has issued a direct challenge to Quezon City 4th District Representative Marvin Rillo, calling on him to face her in a no-edits, no-censorship live debate this Tuesday at noon, amid allegations surrounding the controversial P71-million Carlos L. Albert High School multipurpose building project. Watch full video here: In a video posted on PGMNs social media platforms, Hirro pushed back against Rillos camps threats of a lawsuit, calling them a desperate, cowardly attempt to intimidate and silence someone who is doing her jobher civic duty of protecting the interests of her countrymen. Debate me face-to-face. Lets dissect every allegationgo through each oneline by line, item by item. Answer every question, Hirro said. At the center of the issue is the projects first phase, which began in March 2023 but remains unfinished to this day, with only the foundation and steel posts completed. Rillo and the Department of Public Works and Highways claim that only the first phase has been completed, with two more phases remaining to reach the total budget of P225 million. However, in a video posted earlier this April, Hirro pointed out that the projects official documentsparticularly the bidding documents and the project billboardmade no mention of phases. She noted that such details should have been explicitly stated in the special conditions section of the bidding documents to ensure funding continuity across administrations. Moreover, no budget had been allocated for the second and third phases. Hirro also cited the Bill of Quantities, which included ceiling reinforcements, windows, doors, and tiles, arguing that the approved budget was intended for a completed buildingnot merely its foundation and posts. In a statement sent to the Inquirer last week, Rillo dismissed the allegations as hearsay. Hirro stressed, All I did was compare your public statementssourced from your interviews and your official Facebook pageto official documents from PhilGEPS and DPWH. That isby definitionthe literal opposite of hearsay. She further criticized politicians misuse of the term fake news, describing it as a get-out-of-truth-free card used to evade accountability. Emphasizing that a live debate would allow Rillo to defend himself publicly, Hirro declared: If you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to be afraid of. She warned that if Rillo chose instead to pursue legal action to silence her, That will prove that you do not fight fair and that you are a coward.

"Solo Parents Party-list lauds MRT-3, LRT-2s free rides on solo parents week","MANILA, Philippines The Solo Parents Party-list has lauded the management of Metro Rail Transit Line 3 and Light Rail Transit Line 2 , for extending free rides to solo parents on 26 April 2025 in celebration of National Solo Parents Week. We sincerely commend MRT-3 and LRT-2 for this meaningful act of support. This is more than just a free rideits a symbolic recognition of the hard work and resilience of solo parents, said Dr. Rouselle Teodosio of Solo Parents Partylist. Every gesture that acknowledges their contributions to our society is a step toward inclusivity and empowerment, she added. The initiative, which allowed qualified solo parents to ride for free upon presentation of a valid Solo Parent ID, was praised as a thoughtful gesture that recognizes the daily struggles and sacrifices of solo parents across the country. However, Solo Parents Partylist also acknowledged a key challenge: not all solo parents can easily secure a Solo Parent ID, the main requirement to access government benefits such as this free train rides. Complicated application processes, lack of awareness, and varying local government implementations continue to hinder many solo parents from receiving the support they deserve. This is exactly why the Solo Parents Party-list is fighting to be the voice of solo parents in Congress, Teodosio emphasized. We need to strengthen policies to make the Solo Parent ID more accessible, streamline its application, unified, and ensure that all solo parentsregardless of their backgroundcan claim their rights and benefits. While the Solo Parents Welfare Act has provided an essential foundation by granting additional parental leave, work flexibility, and other benefits, the Solo Parents Party-list asserts that deeper, more inclusive reforms are needed. These include a more accessible registration and streamline processing of solo parents ID, wider access to healthcare, more flexible parental work arrangement, livelihood assistance, and expanded financial aid. As the observance of National Solo Parents Week continues, the Solo Parents Party-list calls on both public and private sectors to continue working together in creating an environment where solo parents are supported sustainablythrough representation, legislation, and action that reflect their realities and help them thrive.

"Antibiotic-resistant salmonella found in local poultry, says a UP study","MANILA, Philippines Salmonella with high levels of resistance to antimicrobial drugs were found in chicken meat sold in wet markets across Metro Manila. This discovery came from a study by scientists at the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Science Institute of Biology . They made the statement on Friday. Salmonella is a food-borne bacteria that, if ingested, can lead to abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea and vomiting from two to seven days. As for the studys samples, the UPD CS IB said, High levels of multidrug resistance were observed when tested against antimicrobial panels, with a total of 50 ARGs detected, conferring resistance to 12 different drug classes. Antimicrobial drugs are used on food-producing animals like chickens to prevent disease and promote growth, according to the World Health Organization . But WHO also warned that misuse and overuse of antimicrobials can make bacteria resistant to the drugs and then, the bacteria can be transmitted to humans, especially through food. Our study suggests a need for proper surveillance of contaminating bacteria as well as regulations on antimicrobial use at the farm level, the UPD IB CS said.

"NBI files charges against Lambino, Cardema for `spreading false info","MANILA, PhilippinesThe National Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday filed complaints before the Department of Justice against PDP-Laban senatorial bet Raul Lambino for allegedly spreading false information.

Also included in the complaint is former National Youth Commission commissioner Ronald Cardema.

Ambushed Maguindanao del Sur bet claims attack politically motivated,"COTABATO CITY, BARMM, Philippines A candidate for provincial board member of Maguindanao del Sur who narrowly survived an ambush on Sunday afternoon has claimed that the attempt on his life was politically motivated. There are people who were mad at me for joining the party of incumbent Gov. Bai Mariam Mangudadatu, Muhammad Utti Omar told reporters on Monday. That is what I believed, and I am convinced this is the reason why they ambushed me, he said in Filipino. Omar did not name any person who wanted him dead. READ: Comelec: BARMM has most areas at serious risk of poll violence Omar is seeking a seat in the provincial board representing the first district of Maguindanao del Sur under the ticket of Gov. Bai Mariam Sangki-Mangudadatu. Omar, also known as Datu Baba, 49, was heading to South Upi town after attending the proclamation rally in Datu Piang town when he was waylaid at around 3 p.m. in Barangay Brar, Datu Anggal Midtimbang town. He sustained bruises on his right face, just below his right eye, and near his armpit, believed to be due to a shattered windshield. His driver, Abel Bunsalagat Buisan, 31, of Buluan, Maguindanao del Sur, sustained serious injuries. Omar, former vice mayor of South Upi, said his four other companions in the Toyota Innova vehicle were unharmed. Recalling how it happened, Omar said he was seated in the front seat of his vehicle and saw a silver minivan without a license plate parked in the opposite lane. Then about three men armed with long firearms alighted from the minivan and opened fire toward us, Omar recalled. I told my driver to continue driving until we reached a police checkpoint, he added. He said it was his first time running for a seat on the provincial board . Despite what happened, Omar said he is pursuing his bid to become a provincial legislator. Colonel Ryan Bobby Paloma, Maguindanao del Norte police director, strongly condemned the ambush and directed Major Zukarnain Kunakon, Datu Anggal Midtimbang police chief, to intensify the manhunt operation against the perpetrators.

Acidre tells Piol: Rice prices spiked during your time at DA,"MANILA, Philippines Another lawmaker has called out North Cotabato gubernatorial candidate Manny Piol after he criticized the government over its growing debt. He reminded the public that rice prices spiked during Piols time as agricultural secretary. Tingog Party-list Rep. Jude Acidre on Wednesday said it is important to assess Piols track record as he tries to woo voters in North Cotabato. According to Acidre, rice prices rose by P70 per kilogram in some areas when he headed the Department of Agriculture , back during former President Rodrigo Dutertes time. During Secretary Piols tenure, rice prices rose to levels that placed a heavy burden on many Filipino families, Acidre said in a statement. Its important to remember that history, especially when public trust is being sought again, he noted. In September 2018, the rice crisis emerged as a national issue tied to broader economic challenges, Acidre recalled. Inflation peaked at 6.7% that month the highest in nearly a decade with food inflation among poor households even higher, he pointed out. As the staple food of Filipinos, rice was at the center of the crisis: Retail prices for well-milled rice in Metro Manila ranged from P46 to P48 per kilo, about 14% higher than the previous year, he remembered. Acidres criticism of Piol came after the latters campaign sortie in North Cotabato, video footage of which was uploaded on the former DA officials Facebook page. Piol spoke using the local dialect. He said that government programs like aid distribution have a hidden agendathe desire of the current administrations officials to stay in power beyond their term. Piol also said the governments debt has ballooned to P16.6 trillion under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s term. Acidre just like Zambales 1st District Rep. Jefferson Khonghun however, noted that it was during Dutertes time that the countrys debt piled up. According to both lawmakers, the countrys debt after the term of former President Benigno Aquino III Dutertes predecessor was only at P6.6 trillion. However, the Duterte administration borrowed P7.2 trillion. This means he left office with the Philippines having a debt of over P13 trillion. Borrowings during Dutertes time were higher than the combined debt left by the two previous presidents.

It takes a village to light the future of children,"MANILA, Philippines For decades, Sitio Kabangbang in the Marilog District of Davao City remained unenergized, leaving the remote community without electric lights nor a network connection. Hours away from the city proper, Kabangbangs lone elementary school where its people pin its hopes and aspirations for the future previously had to rely on gas lamps when the sky grew dark. Hinimok kami ng aming anak na itayo ang paaralan para hindi maranasan ng aming mga anak ang aming pinagdaanan ang kawalan ng kaalaman, shared Matigsalog Datu Ariston Mabayao, the local chieftain. . Pangarap namin ito para sa aming mga anak. Sabi ng apo ko, gusto niyang matuto. Makapagtrabaho siya o makatapos ng pag-aaral, he added. . Kabangbang Elementarys modest building only has two classrooms which are made to accommodate more than 90 students from different year levels. Having to make do with what they have, its teachers multi-task, catering to students of different grades at the same time. Sometimes, they teach different classes sharing just one classroom that is divided by a bookshelf. Adding to the struggles, the students also have to walk several miles from their unenergized homes to a school that also had no electricity. According to the Department of Education , there are 1,562 similar public schools across the country that operate without electric power. Pahirapan p o, especially sa pag-provide ng mga instructional materials kasi hindi kami makapag-print [dahil] walang kuryente. Ang ginagawa ng teacher, sulat sa blackboard, sulat sa Manila paper, said Marima Guillen, a teacher of Kabangbang Elementary School. . Saka hindi tumatagal yung mga laptops kasi nalo-lowbat, walang available na mapag-charge-an kasi walang kuryente. Kahit na yung mga cellphones, hindi makapag-charge . Even the basic need na magkaroon ng ilaw, pahirapan din , she added. . Much farther from Davao City and as inaccessible as Kabangbang Elementary School is Lapinig Elementary School in Sitio Lapinig. Likewise, the school and the remote village it is situated in remained unenergized for decades. This hasnt stopped teachers from hiking through the rugged terrain to reach their students, staying in the schools for days on end away from their own families. Isa sa pinakamalaking hamon is yung teknolohiya. Kung paano namin masasabayan yung mga trend na nasa labas; paano namin ipapaliwanag nang maigi na mas higit nilang mauunawaan, shared Judy R. Patac, School Head of Lapinig Elementary School, pointing to the growing digital divide. . To help these far-flung schools, the Aboitiz Foundation, together with Davao Light and Power Co., an AboitizPower distribution utility, included them in its Aurora PH initiative, which finally provided them with electricity from solar panels and internet connectivity via Starlink, as well as digital learning tools and capacity building sessions for teachers. Last November, five-kilowatt solar panels with battery storage were installed in both the Kabangbang and Lapinig Elementary Schools, which are enough to power a small refrigerator, a television, lights, and electric fans for each school. As a result, learning has become brighter, wider, and more exciting. Mas mauunawaan ng bata po kapag may nakikita po talaga sila. Katulad ng anyong tubig Ang nakikita lang nilang anyong tubig dito sa palibot nila ay yung ilog. Hindi nila nakikita yung [itsura ng] karagatan. Pero ngayon maipapakita na po ni teacher na ganun pala kalapad; may mas malapad pa pala sa ilog na nakikita nila sa palibot , Judy said. . Dito kasi nag-stay ang mga guro tuwing gabi para gumawa ng lesson plans. May ilaw na sila kahit dis-oras ng gabi. Sa umaga naman, ginagamit ito ng mga estudyante para sa mas pinahusay na pag-aaral gamit ang TV, said Davao Light Reputation Enhancement Head Fermin Edillon. . Since 2023, Aurora PH has helped over 10 schools get access to electricity and the internet, including schools that cater to indigenous tribes. This year, the program looks to onboard 50 more last-mile schools en route to helping 300 schools in the next 15 years. Aurora means light. So in a very real sense, its bringing light to these schools, to the lives of teachers, communities, and especially the students, said Aboitiz Foundation President Ginggay Hontiveros-Malvar. Knowing the huge digital divide in education, we recognize that these last-mile schools lack electricity, power, and even connectivity cutting them off from the rest of the world. We hope that by providing this kind of infrastructure, were able to help students access better learning tools and digital resources, while also helping the teachers in the long run. For over 35 years, the Aboitiz Foundation which is the corporate social responsibility arm of the Aboitiz Group has also improved public school facilities, expanded scholarship programs, and provided opportunities for postgraduate learning in innovation and technology. By helping bridge the gap, AboitizPower and the Aboitiz Foundation supports the DepEd and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of quality education for all.

Sen. Poe calls on Naia to make sure Holy Week travelers are comfortable,"MANILA, Philippines The management of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport must ensure that passengers using their terminals are comfortable as more and more people travel for the Holy Week break, Senator Grace Poe said on Monday. Poe in a statement said that Naias terminals have to be comfortable and well-ventilated especially since the country is facing the peak of the summer season. Travelers have already started making their way to different destinations to take advantage of the upcoming holidays, with the Manila International Airport Authority saying earlier that over 150,000 passengers were monitored at Naia just on Palm Sunday. Passenger comfort is not rocket science. Clean restrooms, functioning air-conditioning units, and reliable power and water supply are not luxuries but basic requirements at our countrys main gateway, Poe, who used to be the chairperson of the Senate committee on public services, said. READ: Naia official: Holy Week passengers could surpass last years numbers Especially with the hot weather these days, the Naias management must ensure that the terminals are cool and well-ventilated, she added in Filipino. According to Poe, enough staffers should be deployed to assist passengers and to avoid long queues and bottlenecks. The human component is also critical. Adequate staff should be deployed at check-in desks, baggage handling, immigration and security screening, to ease bottlenecks. There should also be medical and customer service staff to assist passengers in case of disruption, Poe explained. They must also make sure eGates and baggage systems are working. We expect to see comfort and ease under the new NAIA Infra Corporation like centralized hub for taxis and app-based cars as well as doubled driveway lanes, she added. Miaa Head Executive Assistant Manuel Jeffrey David said they expect around 550,000 travelers to flock to Naia until Holy Wednesday surpassing the numbers in 2024. So last 2024, we have around 500,000 for the half of the Holy Week. So, if youre basing it from there, and then you add 10 percent, around 550,000 [passengers]. Because we just received the Palm Sunday numbers this morning, we have around 150,000 passengers already, David told INQUIRER.net in an interview. So, comparing that to 2024s numbers of around 134,000, we are expecting more this week. But, of course, were still expecting a lot of passengers either Palm Sunday and Holy Wednesday and Easter Sunday, he added. Of the 150,511 passengers monitored on Palm Sunday, Miaa said 73,874 were local travelers, while 76,637 were foreign passengers. The Bureau of Immigration has deployed additional personnel at Naia as officials anticipate the influx of travelers for the long weekend.

Tension rises as men forcibly enter Cagayan de Oro water firms office,"ILIGAN CITY Tensions rose as a group of men destroyed the glass door and barged into the building of Cagayan deOro City Water District on Wednesday morning. Several COWD employees told reporters that Fermin Jarales, the firms interim general manager, entered and went straight to the buildings second floor where he and the men, who tore down the door, had since been holed up. The grouphad locked themselves up in the Office of the General Manager, according to the COWDemployees. As of this reporting, personnel from the Cagayan de Oro City Police Office and Special Action Force tried to negotiate with the men to open the door to the office. The commotion happened two days after the Cagayan de Oro City Regional Trial Court Branch41 ordered the Local Water Utilities Administration to cease intervening in COWD,whichhas gone on for almost a year. The LWUA intervention led to its takeover of COWD operation, appointing an interim board of directors and Jarales as interim general manager. In the ruling, Judge Jeoffre Acebido said there was no legal basis for LWUA to intervene in COWDs internal affairs. As a result of the court ruling, Edna Najeal, who was designated by the regular board of directors as acting COWDgeneral manager, ordered on Monday to bar Jarales from the buildings second floor, allowing him only access to the ground floor which is generally open to the public.

"Solon hits Piols criticism of PH debt, calls it brazen hypocrisy","MANILA, PhilippinesFormer Agricultural secretary Manny Piols criticism of the countrys mounting debt is brazen hypocrisy, according to Zambales 1st District Rep. Jefferson Khonghun. Khonghun said in a statement on Tuesday the borrowings ballooned during former president Rodrigo Dutertes time. He claimed that Piol, who is running for North Cotabatos gubernatorial post in the 2025 midterm elections, is just trying to rewrite history when he called out the current administration for having a P16.63 trillion debt. The lawmaker stressed that after the term of former president Benigno Aquino III, Dutertes predecessor, the countrys debt was only at P6.6 trillion. However, during Dutertes time, the government borrowed P7.2 trillion. Duterte administrations debts, according to Khonghun, was bigger than the combined debt left by all previous presidents. Lets set the record straight: It was under your boss, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, when our countrys debt truly ballooned with P7.2 trillion added in just six years, Khonghun said of Piol, who was Department of Agriculture head during Dutertes time. Thats more than the combined total debt of all Philippine presidents from Manual Quezon to Benigno Noynoy Aquino III over 89 years amounting to only P6.6-trillion. If theres a death burden, it was the one the Duterte administration created, he added. Khonghuns statement was a reaction to Piols statements during a campaign sortie at North Cotabato, video footage of which was uploaded on the former DA officials Facebook page. Piol spoke using the local dialect, but he claimed that programs of the government like aid distribution have a hidden agenda a desire to stay in power beyond their term. Furthermore, Piol said that the governments debt has ballooned to P16.6 trillion under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s term. LINK TO VIDEO: https://www.facebook.com/gobmannypinol/videos/1236623568071441 Khonghun, however, said Piols statements are laughable, given that the former DA secretary presided over a controversial time in the department. He presided over rice crises, proposed legalizing smuggling, bungled the bird flu outbreak, and was linked to questionable behavior in the Recto Bank incident. And now he wants to lecture us on responsible governance, Khonghun said. We in Congress are now pushing for reforms to make sure future administrations dont recklessly mortgage our nations future the way it was done under Duterte, Khonghun said. That includes investigating how the P7.2 trillion in loans was used, and whether the Filipino people truly benefited from that borrowed money. Piol, who headed DA in from 2016 to 2019, was criticized publicly in September 2018 after he said that he saw nothing irregular in rice infested with bukbok or weevils, saying that these grains are safe to eat. I was born poor and Ive always known that weevils are part of rice. As Ive said, weevils are to grain as black ants are to fruits, Piol said in the vernacular. Piols statements came after it was revealed that 133,000 sacks of rice stored on a ship docked in Subic, and 177,000 in Albay were all infested with weevils, requiring the need for fumigation to remove the insects. Piol and former Health secretary Francisco Duque III both assured the public that fumigated rice is still safe to eat. READ: DA chief sees nothing irregular in rice infested with weevils Regarding Recto Bank, Piol was accused of allegedly intimidating Filipino fishermen whose boat, F/B Gem-Ver, was allegedly rammed by a Chinese vessel over the West Philippine Sea last June 2019. The allegations came after Piol relayed that one of the crew members told him that it is possible that the Chinese vessel did not see their boat before it smashed into their fantail. Critics, however, noted changes in the fishermens narration of their encounter with the Chinese vessel before and after meeting Piol. But Piol said it is unfair to hint that the fishermen were intimidated into changing their story about what had happened, into a version favorable to the government. READ: No intimidation in meeting with Recto Bank fishermen Piol According to Khonghun, Piol should look himself in the mirror before pointing fingers, as the current administration is trying to fix the problems caused by the past administration. The truth is simple: the current government is paying for the sins of the past. The ones who bloated the debt are now acting like saints. Its shameless, Khonghun said.

DSWD exec downplays rising hunger rates: Public perception,"MANILA, Philippines The government continues to carry out programs that seek to lower the rate of hunger in the Philippines, and the latest survey showing a sharp rise in the number of Filipinos experiencing hunger is mainly based on public perception, a social welfare official said on Monday. At a press briefing in Malacaang, however, Undersecretary Irene Dumlao clarified that the Department of Social Welfare and Development is optimistic that the social protection programs will soon improve the countrys hunger rate. Yes, [the survey numbers may be rising] but that is public perception, based on varying context, Dumlao said. Dumlao made the statement in response to the results of a Social Weather Stations survey released on Saturday, which showed that 52 percent, or around 14.4 million Filipino families, rated themselves as poor. Self-rated poverty among Filipino families also rose to 63 percent in December 2024, up from 50 percent in January and 51 percent in February, the SWS survey showed. The SWS survey also showed that 12 percent identified themselves on the line dividing poor and not poor, and 36 percent said they were not poor. According to Dumlao, the government uses an annual family income and expenditure survey while private organizations like the SWS rely on surveys done quarterly. Then their survey results are dependent on questions they ask from respondents. While we recognize and acknowledge these studies, we also have to compare them with the scientific studies done by the government, she said. Dumlao cited the governments social safety nets such as the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program and the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation aimed at cushioning the impact of unwanted events and adverse shocks on low-income sectors. Citing the governments latest data, Dumlao said these programs have led to a decrease in the poverty incidence in the country. The DSWD official attributed the increase in hunger rates in the country to the string of typhoons that had hit the country last year, and the effects of rising inflation. This is also the reason we have launched the Ayuda para sa Kapos ang Kita Program , which is supposedly aimed as a social safety net to cushion the impact of rising inflation to individuals who are affected by rising inflation but whose income do not exceed the statutory minimum wage. She also said the government continues to aim to bring down the poverty incidence rate in the country to a single-digit percentage before the end of the term of President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. The DSWD is committed in contributing to that attainment of that goal, and we are exerting all efforts to reducing the poverty incidence in the country, she added. Dumlao also pointed out that the causes of hunger and poverty in the country are multi-faceted and would require a multipronged approach. We remain steadfast in promoting various initiatives to address the issue of hunger and poverty and in improving and expanding existing programs of our agency, she said. The program 4Ps invests in the education and health of child beneficiaries because we believe that hunger is a driver of povertywhen children are not healthy, they lose the opportunity to have a good future. This affects their education and their productivity, she added. Alongside the 4Ps, the DSWD has so far conducted nine job fairs that cater to 4Ps beneficiaries, wherein up to 3,000 have been hired on the spot. The agency is also implementing the Walang Gutom program in the metropolis, Dumlao said. Were looking at expanding the implementation of this program, with Walang Gutom Kitchen in northern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, she added. Under the program, eligible families receive P3,000 per month in food credits through Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, which they can use to buy select food items from accredited merchants and Kadiwa ng Pangulo stalls. Dumlao said the government adopts the whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach to address the problem of hunger and poverty. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

PhilHealth sends P22.8M to PGH for heart attack claims,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation has sent P22.8 million to the Philippine General Hospital for patients who have availed of the state-run insurers increased benefits packages for heart attacks. In a statement on Monday, PhilHealth said the P22.8-million payouts were handed to PGH last April 11, as 77 patients availed of the benefit package for Ischemic Heart Disease-Acute Myocardial Infarction or heart attack. According to PGH Medical Director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, this is what they wanted to see an improved PhilHealth service so that heart attack patients and their relatives would not be helpless. With the chance given to us to provide an improved service to heart attack patients, we have attained a record-high service. We no longer have charity cases for heart attack patients, said Legazpi, who was with PhilHealth acting President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Edwin Mercado during the ceremonial turnover at the PGH. Thats the improvement that we want to see. And I think with this current administration of PhilHealth, we will be seeing more of that, he added. At the ceremony, the wife of a patient who availed of an angiogram also attested to the relief that PhilHealths increased benefit packages have brought to the public. At first, we were hesitant because we [had] heard how expensive angiograms can be, but one of the doctors told us that there is a PhilHealth package where we would not pay anything. Of course, we were happy, said Juvy Busayong, wife of patient Jose Busayong. It is a huge privilege for us to receive this package. We want to thank PhilHealth for the package given to us. I hope you can help more people, and more lives could be saved, she added. Last February, PhilHealth announced improved coverage for open heart surgeries now at almost P1 million while launching a new benefit package for heart valve repair and replacement surgeries worth up to P810,000. PhilHealth said there is a need to increase the coverage for cardiovascular diseases as these impose a heavy financial burden on patients and their families. Heart ailments remain the top cause of death among Filipinos, with the World Health Organization data showing that an average of 118,740 Filipinos die every year due to heart diseases. The Philippine Statistics Authority reported in 2023 that a total of 129,300 Filipinos died due to ischemic heart disease. According to PhilHealth, their IHD-AMI benefit package offers coverage up to P523,853, which can be availed at all accredited Levels 1 to 3 public and private health facilities.

Yamsuan: P500M needed to modernize public libraries,"MANILA, Philippines The government needs to invest P500 million in modernizing public libraries and reading centers and making sure these facilities are accessible to children, Bicol Saro party-list Rep. Brian Raymund Yamsuan said. In a statement released on Monday, Yamsuan said a P500-million budget hike for the National Library of the Philippines would facilitate the computerization of public libraries and barangay reading centers nationwide so that materials would be future-ready and catalogued for the next generations. According to Yamsuan, public libraries are still relevant even if information is readily available through smartphones and other gadgets. However, public libraries could be more helpful to students if the books were digitized. The budget of the NLP, which provides support services to public libraries and reading centers, should be increased by P500 million per year until all cities and municipalities are provided and have full access to electronic library facilities, he said. Despite the digitalization wave, public libraries remain relevant as a readily accessible source of information, especially in marginalized communities where students can hardly afford to buy books or mobile devices, he added. The proposal to increase the NLPs budget, Yamsuan said, is contained in House Bill No. 1798, which seeks to amend Republic Act No. 7743, the law that requires the establishment of congressional, city, and municipal libraries and barangay reading centers throughout the country. According to the House of Representatives website, the bill is still pending before the Committee on Basic Education and Culture. Under the bill, modernizing public libraries would also mean providing the infrastructure to establish a reliable internet connection. Modernizing these facilities using the latest electronic library systems and providing them with reliable internet connectivityis a must to help make our education system future-ready, Yamsuan said. Reading centers and public libraries should be equipped with the latest electronic library system for storing, cataloguing and filing of materials. On top of providing each public library and reading center with a complete standard set of reference books and other materials as mandated under Republic Act 7743, these facilities should also have access to e-books and online research resources, he added. To do this, Yamsuan said, Education Secretary Sonny Angara could coordinate with the NLP and the Department of Information and Communications Technology to kickstart digitization efforts. This will help realize the Department of Educations goal under Secretary Sonny Angara to provide every Filipino child, no matter where they are, the opportunity for learning, growth, and success,Yamsuan said. The Philippines should follow the example of Singapore, which has allocated funds to expand and revitalize its public libraries to continue cultivating the love for reading and learning among its citizens, he added. Over the years, libraries have made efforts to digitize and preserve history and details that are considered vulnerable if they remain on paper. In March 2024, the Department of Science and Technology added a special section to its digital library that discusses matters related to the preservation of protected areas in the country. Gilbert Arbon, director of the DOSTs Negros Oriental Provincial Office, said the Science and Technology Academic and Research-Based Openly Operated Kiosks is a digital library with research journals from the Science and Technology Information Institute. READ: DOST digital library adds section on PH protected areas conservation In 2019, the Supreme Court also opened its e-library to the public for free. However, most of these libraries are not the public libraries that students across different regions access. Still, some libraries have started innovating, like the Cebu City Public Library , which in August 2024 turned itself into a friendly space for visually impaired students and professionals doing research. Leoniver Gaquing, acting head of CCPLs Braille Section, said on the Sugboanon Channel that assistive devices and applications, like electronic braille display and screen reader that would provide text-to-speech functionality, were available at the library.

7 cops linked to Kerwin Espinosa shooting face gun charges,"TACLOBAN CITY, LEYTE, Philippines The Leyte Police Provincial Office has filed cases against the seven police officers who were considered persons of interest in the shooting of confessed drug lord and mayoralty candidate Rolan Kerwin Espinosa of Albuera town, Leyte on April 10. Police Col. Dionisio Apas Jr., director of the LPPO, said they lodged a complaint for illegal possession of firearms and a violation of the Commission on Elections gun ban against the seven policemen before the Leyte Provincial Prosecutors Office on Monday afternoon. Apas declined to identify the seven police officers pending further investigation but revealed their ranks: a police colonel, a lieutenant colonel, a staff sergeant, three corporals, and a patrolwoman. READ: Comelec: No need to place Leyte town under red category In a press conference late Tuesday afternoon, Apas said eight of the 14 firearms voluntarily surrendered by the seven police officers to authorities were unregistered. Verification showed that several of the firearms, including a Mini Uzi and some of the rifles and pistols, were unregistered and lacked proper documentation, classifying them as loose firearms, he said. Apas said the seven police officers did not give a categorical answer as to why they were in possession of these unregistered firearms when they were supposedly on a mission to serve a warrant of arrest against a certain individual. The warrant was not intended for Espinosa. Apas said that based on the investigation by their forensic unit, the firearms had gunpowder residue. But Police Lt. Col. Mae Mobago, chief of the forensic unit, clarified that while there were gunpowder residues found on the firearms, it did not mean that these could have been used in the shooting of Espinosa. These firearms could have been used earlier, reason why gunpowder residues were discovered on the firearms, she said. Paraffin tests conducted on the seven policemen showed no traces of gunpowder on their hands. Apas stressed that the complaints lodged against the respondents were just initial cases, as investigators continue to pursue leads for the possible filing of frustrated murder complaints against the seven police officers. We want to make sure that once we file , it will be airtight and solid, he said. The seven police officers are currently under administrative and restrictive custody at the regional police headquarters in Palo town, Leyte. Apas said investigators had yet to determine the type of firearm used in the shooting of Espinosa as no slug was recovered from the crime scene. Perhaps, someone picked it up, he said. A slug is considered a crucial evidence in determining the kind of firearm used in a shooting incident. Apas said the gunman could have mingled with the crowd during the attack. The gunman could have been about 80 meters away from Espinosa, he said. Asked whether any of the seven police officers identified as persons of interest had the ability to shoot accurately from that distance, Apas said none of them were certified snipers. Espinosa, 47, who is running for mayor of Albuera under the Bando Espinosa, Pundok Kausaban , was shot and wounded on the chest while waiting for his turn to address the crowd during a campaign sortie inside the covered court of Barangay Tinag-an on April 10. Also injured were his sister and running mate, Mariel Espinosa Marinay, and a daughter of one of their candidates for councilor. The attack was the first reported election-related violence in Eastern Visayas ahead of the May 12 elections. Espinosa, who survived the attack, condemned what happened, saying it was meant to derail his bid to become the next mayor of Albuera, a first-class municipality with over 47,000 residents in 16 barangays. He vowed not to back down from his mayoral bid despite the attempt on his life, saying he is committed to serving the people of Albuera. In a live broadcast on Facebook on Wednesday, Espinosa challenged those who continue to accuse him of using illegal drugs to take a drug test with him. Lets do the drug test, and those who test positive should be immediately arrested by the police, he added. He stressed he was already a changed man and has turned away from his former way of life.

"Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental brace for devotees in pilgrimage sites","CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY Authorities are bracing for the influx of devotees and holiday tourists in observance of Holy Week as this city and several localities in Misamis Oriental have become major pilgrimage destinations during this time of year. Nick Jabagat, city disaster risk reduction and management officer, reminded those who will be trekking the Malasag Stations of the Cross in Cugman village, and the Our Lady of Guadalupe Shrine on the side of Igbalalay hill in Balubal village on Thursday and Friday to prepare for the heat. The state weather bureau had forecast the citys heat index at 38 degrees Celsius until Friday. Jabagat also advised pilgrims to wear clothing to prevent them from getting insect bites. The local government had set up first aid stations to cater to devotees going up the 3-kilometer trek along the Malasag Hills that ends at the Chapel of the Birhen sa Medalya Milagrosa . But the most elaborate preparation is for the trek to the 1,200-meter-high Guadalupe shrine, which can be reached via a 4.5-kilometer route from Tablon village or a 2.3-kilometer route from the center of Balubal village. The route from Tablon, which is more popular, requires one to cross the winding Umalag River nine times before reaching the foot of Igbalalay Hill, and from there, a trail of 75 concrete steps leads to a chapel that houses the revered image of the Virgin Mary. Apart from 11 first aid stations, the local government also prepared rope lines to help devotees cross the river safely. Volunteers and barangay watchmen are also deployed to aid the devotees crossing the knee-deep river. In El Salvador City, Misamis Oriental, authorities have instituted a temporary scheme to regulate the flow of vehicles to the Divine Mercy Shrine where a towering 50-foot statue of Jesus Christ overlooks the blue sea water of Macajalar Bay. Department of Tourism assistant regional director Decius Esmedalla said the nine-hectare shrine complex has become the top pilgrimage spot during Holy Week in Misamis Oriental as thousands flock there to pray and seek solemnity. Constructed in 2008, the Divine Mercy Shrine was built through donations fromdevotees, and until the present, caretakers charge no entrance fee, and only a token of donations are accepted to enter and pray at the church. From the national highway, devotees can reach the shrine via ahabal-habalor motorcycle. The shrine is only a 30-minute ride by taxi from the airport in Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental. With DOT promotion, other religious sites are gaining popularity as Holy Week destinations. These include the baroque-style Immaculate Conception parish church in Jasaan town built in 1887, which was declared a national cultural treasure in 2001.

Siargaos rise: How a hidden paradise became the worlds best island,"Thirty years ago, Siargao was a quiet island off Mindanaos northeastern coastremote, untouched, and largely unknown to the outside world. Surrounded by pristine waters and dense forests, the island offered unparalleled natural beauty but lacked basic infrastructure, making daily life challenging for locals and visits inconvenient for outsiders. Fast forward to today, Siargao consistently ranks among the worlds best islands, a beloved destination for both local and international tourists. But how did this hidden gem transform into an internationally acclaimed paradise? Siargaos rise wasnt accidentalit didnt simply happen on its own. It was driven by people who believed in Siargaos potential long before anyone else did. Despite skepticism and criticism, dedicated individuals worked tirelessly to build essential infrastructure and develop the island to realize its potential as the legendary tourist destination they envisioned. Siargao now stands as a compelling example of how visionary local leadership can elevate an unknown island in the Philippines onto the global stagebringing tremendous opportunities to its people and immense pride to the entire country. One such visionary leader is Francisco Lalo Matugas, born and raised in the municipality of Dapa, Siargao. The eldest of nine children, he grew up supporting his familys business and learned early on the value of community service and generosity from his parents. After becoming a lawyer and serving in government agencies, Lalo entered public service in 1992 when he ran for governor and won. At the time, most peopleincluding Filipinoshad no idea where or what Siargao Island was. But Lalo Matugas already saw the great potential of his island home. He was determined to make the world see it too. In 1993, former Governor Lalo Matugas, together with the late Mayor Jaime Rusillon of General Luna, literally cut a path through dense jungle to the now-famous Cloud 9 surf break. This simple yet pivotal action opened access for surfers, initiating a cultural shiftintroducing surfing as both a viable sport and a source of livelihood for locals. In the same year, despite limited resources and initial skepticism, these leaders hosted the first-ever Siargao Surfing Classic, planting the seeds for what would become a globally renowned surfing destination. By 1996, their efforts had resulted in the iconic Cloud 9 boardwalk and towerinitially practical structures, but ones that quickly became symbolic landmarks. This laid the groundwork for Siargaos global surfing prominence, recently highlighted when the island hosted the Philippines largest surfing event, the World Surf League QS5000. However, surfing was only part of the islands success story. After serving as governor, Lalo continued to serve Siargao as its congressman. It was during this time that Cong. Lalo Matugas spearheaded major infrastructure projects that dramatically changed Siargaos trajectory. His landmark achievement was the concreting of the islands entire 162-kilometer circumferential road. He began this in 2007 and completed it in 2016a development now enjoyed by both tourists and locals. This revolutionized local transportation, facilitated the growth of businesses, and laid the foundation for Siargaos thriving tourism industry. Equally transformative was Cong. Matugas expansion and modernization of Siargaos Sayak Airport. In the 1960s, then-Governor Oging Navarro donated a portion of his familys land to create a small local airport. Cong. Matugas sought to expand this airport to welcome more visitors from across the country and around the world. He faced heavy criticism that the project was unnecessary and a waste of public funds. Critics argued that no one knew what Siargao was, so no one would want to fly there. Even local airlines believed this and initially refused to give him flights. Undaunted, Cong. Matugas held firm in his vision that Siargao could become a prime tourist destination. He pushed forward and, in 2009, secured just one commercial flight per weekjust in time to serve participants of the second annual International Gamefishing Tournament in the municipality of Pilar. He believed that small start was enough to get the ball rollingand he was right. Just as he envisioned, Sayak Airport has become a bustling regional gateway, now welcoming 18 daily flights and over a thousand tourists per day, totaling more than half a million tourists annually. This once-contested airport now plays a pivotal role in both the islands and the countrys booming tourism economy. Cong. Lalo Matugass son, Cong. Bingo Matugas, succeeded him as Siargaos district representative after Cong. Lalo completed his initial three terms. Building upon his fathers vision, Cong. Bingo oversaw key developments, including Siargaos first national hospital, the islands first international cruise port, and the approval of its first international airporta landmark Public-Private Partnership project under President Bongbong Marcos Build Better More program, supported by the DOTr. Officially signed on December 18, 2024, this project marks a transformative step for the island. From its humble beginnings as a local airport with just one weekly flight, the Matugas congressmen have propelled Siargao into international prominence, making world-class transportation infrastructure a necessity. As Cong. Bingo Matugas concludes his third term as district representative, Cong. Lalo Matugas seeks to return to office, eager to complete these visionary projects and sustain the remarkable progress he initiated decades ago. Beyond tourism, Cong. Lalo Matugas is deeply committed to the welfare of local residents. He supports programs like widespread free medical missionsaffectionately known as Panambay sa Barangayand advances education through the creation of Siargao National Science High School, Surigao del Norte State University, and the conversion of annex high schools into national high schools, enabling more students to enroll and creating more teaching positions for Siargaonon educators. His commitment extends beyond official programsits deeply personal. Cong. Matugas has donated several hectares of his own land to support Siargaonons directly. He donated one hectare to locals without titled land so they could have a place to call home. Another hectare went to a high school under the Department of Education to improve access to education. And yet another hectare was donated for vital government offices like the RTC, LTO, DepEd, and TESDAbringing essential services closer to the people.

"Despite survey lead, Sara Duterte impeachment trial must go on solon","MANILA, Philippines The impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte is a constitutional duty that should continue regardless of what surveys for the 2028 presidential race show, Batangas 2nd District Rep. Gerville Luistro said on Friday. During an interview with reporters covering the House of Representatives, Luistro was asked about a WR Numero survey released earlier which showed that 30.2 percent of Filipino adults preferred Duterte as their next president for 2028. Duterte, however, will be facing a trial at the Senate after she was impeached by the House last February 5 due to alleged confidential fund misuse and threats to ranking officials, including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Well, what I can say about the surveywhere the Vice President toppedamong the presidential polls, no, we have a constitutional duty to do. So regardless of the survey,as to who is the most preferredpresidentiable for the 2028 election,I honestly believethat we have to push throughwith the impeachment process, Luistro, who is a member of the House prosecution panel, said. We have explained this before, there is an impeachment complaint supported by 215 members of the House and as part of the prosecution team, it is our constitutional duty to push through with the prosecution of the Vice President, with respect to the impeachment complaint that was filed against her, she added. Luistro hopes the impeachment proceedings will help the people decide who is fit to be the next president of the country.Thelawmaker also believes it is a chance for Duterte to clarify the accusations against her. Well, this will help the Filipino people decide on who really is to be supported as the next president of the Philippines. Because, of course, we want a president who will lead the country and Filipinos in the proper direction, she said in Filipino. I think this is an opportunity also for the Vice President to clear herself from all the allegations as included in the impeachment complaint. Since 2024 that was last year, we have been talking about the misuse of confidential funds, the betrayal of public trust, the payola envelope ng DepEd and other allegations as stated in the impeachment complaint, she added. Duterte and her officials actions were scrutinized at the House Committee on Good Government Accountability hearings, which started in September2024, after issues regarding the CF usage of the Office of the Vice President and DepEd were unearthed. At one point in the hearings, Antipolo City 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop also a member of the prosecution panel noticed that one of the acknowledgment receipts for the OVPs CF expenditures was signed by a certain Mary Grace Piattos, whom he said bears a name similar to a restaurant and a potato chip brand. ARs are proof of payment, or that funding for projects reached its intended beneficiaries. And in the case of OVP and DepEd, these are informants who provided confidential information to authorities. Later on, Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong showed two ARs one for OVP and another for DepEd which were both received by Villamin.However, the signatures and handwriting used by theVillamin in the two documentsdiffered. Both Piattos and Villamins names did not appear on the Philippine Statistics Authority database. READ: House probe: OVP, DepEd CFs received by same man, different signatures Over the past few months, lawmakers, particularly La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V and members of the panel have revealed that there were more peculiar names on ARs. That includes seemingly combined names of grocery items and other names that sounded like a phone brand: Xiaome Ocho. READ: Piattos kin, Xiaome Ocho also got VP Sara Dutertes funds Ortega Last Sunday, Ortega released the most-recent batch of weird names in ARs including multiple Fionas which refers to a character from fantasy film Shrek;a Magellan, which refers to Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan who landed in Leyte in 1521; and another individual with the surname Ewan, which is a Filipino slang for I dont know.

"Cayetano to Escudero, Imee: Calm down, eyes on the ball","MANILA, Philippines Cooler heads and eyes on the ball. These were the words used by Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano when he urged Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero and presidential sister Sen. Imee Marcos to set aside their emotions and hopefully talk to each other.

Kasi nga nagbabalak yung International Criminal Court at yung ibang mga katulad ni [former] Sen. [Leila] de Lima, di ba? Bastat tingin niya kalaban niya, sasabihin niya o baka ikaw na ang sunod, said Cayetano when he was asked to comment on Escudero and Marcos supposed exchange of scathing remarks. The exchange of remarks between Escudero and Marcos transpired after the latters Senate panel probed into former president Rodrigo Dutertes arrest last March 11. Gusto ba natin na may Pilipinong nag aalala na bigla na lang silang pwedeng damputin, ilagay sa eroplano [at] i-fly out. Ang akin lang cooler heads and eyes on the ball, he added. Earlier, Sen. Marcos claimed that the Senate chief had refused to sign the contempt order against Special Envoy on Transnational Crimes Amb. Markus Lacanilao, ordering his release from the Senate detention facility instead. Lacanilao was cited in contempt by the Senate panel on foreign affairs headed by Marcos for allegedly lying. In response to Marcos remarks, Escudero urged her to refrain from using the Senate as a platform for her own political objectives. In a statement early Friday, Escudero refuted Marcos claim that he refused to sign the contempt order of Lacanilao. Ambassador Lacanilao was ordered detained without the requisite approval and due process, said Escudero. After several hours of Ambassador Lacanilaos unauthorized detention, I directed his release, both as a matter of regularity and out of humanitarian consideration as his grandfather is to be laid to rest today, he added. He said he would issue a show cause order against Lacanilao within the day, directing him to explain within five days why he should not be cited for contempt by the Senate panel on foreign relations. I shall decide on whether or not to sign his arrest [or] detention only thereafter, said the Senate chief. Still, Escudero explained that all Senate members are fully aware that under the Senate Rules, the power of a committee chairperson to order the arrest or detention of any resource person cited in contempt is subject to the approval of the Senate President. Escudero said this safeguard exists to ensure that the Senates powers are exercised prudently, with due regard for the rights of all, and are not wielded for personal or political ends.

Hunt on for hitman who shot mayoral bet Kerwin Espinosa,"TACLOBAN CITY, Philippines The Albuera municipal police has launched a manhunt for the gunman in the shooting of self-confessed drug lord and Albuera, Leyte mayoral candidate Kerwin Espinosa . The operation is in coordination with the Special Weapons and Tactics team. In a statement Friday, the Police Regional Office 8 said they are doing everything to determine the motive and ensure that justice is served. PRO-8 assures the public that all efforts are being exerted to maintain peace and security, especially during the election period. We urge anyone with information to come forward and coordinate with authorities, it said. Espinosa is running against incumbent Mayor Sixto Dela Victoria and Vince Rama, the brother-in-law of Ormoc City Mayor Lucy Torres-Gomez. He was seriously wounded after an unidentified gunman shot him while campaigning inside a gymnasium in Tinag-an village at about 4:30 p.m. on Thursday. Police said while the victim was sitting and waiting for his turn to speak, the gunman, who was hiding on the stage ceiling, shot him from behind. Also injured were Espinosas sister Mariel Espinosa Marinay, who is running for vice mayor, and a girl. The victims were immediately assisted by their supporters and transported through private vehicles to a hospital in Ormoc City. In a video message, Espinosa said the incident would not affect his determination to join the mayoral race to continue his fathers plan and serve the people. The candidate was released from jail in 2023 after the Regional Trial Court in Baybay City junked the drug-related case against him for lack of evidence. Former President Rodrigo Duterte accused Kerwin and his father, former Albuera Mayor Roland Espinosa, of their involvement in the narcotics trade after a police raid that found P11 million worth of shabu near the familys residence in Albuera.

Birdwatching takes flight in Ilocos Region,"LAOAG CITY, Philippines The Department of Tourism has teamed up with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to promote birdwatching in Ilocos region. This initiative is being taken not just for leisure but for conservation, awareness and sustainable livelihood. About 30 professional and amateur birders, photographers and enthusiasts took part in the first birdwatching caravan held in the region from April 4 to 9. This event documented several avian species in their natural habitat. Gaye Acacio, chief tourism operations officer of the DOT Region 1 , told the Philippine News Agency on Thursday that one of the most celebrated birding destinations is the Kalbario-Patapat Natural Park. It is a protected area in Ilocos Norte under Republic Act 11038. With its relatively intact ecosystems, the park has been identified as a key biodiversity area, an important bird area, and part of the East-Asia-Pacific flyway of migratory birds, she said. The Kalbario-Patapat Natural Park in Pagudpud, Ilocos Norte is where the home of the majestic hornbill and grey-faced buzzard and other raptors that pass through during the migratory season, she said. These sightings are more than just spectacles they are symbols of how deeply connected we are to the natural rhythms of the earth, she emphasized. Acacio lauded a group of growing bird enthusiasts both local and abroad for keeping the passion alive and for putting the region on the international birding map. Michael Calaramo, bird expert and acting director of Ecosystem Management and Development Office Ecotourism Park and Botanic Garden of the Northwestern University in this city, in turn, expressed commitment to forge more partnerships with the DOT and DENR. These partnerships result in events like the hosting of international symposium for birds. Based on the annual Asian Waterbird Census, the legendary Paoay Lake Natural Park has been providing shelter to some bird species. The species are Little Grebe, Great Egret, Little Egret, Cattle Egret, Philippine Duck, Tufted Duck, White-browed Crake, Common Kingfisher, White-collared Kingfisher, White-throated Kingfisher and the Great Cormorant. Birders who visited the Kalbario-Patapat Natural Park have also reported at least 18 bird species. The endemic species include the Common Emerald Dove, Green Imperial Pigeon, Turtle Dove, Scops Owl, Rufous Hornbill, Philippine Forest Kingfisher, Coleto, Woodpecker, Hanging Parakeet, Quail, Labuyo or wild chicken, Brahminy Kite, Tarictic Hornbill, Serpent Eagle, Philippine Hawk Eagle and Little Crow. The introduced species are Zebra Dove and Crested Myna. According to the DENR, the Philippines has 117 Important Bird Areas covering 32,302 square kilometers.

"DENR, developer of Masungi Georeserve face off in the Senate","MANILA, Philippines Executives of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Blue Star Construction Development Corporation , an affiliate of the Masungi Georeserve Foundation that manages the property, faced each other in the Senate on Friday over their long-standing dispute. This was after the Senate blue ribbon panel held an inquiry into the DENRs cancellation of its Supplemental Joint Venture Agreement with Blue Star. Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga insisted that what happened to Masungi was not a special case. This is not a special case it is the law. As I had previously stated regarding this issue which is among the millions of hectares that the DENR and this office preserve, conserve, and manage everyone must comply with the law, said Yulo-Loyzaga. According to her, the Supplemental Agreement about a 300-hectare area within what geologists call the Masungi Limestone Formation was intended for government employee housing. However, a 2014 Commission on Audit review raised significant concerns, specifically the lack of proper bidding, minimal project implementation, and absence of a required presidential proclamation. These findings, confirmed by the DENR internal investigation spanning several administrations and more recently upon consultation with the office of the Solicitor General and the Department of Justice, compel the DENR to cancel the agreement due to its legal infirmities, said Yulo-Loyzaga. Let me be clear, this department respects prior rights. But these rights must align with existing laws and regulations, she added. But it was a different story for Blue Star. According to its Director for Advocacy, Billie Dumaliang, they did not receive a single notice about the supposed violations being pointed out by the DENR to defend the cancellation of the agreement. We did not learn about this cancellation from formal processes and were not given a chance to dialogue with the DENR Secretary or high officials despite multiple requests to do so, said Dumaliang. She then pointed out their continued belief that their work is consistent with the Expanded National Integrated Protected Areas System law and the spirit and objectives of the ENIPAS law. In the terms of the ENIPAS law, it says that the law must be interpreted liberally in favor of conservation. Kaya naman po inilathala ang mga batas na ito para ma-protektahan ang mga nanganganib nating gubat at ito mismo ang ginagawa ng Masungi at ng Blue Star, she insisted. We uphold, protect, and promote the ENIPAS law, not only Masungi but across all protected areas in the Philippines where we have become a big voice in terms of environmental protection, she added. For his part, Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano who was presiding over the hearing called on the creation of a technical working group tasked with identifying viable solutions to resolve the disputes that led to the DENRs cancellation of its agreement with Blue Star. The senator also emphasized that the dispute presented an opportunity to address long-standing issues in the conservation area. I felt this is an opportune time, but also a caution to all of us, including the Senate and the government, that people are watching. I [hope] we can conclude this in a very sober way and find real models, he said. The dispute arose from the DENRs termination of its Supplemental Joint Venture Agreement with Blue Star, citing the companys alleged failure to build 5,000 housing units in Masungi. The Masungi Georeserve Foundation, affiliated with Blue Star since 2017, claimed that the government failed to clear illegal settlers as promised and accused the DENR of evading meaningful dialogue.

Revilla says cooler heads must prevail amid road rage surge,"MANILA, Philippines AGIMAT party-list Representative Bryan Revilla has called for sobriety and unity following a shooting incident in Antipolo City that left one person dead and two others injured, as well as a string of other road rage incidents that have drawn widespread public attention. The recent shooting and the series of road rage cases are both saddening and alarming, said Revilla, who also serves as assistant majority leader in the House of Representatives. Revilla, a car enthusiast and avid race car driver, underscored the need for responsible behavior on the road, especially within the countrys vibrant motoring community. Like many Filipinos, fun rides are a source of joy to me. But it must be made clear: there is no space for violence in the Philippine car and riding communities. In road disputes, cool heads must prevail, Revilla said. The lawmaker stressed that violent altercations on the road only aggravate the many more pressing issues confronting the nation. AGIMAT party-list, for its part, reminded the public to adhere to traffic rules and be mindful of the safety of others, including pedestrians. Government rules exist not to spoil the fun but to ensure safety while we are having fun, he added. While the Antipolo City shooting has sparked divided opinions among Filipinos, Revilla emphasized that the shared desire of all motorists remains clear: to return home safely. As we drive and ride, let us keep in mind that our families and loved ones are waiting for us at home, he said. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Dumaguete marine scientist to help restore damaged coral reefs in PH,"DUMAGUETE CITY A local marine scientist based at Silliman University in this city will lead a three-year research project designed to improve the management and protection of marine life. Aileen Pascual Maypa, associate professor at the SU Institute of Marine and Environmental Sciences, will be supported by Pew Charitable Trusts based in the U.S. and will help restore and rebuild damaged or declining coral reefs around the country. Maypa has been awarded the prestigious 2025 Pew Fellows in Marine Conservation. The quality of your research proposal, your professional record, and problem-solving abilities, and your potential to contribute to marine conservation were all factors in the selection committees decision, said Michele Haynes from the Pew fellowship program, in a letter dated December 2024, but which was publicly announced only at the end of March. Maypa and five other international researchers from China, Curaao, Indonesia, and South Africa arethe newest recipients of the Pew fellowships in marine conservation. I am grateful to the Pew. It is good to be appreciated at the global level for doing something that I love doing and which I believe contributes to the common good and sustainability of our future, said Maypa in an interview on March27. Founded in 1948, the Pew Charitable Trusts is an independent, non-profit global research and public policy organization with interests in communities, conservation, finance and economy, governance, and health. Its vision is to serve the public interest by improving public policy, informing the public, and invigorating civic life. The Pew Fellows Program in Marine Conservation, with more than 200 Fellows from 42 countries, supports mid-career scientists and experts around the world to undertake research to understand and mitigate pressing challenges in the marine environment. The information produced by the Fellows projects is crucial for guiding effective stewardship of complex ocean ecosystems. Maypa said she would be busy for the next three years accelerating the recovery of the countrys degraded coral reefs. This is important for us to do as coral reefs provide vital services to coastal communities,including shoreline protection, Maypa said. Reefs create habitats or homes for nearly a quarter of all marine species. My first objective is to develop science-based and community-friendly protocols for effective reef restoration, Maypa said. This includes developing toolkits outlining effective practices in the communities that can contribute to local and national biodiversity policy frameworks. Within three years, Maypa said she also aims to collaborate with coral restoration scientists, practitioners, and government agencies to convene the countrys first nationwide coral restoration-focused network. She said her work based at Silliman will be national in scope. Maypa said she is collaborating with UP Marine Science Institute in Diliman , the UP National Institute of Physics , the Mindanao State University in Tawi-Tawi , and the University of Guam-Marine Laboratory . Her third goal is to contribute to the developing National Coral Reef Program which, she said, has been combined with the Philippine Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan that will also contribute to the 3030 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The 3030 reference is a guide on how to implement the new global target of conserving 30 percent of the earths land and sea by the year 2030. This ambitious goal will be done by establishing Protected Areas and other effective area-based conservation measures. Maypa said that although there are many challenges at the local and national level on marine biodiversity conservation, the support from the Pew is a validation that there are people and international institutions that support our efforts. Among other local concerns, Maypa has been at the forefront of monitoring the current construction of a jetty port on Apo Island, which was given the go-signal by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the same government agency that had declared the Apo Island Protected Landscape and Seascape. She reminded the environment agency of their mandate on environmental protection, and not development. Maypa joins the ranks of only four other Filipinos who have been awarded the Pew Fellowship program that started 35 years ago in 1990 two of whom are National Scientists: Dumaguetes very own National Scientist Angel C. Alcala, National Scientist Edgardo D. Gome, Academician Jurgenne Honculada-Primavera, and former Silliman faculty member Rene Abesamis. Abesamis, last years Pew Fellow, gained national prominence when he called out Dumaguetes plan to reclaim 174 hectares, or 85 percent of the citys coastline as a monumental ecological disaster.

READ: Palace: Marcos unfazed by education crisis amid Its Showtime incident Every nation that aspires to achieve lasting progress must begin with the most fundamental investment, not in towering monuments of concrete and steel, but in something far more enduring, in its people, Marcos said. The landmark reform embodies our commitment to ensuring that every Filipino teacher is equipped with the skills and tools needed to teach with depth, with clarity, and with purpose. It is a vital step towards raising the quality of education for our present, and most importantly, our future generations, he added. According to Marcos, all nations are now investing heavily to prepare their studentswho will join the workforcefor a new economy focused on the digital space.

Taal Volcano update: Seismic activity still on; Alert Level 1 stays,"LUCENA CITY, Philippines The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology continues to detect seismic activity at Taal Volcano in Batangas. In its Friday morning bulletin, Phivolcs reported eight volcanic tremors lasting two to four minutes within the last 24-hour observation period. Alert Level 1 remains in effect, according to Phivolcs. The agency reminded the public that Taal Volcano remains in an abnormal condition and that this should not be interpreted to have ceased unrest nor ceased the threat of eruptive activity. On Wednesday, the agency recorded at least 20 volcanic earthquakes, accompanied by two volcanic tremors that lasted one to two minutes. Eighteen volcanic earthquakes were detected, along with one volcanic tremor that lasted three minutes, on Tuesday. No seismic activity was recorded last Sunday and Monday. Phivolcs defines volcanic earthquakes as those generated by magmatic processes or magma-related processes beneath or near an active volcano. Unlike tectonic earthquakes that are produced by faulting, volcanic earthquakes are directly produced by many processes and are therefore much more varied in characteristics, the agency explained. Volcanic tremors, on the other hand, are continuous seismic signals with either regular or irregular wave patterns and low frequencies. Tremors can be caused by different processes inside the volcano, including resonance triggered by magma or magmatic gas flowing through cracks and vents, successive overlapping low-frequency earthquakes, and eruptions of magma, Phivolcs added. During the latest observation period on Thursday, Phivolcs noted the emission of only 597 metric tons of sulfur dioxide from Taal Volcanos main crater, with plumes rising up to 400 meters high. This was lower than the 1,030 MT of SO recorded on April 7 and 8. Phivolcs classified the latest activity as a weak emission. There were no reports of upwelling of hot volcanic fluids in the main crater lake on Taal Volcano Island, located in the middle of Taal Lake.

"Acidre asks: Journalists cant be irresponsible, but vloggers can?","MANILA, Philippines House Assistant Majority Leader and Tingog party-list Rep. Jude Acidre has asked why there is a seeming leniency on how vloggers, bloggers,and social media personalities produce content, while journalists are held to high ethical standards. In a statement on Wednesday, Acidre questioned the mindset of some sectors, as they believe that social media influencers can say anything without facing consequences. According to Acidre, there should be no difference in terms of holding social media personalities and media workers accountable. Its both upsetting and honestly quite alarming that some influencers and online personalities today feel like they can say whatever they wantno matter how offensive, harmful, or untruewithout facing any consequences, he said. We dont allow TV, radio, or newspapers to publish or air irresponsible and harmful content. So why are we tolerating the same kind of speech on social media, where it spreads even faster and reaches even more people? he asked. Acidres statements came a day after a heated debate at the hearing of the House tri-committee hearing where Manila 6th District Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr. questioned a blogger for calling him stupid. Abante scolded another blogger, this time Elizabeth Joie Cruz, for badmouthing him. This led to a lengthy discussion on whether cursing on social media, particularly for public officials, should be considered part of or beyond the tenets of free speech. Abante was reminded by other bloggers, including Elijah San Fernando a labor leader who cited Supreme Court decisions that cursing public officials due to their work is allowed under free speech. READ: Abante, socmed personalities argue if cursing part of freedom of speech Antipolo 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop, however, noted that freedom of speech is not absolute, as it does not give people the right to violate other peoples rights. Acidres view echoes sentiments made by other lawmakers, that while anyone can exercise their freedom of speech, it can have repercussions if it violates existing laws. They act as if theyre above basic decency, beyond civility, and free from the responsibilities that come with having a public voice, he said. You cant just exercise your right to free speech at the expense of someone elses freedom to live with dignity, truth, and peace. As the saying goes, your right ends where my freedom begins, he added. The lawmaker also lamented that social media, instead of being a tool that connects people, has been used to divide and misinform the public. When influencers use their platform to spread lies, attack others, or stir hate, thats not free speech. Thats abuse. And its hurting real people, he added. One of the biggest reasons for the spread of fake news and harmful content on social media is this mistaken belief that freedom of speech means you can say whatever you want, no matter what. Thats just not true. The tri-committee has been tasked to probe the spread of disinformation online after several resolutions were filed and privilege speeches about the matter were delivered. Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Robert Ace Barbers was one of the lawmakers who delivered a privilege speech following rumors about him and the other chairpersons of the Houses quad committee, while they were investigating illegal activities in Philippine offshore gaming operators, the illegal drug trade, and extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administrations drug war. During the March 21 hearing, Abante lashed out at some vloggers who insinuated that lawmakers are dimwits, firing back by saying that these social media personalities are stupid because they write without thinking.

"Substandard steel, deadly risks: Bangkok collapse a warning for PH","MANILA, PhilippinesThe collapse of a 30-story government building in Bangkok is again raising alarm about the dangers of substandard construction materials and what they could mean for the Philippines when a major earthquake hits. At least 15 people were killed and more than 70 remain missing after the State Audit Office building, still under construction, came crashing down on March 28. The collapse was triggered by a magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck neighboring Myanmar but was strong enough to shake parts of Thailand. READ: The Big One and substandard rebars: A killer mix Investigators later found that the building had used steel bars made by Xin Ke Yuan Steel Co., a Chinese manufacturer using induction furnace technology a controversial process linked to weaker, lower-quality steel. Tests by the Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand confirmed that the rebars used in the building failed basic quality checks. They didnt meet standards for weight, chemical makeup, or strength. Thai authorities also revealed that the factory that supplied the steel had already been ordered closed months earlier for safety violations. The collapse has prompted Thai authorities to crack down on local manufacturers using IF technology. According to Thailands Industry Minister Akanat Promphan, seven steel factories that were found to be producing substandard steel have been shut down over the past six months even before the Bangkok collapse. Investigations into three more plants are still ongoing. These efforts have now intensified in light of the disaster, with the government also reviewing the quality certifications of IF-made rebars across the country. In other parts of Asia, China banned IF steelmaking in 2017 after finding that the process caused severe pollution and often produced substandard steel. Since then, many Chinese-made furnaces have been shipped to Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Indonesia has seen a rise in IF use over the years. Industry leaders there have raised concerns, especially given the countrys earthquake risks, but no official ban has been implemented as of 2025. Malaysia meanwhile imposed a two-year moratorium in 2023, suspending all new applications and expansions in the steel industry. The move, while not a full ban, was meant to give regulators time to reassess the sector under the governments New Industrial Master Plan. Japan and Taiwan countries known for strict construction codes require high-grade rebars for structural use. While theres no public record of formal bans, there are no known IF plants producing construction steel in either country. But in the Philippines, steel made from induction furnaces continues to be allowed and widely sold despite years of warnings from industry experts and environmental groups. In the Philippines, the Philippine Iron and Steel Institute has been sounding the alarm for years. Their lab tests have repeatedly found IF-made rebars being sold nationwide that are underweight, brittle, and fail to meet the Philippine National Standards the countrys benchmark for safe, high-quality construction steel. Rebars that dont meet PNS specs may look the same as stronger ones, but theyre more likely to snap or crumble under pressure especially in buildings, bridges, and roads meant to withstand heavy loads or earthquakes. Induction furnaces melt scrap metal using electricity. But unlike electric arc furnaces , IFs cant remove impurities in the steel. That makes the end product cheaper, but also more inconsistent and risky to use in construction. Environmental group SEEDS PH has called on the government to phase out IF steel altogether, calling it a pollutive, outdated, and dangerous technology. SEEDS PH Secretary-General Dona Cristino described the technology as a serious public risk: These IFs are like a double-whammy to us Filipinos: they destroy our environment and they produce substandard products, Cristino said in an online report. She also warned that many IF plants operate without updated environmental compliance certificates and pollution control permits violations of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The group says these products dont meet national standards and could put lives at risk, especially during typhoons and earthquakes. In 2019, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources created a technical working group to review steel production standards. But as of 2025, there is still no official ban or clear restrictions on IF-produced steel in the Philippines. Meanwhile, officials like Office of Civil DefenseUndersecretary Ariel Nepomuceno have made their position clear. Using substandard steel can compromise the strength of buildings, houses, and other structures such as bridges, warehouses, etc. Lives will be at risk if such buildings or structures collapse, Nepomuceno toldINQUIRER.netin an earlier interview.

Cebu hopes for return of Argao pulpit panels,"With the return of the Boljoon pulpit panels after about four decades, it turns out that another church in Cebu Province also lost its old pulpit panels many years ago. Built from 1788 to the 1830s, the church of Argao still hasalthough now unpalatably gildedits impressive retablos and pulpit with carved, polychromed panels, most likely similar in character to the Boljoon panels. Details are sketchy on the designs of the panels and when these were stolen, but Cebus heritage sector is also hoping for their return. Jobers Bersales, historian from the University of San Carlos and member of the Cebu Archdiocesan Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church , said that all of Argaos six panels are gone, replaced with newer ones. He said that there are still no leads on the whereabouts of these objects. Meanwhile, during the mass at Boljoon church upon the return of the panels, Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma thanked everyone involved in the return of the panels to the most beautiful pulpit. A rarity today, he delivered his homily in the pulpit, his third time to do so in his 49 years as a priest and prelate. He congratulated all Boljoonanons for the momentous occasion and mentioned that the pulpit panels are important because the Word of God becomes alive when preached and when reflected upon, pamalandong sa atong kinabuhi . Prior to their return, the pulpit panels, which were donated to the National Museum in early 2024, underwent diligent conservation by experts tapped by the Calahe Environmental Consultancy. Tats Rejante-Manahan and wood conservation specialist Cheek Fadriquela worked on the panels for several months, finishing the work in time for their return to the Patrocinio de Maria Santisima church on March 21. In a statement, Calahe said, The team did intensive material research and executed a conservation treatment plan to clean, consolidate, restore, and protect the panels so that they could have a longer life as they go back to Boljoon.

Maguindanao del Norte town placed under Comelec control,"MANILA, Philippines The Commission on Elections has placed the town of Datu Odin Sinsuat in Maguindanao del Norte under its control, following the murder of its municipal election officer. [D]ue to the death of Election Officer Abo and to prevent further violence, the [Comelec] hereby places Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao Del Norte, under Comelec control to ensure the peaceful and orderly conduct of the upcoming elections thereat, said Comelec Resolution No. 11126, which was promulgated on April 4 but was published only on Monday. The poll body designated Commissioner Noli Pipo as the commissioner in charge of Datu Odin Sinsuat, who shall exercise oversight functions and shall be the direct representative of the commission en banc in the town. READ: Election exec, husband slain in ambush in Maguindanao del Norte Once put under Comelec control, the poll body shall be the de facto government in charge of the locality and shall take immediate and direct control and supervision over all national and local officials and employees in the area. It also has full control and supervision over all national and local law enforcement agencies, including the police, as well as military personnel, for the purpose of ensuring the holding of free, peaceful, orderly, honest and credible elections in the town. Following the ambush and death of Lidasan-Abo on March 26, lawyer Muhammad Nabil Mutia, the provincial election officer, was designated to run the towns election office. Additional police personnel have also been deployed in Datu Odin Sinsuat and more police checkpoints along portions of the Cotabato City-Isulan highway have been set up since April 4. Comelec Chair George Garcia earlier called on the people of Datu Odin Sinsuat to not fear the Comelec control declaration, and that they should go on with their normal lives. He said residents should continue going to their workplaces and school and do their daily activities. According to Comelec, the additional soldiers and police officers deployed in the area would only maintain peace and order. They would not be allowed to stay within a 50-meter radius of the polling place. They would only be allowed to enter the voting precinct when they are going to cast votes and if there is an actual disturbance of peace and order therein. We want to make sure that no one will give up their lives again. This is our strongest answer to the ongoing violence there, Garcia said. Datu Odin Sinsuat has 82,586 registered voters, 104 clustered precincts and 39 voting centers, according to Comelec data. Based on the latest 2020 census, the town has a population of around 116,768 in 34 barangays. Garcia also assured that the officials and employees in Datu Odin Sinsuat would remain in their posts to allow the local government unit to perform its regular functions. If the violence is not because of the setup in the LGU or is not instigated by anyone in the LGU, why should we even interfere in the LGU? It will be a soft declaration of Comelec control, Garcia said. But if we see that the Comelec must control the entire LGU, why not? We will do that, he added. Garcia said the recommendation to place Datu Odin Sinsuat under Comelec control came from the police and military, following the series of violence reported in the town. Lidasan-Abo and her husband, Datu Jojo Abo, were murdered on March 26, two days before the start of the campaign period for local posts for the midterm elections in May. They were on their way from Cotabato City to the local poll office in Barangay Dalican of Datu Odin Sinsuat when they were ambushed at 8:30 a.m. by unidentified gunmen along the national highway in Barangay Makir.

"PH goal: Reduce maternal deaths to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030","MANILA, Philippines The World Health Organization has urged countries in the Western Pacific region, including the Philippines, to ensure that every mother and baby receive the care they deserve. Based on the WHO report released on Monday titled, Trends in maternal mortality estimates 2000 to 2023, there has been progress in reducing deaths among pregnant women worldwide. The maternal mortality ratio indicates the number of women who die during pregnancy or childbirth, which serves as a crucial measure of both womens health and how well health-care systems protect mothers. READ: Preventing maternal deaths For every 100,000 babies born in countries and areas in the region in 2023, 35 mothers died. This was 29 percent lower than in 2010 when 49 mothers died per 100,000 live births. However, despite this progress, too many families and communities still lose mothers and newborns to preventable causes. For instance, the number of pregnant Filipino women who died in 2023 was higher than the regional average. According to the report, 84 Filipino mothers died for every 100,000 babies born in 2023. This was despite the improvement of the MMR in the country, a 28-percent decrease from the 117 maternal deaths every 100,000 live births recorded in 2010. For the Philippines, it will be a race to meet the Sustainable Development Goal MMR of 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. Pregnancy and childbirth should be a time of joy, but for some families and communities, it ends in tragedy. The life of every mother and every newborn is precious, and we must do everything possible to save them, said Dr.Saia Mau Piukala, WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, at a press conference in Manila on Monday, which is World Health Day. We have the power to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths in our region. Every woman and every baby deserves the highest quality of care to ensure their survival and well-being, he said. According to Piukala, this requires not just better access to care, but a transformation in the quality of health care that women and newborns receive, particularly in the most vulnerable communities. The WHO also kicked off on Monday a yearlong campaign on maternal and newborn health called Healthy beginnings, hopeful futures to urge the health community to ramp up efforts to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths, and to prioritize womens longer-term health and well-being. According to the WHO regional director, governments can support better quality maternal health care by making sustained investments in safe and accessible maternal newborn care; supporting an enabling environment for health workers such as safeguarding uninterrupted access to water and sanitation; and ensuring health facilities are well-stocked with essential medicines and supplies.

Manila university ordered to close law school,"MANILA, Philippines The governments legal education regulator has ordered the closure of the College of Law of the University of Manila because of its dismal performance in bar examinations. The closure will take effect for Academic Year 2024-2025, the Legal Education Board said in a notice to the public on Monday. This decision was made after a thorough evaluation of the legal education institutions compliance with legal education standards and regulatory requirements, it said. The LEB added that UM was informed about the closure order on June 5 last year. However, the board said it has received information that the universitys College of Law continues to accept enrollees despite the closure. This prompted the release of the public notice with the board saying it does not recognize enrollment in the said school. The universitys law school was ordered to stop operations for failing to meet the minimum standards set by the LEB. In particular, it registered a dismal performance in the bar exams, while it also did not meet the prescribed curriculum and academic standards for legal education. The board also flagged several deficiencies in the schools institutional facilities and resources, which are necessary for quality legal instruction. Based on the Supreme Courts list of law schools performance, the UM College of Law did not have graduates who took the 2024 bar exams.

EPD chief sacked over alleged irregularities in arrest of 2 Chinese,"MANILA, Philippines Eastern Police District Director Brig. Gen. Villamor Tuliao was relieved from his post after alleged irregularities in the arrest of two Chinese nationals by one of his units, the Philippine National Police announced. This is no longer just about rogue officers. It is a failure of leadership. When discipline collapses, it begins at the top. Leaders will be held to the highest standards of accountability, PNP Chief Gen. Rommel Marbil said in a statement on Saturday. Marbil added that he ordered the Internal Affairs Service and the National Capital Region Police Office to conduct an investigation, stressing that administrative and criminal cases will be filed against officers proven to be involved. Those involved must be summarily dismissed from the service and permanently disqualified from holding any position in government. If the director is found liable under the principle of command responsibility, he will never be trusted with any position of leadership again, he said. According to the police, the incident took place last Wednesday, when EPD District Special Operations Unit personnel arrested two Chinese individuals in Las Pias City through a warrant for alleged violations of firearms regulations. A police investigation report said the operatives carted away millions in cash in local and foreign currencies, luxury bags, watches, jewelry and smartphones, with the DSOU personnel claiming it was part of a bribe by the Chinese individuals. T he report, however, added that operatives failed to wear body-worn cameras and provide a sketch or spot report as of Thursday morning. The operatives also allegedly did not coordinate with the Las Pias City police nor did they inform or have the approval of the EPD district director. READ: NCRPO sacks 31 cops over alleged irregularities in arrest of 2 Chinese NCRPO Director Maj. Gen.

Gatchalian wants Senate probe into bullying in Bagong Silangan High School,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Senates basic education panel will conduct a public hearing on April 8 to study Bagong Silangan High Schools bullying prevention policy. This was confirmed by panel head Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian in a Monday press conference. Tomorrow, we have a hearing on that. Our focus is policy, not so much on the individual incidents but the policy, Gatchalian told reporters when he was asked to comment on the matter. Gatchalian said he is concerned about the seemingly rampant cases of bullying in Philippine schools which appear to be more violent than before. This was after a viral video from Bagong Silangan High School in Quezon City showing three female students taking turns pulling a students hair. READ: https://newsinfDeped probes alleged student bullying in Quezon City Its very concerning, and its happening in our schools. Thats why we have a hearing tomorrow to know what the government should do what the government is doing and what our schools, principals, and parents are doing as well, Gatchalian said. For his part, the senator believes that the schools policies to prevent bullying are outdated. He said one angle that his panel would look at is whether there are sufficient guidance counselors in the school to manage such instances. We now have a new law the Mental Health and Wellbeing in Schools law. Pursuant to this, theres a need for schools to hire psychologists and guidance counselors. Where are we in terms of that? A guidance counselor is an important person in school because they are the ones being consulted by children when they have a problem. They are the ones being consulted by parents, but admittedly we are lacking in terms of that so for now they have appointed what they call guidance teachers, he said. Gatchalian added that officials of Bagong Silangan High School would surely be present at the probe, but he added that the panel has yet to decide whether or not they would invite the parents of the bullied child.

What happens after Kanlaon Volcano eruption? Phivolcs gives 3 scenarios,"MANILA, Philippines State seismologists are looking at three scenarios following the explosive eruption of Kanlaon Volcano in Negros Island early Tuesday morning. Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Director Teresito Bacolcol said no lava was seen at Kanlaon when they reported the volcanos explosive eruption. According to him, the volcano only emitted steam, but pyroclastic density current was also observed. Following the early morning eruption, what can the affected communities expect? Bacolcol said Phivolcs is not ruling out the possibility of the following scenarios: First, magma might slowly flow out of Kanlaons crater. Mababang pag akyat ng magma na umaagos lamang ang lava mula sa kanyang bunganga, the scientist identified. If this happens, this will probably take several months katulad ng nangyari sa Mayon Volcano na it took 6 months bago natapos, he explained. Second, rapid ascent of magma or the volcanos conduit might be blocked. The Phivolcs official said he believes the explosive eruption early Tuesday could have been triggered by blocked conduits which, later on, caused overpressurization. Ito ang nangyari dito eh Nabarahan ang conduit kasi for the past few days, halos wala tayong earthquakes, he pointed out. Two days ago, dalawang earthquakes lamang and mababa rin ang sulfur dioxide natin. So, ibig sabihin, nabarahan yung conduit ng bulkan and nagkaroon ng overpressurization kaya po sumabog, he noted. Bacolcol said if the second scenario happens, Phivolcs might raise the volcanos alert level from three to four. The movement of magma will stop temporarily and activity will slow down or disappear. Should the third scenario happen, Bacolcol said Phivolcs may lower the volcanos alert level from three to two. At present, Phivolcs said there is still no clear timeline on Kanlaons activities. Bacolcol, however, told the public that they will constantly monitor the volcano. To provide context, he recalled that in the history of Kanlaon, it only emitted lava once and it was recorded in 1092. Sana hindi [maulit]. We dont want that to happen, he said. Although kung mangyari man lang, we are hoping na katulad man lang sa nangyari sa Mayon Volcano noong 2023 na effusive eruption lamang mabagal na pagdaloy ng lava. Hindi siya explosive eruption, he remembered. Phivolcs earlier said the explosive eruption at the summit vent of Kanlaon Volcano began at 5:51 a.m. The eruption produced a voluminous bent plume approximately 4,000 meters tall that drifted southwest.

At the Clark Freeport Zone in Pampanga, a major investment hub in Luzon, Clark Water, a Manila Water Non-East Zone operating unit, recognizes its crucial role in driving economic growth in the province. As a key infrastructure partner of the Clark Development Corporation , Clark Water ensures sustainable water and wastewater management through innovative solutions, efficient operations, and continuous service improvements. Since Manila Waters acquisition of the operating unit in 2011, Clark Water has invested P4.2 billion in capital expenditures to enhance the quality of water and wastewater services provided to the locators of the Clark Freeport Zone. These investments covered new water and wastewater infrastructure, the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing facilities, and network improvement projects. These investments were strategically aligned with Clark Waters commitment to operational efficiency and long-term service sustainability within the CFZ. These efforts have resulted in 24/7 water service availability, 100% water supply and wastewater coverage, 100% compliance with the DOH-Philippine National Standards on Drinking Water and DENR Administrative Order 2021-19 on Effluent, and an impressive 6% Non-Revenue Water level.

Ortega: Names in Sara Duterte secret funds show mastery of system,"MANILA, Philippines Having weird names to certify receipt of confidential fund disbursements from Vice President Sara Dutertes offices may be an indication that there is a template on how to manage these allocations, La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V said on Monday. Ortega in a press briefing at the Batasang Pambansa was asked as to what might have been the mindset behind the use of peculiar names on the acknowledgement receipts of both the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education . The lawmaker did not give a specific answer, but he said it shows that people in the offices are familiar or have mastered a system on how to manipulate the funds. Well, I think they are already accustomed to this process. They knew how to run this system, more specifically about the confidential funds, Ortega said in Filipino. Whether they intended to use these names or not, they really knew what to do. Thats my opinion about this, there is a mastery of this system already. he added. ARs are proof of payment, or that funding for projects reached its intended beneficiaries and in the case of OVP and DepEd, some of these are informants who provided confidential information to officials. This is required by the Commission on Audit especially for payees that are not business entities. But both agencies, including DepEd who used to be under Duterte, came under fire after hearings of the House of Representatives committee on good government and public accountability revealed issues in disbursement. Antipolo City 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop first noticed that one of the individuals who signed the ARs was named Mary Grace Piattos a name similar to a restaurant and a potato chip who signed off an AR from the OVP. Later on, Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong showed two ARs one for OVP and another for DepEd which were both received by a certain Kokoy Villamin. However, the signatures and handwriting used by theVillamin in the two documentsdiffered. READ: House probe: OVP, DepEd CFs received by same man, different signatures Both names Piattos and Villamin were also not present in the Philippine Statistics Authority registry for live birth, death, and marriage. On Sunday, Ortega released the most-recent batch of weird names in ARs including multiple Fionas which refers to a character from fantasy film Shrek; a Magellan, which refers to Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan who landed in Leyte in 1521; and another individual with the surname Ewan, which is a Filipino slang for I dont know. READ: Magellan, Fiona found on list of VP Duterte secret fund recipients https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2050418/magellan-fiona-found-on-list-of-vp-duterte-secret-fund-recipients Previously, Ortega also released a set of names said to be from a grocery shopping list, while there were some names that sounded like a phone brand Xiaome Ocho. READ: Piattos kin, Xiaome Ocho also got VP Sara Dutertes funds Ortega Ortega also said that the House is also looking to shift its attention from the alleged fake names towards the legitimate personalities that signed ARs. According to Ortega, aside from the allegedly fictitious personalities, there are also over 600 individuals whose identities exist within the PSA database which means the next step is to check if they really got the CF allocations from OVP and DepEd. Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourthimpeachmentcomplaint, hinged on these allegations of CF misuse within her offices, and threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The articles ofimpeachmentwere immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trialto start forthwith if at least one-thirds of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition.

"PhilHealth has sufficient funds, Marcos assures public","MANILA President Ferdinand R.

"Magellan, Fiona found on list of VP Duterte secret fund recipients","MANILA, Philippines The list of non-existent recipients of the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Educations confidential funds continues to grow, this time with multiple Fionas, a Magellan, and an individual with the surname Ewan a Filipino slang for I dont know. House Deputy Majority Leader and La Union Rep. Paolo Ortega V bared another list of odd names, which he said resemble known Filipino figures and add to the fueling concerns about the authenticity of government disbursements. According to Ortega, Honeylet Camille Sy, Feonna Biong, Feonna Villegas, and Joel Linangan were listed as alleged beneficiaries of the OVPs P500-million CF, while Fiona Ranitez, Erwin Q. Ewan, Ellen Magellan, Gary Tanada purportedly received portions of the DepEds P112.5-million CF. These CF recipients with odd names also have no official birth, marriage, and death records from the Philippine Statistics Authority , but these names were on the list submitted by the OVP and DepEd to the Commission on Audit . This is not funny anymore; they repeatedly use fake names they seem to get from movies and showbiz, Ortega said in Filipino. We are talking about public funds here. If they cannot present evidence that these are real people then this will be strong evidence against VP Sara Dutertes impeachment trial, he added. READ: OVP fund recipients have names resembling groceries: Harina, Bacon Earlier, Ortega unveiled a set of names he dubbed as Team Grocery.

READ: More food names found on OVP secret fund receipts: Kamote, Mango In December 2024, the House committee on good government and public accountability submitted 1,992 individuals linked to the alleged misuse of the OVP confidential funds. Citing the PSA, Ortega said 670 of the 1,992 names had a most likely match in PSA records; 1,322 individuals had no birth records; 1,456 had no marriage records ; and 1,593 had no death records . Earlier, panel chair Manila 3rd District Rep. Joel Chua said 405 of the 667 names found on the acknowledgment receipts for the CFs of the Duterte-led DepEd have no record with the PSA. Ortega said the use of aliases in government transactions is not new, including in operations involving sensitive intelligence work, but the use of fictitious names must comply with the documentation requirements outlined in Joint Circular 2015-01, which governs the handling of confidential and intelligence funds. Under the circular, agencies must maintain sealed logs linking aliases to real, verifiable identities, to prevent fraudulent use of public funds. Failing to do so could constitute misuse of state resources, Ortega pointed out. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Defensor: Anti-political dynasty bill must not disenfranchise voters,"MANILA, Philippines Iloilo 3rd District Rep. Lorenz Defensor said there needs to be a balance in crafting a bill seeking to ban political dynasties in the country. While he agrees with calls to craft a bill defining and banning political dynasties, he saidvoters who prefer certain candidates should not be disenfranchised. And that the rights of people who want to enter public service are not infringed. Defensor, during a virtual briefing on Wednesday, said this after being asked about a petition filed before the Supreme Court asking the judiciary not to tolerate Congress inaction on the 1987 Constitutions prohibition of political dynasties. Article II, Section 26 of the 1987 Constitution states that the government should prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law, which means that an enabling law crafted by Congress is needed to enforce this. We should define what a dynasty should be under a law that will be passed by Congress. And Im very open to discussing that, especially if the Supreme Court itself will issue a mandamus. There have been many pending bills about the anti-dynasty law in Congress and its about time we deliberate on that seriously so we can define what a dynasty is, he said. Because unless and until a clear definition of what a dynasty is, it will be very hard for us to exercise our democratic process [] we dont just say that because you are the brother of a senator, youre the niece of a governor, or you siblings are in politics, its automatically a dynasty. We should have a reasonable definition so as not also to infringe the rights of individuals to enter public service, he added. READ: Bam Aquino to refile anti-political dynasty bill if elected According to Defensor, fat dynasties or family members taking turns to occupy a certain elective position will always be bad for the government. However, the lawmaker also noted that such a process occurs because of term limits set by the Constitution. Fat dynasties are always bad. So what is a fat dynasty? Fat dynasty, person A, his wife, children, cousin, siblings, are in politics, and its partly because also of the term limits where where someone has ended his term, he will select someone from his family and after that, that member of the family will stay on, and after his or her term expires they will select another one, he said. If you compare our political system with mature democracies where it is one member of the family like Joe Biden for example, since he has no term limits, he was able to serve continuously, sitting in his district, holding on to his Senate seat and that politician becomes a statesman with a mature political sense [] So we have to strike the perfect balance between term limits and political dynasties, he added. Defensor noted that changing term limits would have to be a constitutional amendment, which he admitted will be hard since not even proposed economic changes to the 1987 Constitution were approved. Everyone hates it when I propose amendments to the constitution every term. When we discuss constitutional convention or constituent assembly, I am always the enemy. It will be even harder to amend the term limitsbecause we cannot even pass simple changes to economic provisions, what more for political provision. So thats even harder, he said. But its a start if we have a political dynasty bill for discussion next Congress. Its a good start, he added. Thin dynasties, meanwhile, can be acceptable according to the lawmaker. To some extent, yes. Its no longer a dynasty if theres only one person in power, like in the case of Jovito Salonga, its only Jovito Salongga among his relatives who became a member of Congress, he was the only senator, only him became a Senate President, he said. You become a statesman. When you have maturity and your term continues []As long as they are voted by the people, you always have to bring it backto the constituency. Its hard to stop the people from picking their preferred candidates, he added. Banning political dynasties has been a repeated call from many cause-oriented groups, noting that having many members of a family on different elective posts hinders growth and weakens checks and balances. However, the absence of a law disallowing dynasties have prevented poll-related agencies, like the Commission on Elections, from enforcing a ban. READ: Comelec junks poll protest vs Erwin Tulfo Last Monday, 1-Sambayan coalition submitted a 48-page petition to the SC, seeking the High Tribunals help on prompting Congress to come up with an anti-political dynasty bill. According to the petitioners, they want SC to hold Congress in contempt should they fail to comply within one year if the petition is granted. Congress failure to enact an enabling law, since the Constitutions ratification in 1987 up to date, has not only rendered Article II, Section 26 of the Constitution inutile but also allowed political dynasties to concentrate power within a few families, undermined the democratic process, and ultimately exacerbated poverty and inequality among our people, it added. READ: Another petition to enact Anti-Political Dynasty law filed Defensor however doubts that the SC would issue a writ of mandamus as the Constitution did not issue a deadline on when the bill should be formed.

I dont think the Supreme Court will act or issue a mandamus against Congress to compel it because this is purely a political question whether the members of Congress are willing to pass a bill.

Imee to Palace: Allow Cabinet execs to talk about Dutertes arrest,"MANILA, Philippines Presidential sister Sen. Imee Marcos has appealed to Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin to reconsider and allow invited Cabinet executives to attend the second hearing of the Senate inquiry into the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte set on Thursday. In a letter dated April 1, which was only released to the media on Wednesday, the senator said she finds none of the justification provided by Bersamin sufficient to ban executive officials from attending the hearing of the Senate foreign committee, which she chairs. Bersamin earlier said the Palace has decided to respectfully decline the invitation to attend the April 3 hearing of the Senate panel led by Marcos, citing executive privilege and the sub judice rule. Regrettably, the undersigned finds none of the reasons you adduced in the letter as sufficient justification for the refusal of executive officials to attend the hearing, said the senator, who is the eldest sister of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Foremost, the findings you referred to in your letter, while sufficiently backed by factual and legal bases, are nonetheless preliminary, she added. The senator argued that her panel is keen to provide the executive officials an opportunity to clarify issues and questions that surfaced at the last hearing. READ: Cabinet done with Sen. Marcos probe of Duterte arrest There are likewise new pieces of information that the Committee has received, and in the interest of fairness and transparency, the Committee would like to give executive officials a chance to explain their side relative to these new pieces of information, she emphasized. With this, she expressed hope that the Palace would reconsider its decision and allow invited Cabinet members to attend the scheduled hearing. While the Palace has yet to issue a response, the senator said the second hearing on Dutertes controversial arrest would push through on April 3. Duterte was arrested on March 11 on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court which charged him with crimes against humanity for the bloody drug war he orchestrated when he was still in power.

CCTVs in classrooms proposed to deter bullying,"MANILA, Philippines Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian on Monday said the government should consider installing closed-circuit television cameras in classrooms to prevent violence between students in public and private schools. Thats also a very good idea. In fact, we received suggestions that [the government] should really fund the installation of CCTVs in schools, Gatchalian said in a press conference. He noted that some schools had actually placed security cameras within their premises, but these were mostly provided by local governments. Gatchalian, who chairs the Senate committee on basic education, made the remarks a day before a scheduled inquiry into a spate of violent incidents involving students, including the death of a 14-year-old girl who was stabbed dead by her classmate inside their school in Paraaque City. READ: Grade 8 student stabs to death classmate in Paraaque City He noted that after this, there was a viral video of a young female student who was physically attacked by two other girls inside a classroom. The senator said these incidents should not have happened if school officials had strictly implemented the antibullying policy. Bullying has become more violent, Gatchalian lamented. The victims were not only bullied, but their videos were even uploaded [in the internet] to shame them. Its very concerning and its happening in our schools, he added. According to Gatchalian, the Senate inquiry will focus on the current policies of the Department of Education and other academic institutions in addressing the problem of school violence. He said the school officials and parents of students involved in such incidents should be told they could face civil suits. We will conduct a hearing to know what the government should do and what the government is doing, and what our schools, the principals and the parents are doing as well, he added.

Captured rebel leads Army to NPAs hidden weapons in Quezon,"LUCENA CITY An alleged member of the New Peoples Army , who was captured last week, led government forces to a cache of firearms hidden by his comrades in Lopez, Quezon province. Colonel Jeffrex Molina, chief of the Armys 2nd Infantry Division Public Affairs Office, reported that Queen guided soldiers to the hidden weapons in Barangay Mal-ay on Sunday, April 6. Government troops recovered an M16 rifle, two anti-personnel mines, four M16 magazines with 67 rounds of ammunition, 20 rounds of M14 ammunition, and assorted tools and equipment used in the production of improvised bombs. Major General Cerilo Balaoro Jr., 2nd ID commander, attributed Queens arrest to the continuous counterinsurgency operations and intensified collaboration with local communities and former rebels. Their firearms, explosives, and war materiel are now being recovered one by one, preventing them from launching hostile actions against our people, Balaoro said in a statement. On March 27, Queen and a companion were captured by policemen in Lucena City. Investigators said Queen had been tasked by the NPA to collect permit-to-campaign fees from election candidates in Quezon province. In previous elections, the rebels reportedly demanded not only cash but also food, rice, medicines, communication equipment, and even firearms from targeted candidates in exchange for allowing uninterrupted campaign activities within areas considered to be NPA strongholds. Queen is listed as the most wanted criminal in the Calabarzon region . He is facing six warrants of arrest for double homicide, attempted homicide, multiple counts of attempted murders, frustrated homicide, and violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020.

MMDA official who shamed cop in viral video keeps job,"MANILA, Philippines The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority said on Monday that Gabriel Go will remain the head of its Special Operations Group-Strike Force although he has been ordered to undergo training, particularly on anger management. As SOG-SF head, Go leads the MMDA body tasked to remove road obstructions in Metro Manila to allow the free flow of vehicles and pedestrians. He recently drew flak after he shamed an apologetic policeman in Quezon City who had parked on the sidewalk as the SOG-SF was conducting clearing operations on March 25. The incident was captured in an online video which went viral, prompting the MMDA to say it will take disciplinary action against Go who also publicly apologized for the incident. READ: MMDA exec apologizes for shaming cop during clearing op As directed by MMDA Chair Don Artes, Go will undergo a five-day training mentorship coaching on traffic management, focusing on leadership, courtesy and discipline and with special attention on stress and anger management. Artes decision on Go is not a form of punishment, but more for his self-improvement, the MMDA said in a statement. The five-day training mentorship coaching shall be under the guidance of Edison Nebrija of the MMDA Traffic Education Division, who was Gos predecessor before he was suspended in November 2023 after claiming that Sen. Ramon Bong Revilla had been apprehended for using the Edsa busway. The MMDA Legal and Legislative Affairs Staff office also reprimanded Go for simple discourtesy with a stern warning that a similar incident would be dealt with more severely. An administrative complaint has been filed against him for discourtesy toward the police officer.

"VP security group reorganized, not disbanded AFP","MANILA, Philippines The Armed Forces of the Philippines on Saturday clarified that the Vice Presidential Security and Protection Group was not disbanded but reorganized. This clarification was issued following reports that the VPSPG had been dissolved by AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. In a statement, the AFP said the reorganization of the VPSPG into the AFP Security and Protection Group was part of its rationalization and streamlining efforts, which took effect last February, as approved by the Department of National Defense. This administrative adjustment was undertaken to unify security and protection operations. It ensures the continued, uninterrupted, and robust protection of the Vice President within a more integrated and optimized framework, the AFP explained. The current setup is also more efficient and effective in ensuring the safety and security of the present and future vice presidents. It is worth noting that the VPSPG was only created in June 2022. Prior to this, Vice Presidents were secured by the Security and Protection Battalion under the AFP General Headquarters and Headquarters Support Command, with no dedicated military security group, the AFP said.

"7 drug suspects in Calabarzon yield P2M worth of shabu, 2 guns","LUCENA CITY Seven suspected traffickers were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday yielding more than P2 million worth of shabu and two illegal firearms in police operations in Cavite, Laguna, and Quezon provinces. The Police Region 4A reported Thursday that anti-narcotics operatives in Dasmarinas City, Cavite held Vin at 10:55 p.m. on Wednesday after he sold P50,000 worth of shabu to an undercover police officer in Barangay San Agustin 2. Seized from Vin were three sachets containing shabu weighing 150 grams worth P1,020,000. The report tagged the suspect as a high-value individual in the illegal drug trade. HVI refers to financiers, traffickers, manufacturers, and importers of drugs or leaders/members of drug groups. Later at 2:45 a.m. Thursday, the same team of operatives busted Barok in Barangay Burol Main, also in Dasmarinas City. The suspect, also an HVI, was caught in alleged possession of six sachets containing meth weighing 95 grams valued at P646,000. In Tanay, Rizal, police arrested Marc and Dada at 11:58 a.m. on Wednesday in Barangay Sampaloc.

Supreme Court asked to nullify Naia concession deal,"MANILA, Philippines A group of lawyers on Monday asked the Supreme Court to nullify the concession contract for Ninoy Aquino International Airport , citing violations of constitutional rights to due process and equal protection under the law. In a 182-page petition for certiorari and prohibition, lawyers Joel Butuyan, Ma. Soledad Derequito-Mawis, Antonio Gabriel La Via, Roger Rayel, and Jose Mari Benjamin Francisco Tirol urged the high court to declare unconstitutional, illegal, and void both the Manila International Airport Authority Administrative Order No. 1, series of 2024, and the Naia Public-Private Partnership project concession agreement. They also sought to stop the implementation of both measures. The petitioners further asked the high tribunal to direct the respondents to restore the status quo at Naia as of Sept. 13, 2024, before the handover to a private operator and before the effectivity of MIAA RAO No. 1. READ: Consumers question Naia concession deal, fee hikes Named respondents were Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, representing Cabinet members; the Department of Transportation ; MIAA; the Prequalification, Bids and Awards Committee for the Naia PPP Project; and the PPP Governing Board, as well as private concessionaire New Naia Infra Corp. . According to the petitioners, the government has left the Filipino people and Naia users to fend for themselves under an administrative rate regulation that they said not only violates the law and public policy but also defies the all-important constitutional provisions on separation of powers, due process, and equal protection of laws. They warned that a Supreme Court ruling upholding the concession agreement would open the floodgates to an open and institutional connivance between the government and business conglomerates or other private entities to partner in operating public utilities, government monopolies, and government facilities, which will disregard the mandate of the law to protect the public interest and to shirk from the obligation to provide affordable and accessible public services. As it stands, the Naia PPP Project is just privatization for privatizations sake. From inception to implementation, the Project was never designed with the common good or public welfare in mind, the petition read in part. The P170.6-billion concession agreement, dated March 18, 2024, is a contract between the DOTr, MIAA, and NNIC covering the rehabilitation, operation, expansion, and eventual transfer of Naia. It grants NNIC the right to operate and maintain the airport for 15 years, extendable by another 10 years. NNIC began collecting fees and charges at Naia on Oct. 1, 2024, following RAO1, enforcing substantially increased rates from higher vehicle parking rates to land lease rentals and office space rentals, to aircraft landing and takeoff fees, to tacking fees and passenger processing fees, among others. The lawyers argued that the bidding did not comply with and was in violation of the provisions of the new PPP Code signed into law on Dec. 5, 2023, and took effect before the bidding on Dec. 23, 2023. They also argued that the adoption and integration of RAO1 into the concession agreement violated their right to procedural due process, pointing to the lack of genuine and meaningful public participation. The petition cited strong opposition and serious objections from airline groups, including the Air Carriers Association of the Philippines, the Board of Airline Representatives, the Airline Operators Council, and the International Air Transport Association Philippines. None of these objections, they said, were addressed during the sole public hearing conducted by MIAA on Feb. 12, 2024. The lawyers warned that without immediate action from the high court, the continued implementation of RAO1 and the concession agreement could cause grave injustice and irreparable damage to millions of Filipinos and foreign travelers, as well as to airlines, concessionaires, and lessees now paying increased rates under the contested administrative order. Given the circumstances, the extreme urgency of and paramount necessity for a temporary restraining order, writ of preliminary injunction or status quo ante order issued by the Honorable Court cannot be overstated, the petitioners said.

Fire razes Gabaldon-style school building in Albay,"LEGAZPI CITY Flames engulfed a Gabaldon-type building of Camalig North Central School early Tuesday morning in Camalig town in Albay province. Residents near the school located at Barangay Salugan said the fire started between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. and lasted more than two hours. The Camalig Bureau of Fire Protection responded but due to the spread and size of the flames, firemen from nearby municipalities of Daraga, Guinobatan, and Ligao had to come to aid them. Authorities declared the fire under control at 2:12 a.m. Damages were estimated to be at P11,447,520. No casualties were reported during and after the incident.

House prosecution in VP Duterte impeachment tapped trial lawyers solon,"MANILA, Philippines Despite a continued refusal to name names, Iloilo 3rd District Rep. Lorenz Defensor has divulged that some of the private lawyers tapped by the House prosecution for Vice President Sara Dutertes impeachment trial have prior experience with similar proceedings. In an online interview on Wednesday, Defensor said the lawyers who have helped him and the rest of the House prosecution team are practicing lawyers who have experience in previous impeachments. They are practicing lawyers and litigators whove had experience in previous impeachments. Thats as far as I can go. So at least they have experience in impeachment trial, said Defensor, one of the lawmakers tapped to form part of the prosecution team. Some of them are returning to help and volunteer, he added. So far in the countrys history, there have been several successful impeachments of high-ranking officials, but there were only two cases that have made it to a Senate trial that of former President Joseph Estrada and the late Chief Justice Renato Corona. Estrada was accused of bribery, graft, and corruption in the impeachment complaint, while Corona was convicted for not disclosing his wealth in his Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth. Until now, both the House leadership and the prosecution team have been tight-lipped regarding the set of private lawyers helping build the case against Duterte. Last March 19, House Secretary General Reginald Velasco disputed reports that DivinaLaw, one of the more prominent law firms in the country, was tapped by the prosecution team to help them. READ: DivinaLaw not part of House prosecution team in VP trial Velasco Velasco clarified this after news reports came out that he supposedly confirmed the law firms engagement during an interview while visiting the Senate for an ocular inspection. The House official did not mention the news report, but the Philippine Daily Inquirer ran a story stating that Velasco and their sources indicated that DivinaLaw would be leading the group of private prosecutors. READ: Lawyers helping House impeach team experienced, angry According to Defensor, he respects the decision of the prosecution panel, but he does not understand why the identities of the volunteer lawyers have to be withheld. Furthermore, the lawmaker said it would be the lead prosecutor, House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan, who would reveal the names of the private prosecutors. For me, its okay for them to come out in the open so that the private sector, which includes the private prosecution team, can also have a voice in this impeachment process. Especially with the media, right? So you would also get a sense of how they feel as a private citizen, Defensor said. Ill leave it to the lead prosecutor when he decides on that. We have communications between the different teams, articles, but with respect to when the private prosecutors can come out openly, Ill leave that to the lead prosecutor, he added. Last February 5, Duterte was impeached by the House after 215 lawmakers filed and verified the fourth impeachment complaint hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a vice president. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. Under the Constitution, the Senate will act as an impeachment court, with sitting senators as judges. READ: House impeaches VP SaraDuterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the petition was not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5. It means Congress would have to reconvene first after the election or through a special session to discuss the matter. Defensor previously said that they hope the impeachment trial would start immediately as the Constitution states, but he also said that they would respect the Senates decision regarding the timeline of the proceedings.

No reason for Senate to share Duterte findings with US Palace,"MANILA, PhilippinesTheres no reason for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations to share its findings with United States President Donald Trump, a Palace official said. Thats because the US respects the Philippines prerogative regarding the arrest and surrender of former President Rodrigo Duterte. But Sen. Ronald Bato dela Rosa made a suggestion otherwise, believing it is appropriate for the panel to forward its findings to Trump so that the assets of the aircraft owner that brought Duterte to the Netherlands can be frozen. READ: Dela Rosa wants sanctions against the owner of jet that flew ex-Pres Duterte Dela Rosa said this was in accordance with an executive order recently signed by Trump, stating that any non-American person or organization can face sanctions if they assist the International Criminal Court in investigating, arresting, or prosecuting a protected person without the consent of their country of origin. A protected person refers to a U.S. national or military personnel or any individual who is a lawful resident of a U.S. NATO ally or a major non-NATO ally, a designation the Philippines holds. But during Mondays briefing, Castro rejected dela Rosas suggestion by citing a portion of the same EO that the senator was referring to: The United States remains committed to the accountability and to the peaceful cultivation of international order at the ICC. And the parties to the Rome Statute must expect the decisions of the United States and other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICCs jurisdiction consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives. Castro explained in a mixture of Filipino and English, So, this means that through this executive order, the United States respects the prerogatives of countries that are considered its allies. Therefore, whatever prerogative our country exercises, the U.S. will respect it. ( READ: Dela Rosa hits Marcos betrayal to the max after Dutertes arrest Castro, in a briefing on March 14, confirmed that the Office of the President paid for the chartered plane that brought Duterte to ICC headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands. She said this was part of the administrations commitment to comply with the International Criminal Police Organization. This was not the first time that Dela Rosa criticized the Marcos administration over Dutertes arrest. The senator had previously accused President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of breaking his promise not to cooperate with the ICC on Dutertes case. He told me before: Dont worry, I will never cooperate with the ICC because after you, whos next? It might be us.

"DA eyes MSRP for garlic, eggs amid profiteering concerns","MANILA, Philippines The Department of Agriculture is considering the imposition of a maximum suggested retail price on garlic to prevent possible profiteering, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said. In a news release on Tuesday, Tiu Laurel said the proposal to impose an MSRP on garlic has been under discussion, but was placed on hold after the price per kilo dropped to around P100, down from a peak of P160. READ: DA sets aside P85M for small-scale egg production The higher price was double the estimated landed cost of P80 per kilo. Imported garlic accounts for 95 percent of the market supply, with significant volume being sourced from China. Since the price has fallen to around P100 a kilo, we had to hold back. I think the current price is reasonable given their cost of around HPP80, Tiu Laurel said. But if prices spike again, we will definitely implement an MSRP. The DA is also closely monitoring the prices of eggs to ensure they dont rise to unreasonable levels. Tiu Laurel noted that rising demand due to election spending and increasing chicken mortality from higher temperatures are contributing factors to the price fluctuations. He said DA monitoring places egg prices within the P6-P8 range, lower than the reported P10-P12. There are some who are suggesting we implement an MSRP on eggs but, as with other goods like rice and pork, we have to consult stakeholders first so as not to shock the industry, he said. Meanwhile, the DA on Monday further reduced the MSRP for imported rice to P45 per kilo from P49, reflecting the global decline in rice prices. For pork, the DA set an MSRP of P380 per kilo for liempo and P350 per kilo for kasim and pigue; and P300 per kg. for sabit-ulo following a series of stakeholders meetings across the hog industry.

DOTR: LRT-1 fare hike needed for Cavite rail extension,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Transportation underscored the importance of the fare hike of the Light Railway Transit Line 1 , which takes effect on Wednesday, particularly for the completion of the Cavite rail extension.

Abby Binay OKs landmark ordinance lowering property taxes in Makati,"MANILA, Philippines The Makati City government approved the highest amount of real property tax reduction in the city so far. Makati said it could still weather the revenue loss, thanks to the savings made following the departure of the 10 embo villages which the local government said are subsidiaries to the city coffers. Outgoing Makati mayor and senatorial candidate Abby Binay on Tuesday said she approved the ordinance that lowered existing real property tax rates on all classes of land in the city, effective January 1, 2025. On March 24, Binay signed City Ordinance No. 2025-047 amending sections of the Revised Makati Revenue Code, or City Ordinance No. 2004-A-025, which pertain to the imposition of basic real property tax and assessment levels. READ: Abby Binay, Pia Cayetano okay in same slate amid clan row Tiangco Following a comprehensive review of current tax rates and prevailing economic conditions, we have proceeded with our plan to lower tax rates for all classes of land in the city, Binay said in a statement. Binay said this move comes as the city had a substantive savings of up to P7.9 billion a year following the the removal of subsidies to 10 embo barangays. Residents and property owners in the city will now enjoy substantial savings from the biggest tax reduction and lowest assessment levels implemented by the city government to date, she added. Binay said the tax rate for residential properties has been reduced from 1.5 percent to 1.0 percent; commercial properties from 2.0 percent to 1.5 percent; industrial properties from 2.0 percent to 1.5 percent; and special properties from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent. Moreover, the additional tax rate for properties classified as residential/commercial has also been reduced from 0.25 percent to 0.125 percent. This move is expected to provide relief to residents and boost Makatis competitiveness as a premier investment destination for large corporations, startups, and small entrepreneurs, Binay said. READ: Senatorial bet Abby Binay not dwelling on being Alan Peters workmate The Supreme Court declared that Taguig has the rightful jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio Military Reservation where Bonifacio Global City and theEmbobarangays are located and not Makati. SC stated that that 10 barangays in Makatis second district based on historical, documentary and testimonial evidence, indeed fall within the territorial jurisdiction of Taguig. I believe we can manage very well even with lower RPT collection, Binay said. As more businesses choose to locate in Makati, our revenue from business tax and relevant fees will increase as well. More importantly, more jobs will be created for our residents, she continued. The tax rates for buildings, machinery, and other improvements remain the same, as follows: Under the amended of the revenue code, the assessment levels applied to the fair market value of real property to determine its assessed value have also been significantly lowered. For residential properties, the assessment level per classification has been adjusted as follows: Commercial and Industrial properties, previously assessed at 40 percent, are both assessed at lower rates. For commercial properties, the following assessment rates now apply: For industrial properties, the following assessment rates now apply: Under special classes, assessment levels have been retained for lands located in predominantly commercial/industrial areas at 0.70 percent, and lands situated in predominantly residential areas, 0.30 percent. For buildings, machineries, and other improvements, assessment values based on actual use remain as follows: Under Section 4, any excess that may result from the application of the ordinance on real property tax assessments that have been paid before the approval of the ordinance, covering the period Jan. 1, 2025 onwards, will be considered as a tax credit that may be applied to succeeding real property tax assessments.

DENR to set up ocean environment task force in Q2,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Environment and Natural Resources said it will set up a task force to enhance the countrys ocean and maritime governance by this year. During a forum organized by the Stratbase Institute in partnership with the Embassy of France in the Philippines, Environment Undersecretary Augusto Dela Pea said the DENR will set up an Ocean Environment Task Force by the second quarter of this year. READ: DENR eyes 8 new marine scientific stations Our goal is to drive organizational transformation within DENR for more effective ocean conservation. To achieve this vision, we have established the roadmap for the full organization of the Task Force in Q2 2025, Dela Pea was quoted by Stratbase as saying during the forum. According to Dela Pea, who also serves as OETF vice chair, the task force aims to enhance ocean governance, align national policies with international commitments, and incorporate scientific data into policy-making. Ultimately, he added, the DENR aims to institutionalize this task force as a permanent bureau. Meanwhile, other experts stressed during the forum the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach, involving policymakers, the private sector, communities, and international partners, particularly France, in the development of the countrys blue economy. French Ambassador to the Philippines Marie Fontanel, for her part, underscored the importance of the blue economy to the Philippines and France. Our shared responsibility is to combine economic development with environmental protection. France is fully committed to this dynamic, bringing its expertise in marine resource management, innovation for sustainable ocean exploitation, and the fight against illegal fishing, Fontanel said. We are convinced that dialogue and the sharing of best practices are key to building a future where economic growth and marine ecosystem preservation go hand in hand, she added. Stratbase Institute President Dindo Manhit shared similar sentiments, specifically, the need for collaborations with like-minded nations in advancing the countrys maritime future. We have now identified this growth area, bolstered by pronouncements from the executive and initiatives from the legislature, said Manhit. Now we are emboldened by the show of cooperation and partnership by an established blue nation in France, and driven by a desire to maximize the benefits of our resources and channel them to the ultimate good of the Philippine people, he added.

"8 plate in viral road rage vehicle looks fake, House official says","MANILA, Philippines House of Representatives Secretary General Reginald Velasco said on Friday the No. 8 car plate in one of the vehicles involved in a recent viral road rage video may have been faked. Velasco added that it could be a mere copy of the special protocol plates issued to members of the House of Representatives. In a statement, he said that the House condemns the misuse of the special plates, noting that the plate used by the motorist did not have the security features that the House places. The House of Representatives strongly condemns the misuse of the special protocol plate number 8 by the owner or driver of a vehicle recently involved in a traffic altercation, as seen in a viral video circulating online, he said. From watching the viral video, it would seem that the protocol plate is fake. It does not seem to have the security features of an original 8 protocol plate. Our law enforcement agencies can easily identify fake plates and confiscate them, he added. Videos on social media showed a person driving a Mitsubishi Montero with an `8 plate getting out of his vehicle to confront another driver on a Honda CR-V. The Montero driver threatened to shoot the person inside the CR-V before driving away. This marks the third road-rage incident in recent weeks. Two incidents had earlier transpired in Antipolo City, including one where a motorcycle rider was shot dead. READ: One of Antipolo road rage victims now dead police Velasco, meanwhile, urged authorities to probe the incident because using fake special plates is illegal, and erodes public trust on government officials. We urge the appropriate authorities to immediately investigate and hold accountable the individual in the video. Using a fake special plate number, if that is indeed the case, is illegal and constitutes a punishable offense under existing laws. It is a serious matter that undermines the integrity of official markings and erodes public trust, he said. READ: House, MMDA agree: Vehicles with 8 plates to be apprehended The special protocol plate 8 is issued exclusively for official use by sitting members of the House of Representatives. Any attempt to impersonate or abuse this privilege is a direct affront to the institution and the law, he added. Similarly, Velasco called on the public to be vigilant and report similar incidents. The House is fully committed to cooperating with law enforcement agencies to ensure that those who misuse government-issued protocol plates face the full force of the law, he noted. Last April 2024, Velasco already reminded lawmakers that the House has not issued any special 8 plates, noting that the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is mandated to confiscate these. READ: House SecGen: No authorized special plates for solons Then in November 2023, Velasco said they had entered into an agreement with MMDA about apprehending drivers using vehicles with the special 8 plates.The deal was made after reports came out that some individuals have been using old 8 numbers or replicas just to evade law enforcement.

"Alternative smoking methods may reduce carcinogen exposure, expert says","MANILA, Philippines A leading French oncologist said alternative smoking methods could reduce the bodys exposure to carcinogens as he pushed for harm reduction strategies in tobacco control. Professor David Khayat told the Cypriot newspaper Phileleftheros that traditional anti-smoking policies have been ineffective, citing the steady 1 billion global smokers that existed between 1990 and 2019. He argued that transitioning smokers to smoke-free alternatives could lower cancer risk. If we look closely at the statistics, we will find that in the coming years, we will have 60 million deaths worldwide due to lung cancer. Lets do something to prevent that, Khayat said. Anton Israel, president of the Nicotine Consumers Union of the Philippines, echoed this, saying that smoking, not nicotine, is the primary issue. We have achieved new smoke-free technologies that remove the harm from nicotine consumption. Products such as e-cigarettes, heated tobacco, and nicotine pouches reduce consumers exposure to carcinogens substantially, Israel said. Khayat clarified that nicotine does not cause cancer, with carcinogens stemming from the burning of tobacco. The burning of tobacco, which occurs in conventional cigarettes, produces thousands of substances. A percentage of these are carcinogenic. He said heated tobacco delivers nicotine with significantly reduced harmful substances compared to traditional cigarettes. Khayat said smoke-free technologies give the user the satisfaction that a smoker feels, but the percentage of harmful and carcinogenic substances that reach their body is reduced. He cited many scientific studies showing that the number and concentration of substances produced from smoking have to do with the high temperatures that occur during combustion. Khayat also criticized the World Health Organizations stance against harm reduction, suggesting a shift toward pragmatic solutions and warning that obesity may soon surpass smoking as a leading cancer risk factor. Khayat emphasized that harm reduction, as seen in the United Kingdom, acknowledges the difficulty of eliminating risky behaviors and aims to mitigate their effects. More than 64 percent of people who smoke and develop cancer do not quit and continue, he said. Thats why what I do and recommend now for those who dont quit smoking is to try to reduce the harm it causes. This could potentially be achieved through alternative smoking products, Khayat said. Khayat stressed the potential for alternative products to transition smokers away from cigarettes, urging for regulatory frameworks that balance access for smokers with preventing youth uptake. The goal remains smoking cessation. But because there will always be some who do not quit, we must include harm reduction in our efforts. The fewer carcinogens that enter the human body, the smaller the harm, Khayat said. He said if all smokers who do not quit smoking realize that there are better alternative options than cigarettes, and more people make the change, then we will gradually see the effects on public health. As global discussions on tobacco control intensify, tobacco harm reduction is expected to be a key topic at the upcoming WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Conference of the Parties in Geneva in November.

Senator JV Ejercito on Tuesday shared a Facebook video with a caption: A touch of humanity and consideration in public service and enforcement will be understood and appreciated.

Go added that the vehicle malfunctioned, causing it to be stalled on the sideways. While no commotion was formed between the two, the old man expressed defeat and asked for understanding. Ako po ay nagkasala pero ang akin lang po, kaunting konswelo dahil sa edad kong ito, hindi ko maitulak, the elderly expressed. Go then said while he understood the situation of the man, such an incident should not be ignored as it would be unfair to others. He added that the elderly should have asked for help from enforcers when he saw the clearing operations from the other side of the street. Many netizens in the comment section of the video pointed out the unfairness of the situation for the elderly. Yes, law applies to all and ignorance of the law excuses no one.

PAF lifts grounding of FA-50 jets; crash probe on final stage,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine Air Force has lifted the grounding of the 11 remaining FA-50 fighter jets less than a month after the crash of one of its aircraft in Bukidnon province that killed two pilots. Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo, PAF spokesperson, told the Inquirer on Tuesday that the FA-50 fleet has been on full operational status since March 25. In March, the PAF decided to ground its remaining 11 FA-50 jets amid an ongoing investigation on the death of the two of its pilots, Major Jude Salang-Oy and First Lieutenant April John Dadulla, after their fighter jet crashed at Mt. Kalatungan in Bukidnon. READ: PAF grounds FA-50 fleet after fatal Bukidnon crash The March 4 crash was the first recorded accident since the government acquired 12 units of FA-50 fighter jets from Korea Aerospace Industries , South Koreas sole aircraft maker. Castillo said the PAF is now on the finalization stage of an official report on the ill-fated fighter jet. On Monday, the PAF conducted a blessing ceremony for the pilots and the remaining FA-50 fighter jets. This cherished tradition is more than just a ceremonyit is a moment of prayer, dedication, and gratitude, as we entrust our aircraft, pilots, and personnel to Gods divine protection, the 5th Fighter Wing, Air Defense Command, said in a Facebook post. With every mission we undertake, we seek His guidance for safe flights and ground operations, ensuring that we uphold the highest standards of excellence, safety, and service throughout the year, it added.

Explainer: How a quiet court case threatens small-scale fishers,"MANILA, PhilippinesA small courtroom decision in 2023, quietly affirmed on a technicality, could unravel decades of protection for the Philippines smallest fishers. At the heart of the issue: Who really controls municipal waters? And do small fishers still have the right to call them their own? On October 5, 2023, Mercidar Fishing Corporation, a commercial fishing company, filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief before the Malabon Regional Trial Court . A Petition for Declaratory Relief is a legal move where someone asks the court to clarify whether a law or regulation is valid even before its enforced against them. In this case, Mercidar wanted the court to declare certain fisheries laws as unconstitutional, meaning they believed these laws go against what the Philippine Constitution says. Mercidar challenged parts of the Philippine Fisheries Code and its implementing rules, specifically Department Administrative Order No. 10, series of 2015. According to lawyer Rose-Liza Eisma-Osorio, acting vice president of Oceana, the case focused on two main issues: Limit the users of municipal waters to municipal fisherfolk, and give LGUs jurisdiction over municipal waters and the authority to allow limited access to commercial fishers under specific conditions. In simpler terms, Mercidar questioned why the law allows only small-scale fishers to fish in waters up to 15 kilometers from the shore . They also challenged the power of local government units to control these waters and set the rules for who can fish there. On December 11, 2023, the Malabon RTC declared unconstitutional the following provisions: From the Fisheries Code: From DAO 10-2015: The RTC held that these provisions violated constitutional supremacy. In its ruling, the court emphasized that control over natural resources belongs to the national government not local governments. As summarized by Atty. Osorio, the decision stated: The Constitution provides that municipal water is a natural resource that is owned by the State, and the authority over such resources is vested and delegated by the Constitution to the concerned national government agency, not with the LGUs. It further held that the Fisheries Codes provision for preferential treatment did not expressly exclude commercial fishing operations. The Malabon RTCs decision went unchallenged at the lower court level not because the government agreed with it, but because the Office of the Solicitor General , which represents the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Department of Agriculture , failed to file a timely response. During a hearing on November 10, 2023, the OSG made an oral motion asking for more time to submit its answer. But instead of acting on it directly, the court proceeded without granting a clear extension. The OSG later filed a written Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer, but again, the court did not approve it. Kahit may rules tayo, under the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, kapag may mga ganitong kaso dapat yung korte [ang] magbibigay ng kaalaman sa lahat ng apektadong ahensya []. Hindi nila ginawa, said Atty. Osorio. With no official response from the government, the court issued an Order of Default on December 7, 2023, which allowed Mercidar Fishing Corporation, the petitioner, to present its evidence ex parte meaning without the participation of the other side. Mercidar also withdrew its request for a temporary restraining order , submitted affidavits and documents, and rested its case. The RTC granted Mercidars motion and declared the petition submitted for decision, without any input from the government. This move raised serious questions among legal experts and environmental advocates. As Atty. Osorio pointed out, under Section 2 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, motions to declare a defendant in default are not allowed. Despite this clear rule, the court proceeded with the default ruling a highly unusual and controversial step in a case with national implications. Sana kung binigyan ng pagkakataon mag file ng answer yung gobyerno, nandoon yung mga substantibong argumento na pwede nilang ipasok sa kaso, Atty. Osorio explained. That same day, the OSG filed an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration, asking the court to reverse the Order of Default and allow them to submit their response. An Omnibus Motion is a legal filing that asks for multiple forms of relief in one motion. In this case, the OSG was trying to cancel the default ruling and participate in the case. But on December 20, the RTC denied the motion, calling it moot and academica legal term meaning it was no longer relevant because the court had already ruledand lacking in merit, meaning the court didnt find the arguments convincing. After the Malabon RTC declared parts of the Fisheries Code and its implementing rules unconstitutional on December 11, 2023, the OSG attempted to reverse the decision. But the process got off to a late start. On January 2, 2024, the OSG filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 before the Supreme Court. This type of petition is a formal request asking the high court to examine the decision of a lower court , but only if theres a legal question involved such as whether the lower court misinterpreted the law or went beyond its authority. But on August 19, 2024, the Supreme Courts First Division dismissed the petition not because it disagreed with the arguments, but because it was filed too late. The Court said the deadline to appeal had passed, and that the RTC ruling had already become final and executory. In legal terms, final and executory means that a courts decision is closed, settled, and can no longer be changed or appealedunless a very narrow exception applies, such as correcting a clerical mistake or invalidating a clearly void judgment. As Atty. Osorio explained during the Atin ang Kinse: A Convergence Summit for the Protection of Municipal Waters held on March 20: The Supreme Court reiterated the long-standing rule that when a judgment becomes final and executory, it becomes immutable, unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, except to correct clerical errors or to make nunc pro tunc entries or when it is a void judgment. The Supreme Court also pointed out that BFAR and DA, through the OSG, failed to prove that the RTC had made a reversible error a serious legal mistake that would justify canceling the original decision. However, Oceana and other petitioners are questioning the Supreme Courts timeline. According to Atty. Osorio, the Court considered December 11, 2023 as the date the RTC decision became final and started counting the 15-day appeal period from there. However, the government had filed an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration, which the RTC only denied on December 20. Sabi nila out of time na yung appeal na finile ng DA [at] BFAR [through] OSG noong December 11, 2023 [] Pero maalala natin, nag-file ng Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration pero sinasabi nila out of time na eh kasi December 11 [] Pero if you go back to the timeline, noong December 20 may decision sila [], said Atty. Osorio. She explained that if the court had used December 20 as the starting point, the OSGs January 2 filing would have been within the 15-day limit for appeals. Instead, the Court followed the December 11 date even though the motion for reconsideration was still pending at the time. So dapat ang counting nila na finile noong January 2, within the timeline, which is 15 days. Pero pag kinount mo from December 11, parang out of time kasi 20 days na yun So yun yung isa sa mga katanungan, she added. In simpler terms, Osorio argues that if the RTC decision wasnt yet final until December 20, then the OSGs January 2 appeal should have been considered on time. Because the Court chose to stick with the December 11 timeline, the petition was rejected, and the ruling that struck down key legal protections for municipal waters remains final and binding unless the Supreme Court later agrees to reopen the case. The full impact of the court ruling has yet to be felt and could still shift, depending on how the Supreme Court rules on the pending motions and interventions filed by government agencies, coastal communities, and advocacy groups. For now, the decision by the Malabon RTC stands. With key provisions of the Fisheries Code and its implementing rules struck down, local governments have lost their legal footing to regulate municipal watersthose stretching up to 15 kilometers from shore. These powers once allowed LGUs to issue permits, limit access to commercial fishing boats, and enforce local ordinances meant to protect coastal ecosystems and support small fishers. Also gone is the legal basis for giving municipal fisherfolk first rights to these waters. That opens the door for commercial fishing operations to enter the 10.1 to 15 kilometer zone an area previously subject to restrictions and LGU oversight. Whether or not that will happen widely remains to be seen, but the uncertainty alone has left many small-scale fishers anxious. Hindi ako sang-ayon, kasi kawawa talaga ang ating maliliit na mangingisda lalo na kung papayagan ang mga commercial fishing vessel na pumasok. Gumagamit sila ng mga gear na talagang nakakasira sa ating pangisdaan. Mas lalong mahihirapan ang maliliit na mangingisda, said Tomas Limboc Jr., barangay captain at Barangay Papaya in Nasugbu, Batangas. Sa pinatutupad na [desisyon] ng Supreme Court sa commercial fishing, tutol ako kasi kapag nakapasok yan dito sa pangisdaan namin, sigurado ang maapektuhan ang maliliit na mangingisda. Pag pumasok iyan sa ating area, wala nang isda pa na madadatnan [yung mga maliliit na mangingisda], he added. The fear is that increased competition in nearshore waters will push already vulnerable fishing communities further to the margins. Some groups say its not just a legal issue its a question of survival. Para sa aming maliliit na mangingisda, napakalaki talaga ng epekto nito. Ngayon pa lang, ramdam na namin ang mga panahong wala kaming nahuhuli. May mga gamit silang [modernong] gear, samantalang kami mano-mano lang. Alam pa nila kung saan maraming isda, said Mang Jin, a fisherfolk. Inaagawan nila yung mga tulad naming mahihirap na mangingisda, maliit na nga ang kita, kukunin pa nila [ang mga isda], he added. At the national level, the concern comes as fish production continues to slide. Data from the BFAR show that fish harvests in the third quarter of 2023 were the lowest in a decade, raising questions about sustainability and long-term food security. Yes and this question lies at the heart of the petitions now being filed by fisherfolk, local governments, and environmental advocates. According to Atty. Osorio, both the Constitution and the Local Government Code uphold the rights of small fishers and empower local government units to protect marine resources and manage their municipal waters. Several constitutional provisions support this: In addition, Osorio points to the General Welfare Clause in the Local Government Code, which gives LGUs specific powers related to coastal governance: Under the General Welfare Clause, all local government units are granted the power to exercise express and implied powers, including inherent powers: On January 2, 2025, the OSG filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the Supreme Court, asking it to revisit and reverse its August 2024 decision, which had allowed the lower courts ruling to stand. A Motion for Reconsideration is a formal request asking the Court to take a second look at its decision, usually when new arguments or overlooked facts are presented. That same day, several groups also asked to formally join the case through whats called a Petition-in-Intervention. These were filed by Oceana, a municipality fisherfolk, and concerned citizens. A Petition-in-Intervention allows someone who wasnt originally part of a case to step in if they can show that the outcome directly affects them or that public interest is at stake. These petitioners argue that: As Atty. Osorio emphasized in her presentation: The Supreme Court has, in several instances, allowed petitions-in-intervention even after the trial court has rendered judgment to, inter alia, protect public interest, to facilitate the administration of justice.

In simpler terms, its not too late for the Court to reopen the case if it believes doing so is necessary to serve justice and protect the rights of those most affected. What began as a single petition by a commercial fishing firm has now exposed deep cracks in the countrys environmental governance and access to justice for the marginalized. With municipal fishers left out of the courtroom, the burden now falls on the Supreme Court to determine whether a ruling made without them can stand. This case has become a test of how far the country is willing to go to uphold the constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology and to deliver on the promise of social justice for small fishing communities.

INQToday: Admin officials no-show in next Senate hearing on Duterte arrest,"Heres a quick roundup of todays top stories: Administration executives will not attend Thursdays second Senate hearing on former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest, Sen. Imee Marcos office confirmed on Tuesday. This was based on a letter from Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin dated March 31 and addressed to Sen. Marcos and Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero. Former President Rodrigo Dutertes legal counsel is looking to challenge the International Criminal Courts jurisdiction on his crimes against humanity case to prevent it from reaching trial at all costs, a lawyer representing extrajudicial killing victims said Tuesday. Because once the trial takes place, it would be hard for Dutertes lawyer, Nicholas Kaufman, to counter the surmounting evidence against him, according to Atty. Neri Colmenares. Following the destructive magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck Myanmar and Thailand last week which claimed thousands of lives, an official from the Office of Civil Defense on Tuesday admitted that the Philippines still has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to disaster preparedness. At a public briefing, OCD spokesperson Director Chris Noel Bendijo emphasized how crucial it is to comply with the National Building Code, noting that preparations for the Big One would be in vain if the infrastructure is not robust enough. The Department of Foreign Affairs does not recommend that the relatives of two overseas Filipino workers , missing since an earthquake hit Myanmar on March 28, fly out with the Philippine rescue team, a DFA official said on Tuesday. Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Eduardo De Vega made this response to a request by the parents of Edsil Jess Adalid to join the countrys contingent team in Myanmar before dawn Tuesday. Some former workers of Philippine offshore gaming operators retrieved devices from their facilities during the governments crackdown on scam hubs. This was the warning of the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group at a press briefing in Camp Crame on Tuesday, after announcing the arrest of a man in Manila for selling a text blaster linked to a Pogo.

Sara Duterte impeachment trial: Defensor OK with Senate timeline,"MANILA, Philippines Iloilo 3rd District Rep. Lorenz Defensor sees no problem with Senate President Francis Escuderos outright denial of a motion seeking to compel Vice President Sara Duterte to answer the impeachment complaint. Defensor said they will heed the senator-judges discretion regarding the impeachment trial of VP Duterte. In a virtual press briefing on Wednesday, Defensor was asked about Escuderos statements last March 26. That day, the lead prosecutor, House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan, filed a motion to issue a summons to Duterte. But Escudero said it could not be done with Congress on a break. READ: Escudero wont summon Duterte on impeach raps: It cant legally be done While we respect the decision of the lead prosecutor, I will await the collective decision of the team on our next move, Defensor told reporters. But I personally want to make it clear that if the presiding judge or the Senate President has rejected and has insisted on the timeline that he has already proposed, Im okay with following Senator Chiz Escuderos directive regarding that timeline. Well just do our job to prepare, and we will see. We will make a collective decision on that. But for me, I will follow what the judge has to say. Its hard to fight against them, Defensor added in a mix of Filipino and English. Defensor also said that they were still preparing for the impeachment proceedings against Duterte, noting as a lawyer, that their task was to gather as much evidence as they could to have a strong case for the trial. The lawmaker also said it was a good thing that a lawyer like Escudero would be the presiding judge during the trial. Just for the record, Im very happy and Im glad that the Senate president, who will be the presiding judge in the impeachment trial, is a lawyer, he said. And Im very sure that the Senate President Chiz Escudero would be able to clearly distinguish between a political exercise such as an impeachment proceeding compared to a judicial proceeding where the strict rules of evidence apply. Its good that our judge is a lawyer. He will be able to better appreciate the evidence and not only through technicalities that will be raised. Remember, since an impeachment process is not a criminal proceeding, our rules of evidence and the quantum of evidence required for a conviction are not that strict, he added. Earlier, Defensor said the prosecution panel was 80 percent ready to start the trial. He also said that he and other members of the team have staged mock trials to simulate what an impeachment proceeding feels like. That is to prepare responses in case members of the defense team question their evidence and witnesses. Last February 5, the House impeached Duterte after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The case was hinged on several issues, among them the alleged misuse of confidential funds in her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a vice president. The Articles of Impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate. The Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. Under the Constitution, the Senate will act as an impeachment court, with senators sitting as judges. READ: House impeaches Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the Articles of Impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5. That means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. Defensor previously said that they hope dDutertes impeachment trial would start immediately as the Constitution states. But he also said that they would respect the Senates decision regarding the timeline of the proceedings. READ: Lawmakers hope VP Sara Duterte impeachment trial will start soon Libanan explained, however, that he and the other prosecutors signed their motion to issue summons against Duterte as early as March 14. But they refrained from submitting it to the Senate because Congress was in recess. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

P15 million savings eyed from solar-powered Samar town hall,"TACLOBAN CITY, Philippines The local government of Paranas, Samar will save P15 million in electricity costs by using solar power to energize its municipal hall. This is the second government office to be powered with renewable energy in the province . Non-government organization Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities said that is the net lifetime savings after the switch-on of the 48-kWp smart hybrid solar PV system. A PV system is composed of one or more solar panels combined with an inverter and other electrical and mechanical hardware that use energy from the sun to generate electricity. The 48-kWp smart hybrid solar PV system refers to the maximum power output of a solar panel system under ideal conditions. This is enough to power around 30 to 35 rural households with an average electricity consumption of 200 kilowatts per hour per month. Paranas will once again serve as an inspiration to many municipalities and cities in Eastern Visayas and across the Philippines a model that values cleaner and more sustainable energy sources for the future of their community, Angelo Kairos dela Cruz, executive director of ICSC, said in a statement Friday. The ICSC turned over the project and signed a deed of donation on March 26 after months of installation. Paranas town has been prioritized for locally-led energy transition efforts since 2019, when it adopted solarized rooftops in its public buildings, including the evacuation center, materials recovery facility, several public schools, and a barangay health center. The hybrid solar PV installation in the municipal hall is the second solar project of the municipality done in partnership with ICSC, following the solarization of its rural health unit last year. The partnership between ICSC and the local government of Paranas for this hybrid solar PV installation project was made official through a memorandum of agreement signed in October last year.

Dismissed Cebu City Mayor Rama faces another dismissal from service,"CEBU CITY Dismissed City Mayor Michael Rama is facing another legal obstacle. The Office of the Ombudsman has ordered another dismissal from service, Ramas second in three months. This time, the former mayor was found liable for awarding three purchase orders for garbage collection and disposal to three private firms without conducting a competitive bidding process. The Inquirer tried to reach Rama for a statement but he had not responded. But his wife, Malou, took to Facebook her sentiments regarding her husbands second dismissal from the service, saying the setback was yet another tactic used by his political enemies to stop his reelection bid. Rama, she added, would continue to campaign and run in the May 12 elections. Do not be worried about the recent development. That is just a tactic of our opponent, Malou said in Cebuano. They want to destroy Mayor Mike Rama. But more people are instead drawn to Partido Barug Bag-ong Sugbo Team Rama. The fight continues, she added. In an order dated Jan. 3, 2025 but was released only on March 28, the anti-graft office found sufficient basis to hold Rama liable for grave misconduct. The order also applied to five former members of the Bids and Awards Committee Leizl Jacobe Calamba, Lyndon Bernardo Jao Basan, Conrado Acha Ordesta III, Janeses Bordario Ponce, and Dominic Amigable Dio. Verily, because of respondents grave misconduct, ACM Hauling Services, Jomara Konstruckt Corp., and ARN Central Waste Management Inc. derived unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference from the contracts awarded to them, the anti-graft office said. The decision was signed by Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officers Myra Nimfa Solidum Mendieta and Roseann Claudine Pasion, reviewed by Preliminary Investigation and Administrative Adjudication Director Nellie Boguen-Golez, and approved by Deputy Ombudsman Jose Balmeo Jr. The case stemmed from a complaint filed by Jundel Bontuyan on Aug. 11, 2023, alleging that Rama and members of the BAC issued three purchase orders for garbage collection and disposal to Jomara Konstruckt Corp., ACM Hauling Services, and ARN Central Waste Management Inc. According to the Ombudsman, misconduct is the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment. When the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules are manifest, the public officer shall be liable for grave misconduct, it added. In this case, there is sufficient evidence to adequately conclude that the elements of corruption and flagrant disregard of established rules are manifest when respondents awarded the contracts to ACM Hauling Services, Jomara Konstruckt Corp., and ARN Central Waste Management Inc. , the Ombudsman said. The recent Ombudsman decision was just the recent in the series of legal debacles being faced by Rama. In May 2024, the Ombudsman ordered a six-month preventive suspension on Rama and seven other government officials of this capital city pending an investigation of their alleged failure to pay the salaries of at least four employees for seven months. Rama started serving his six-month preventive suspension on May 10, 2024. Still, before he could fully serve it on Nov. 6, the Ombudsman issued another order on Oct. 3 dismissing him from the service for nepotism and grave misconduct for appointing his two brothers-in-law to government posts. Ramas dismissal order carried a perpetual disqualification from public service. Five days after the Ombudsmans order came out, the DILG installed Vice Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia as the new mayor of Cebu City. Rama went to the Supreme Court and challenged Commission on Elections Resolution No. 11044-A that mandated the cancellation of all Certificates of Candidacy of aspirants who have been slapped with a penalty of disqualification by the Ombudsman so he could seek reelection.

"1,000 Muslim community members in Bohol celebrate Eidl Fitr","TAGBILARAN CITY At least 1,000 members of the Muslim community celebrated Eidl Fitr on Monday at the President Carlos P. Garcia Sports Complex in this city. Wearing their best robes and dresses, Muslim men and women living in Tagbilaran City, Panglao, Dauis, and Tubigon gathered at the sports complex to celebrate the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of sacrifice. Taha Malabi, president of the Bohol Muslim Community Peace Movement, said Eidl Fitr is one of the most important occasions in Islam. The celebration started at 7 a.m. with a traditional Salat al-Eid or special prayers recited during the Eid holidays. Since Eid Al-Fitr is a day of joy and thanksgiving, Muslims were obliged to keep the lessons of Ramadan close to heart by performing their duty and making sacrifices for a noble objective. After the Salat al-Eid, meal packs were served to the attendees. Celebrations were also held in Batuan, Jagna, and Catigbian towns. Shahari, 31, said he found peace and contentment while celebrating Ramadan. I pray for peace because Allah is peace, he said. About 80 percent of the Muslims who came to Bohol many generations ago are Maranaos, while the rest are a mixture of Tausugs, Maguindanaos, and other tribes.

NPA commander from Negros yields to Cebu City police,"CEBU CITY An alleged commander of the New Peoples Army on Tuesday surrendered to the police in this city. Misael Atadero Dela Cruz, 57, a resident of Sitio Kakha, Barangay Talalak, Santa Catalina, Negros Oriental, was accompanied by his wife. He said he decided to surrender in Cebu City for security purposes as he feared yielding to authorities in Negros. Dela Cruz, also known as Jimlan, Layan, Ly, Totoy, Yanyan, Naldo, and Yaksel is facing multiple charges in court and said he was tired of hiding. The suspect is considered a national level most wanted person. I think he feels more at ease surrendering and revealing himself in Cebu City, possibly because of the media presence here. That might be a way for him to protect himself, said Lieutenant Colonel Macatangay, deputy director for operations of the Cebu City Police Office. The police served multiple warrants of arrest against him when he surrendered to the Abellana Police Station in Cebu City with the assistance of the Regional Intelligence Unit. The suspect has outstanding warrants for three counts of rebellion issued by the Regional Trial Court Branch 63 in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental; and violations of Republic Act 9851 issued by the Regional Trial Court Branch 64 in Guihulngan City. He also has three counts of murder charges issued by Regional Trial Court Branch 63 in Bayawan City and Branch 64 in Guihulngan City; two counts of frustrated murder issued by Regional Trial Court Branch 64 in Guihulngan City and Branch 63 in Bayawan City; and violations of Republic Act 10591 , Republic Act 7166, and Comelec Resolution No. 10728, all issued by Regional Trial Court Branch 38 in Dumaguete City. He also faces two counts of robbery issued by Regional Trial Court Branch 64 in Guihulngan City and six counts of theft issued by the same court in Guihulngan City.

France Castro has requested the National Bureau of Investigation to probe the social media red-tagging and purported circulation of false content about her and other Makabayan senatorial candidates. In a letter she sent to the NBI on Thursday, Castro reported a pro-Duterte account claiming that she had died from a heart attack upon learning of the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte. She said this account could no longer be searched and had already been fact-checked by a media organization. READ: Rep. Castro asks Meta to restore her Facebook pages This video used edited photos, a misleading thumbnail, and utterly false claims to portray in a bad light myself and the legitimate issues for which I advocate, i.e., transparency over confidential funds and the Vice Presidents accountability for them, Castro said. Castro also said the channel or video could no longer be searched, and it could have been taken down. However, she said the NBI should still look into this account and coordinate with YouTube and Google as to the links of the video and channel. She also referred Makabayans request addressed to the Commission on Elections to the NBI. In particular, we referred to the attention of the Comelec an impersonation account creating and disseminating AI-generated and red-tagging videos through Facebook and essentially urging the public not to vote for progressive candidates under the Makabayan, Castro wrote. However, we at the Makabayan wish to stress that any investigation and all related actions thereto should strictly comply with the requirements of due process and should neither impair nor undermine free speech and other democratic rights of users and consumers of online content, she added. We believe that spreaders of red-tagging and false information online only get more vile and damaging to the public with every second that they are allowed to exist on YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms unchecked. We therefore hope for your immediate and favorable consideration of our requests, the lawmaker also said. Last week, Castro demanded Meta to restore her Facebook pages after the company unpublished them and restricted the personal accounts of the pages administrators. Castro said her first official Facebook page was unpublished last February 16, while the second was unpublished on March 15. She called these acts a form of digital censorship and an attack on freedom of expression. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Anti-corruption group wants fair hearing for suspended Marikina mayor,"MANILA, Philippines The anti-corruption movement Mayors for Good Governance is calling for a fair and transparent hearing on the preventive suspension issued by the Office of the Ombudsman against Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Marcy Teodoro. The M4GG is an organization committed to fighting corruption and upholding transparency, innovation, and good governance. It consists of over 150 local chief executives, including Teodoro, who serves as one of its convenors. In a statement on Thursday, M4GG said the hearing process would help them uncover the full truth concerning the allegations against Teodoro. Nananawagan ang Mayors for Good Governance para sa isang makatarungan at malinaw na proseso ng pagdinig ukol sa anim na buwang suspension na ipinataw ng Ombudsman kay Marikina Mayor Marcy Teodoro, M4GG said in a statement. The organization likewise expressed confidence that justice and truth will prevail in the investigation. Bilang isang samahan na nagsusulong ng mabuting pamamahala at pagsugpo sa katiwalian sa pamahalaan, umaasa kami na magiging pataas ang imbestigasyon at mananaig ang katarungan at katotohanan sa isyung ito, it said. Earlier, Teodoro said the suspension order issued against him is a broader effort to derail his candidacy in the May 12 elections and a desperate attempt to besmirch his name. He and 18 other city officials were slapped with a six-month suspension order over their alleged diversion of P130 million in public funds that the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. reimbursed to the city government in 2023. We are confident that we have a strong defense and will prove that these allegations have no basis or merit. We will face this head-on, with full transparency and accountability. We will continue our fight for good governance, a clean and honest service, and, most importantly, for every resident of Marikina who deserves better, the suspended mayor said. In the order dated March 21 but was released to the media on Tuesday, the Ombudsman said it found sufficient grounds to suspend Teodoro and the other 18 Marikina City officials, considering there is a strong evidence showing their guilt. Teodoro and others are facing charges of graft, malversation, technical malversation, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Following Teodoros suspension, the Department of the Interior and Local Government appointed Sangguniang Panlungsod member Rommel Acuna to assume the post of Marikina City acting mayor.

DSWD refocuses Akap to aid those earning below minimum wage,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Social Welfare and Development has redirected its Ayuda sa Kapos ang Kita Program to support Filipinos earning below the minimum wage.

The revised guidelines require the publication of Akap beneficiaries on the DSWD website and social media platforms to enhance transparency, he added.

Wasted catch: The hidden crisis of fish loss in Samar Sea,"MANILA, PhilippinesFor generations, the Samar Sea has been a lifeline for coastal communities in Northern Samar and Samar provinces. Fishing is not just an occupation; it is a way of life, a means of survival, and a cultural heritage passed down through generations. But beneath the waves, a silent crisis is unfolding one that threatens both food security and livelihood. A recent study commissioned by Oceana has revealed that up to 40 percent of fish caught in these waters never make it to consumers plates, lost to spoilage, improper handling, and market inefficiencies. This staggering waste known as postharvest fish loss represents more than just spoiled seafood. It is a blow to small-scale fishers struggling with declining incomes, a threat to nutrition in some of the countrys poorest regions, and a symptom of a larger systemic failure in the Philippines fisheries sector. Postharvest fish loss occurs when fish deteriorates in quality, loses market value, or is discarded entirely before it can be sold. In the Samar Sea, the Oceana study found that the average postharvest fish loss is 38.39 percent in municipalities along the San Bernardino Strait and 40.34 percent in those along Samar Bays and Channels. The species most wasted are sardines, anchovies, and slipmouth staples in the diets of low-income households. For communities where 75.1 percent of Northern Samars population and 60.5 percent of Samars population have experienced food insecurity, these losses are devastating. This is not an isolated problem. Across the Philippines, postharvest fish losses have long plagued the industry. A study published in 2022 found that the country loses up to 40% of its total fisheries output due to spoilage, handling issues, and lack of storage infrastructure. The situation in Samar mirrors a national crisis that has yet to see meaningful intervention. READ: PH post-harvest fish losses need more than band-aid solutions, govt told Its alarming that almost half of the fish catch is lost before they are landed or rots before they are sold, Oceana Philippines Vice President lawyer Gloria Estenzo Ramos said previously. When we address this, imagine how much of a positive difference this will make for coastal communities and the lives of poor families, she added. Oceana pointed to multiple causes of postharvest fish loss in the Samar Sea: Despite government initiatives like the Community Fish Landing Centers , meant to improve fish storage and marketing, these facilities remain underutilized. Many lack proper cold storage and processing equipment, rendering them ineffective in solving the problem. The irony is hard to ignore: while fish is lost at alarming rates, the very communities catching them suffer from malnutrition. According to the National Nutrition Council, high rates of stunting, wasting, and iodine deficiency in Northern Samar and Samar indicate insufficient protein and fish intake. If even half of the lost fish was salvaged through better handling and infrastructure, it could significantly improve food availability and nutrition in these provinces. Fish species like anchovies, sardines, and rabbitfish are rich in protein, Vitamin A, and iron nutrients that could help combat undernutrition in the region. Oceana previously noted that in addition to suffering from malnourishment, municipal and artisanal fishers across the country who produce nutritious food face food insecurity and continue to be among the poorest of the poor. [D]espite the availability of locally caught fish, food security and fish consumption is decreasing over time, particularly in low-income and rural households, because of the increasing price of food, a growing population, unsustainable development, and impacts from natural disasters , and lingering effects of the pandemic, the group said. Hence, it strongly recommends to prioritize the sustainable management of our fisheries and the wellbeing of artisanal fisherfolks for food and nutritional security and livelihoods to reduce hunger and poverty incidence in the Philippines. According to the study, addressing postharvest fish loss requires a comprehensive approach rooted in effective policies and infrastructure development. Establishing robust fish catch monitoring and reporting systems is crucial to ensure accurate data collection and inform sustainable management strategies. Training women and mobile peddlers in postharvest handling and processing could help minimize quality loss and improve income opportunities within fishing communities. Additionally, implementing organized marketing systems would strengthen market linkages between fishers, aquafarmers, and buyers, reducing inefficiencies in the supply chain. Investment in cold storage and processing facilities is another key solution suggested by Oceana, providing year-round access to fresh seafood while minimizing spoilage. Meanwhile, refurbishing non-operational CFLCs into multi-purpose storage and processing hubs could help address infrastructure gaps. Introducing area- and species-specific price regulations would also stabilize fish prices and protect fisherfolk from market force losses. On a broader scale, the group recommended integrating the fisheries sector into KADIWA stores to enhance market access for small-scale fishers, making nutrient-rich fish more available to underserved communities. Moreover, utilizing readily available fish species in nutritional programs, particularly for addressing wasting, stunting, and micronutrient deficiencies, could also help combat malnutrition in coastal regions: A promising model for reducing postharvest fish loss can be found in Daram, Samar, where a P249.8 million investment has been set in motion to support coastal communities and minimize fish wastage. Daram, which has the longest coastline and largest municipal waters in the Samar Sea, heavily depends on fishing. However, its fisherfolk have long faced issues such as a lack of storage facilities, market instability, and climate change impacts on fish supply and livelihoods. Based on Oceanas study findings, the fish trading system in Daram, where many catches are sold at sea, is a major contributor to the postharvest fish losses in Samar. This leads to unrecorded landings and price fluctuations. To counter these challenges, the local government and fisherfolk, with assistance from Oceana and national agencies, have developed a five-year plan to cut postharvest losses from 40 percent to 10 percent. This initiative includes: The local plan in Daram supports President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s Philippine Development Plan to manage harvest waste, said Oceana Philippines campaign and research director Rhea Yray-Frossard. The project aims to prevent loss of essential fish nutrients and wastage of fish catch during peak seasons by establishing facilities that support proper handling, processing, and storage, she noted. Vice Mayor Lucia Astorg acknowledged that while Daram has vast marine resources, a lack of cold storage, drying facilities, and organized market access has led to fish wastage. Additionally, the seasonality of sardines results in drastic price fluctuations, forcing fisherfolk to discard excess fish during peak seasons due to a lack of buyers. By improving handling, processing, and storage facilities, the initiative aims to prevent fish nutrient loss, stabilize prices, and minimize waste. The campaign will directly benefit 9,293 residents across 10 coastal villages in Daram. Postharvest fish loss is a crisis hiding in plain sight one that affects not just fishers but entire communities dependent on the sea for sustenance. In the Samar Sea, where the effects of this loss are most pronounced, tackling this issue could mean the difference between a thriving coastal economy and deepening poverty. For too long, solutions have been patchwork band-aid fixes on a systemic problem. If the government and stakeholders fail to act decisively, the losses will continue, robbing both fishers and consumers of a vital resource.

"Karapatan calls for immediate release of Lumad leader, others","MANILA, Philippines Human rights watchdog Karapatan enjoined indigenous peoples rights activists in calling for the release of Lumad leader Michelle Campos and three others allegedly arrested early this March. According to the group, Campos and her companions Alden Baguio, Jun Rey Misoles, and Rovelyn Acevido were seized in Barangay Das-agan, San Francisco, Agusan del Sur, last March 6. It said they are currently being held under heavy military guard at the Democrito O. Plaza Memorial Hospital in Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur, where they received treatment for various injuries. READ: Lumad leader among 6 slain in Bohol clash AFP But Karapatan noted that the whereabouts of another Lumad leader, Genasque Enriquez, who was reportedly arrested on March 2, are still unknown. The group said a fact-finding and humanitarian mission dispatched by Kalipunan ng Katutubong Mamamayan and Karapatan from March 10 to 12 determined that Campos faces at least seven trumped-up cases ranging from frustrated murder to murder. All of the warrants for these cases were served on Campos after she had been at the hospital for five days already, said Karapatan Secretary General Cristina Palabay, as quoted in a press release. No warrants were presented to her or her companions upon their arrest, she added. Despite these cases already pending in civilian courts against Campos, she is still under military custody. The constant presence of soldiers and military agents nearby prevented members of the fact-finding and humanitarian mission from conducting a in-depth interview of Campos and her companions, Palabay further said. Palabay further said, As long as they remain in the hands of the military, they could not speak freely and are vulnerable to harassment and torture. Furthermore, Palabay said that the other three arrested must be released as there were no pending cases against them. They were also arrested without a warrant, Karapatan said. As for Michelle Campos, the cases filed against her are all manufactured and meant to discredit her work as a passionate advocate of Lumad rights, said Palabay.

SC affirms graft conviction of former Pagsanjan Mayor ER Ejercito,"MANILA, Philippines The Supreme Court has upheld the graft conviction of former Pagsanjan Mayor Emilio Ramon ER Ejercito amid the illegal insurance deal he approved as mayor in 2008. In a 16-page decision, the SC First Decision affirmed that Ejercito and Marilyn Brue, owner of First Rapids Care Ventures , guilty of violating Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Both were sentenced to up to eight years in prison and permanently banned from holding public office. The case stemmed from a complaint filed by the United Boatmen Association of Pagsanjan , accusing Ejercito and other local officials of awarding a contract to FRCV without public bidding. Charges were filed against them by the Office of the Ombudsman before the Sandiganbayan, where Ejercito, Bruel, and several council membersexcluding the vice mayorwere convicted. Ejercito then elevated the case to the SC, arguing that the FRCV was just a qualified service provider that public bidding was unnecessary; while Bruel, claimed that the contract was for special services, not insurance. READ: No anomaly in insurance deal, says ex-governor But the SC in its decision disagreed, ruling that the contract was for insurance and therefore classified as goods requiring public bidding under the Government Procurement Reform Act. The SC found that Ejercito knowingly gave FRCV an unfair advantage, bypassing legal procedures and ignoring clear red flags. FRCV lacked a Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission, and was registered with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bureau of Internal Revenue just five days before it offered its services to Ejercito. These suggest that FRCV was created solely to provide specialized services to the Municipality of Pagsanjan despite having no prior experience. By purposely sparing FRCV from the rigors of the processes under the procurement law and consciously turning a blind eye to irregularities, [Ejercito] gave it unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference, the decision read. Under Republic Act 3019 public officers are prohibited from unfairly favoring private parties by granting them special benefits, advantages, or preferences through bias, bad faith, or serious negligence. Due to this, Bruel was found guilty of misrepresenting FRCVs qualifications and conspiring with Ejercito to secure the contract, falsely claiming that FRCV could provide the required services, even though its BIR registration listed it as a computer Business.

"DPWH projects aim to boost safety, connectivity in Masbate, Iloilo","MANILA, Philippines The Department of Public Works and Highways has completed two key infrastructure projects that aim to improve the safety and accessibility of flood-prone and remote areas in Masbate and Illoilo. In Barangay Jamorawon, Milagros, Masbate, a newly constructed 12-meter-long and 7-meter-wide spillway structure now provides a safe crossing path, complete with concrete slope protection and a reinforced concrete pipe culvert for drainage. The project also includes a 233.72-meter river revetment and a 15-meter-long concrete pavement on the spillway approaches, the DPWH said. Due to flooding, the area has historically been inaccessible during the rainy and typhoon seasons. With the spillway bridge and revetment structures completed, residents of Barangay Jamorawon are now able to safely cross the river to access its more remote communities, said DPWH Region 5 Director Virgilio Eduarte in a statement on Tuesday. Meanwhile, in San Miguel, Iloilo, a 1.92-kilometer concrete road now provides a safer and more convenient route to the Goducate Training Center, an inland ecotourism camp and training resort. The newly paved road runs from Sitio Sapa, Barangay San Antonio to Barangay Sto. Angel, significantly improving travel conditions for tourists and locals. DPWH Director Sanny Boy Oropel said, upgrading this access road will help boost local tourism and connectivity and spur more economic opportunities for surrounding barangays. The improved road is expected to be beneficial to agricultural communities by facilitating faster and more cost-effective transportation of farm produce to markets.

Escudero confident SolGen can justify legality of 2025 budget,"MANILA, Philippines The Senate, through Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, will be able to justify the legality of the 2025 national budget before the Supreme Court. Speaking at a Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum on Wednesday, Senate President Francis Escudero said he was confident of this. To explain the reason behind his stand, he said in a mix of English and Filipino: The bicam report is clear. We authorized the finance committee and appropriations committee to fill in any gaps, to make any corrections given that the budget bill consists of over 200,000 lines. And not because there are blanks we will return to the bicam. READ: SolGen seeks dismissal of SC petition vs 2025 budget So that authority was given within the parameters of the delegated authority given by the bicam to the respective House and Senate committee, he added. According to Escudero, the Supreme Courts goal is not to infringe upon the power of Congress to settle the national funding but to ensure that the process was done right. Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo earlier confirmed that there were blank items in the bicameral conference committee report on the 2025 national budget, but she clarified these were only for the final computation of the amendments made. In relation to this, Davao Rep. Isidro Ungab and former Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez filed a petition before the Supreme Court questioning the alleged blank items in the 2025 budget plan.

VP Duterte can answer impeach raps in PH or via consulate reps,"MANILA, Philippines Vice President Sara Duterte can either go home or send her reply to the nearest consulate should the Senate ask her to respond to the articles of impeachment, House of Representatives prosecutors said on Tuesday. In a press briefing at the Batasang Pambansa complex, Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan and 1-Rider party-list Rep. Ramon Rodrigo Gutierrez said this could be the possible scenario for Duterte when asked about what would happen if the Senate issued a summons order against her. The two congressmen, both House prosecutors in the impeachment trial of the vice president, had earlier requested the Senate to order her to answer the impeachment charges. READ: Solons ask Senate to order VP Duterte to answer the impeachment raps We are of the opinion, that [] assuming first the summons would be delivered to the good Vice President.. that would be through personal summons or substitute, the Vice President, if she would still be abroad, can still file her answer and just approach the nearest consulate to have it apostilled, Gutierrez said. She would have to answer it.. it would be a formal filing with the court through the consulate. Thats one opinion that we have, although the ideal [thing] would still be that, personally, she would return to the Philippines to file her answer before the court, he added. Libanan who Gutierrez announced as the teams lead prosecutor agreed, saying that Duterte could respond to the order, if issued by the Senate, within 10 days of receipt. If the Senate listens to our request, our Vice President will be required to answer the articles of impeachment. This means the summons will be served to her. What does that mean? It means they will be informed formally of the cases, as while she may have heard of it through news and social media, it was unofficial. So the charges that she would face would be mentioned, and she will be asked to respond in a non-extendable period of 10 days, Libanan said in Filipino. So that can be submitted to her office or delivered to her residence. Now, once she receives that, of course they would call her. Her choices, as Congressman Gutierrez mentioned, is that she can respond by going home and answering in writing each allegation, or she can visit our consulate in the Netherlands, where she can execute her answer, he added. Duterte is currently in The Hague, Netherlands to assist her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who is under the custody of the International Criminal Court. The older Duterte is facing crimes against humanity charges for his administrations drug war that left thousands dead. According to Gutierrez, Vice President Dutertes potential situation can be likened to her familys ally, former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, who in December 2024 submitted a counter-affidavit for the qualified human trafficking complaints filed against him while he was in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The human trafficking complaints stemmed from Roques alleged involvement in Lucky South 99, the Philippine offshore gaming operator hub in Porac, Pampanga, that was raided last June 2024 for being a human trafficking den. In the same way, if to make it more common knowledge, yong pagsagot rin po ni attorney Harry Roque, ginawa niya rin po yon abroad po no, so in the same manner it could be done po, Gutierrez noted. Earlier, Gutierrez and Libanan submitted a motion asking the Senate to issue a summons against Duterte. According to Libanan, the entire prosecution team signed the motion as early as March 14, but they refrained from submitting it to the Senate as the session was in recess. They eventually submitted the motion as they took the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing on former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest as an indication that the chamber is still working despite Congress being on a break. In the motion, the prosecution panel cited Rule VII of the Rules of Procedure on Impeachment Trials dated March 23, 2011, which states that a writ of summons should be issued against the official impeached by the House. The prosecution team said the impeachment rules are still applicable since there was a provision stating that it will be in force until it is amended or repealed. Duterte wasimpeachedby the House last February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourthimpeachmentcomplaint, hinged on several issues like the alleged confidential fund misuse, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a Vice President. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP SaraDuterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5 which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter.

"Alyansa Senate bets bat for law, stronger action vs fake news","MANILA, Philippines Senate candidates under the administration-backed Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas are determined to combat fake news, batting for the creation of an anti- fake news law. At a press conference in Cavite on Friday, the senatorial candidates were questioned one by one on what their stand was on the supposedly worsening cases of fake news, especially following the developments on the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte. Former Senate President Vicente Tito Sotto said that an anti-fake news law is among his top priorities should he get reelected. Hindi lang fake news pati fake content and Im ready for the bill to be filed. The other thing is if we make it back to the Senate, its one of the first bills that I will file. Anti-fake news and anti-fake content and penalties for those who produce those fake news, said Sotto. Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino, for his part, said he himself had been a victim of fake news, emphasizing that he wants to support any initiative that would fair out the truth without diminishing freedom of expression. Former Social Welfare Secretary Erwin Tulfo, meanwhile, echoed his allies remarks, likewise voicing out the need for a law to combat fake news and fake content. I believe lahat tayo magiging biktima nyan one of these days kapag hindi ho natin ika-nga bantayan yan. We have to have a law otherwise you, me, all of us magiging biktima po ng fake news na yan, fake content, said Tulfo. Makati City Mayor Abby Binay said that more than legislation, there is likewise a need to strengthen enforcement of policies to capture those who are spreading fake news.

"Borongan City market vendors, tricycle drivers go cashless","TACLOBAN CITY Borongan City in Eastern Samar has become the first in Eastern Visayas to implement cashless transactions among market vendors and tricycle drivers. The launch of the PalengQR PH Plus program on March 19, an initiative of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and the Department of the Interior and Local Government , makes payments faster, safer, and more convenient for both consumers and service providers. The program also aims to promote financial inclusion by providing small businesses and transport operators access to secure and efficient digital payment solutions. Mayor Jose Ivan Dayan Agda welcomed the program, emphasizing that it was provided to Borongan free of charge by the BSP. Its a game changer for our entrepreneurs. They can now track their sales and inventories more efficiently, while also eliminating pilferage. This could lead to better management and higher profits, Agda said in a phone interview on Friday, March 21. This system will benefit not just vendors and tricycle drivers but also everyday consumers, allowing them to enjoy the ease and security of cashless transactions, he added. Agda said the cashless system would also be extended to other small entrepreneurs in the city, including street food vendors such as those selling barbecue. As of now, about 200 market vendors in Borongan have signed up for the program, marking a significant step toward digital transformation in the city. The cashless transactions align with Borongan Citys goal of becoming a smart city where most financial transactions are conducted digitally or online. During the launch, Victorio Tingcang III, BSP Tacloban branch area director, highlighted the key benefits of PalengQR PH Plus. We no longer need to carry physical money because we can now pay the exact amount using QR PH. This helps prevent virus transmission from handling cash and protects people from counterfeit bills. QR PH is an efficient system that saves time and transportation costs since transactions can be completed remotely via mobile phones, Tingcang explained. The PalengQR PH Plus system enables small businesses, market vendors, and tricycle drivers to integrate digital payments into daily operations, reducing reliance on cash transactions and improving financial security. To encourage participation, financial service providers such as GCash, Maya, BanKo by BPI, Landbank, and Chinabank set up on-site booths during the program launch. These institutions assisted attendees in creating digital wallets, allowing them to take advantage of cashless payment options immediately. The PalengQR PH Plus program is part of BSPs broader initiative to promote financial inclusion and digitalization in the country. Launched in 2022 in partnership with the DILG, the system enables businesses, vendors, and transport operators to accept digital payments via QR codes, which customers can scan using mobile wallets and online banking apps. Among the key benefits of the program are enhanced security as it reduces risks of theft and counterfeit money; convenience as it speeds up transactions and eliminates the need for exact change; financial inclusion as it expands digital payment access to small businesses and informal workers; and business growth as it boosts economic activity by streamlining payments. BSP records show that there are 169 local governments across the Philippines implementing or preparing to roll out PalengQR PH Plus as of Feb. 22, 2025.

INQToday: Police to file raps vs suspect in bloody Antipolo road rage,"Heres a quick roundup of todays top stories: Rescuers braved aftershocks to scour the devastated city of Mandalay in Myanmar for survivors on Monday, March 31, after a massive earthquake killed at least 1,700 people in the country and at least 18 in neighbouring Thailand. Vice President Sara Duterte should stop making public comments about the case of her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, before the International Criminal Court and leave it to their lawyers instead, a lawyer accredited by the court said on Sunday. The younger Duterte over the weekend questioned the widely reported figure of 30,000 drug war deaths during her fathers administration, saying the prosecutions claims were far from the 181 pieces of evidence submitted to the ICC. This time, House lawmakers found names resembling groceries on the list of recipients of the Office of the Vice Presidents confidential funds . House Deputy Majority Leader Paolo Ortega V of La Union said on Sunday that the newly discovered names, dubbed Team Grocery, further raised allegations that large sums of public money were allegedly funneled to fictitious individuals. Authorities will file complaints of multiple frustrated homicide against the motorist who went on a shooting rampage during a melee in Antipolo City on Sunday, according to the city police chief Lt. Col. Ryan Manongdo. Manongdo said the police are scheduled to file a case against the 28-year-old suspect identified as alias Kenneth on Monday.

"Rice tariff cut to blame for drop in palay prices, says farmers group","MANILA, Philippines A farmers group on Wednesday said that the low import tariffs should be blamed for the decline in palay prices during the dry season harvest. The Federation of Free Farmers pointed out the drop in international prices by the first quarter of March. Palay traders are probably anticipating that the prices of imported rice will continue to fall, so they are playing safe by buying low from farmers, said FFF Board Chairman and MAGSASAKA Party-list first nominee Leonardo Montemayor in a statement. READ: Philippines seen to reduce rice imports this year The Department of Agriculture recorded 641,000 metric tons of rice imports from January to mid-March 2025, significantly lower than the 1.2 MT recorded in the first quarter of 2024. President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. signed Executive Order No. 62 in June 2024, implementing a tariff cut from 35% to 15% on rice and other agricultural products. The FFF also urged the DA to address the decline in palay prices, emphasizing that the it should not deny reports of low palay prices and suicide committed by some farmers. The DA on Monday said that they have to validate reports from the group that three farmers took their own lives due to low palay farmgate prices and over-importation of rice. It is sad that the DA, instead of commiserating with the plight of farmers, has blamed them for allegedly spreading fake news, Montemayor added.

Blogger apologizes for claiming PH uses water cannons in WPS,"MANILA, Philippines Lawmakers threatened on Friday a blogger with contempt after he claimed during a House hearing that Philippine forces conduct water cannon attacks like what Chinas vessels did in the West Philippine Sea . In the end, blogger Mark Lopez apologized to the House tri-committee holding an inquiry into fake news in social media for making that statement. This all started after Deputy Speaker David Suarez asked Philippine Coast Guard Commodore Jay Tarriela at the hearing if he had been on the receiving end of social media attacks due to his ardent defense of the countrys territories. When Tarriela said one of the bloggers who attacked him was present Lopez Suarez asked the latter several questions related to the territorial dispute over the WPS, such as the incident when PCG vessels were being water-cannoned by Chinese Coast Guard ships. Kunyari, nong tinitira ng water cannons masakit sa akin yon. Pag binabangga yong mga Coast Guard vesselsnatin ng mga dambuhalang Chinese vesselsmasakit sa akin yon, Suarez told Lopez. Masakit po yon pag ginagawa ng Malaysia, pero yon po ang nature ng base sa South China Sea eh. Tayo rin po sir, tayo rin po nagwo-water cannon Mr. Chair, Lopez replied. Lopezs statements prompted Suarez, committee presiding officer and Surigao del Sur 2nd District Rep. Johnny Pimentel, and Abang Lingkod party-list Rep. Joseph Stephen Paduano to demand that the blogger clarify his statements. Mr. Lopez may I ask, where did you get that information, because from what I know, I havent heard of any news that the Philippines water cannoned China, Pimentel said. Thats fake news Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman thats fake news, Suarez said. Yes, that is why, just a point of clarification, you mentioned earlier that the Pilipinas water cannoned China. May we know where did you get that information, was it in the news? Pimentel asked. Mr. Chair, I did not know anything about water cannon attacks against China, Lopez replied. Paduano said that while it is true that Lopez did not mention anything about water cannon attacks against China, the blogger said something about the Philippines doing water cannon attacks which the lawmaker said were spoken in the context of WPS discussions. He talked about water cannons only, but Mr. Lopez listened closely because the issue as of now is the West Philippines Sea, the problem with China. Now when DS Suarez mentioned the water cannons, you replied by saying that we were also doing water cannon attacks. Where did that come from? Because we are talking about the West Philippines Sea, Paduano said. Now, you are correct that you did not say anything about water cannon attacks against Chinabut we are talking about the West Philippines Sea. Now, what is that water cannon attack you are speaking of? he asked. Mr. ChairI premised my statement because I have been saying that the South China Sea issueis a complex issue, Lopez replied. But Paduano warned Lopez not to evade his question or he will be cited for contempt for lying. Wait please answer my question, what do you meanthat the Philippines is usingwater cannons [] Do not be evasive, I warn you, youre under oath, answer me as to where you refer to that water cannon , Paduano said. Mr. Chair, I did not say anything about the Philippines doing water cannons against an opposing state, Lopez said. Waitbut were talking about the West Philippines Sea, this will be your last warningor else I will cite you in contempt. This is your last warning,youre under oath,eh what do you meanthat the Philippines is using water cannons, Paduano noted. Mr. Chair, what I said is that the Philippines can do water cannon attacks also, Lopez reiterated. Suarez said since the meeting is on record, House stenographers can be asked to check the transcript of the meeting to confirm if Lopez really meant that the Philippines had done water cannon attacks. In the end, Lopez admitted to spreading fake news. Suarez on the other hand said such statements are absolutely reckless. Mr. Chair I will apologize, I am wrong, I am spreading fake news. What I am saying is that we can do the water cannon regarding the South China Sea issue. I am spreading fake news, Lopez said. What you saidnag-water cannon,Mr. Chair,if you wantwe can ask thesecretariat torefer to our stenographers in the backto the statements issuedby Mr. Lopez regarding that issue. Sowe have never taken,I dont think, thats reckless,absolutely reckless, Suarez countered. Lopez is one of the bloggers invited by the tri-committee to the hearing, which seeks to look into the spread of disinformation online after several resolutions were filed and different privileged speeches about the issue were delivered. The tri-committee is composed of the House committee on public order and safety, the committee on public information, and the committee on information and communication technology. Aside from Lopez, other vloggers and social media personalities including former Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles appeared before the tri-committee after they skipped the first two hearings. The other social media personalities at the hearing wereElizabeth Joie Cruz, MJ Quiambao-Reyes, Krizette Laureta Chu, Dr. Richard Mata, Dr. Ethel Pineda Garcia, and Aeron Pea.

Lacson says Bato seeking refuge in Senate debatable,"MANILA, Philippines Former senator Panfilo Lacson on Friday said he thinks Sen. Ronald Bato dela Rosa s plan to seek refuge in the upper chamber should an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court be issued against him is debatable. Huwag siya magtago. Biro lang. Seryoso, choice niya yan, pero to seek refuge sa Senado mukhang debatable kasi sabi ko limitado ang legislative immunity ng members ng Congress, said Lacson. In session lang at less than 6 years ang penalty. At ito international ang warrant kung sakaling lalabas, di ko sinasabing lalabas ang warrant, he added. Senate President Francis Escudero earlier confirmed that dela Rosa could take sanctuary in the upper chamber in case an arrest warrant is issued against him. Escudero specifically said he would not allow a lawmaker to be arrested within the institutions grounds. Dela Rosa, who served as the first Philippine National Police chief of the Duterte administration, was the one who issued Command Memorandum Circular No. 16-2016. The memo was the basis for Project Double Barrel that started Dutertes war on drugs. This particular role landed him on the roster of Duterte administration officials who were accused of crimes against humanity by drug war victims-families before the ICC. One of the privileges that a member of Congress enjoys is the privilege from arrest. Section 11, Article VI of the Constitution specifically states that a senator or a member of the House of Representatives shall, in all offenses punishable by not more than six years imprisonment, be privileged from arrest while the Congress is in session.

Palace admits failure to reach 1 million target housing units per year,"MANILA, Philippines The Palace on Monday admitted failing to reach its target of one million housing units per year due to certain obstacles relating to construction and contracting. Undersecretary Claire Castro, of the Presidential Communications Office, made the pronouncement after stating that the government, through the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development, currently has 90 ongoing projects nationwide, with 82 in the preproduction phase and 436 additional proposals awaiting approval. READ: Marcos aims to build 1 million low-cost houses annually: We will try very, very hard Completed projects, meanwhile, resulted in only 259,365 housing units since the beginning of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s term, said Castro, which is far from the governments target of one million housing units per year. May mga pagkakataon po gustuhin po natin na matapos po ang lahat pero may mga causes of delays, said Castro in a Palace press conference. These delays, she said, included challenges in processing and releasing development loans, permitting and due diligence processes involving land ownership and issues with longer construction periods, particularly for vertical housing. Castro also cited issues with limited contractors, as only a few participate in the housing projects due to the low rates offered to the public.

"Duterte arrest glimmer of hope in quest for justice, bishop says","BACOLOD CITY Bishop Gerardo Alminaza of the Diocese of San Carlos in Negros Occidental welcomed the arrest of former president Rodrigo Duterte, saying it brings solace to the thousands of families who lost their loved ones during the controversial war-on-drugs initially in Davao and subsequently throughout the country. The prelate also expressed hopes that other perpetrators of this drug war will be brought to justice. From the harrowing era of state-sponsored killings that plagued our nation, a glimmer of hope has emerged with the arrest of Duterte, Alminaza said in a statement on Thursday, March 20. This development brings a measure of hope and solace to the thousands of families who lost their loved ones during the Duterte regimes war-on-drugs and war-on-rights, a period marked by impunity and reward-driven killings, he added. Alminaza pointed out that the Diocese of San Carlos has consistently called for an end to these killings as he personally borne witness to the devastating consequences of this violence. I presided over the heart-wrenching funeral masses of activists Zara Alvarez, Dr. Mary Rose Sancelan, and her husband, all murdered for their dedication to the poor and their tireless work for justice and peace in Negros Island, he said. Alminaza said he also offered prayers at the wake of Skyler Bladen Abatayo, a four-year-old boy tragically killed by a stray bullet during a flawed drug raid in Cebu City. It is deeply troubling that many remain unconvinced of the profound injustice perpetrated through these systematic killings, and that, tragically, former president Dutertes actions garnered admiration from some, he said. It pains me to acknowledge that some among us continue to support former president Dutertes campaign of violence, justifying the killings as a solution to the nations drug problem, Alminaza added. These people, the prelate said, remain blinded by the false narrative that criminality and drug addiction could be eradicated through death and execution. Holding Duterte accountable will be a warning to other leaders who want to unleash human rights violations in the future, he said. We must engage in a critical reevaluation of our values as believers, reaffirming our commitment to the sanctity of all life. The Church must remain a powerful voice against injustice and any form of tyrannical solution to social problems, he added. Alminaza said they remain vigilant against the continuing practice of impunity as military attacks and bombings continue to terrorize rural communities on Negros Island, Mindoro and Mindanao. Duterte, 79, was arrested last March 11 under an International Criminal Court warrant over allegations of crimes against humanity following the drug war he launched during his stint as president from 2016 to 2022.

VP Sara Duterte told: Your dad allowed heros burial for Marcos Sr.,"MANILA, Philippines An activist has reminded Vice President Sara Duterte that her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, allowed a heros burial for the late President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. after she compared her dad to Marcos critic and democracy iconBenigno Ninoy Aquino Jr. In a message to reporters on Monday, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan President Renato Reyes Jr. said it seems the Dutertes are trying to use people involved in the Edsa People Power Revolution, like Aquino, to invoke an anti-Marcos narrative and criticize Marcos Sr.s son, incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. However, Reyes said this is outrageously ironicbecause former President Duterte was the one who allowed Marcos Sr. to be laid to rest at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. The Duterte camp has no own narrative, so they are trying to grab the narrative of democratic forces, he added. According to Reyes, it is also clear that former President Duterte is not the victim, unlike Aquino who suffered political attacks and incarceration before his self-exile to the United States. Let us be clear. Mr. Duterte is no victim, he is no martyr; rather, he is the main villain in the unfinished saga of drug war extrajudicial killings , he added. Ex-president Duterte, who is currently under the custody of the International Criminal Court in The Hague in The Netherlands, was discouraged by Vice President Duterte from returning to the Philippines as he may suffer the same fate as Aquino. READ: VP Sara warns dad: You could suffer Ninoy Aquinos fate if you return On August 21, 1983, Aquino was killed on the tarmac of then-Manila International Airport after attempting to return to the Philippines. Earlier, the Aquino family issued a statement saying that Aquinos return to the Philippines and Dutertes situation have no similarity. According to the family, a study of the countrys history would show that Aquino was treated far differently compared to what Duterte is experiencing now. READ: Duterte, democracy icon Ninoy lack similarity Aquino family Staunch Duterte critic and former Senator Leila de Lima also does not see any similarity in Aquino and Dutertes situation, saying that Duterte only wants to escape accountability for his cases before the ICC. Malacaang also defended Aquinos legacy, saying that the late senator did not have any record of alleged crimes against humanity. READ: Ninoy Aquino had no record of crimes against humanity Palace Duterte is facing crimes against humanity charges at the ICC for alleged EJKs under his administrations war against illegal drugs. This is not the first time that Vice President Duterte referenced Aquino in hitting back against the Marcoses. On November 25, 2024, after being criticized for her threats to President Marcos, First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, and House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, Vice President Duterte said she agrees with the Chief Executives views that ordinary citizens can be targets of assassinations since the Marcoses were behind Aquinos assassination. Oo, di ba pumalag nga ang buong bayan nang pinatay ng pamilya nila si Benigno Aquino? , Duterte told reporters on the sidelines of the House committee on good government and public accountability hearing. The Aquino family said the Marcoses have to be held accountable for what happened during their late patriarchs two-decade rule, but they noted that Ninoys advocacy has been through peaceful struggle, with the rejection of any threat of violence or assassination. On the Facebook page for the late former President Benigno Aquino III, son of the democracy icon, the Aquino family reiterated that Ninoy was a known believer in peaceful methods to criticize the government a belief that he carried until his death in 1983. The statement came after Vice President Duterte referred to the assassination of Ninoy at the tarmac of the Manila International Airport which is now known as the Ninoy Aquino International Airport to up her criticism of the current Marcos administration. In the 2022 elections, President Marcos and Vice President Duterte ran under a single ticket dubbed as the Uniteam, achieving a landslide victory against the Aquino-endorsed tandem of former Vice President Leni Robredo and former Senator Francis Pangilinan.

Cayetano wants Masungis revoked housing deal investigated,"MANILA, Philippines Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano is calling for a Senate investigation into the Department of Environment and Natural Resources decision to revoke a housing deal within the Masungi Georeserve in Rizal, a move that has sparked a dispute over land use, conservation, and governance. In his Senate resolution No. 1323, Cayetano particularly urged the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee to examine why the DENR revoked its Supplemental Joint Venture Agreement with Blue Star Construction Development Corporation . The developer had been authorized to build housing units for government employees within the protected area. READ: DENR to evict developer of Masungi Georeserve The protection and conservation of the environment and our natural resources for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations of Filipinos is a sacred duty entrusted to our leaders, Cayetano stated in the resolution. The DENR first granted BSDC permission in 1996 to build 5,00 units, later expanding the deal in 2002. The agency, however, canceled the agreement this March due to the lack of presidential approval, missing compliance documents, and BSDCs alleged failure to meet its obligations. This dispute has since escalated, with the DENR accusing Masungi Georeserve Foundation, Inc. , a group linked to BSDC, of prioritizing tourism over housing. MGFI, in turn, claimed that the DENR was neglecting its duty to remove illegal settlers and weakening environmental protection. It is imperative that the government, the private sector, and other stakeholders squarely confront this legal quandary in which the Masungi Georeserve finds itself, Cayetano said. The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee has yet to schedule a hearing on the matter. INQUIRER.net trainee, Sheba Barr Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Municipal fishing crisis deepens,"MANILA, Philippines The waves off the Philippine coast have always provided a lifeline for millions of small-scale fishers. But in recent months, a legal storm has threatened that lifeline. A controversial Supreme Court First Division ruling issued in August 2024 overturned long-standing protections for municipal waters, allowing commercial fishing vessels to operate within the 15-kilometer zone previously reserved for small-scale fishers. The decision stemmed from a legal challenge filed by Mercidar Fishing Corp. on October 25, 2023, against fishing restrictions in municipal waters. Less than two months later, the Malabon Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of Mercidar, nullifying municipal control over commercial fishing in the 15-km zone and lifting the ban on commercial fishing in waters shallower than 12.8 meters. The Supreme Court upheld this decision on August 19, 2024, citing the Office of the Solicitor Generals late appeal. READ: Petition filed vs SC ruling on big-scale fishing in town waters Studies indicate that if the ruling stands, municipal fishers could be left with just 2 percent of their traditional fishing grounds, while 98 percent of the countrys waters would be open to commercial fishing vessels. With fisheries production at its lowest in two decades, many fear this ruling will accelerate the decline of marine resources and threaten the livelihoods of coastal communities. For generations, municipal waters those extending 15 kilometers from the shoreline have been the exclusive domain of small-scale fishers. This preferential access, enshrined in the Fisheries Code of 1998, was designed to ensure the sustainability of marine ecosystems and protect the livelihood of artisanal fishers. But with the Supreme Courts ruling nullifying key provisions of the law, commercial fishing fleets now have legal footing to encroach on these once-protected waters. Local officials are raising alarm over the rulings environmental and economic impact. Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson warned that allowing commercial vessels into municipal waters could destroy crab habitats in the Guimaras Strait and Visayan Sea, both vital to the regions fishing industry. In Iloilo, municipal leaders including those from Carles, Ajuy, and Estancia fear that artisanal fishers, who rely on sustainable fishing practices, will struggle to compete with large commercial fleets. The decline in fish stocks is already evident. In 2024, fisheries production dropped to 4.05 million metric tons, a 5 percent decrease from 2023 and the lowest in two decades, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority . The biggest decline was in marine municipal fisheries, which saw an 8.8 percent drop from 879,960 metric tons in 2023 to 802,770 metric tons in 2024. Meanwhile, commercial fisheries output grew by 4.2 percent to 857,330 metric tons, emphasizing the widening gap between small-scale and large-scale fishers. READ: Fish harvest drops to lowest amid legal fight over municipal waters Experts warn that the continued encroachment of commercial fishing vessels into municipal waters will accelerate fish stock depletion, particularly for species such as sardines and anchovies, which are critical to food security and the fishing economy. Overfishing, habitat destruction, and bycatch could further destabilize marine ecosystems, making it harder for municipal fishers to earn a living. READ: Scientists urge SC: Protect fisherfolks rights, municipal waters Fearing economic and environmental fallout, LGUs have launched legal and political challenges to the ruling. All 19 mayors from the League of Municipalities of the Philippines Surigao del Sur and the 13 mayors from the Alliance of LGUs along Samar Bays and Channels have signed resolutions supporting the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources , and the OSG in their bid to reverse the SC decision. READ: BFAR appeals SC ruling allowing commercial fishing in municipal waters In Iloilo, the provincial government filed a motion on February 21 to intervene in BFARs appeal for reconsideration. Other municipalitiesincluding Carles, Oton, Ajuy, Anilao, Barotac Nuevo, Barotac Viejo, Batad, Concepcion, Dumangas, San Dionisio, San Joaquin, Guimbal, Miagao, Tigbauan, and Estanciahave also urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to take action to protect small-scale fishers. Similarly, the municipality of Santa Fe has joined international marine protection group Oceana and civil society groups in a petition filed on January 2 to remand the case to the lower court so affected communities can be recognized as indispensable parties. The municipality of Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro, led by Mayor Walter Marquez, filed another motion for intervention on January 24, alongside civil society groups and peoples organizations. Oceana Acting Vice President Rose-Liza Eisma-Osorio emphasized the significance of LGUs uniting to fight the ruling. Rather than compete with each others resources, the local governments opted to collaborate, ultimately benefiting their communities, she said, adding that their collective effort underscores the importance of municipal waters to the food and livelihood security of coastal communities. Antique Vice Governor Edgar Denosta has urged the Supreme Court to reconsider, warning that allowing commercial vessels in municipal waters will deplete fish stocks. In Libertad, Antique, Mayor Mary Jean Te, who also leads the Libertad, Pandan, Sebaste, and Culasi Bay-Wide Management Council, emphasized the challenges that small fishers will face if they must compete with large-scale operators. Meanwhile, Del Carmen officials in Surigao del Norte have echoed the sentiments of municipal fisherfolk, urging the Supreme Court and the President to uphold the preferential rights of small-scale fishers and regulate commercial fishing operations. The legal dispute over commercial fishing in municipal waters continues as LGUs, fisherfolk, and advocacy groups oppose the controversial ruling and seek answers about the statutory authority given to local governments and preferential rights of municipal fisherfolk, said Osorio. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address. I agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge that I have read the Privacy Policy . With motions pending before the Supreme Court, the fate of municipal fisheries remains uncertain. If the ruling stands, commercial fleets will gain unprecedented access to coastal fishing grounds, further pushing thousands of small-scale fishers to the margins. If overturned, it would restore protections that have long been in place to balance economic survival with ecological sustainability. For now, coastal communities remain resolute. The fishers who have relied on the sea for generations refuse to surrender without a fight. As the Supreme Court deliberates, the future of the countrys marine resources and the communities that depend on them hangs in the balance. Graphics by Ed Lustan/Inquirer.net.

Binay also highlighted that senior citizens from Taguig and neighboring areas have continued to receive free laboratory, imaging, and diagnostic services at OsMak, aligning with the Universal Health Care Law of 2019. Of the total number of 95,913 non-residents served, 68,266 are from the 10 Embo barangays that the Supreme Court has ruled to be under the jurisdiction of Taguig. Binay said that what began as a response to urgent needs has evolved into a sustainable support system. Weve seen a significant increase in the number of residents from the Embos and other parts of Taguig, as well as other localities utilizing our health facilities and services compared to when we first opened our doors to them, she said. This affirms that our approach is addressing a critical gap in service delivery, she added. Aside from health services and medicines, individuals from outside Makati have benefited from specialized services during caravans, such as pet vaccination, pet microchipping, legal aid, job placement assistance, and utility support from Meralco and Manila Water.

Marcos vetoes bill naming Pampanga culinary capital,"MANILA, Philippines Concerned about the sensitivity of other provinces that are also proud of their homegrown cuisine, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has vetoed a bill that sought to declare Pampanga as the Culinary Capital of the Philippines. In veto messages dated March 12 and addressed to the Senate and the House of Representatives, Mr. Marcos disapproved Senate Bill No. 2797 and House Bill No. 10634, citing several reasons. In consideration of the possibility that the enrolled bill may cause negative cultural implications, discrimination, regional bias, and loss of diversity, I am constrained to veto the above-mentioned enrolled bill, the President said. I look forward to more beneficial legislation that would highlight our unique culture without sacrificing our diversity, he added. Both passed on the final reading in 2024. SB 2797 and HB 10634 sought to bestow Pampanga such an official title and tasked mainly the Department of Tourism with promoting the provinces native dishes and delicacies. Both bills included prominent Kapampangan lawmakers as authorsSen. Lito Lapid for SB 2797 and former President and Pampanga second district Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, House Senior Deputy Speaker and Pampanga third district Rep. Aurelio Gonzales Jr., Pampanga fourth district Rep. Anna York Bondoc, and Pampanga first district Rep. Carmelo Lazatin II for HB 10634. In March 2024, the provincial government approved an ordinance that already conferred the title to Pampanga. The ordinance noted the province had a long uninterrupted reputation for being home to culinary talentsfrom the chefs who cooked for the Malolos Congress in Barasoain in 1898 to the chefs who prepared meals for the athletes of the 30th Southeast Asian Games in 2019. That month, the province also hosted an unprecedented two-day international conference on Kapampangan cuisine, complete with demos, an art exhibit, a food bazaar, and a bookfair. As to the measure approved by the House and the Senate, the enrolled copy was sent to Malacaang for the Presidents signature on Feb. 11. Under the Constitution, the President may veto a bill within 30 days upon receipt. In his two-page veto message, Mr. Marcos said he sincerely appreciated the lawmakers efforts to recognize Pampangas contributions to the countrys rich culinary history. It cannot be denied that Pampanga is celebrated for its diverse and flavorful dishes, traditional cooking methods, and a strong culture of food innovation, he said. This is consistent with the policy of the government to conserve, promote, and popularize the nations historical and cultural heritage and resources, as well as artistic creations. However, while I recognize the noble intention of the authors, I cannot ignore the concerns regarding the declarations lack of historical basis, the absence of a thorough study that shows key performance indicators for such designation, and the possibility that the bill may offend sensibilities in other provinces that are equally proud of their culinary contributions, the President said. In a press briefing, Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary and Malacaang press officer Claire Castro further explained Mr. Marcos veto. The bill is well intentioned, but it might create discrimination, Castro said. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Duterte supporters used other rally photos to deceive solons,"MANILA, Philippines Two ranking House lawmakers have expressed doubts about social media posts regarding recent rallies staged to protest the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte, saying there were instances when photos of other gatherings were used. During a press briefing on Thursday, La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V and Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong said there seemed to be an attempt to deceive people into thinking that massive rallies were staged to call out Dutertes arrest. The rallies were supposedly held to protest the implementation of the International Criminal Courts arrest order against Duterte last March 11. According to Ortega, people need to be discerning about the spread of misinformation and disinformation about pro-Duterte rallies. I saw videos of the demonstration and rally. The lights used were colored pink. I have not seen any rally theres only one group that staged big demonstrations and rallies that used pink as a background light, he said in Filipino. So at that moment, I said it appears questionable already. As I have said, this information should be verified, he added. When pressed if he believed the images posted by Duterte supporters belonged to the rallies of former Vice President Leni Robredo who famously used pink as her motif in the 2022 presidential race Ortega said he was not saying that it came from this political side. However, Ortega said that further investigation might be needed to ascertain if the Robredo campaigns videos and photos along with other rallies were used to make it seem that a lot of people were calling out Dutertes arrest. I am not saying that it came from them, I am just saying that the light used was pink. But I think journalists can check on this, as to where the photos were sourced because its up there, he explained in Filipino. So if you Google any rally, you can collage these photos, post these spliced images, and thats it, he added. Adiong, meanwhile, said there seemed to be an intention to deceive people into thinking that massive civil unrest was ongoing. The lawmaker, who hails from Mindanao, acknowledged that there were people protesting Dutertes arrest near his area, especially since the former president hails from Davao City. However, the protest movements were an exercise of free speech and not meant to spread unrest. Theres already the deceit eh, the intention to deceive. So thats what we need to counter, there is an intention to deceive to divert discussions and reach a point where you would no longer agree because in the first place, the information is not correct and accurate, he said. Like in Mindanao, there are rallies staged there, we have seen it. But these are all gatherings to share their opinion. But as to a widespread [unrest], there is none. So we really have to counter the fake news because other people even foreigners might believe that there is really civil unrest, he added. There has been a deluge of misinformation and disinformation since Duterte was arrested on the order of the ICC. On its social media pages, GMA News fact-checked a post using its footage, which made it seem that thousands of people attended a prayer rally for Duterte in Cebu City. GMA News clarified that the footage was taken during the Sinulog Festival in January 2025. Other lawmakers also called out misinformation and disinformation on social media networks. Ortega previously said the massive spread of misinformation and disinformation after Duterte was taken into custody by the International Criminal Court only brings shame to the Philippines. He was referring to the many social media posts containing fake information and even hate speech against foreign institutions like the ICC. Duterte supporters also harassed ICC Judge Lulia Motoc and made degrading comments about her. There were also posts falsely claiming that Motoc shared a photo with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s wife, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos. Also, Ortega said there have been false narratives on social media, including those from former Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, who claimed that Duterte was missing and was not given the proper medical care.

Harry Roques request for asylum wont affect his cases in PH Palace,"MANILA, Philippines Former presidential spokesperson Harry Roques plans to seek asylum in The Netherlands wont affect his cases in the country, a Palace official said Tuesday. Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary Claire Castro made the pronouncement after Roque recently announced that he will submit an asylum application in the Netherlands which would grant him the right to non-departation. Hindi naman ito makakaapekto. Unang-una po, magpa-file pa lang po yata siya ng petition at hindi pa po ito naga-grant, said Castro in a Palace press conference. According to Castro, Roque cannot prove political persecution based on the evidence gathered by the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force against him, specifically, on his alleged involvement in the operations of suspected illegal Philippine offshore gaming operator Lucky South 99 in Porac, Pampanga. Roque is facing human trafficking complaints before the Department of Justice over his alleged active participation in the operations of the Pogo hub. So, how could there be a political persecution if all the pieces of evidence are overwhelming? Castro said. Asked if the country aims to work with the International Criminal Police Organization in bringing Roque home, Castro responded in the negative, but explained that this may change once a warrant of arrest is issued by a Philippine court. Prior to this appearance in the Netherlands, Roque has been in hiding amid an arrest order from the House of Representatives Quad Committee after being cited for contempt and ordered to be detained due to his failure to submit documents that would supposedly justify his sudden increased wealth.

AI training for govt workers bill filed in Senate,"MANILA, Philippines To prepare the government workforce for the emergence of artificial intelligence, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada filed a bill mandating specialized AI training for civil servants. Estradas Senate Bill No. 2930, or the proposed Artificial Intelligence Training for Government Workforce Act, seeks to equip key government employees with AI knowledge, balancing its benefits and risks. In a statement on Wednesday, Estrada emphasized that many companies worldwide have already integrated AI into their operations, while government agencies across the globe are actively working to understand AI and its impact on the public workforce. The debate and conversation around AI have been everywhere whether it really helps people in their everyday lives or it is simply a threat to the global workforce. AI really has a lot of potential from automating tasks to making it easier for complex questions to be answered in just a matter of seconds, Estrada said. Should the bill get eventually signed into law, the Department of Information and Communication Technology will be mandated to lead an AI training program covering AI fundamentals, its applications in government, risks such as discrimination and privacy concerns, and strategies for responsible AI use. Trainings will be conducted every two years and funded under the national budget.

PhilHealth lifts 45-day benefit limit rule to improve member care,"MANILA, Philippines To extend unhampered service to its members, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation has lifted its 45-day benefit limit rule. In a statement on Thursday, PhilHealth Acting President and Chief Executive Officer Edwin Mercado said the 45-day benefit limit is an outdated cost-containment strategy. The 45-day benefit limit previously allowed PhilHealth members a maximum of 45 days of hospital confinement per calendar year. Their qualified dependents shared a separate 45-day confinement limit annually, the state insurer added. Naiintindihan natin kung bakit ito inilagay noon, ngunit, sa pagbabago ng ating payment mechanism, napapanahon na rin talagang repormahin ito, Mercado said. We cannot always predict or schedule our medical needs. Marami ring mga serbisyo ang kinakailangan ng higit sa 45 days na coverage, the PhilHealth chief further explained. PhilHealth has previously expanded its hemodialysis package, increasing coverage from 90 to 156 sessions per year. READ: PhilHealth announces increased coverage for hemodialysis sessions With the removal of the 45-day benefit limit, a more inclusive approach will now extend to other medical services, the state insurer emphasized. Nais natin na ang mga Pilipinong may malulubhang sakit, chronic conditions, o di kayay nangangailangan ng mahaba-habang pagpapaospital ay patuloy na makatanggap ng serbisyong pangkalusugan nang hindi pa nag-aalala kung sila ba ay mababaon sa utang, Mercado expressed. To ensure the responsible implementation of this policy, PhilHealth said it will closely monitor patient admissions, readmissions, and benefit utilization exceeding 45 days. The agency also underscored that availing of benefits should be based on proper medical indication, necessity, and alignment with the patients treatment plan.

"Local rice floods Cotabato city market, brings prices down","KIDAPAWAN CITY Rice from the recent harvest in neighboring rice-producing provinces is now flooding the mega market in this city, bringing prices down to the delight of consumers. Carmelito Bacus, president of the Grains Retailer Confederation, said local rice was already selling at P930 per 50-kilogram sack, down from the P1150 prevailing in the market barely two weeks ago. Prices of rice sold per kilo also went down to P45 and P49 here from P52 per kilo in the previous weeks. READ: Pangasinan town rolls out rice subsidy program The abundant supply of local rice is the result of the mass harvest not only in the province of Cotabato but also in neighboring provinces of Davao del Sur and South Cotabato, Bacus said. Rice farmers in these provinces harvested their crops in the last week of February and in the early weeks of March. Bacus said the rice being sold in public markets of Cotabato also came from Bukidnon and South Cotabato; and in the towns of Mlang, Tulunan, and Kabacan in this province, which also harvested their palay recently. He said the supply of lower-priced rice in the market would continue until the next harvest in June. Cheaper rice can now be easily accessed by our consumers since they can buy it anywhere in Cotabato, Bacus said. Suppliers have also assured the rice retailers association in Cotabato that there would still be a lot of buffer stocks to sustain the needs of consumers before the next harvest. Bacus also said his store had been enjoying brisk sales; disposing at least 20 sacks of local rice per day, which doubled the 10 sacks per day or even less he sold during lean times. He noted that in the past months, consumers preferred to buy rice per kilogram to buy it in bulk. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Northern Samars investment policies get Malacaang citation,"TACLOBAN CITY Northern Samar has solidified its reputation as a prime investment hub after receiving a presidential recognition for its pioneering One-Stop Action Center for Strategic Investmentsthe first local government green lane for strategic investments in the country. This recognition, conferred at the Gawad Bayanihan sa Pamumuhunan awarding ceremony in Malacaang Palace on March 13, underscores Northern Samars growing prominence as an investor-friendly province. Alongside Laguna, Bulacan, Cavite, Batangas, Ilocos Norte, and the City of General Trias, Northern Samar was honored for its commitment to streamlining business processes and fostering an environment conducive to economic growth. Jhon Allen Berbon, head of the Provincial Economic Development and Investment Promotions Office , emphasized that the recognition serves as a strong endorsement of Northern Samars readiness for large-scale investments. This award is important because it is a testament that Northern Samar is investment-ready. Our policies are in place, and the provincial government is fully committed to supporting investors, he said on Tuesday. With this latest national recognition, Northern Samar strengthens its appeal as a top-tier investment destination, paving the way for greater economic opportunities, job creation, and sustainable development, he added. Gov. Edwin Ongchuan credited the provinces investment success to the strategic collaboration between provincial government departments and local governments which has created a seamless investment ecosystem. While the PEDIPO team has been instrumental in securing two presidential recognitions, this achievement is truly the result of the collective effort of the entire provincial government and all local governments. It is our unity and interdependence that give Northern Samar its unique advantage as a premier investment destination, particularly in renewable energy, Ongchuan said in a statement. The provinces efforts in investment promotion have already yielded impressive results. In 2024, Northern Samar was also recognized for establishing PEDIPO and launching the Winvest Northern Samar campaign, initiatives that have successfully attracted and facilitated over P150 billion in investments, particularly in the energy sector involving renewable energy. This milestone has captured the attention of international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which are now studying Northern Samars best practices for possible replication in other local governments across the country.

From war zones to Laang Kawal Partylist: Lt. Col. Almario fights for reservists,"MANILA, Philippines In a nation where resilience is a cornerstone, Lt. Col. Jaime Roberto Almario stands as a formidable advocate for change. A Philippine Army reservist, telecommunications entrepreneur, and the first nominee of the Laang Kawal Partylist, Almarios career bridges the chaos of the Marawi siege with a relentless campaign to uplift the countrys 1.2 million reservists, revealing a leader shaped by experience and driven to strengthen national defense. Almarios military journey began with a sociology degree in 1990, followed by nearly two decades of service in the Army Reserve Command, where he committed to 60 days of annual training. Inspired by his father, a pioneer of the PAF Blue Diamonds aerobatic team, he honed his skills over years, topping the General Staff Course for Non-Resident Instruction in 2018, ranking among the top ten in Psychological Operations and Civil-Military Operations courses, and completing the Basic Airborne Course. Yet, his defining moment came in 2017, when conflict thrust him into the spotlight. That May, as martial law enveloped Mindanao, Almario, then 48, was one of only three reservists from Manila summoned by the Armed Forces of the Philippines for the Marawi siege. A businessman with a telecommunications firm, he left his civilian life behind, arriving within 24 hours to join the fight. Stationed on the front lines, he bolstered military communication signalsa critical lifeline amid combatdrawing on his expertise to keep troops connected. Conditions were brutal: he camped in roofless structures to evade sniper fire, went weeks without bathing, and subsisted on irregular meals of rice and sardines. Long lines of evacuees fleeing the city, carrying only essentials, underscored the crisiss scale, while Almario and his team ducked shrapnel and returned fire when pressed. Every time I went to the evacuees, they begged us not to bomb their homes, he later recalled, a glimpse into the human cost he witnessed. Dengue, contracted amid the squalor, cut his deployment short by Septembers end, sending him back to Manila to recovera stark testament to the physical strain of service. His time in Marawi deepened his admiration for regular troops, whose daily sacrifices he saw up close, often with limited resources. They make do with what they have, he noted, a lesson that now fuels his broader mission. Today, Almario leads Laang Kawal Partylist, representing over 1.2 million reservists89% of the AFPwho shoulder defense and disaster response on a scant 2% of the AFP budget of PHP 256.1 billion. He targets the Reservist Act of 1991 , which he deems outdated, pointing to Marawi where reservists brought their own weapons and gear due to inadequate support. His platform demands health and accident insurance for annual training, arguing, Ive seen reservists step up with nothing but grit and patriotism; insurance means were serious about keeping them in the fight. Alongside Col. Noel Detoyato and Lt. Col. Jannette Chavez-Arceo, he also calls for training cyber warriors among the youth to counter digital threats, recognizing the shifting nature of modern warfare. Almarios civilian career amplifies his impact. In telecommunications, he has supplied vital equipment to government agencies, a role that proved pivotal after Typhoon Ondoy in 2009. When the storm struck, he redirected his company to provide search-and-rescue solutions, showcasing his ability to adapt under pressurea skill he later brought to Marawi. This blend of innovation and resolve informs his push for a better-equipped reserve force. His Marawi deployment was rare for a reservist, typically activated post-conflict for rehabilitation rather than mid-battle. Alongside a bank vice president and an IT expert, Almario bridged civilian expertise with military need, yet faced the same risks as regularssniper fire, disease, and deprivation. That experience drives his advocacy today, as he seeks to close the gap between reservists and their regular counterparts in resources and recognition.

Manila Water to hike rates by 4 centavos,"MANILA, Philippines The Razon-led Manila Water Company Inc. will increase its water rates by four centavos from April to June to recover losses due to currency fluctuations. Customers consuming 10 cubic meters per month or less may see their bills inch up by 21 centavos per month, while those consuming 20 cu. m. to 30 cu. m. or less will have to pay 45 centavos to 90 centavos more, respectively.

Dutertes ICC arrest: Separating fact from lies,"MANILA, Philippines The International Criminal Court s arrest warrant against former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has sparked a firestorm of reactions, with supporters calling it a political attack and critics hailing it as a long-overdue step toward justice. As misinformation spreads across social media, it is essential to separate fact from speculation. On March 11, 2025, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila upon his return from Hong Kong. The arrest was carried out based on a warrant issued by the ICC, which accused him of crimes against humanity related to extrajudicial killings during his war on drugs and his time as mayor of Davao City and later as the president between 2016 and 2022. After the arrest, Duterte was immediately transferred to ICC custody. By March 12, 2025, the ICC confirmed that he was detained at The Hague, where he will undergo trial READ: EXPLAINER: Whats next after arrest of Rodrigo Duterte? Despite the arrest being carried out under proper legal procedures, various narratives have surfaced online, questioning the legitimacy of the warrant and the ICCs authority. This article examines the major claims surrounding Dutertes arrest and how they hold up against verified sources, ICC documents, and international law. Many argue that 43 deaths are too few to justify a charge of crimes against humanity, with some pointing out that more people die from accidents every day. Others compare this to incidents like the Ampatuan Massacre, which involved 58 deaths but was tried in Philippine courts. The ICCs warrant cites 43 specific cases as representative examples of a much broader pattern of extrajudicial killings. These include 19 individuals alleged drug pushers or thieves killed by members of the DDS in various locations in and around Davao City. Additionally, at least 24 alleged criminals, including drug pushers, thieves, and drug users, were killed by or under the supervision of Philippine law enforcement, sometimes with the assistance of non-police personnel, across different locations in the country. However, the investigation extends far beyond these cases, covering thousands of deaths, with human rights organizations and the ICC estimating the toll of Dutertes drug war at between 6,000 and 30,000 victims. A pre-trial document dated September 2021 stated that the ICC prosecutor estimates the total number of civilians killed in connection with the so-called war on drugs campaign between July 2016 and March 2019 appears to be between 12,000 and 30,000. The document further stated that the estimates of the number of killed persons range from 12,000 to 30,000. [T]he Philippine authorities themselves reported that at least 5,281 persons were killed during police anti-drug operations between July 2016 and March 2019. Focusing on select cases is a common practice in international trials to establish patterns of state-sponsored violence while keeping legal proceedings manageable. READ: EXPLAINER: Brutal attacks on civilians hauled Rodrigo Duterte to The Hague What Dutertes supporters say: Some claim the ICC deliberately ignored higher death tolls because it could not prove them in court, suggesting that the case is weak. They argue that if thousands were really killed, the ICC would have cited all of them. The ICC does not dismiss higher death toll figures but rather strategically selects cases with clear evidence, credible witnesses, and traceable command responsibility. This is standard practice in international cases and ensures prosecutors can prove a consistent pattern of violence rather than overwhelming the court with thousands of separate cases. Several ICC documents, including the most recent ones such as the warrant of arrest repeatedly and explicitly noted that the larger body count still supports the ICCs case and that the killings were both widespread and systematic two key elements of crimes against humanity. The attack was widespread. It was carried out on a large scale and frequent basis, victimising a significant number of civilians over a broad geographic area and a prolonged period of time, the ICC stated. [T]here are reasonable grounds to believe that this attack was both widespread and systematic: the attack took place over a period of several years, and thousands people appear to have been killed, it added. Supporters claim that being labeled an indirect co-perpetrator proves that Duterte is not directly responsible and is being unfairly prosecuted. Some argue that this makes the case against him weaker, as he is not accused of personally killing anyone. The term indirect co-perpetrator is a legal classification under Article 25 of the Rome Statute, which still attributes significant responsibility to the accused. 3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person: Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person, regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible. This designation means that while Duterte may not have personally committed the killings, he enabled, facilitated, and contributed to the widespread and systematic nature of the crimes. The ICCs pre-trial documents explicitly state: 109. DUTERTE is the person most responsible for the crimes referenced in this Application. He was the mastermind of the formulation and dissemination of the Common Plan to target alleged criminals. He first conceived of the plan and oversaw its implementation in Davao City, and then nationwide, the ICC warrant of arrest document noted. As Mayor, and later as head of state, head of government, and leader of the countrys police forces, DUTERTE had authority over the perpetrators of relevant crimes. Indeed, as President, he was the only individual in the Philippines with ultimate authority over all State actors involved in implementing the Common Plan. He alone could approve or prevent the implementation of the Common Plan in its entirety, it added. Additionally, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber provided further details on Dutertes direct role in orchestrating these crimes: These crimes were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines, pursuant to a State policy to attack alleged criminals in the Philippines. DUTERTE and his co-perpetrators knew that their conduct was part of, or intended their conduct to be part of, that attack. The publicly stated aims of the attack were to reduce criminality, including drug use, sale and production, in Davao City and, later, in the whole of the Philippines . During the Presidential period, many of the acts were committed as part of a formal anti-illegal drugs campaign implemented by law enforcement personnel, which was frequently described in public reporting as DUTERTEs War on Drugs. However, such acts were only one component of the attack, which from its origins, targeted individuals suspected of various crimesand not only alleged drug users, dealers and producers. The ICC cites Dutertes repeated public statements encouraging extrajudicial killings, which established an environment of impunity. It also noted that these killings were not isolated incidents but part of a deliberate and coordinated effort linked to Dutertes leadership. In 2021, it explained that based on available information, Duterte has publicly encouraged extrajudicial killings in a way that is incompatible with a genuine law enforcement operation. What Dutertes supporters say: They argue that the Philippines has its own courts and that foreign institutions should not interfere in domestic matters. Some claim the ICCs case disrespects Philippine sovereignty. Fact check: Legally invalid The ICC operates under the complementarity principle, which means it only intervenes if a country is unwilling or unable to prosecute crimes domestically. READ: EJK victims mom: Duterte arrest not enough as Dela Rosa, Albayalde still free Some claim that Duterte was kidnapped because there was no valid warrant issued by the Philippines, making his arrest illegal. The ICC legally issued a warrant for Dutertes arrest after a thorough investigation. The Philippine government followed proper legal protocols. Claims that he was kidnapped lack any factual basis. READ: ICC EXPLAINER: Fine points in the arrest of Rodrigo Duterte What Dutertes supporters say: Dutertes supporters claim that his arrest is a political move orchestrated by his enemies rather than a legitimate legal process. Many argue that the ICC is being used as a weapon by Western powers to interfere in Philippine affairs, targeting Duterte while ignoring worse human rights violations in other countries. Others claim that the case is being pushed by his political opponents who have long sought to bring him down. Some supporters also argue that Dutertes strong stance against the U.S. and Western influence, along with his closer ties with China and Russia, made him a target of international institutions like the ICC. They point out that the ICC has not arrested leaders from powerful nations like the U.S., despite their involvement in wars that led to mass civilian casualties. Another claim making the rounds online is that the timing of Dutertes arrest after his allies lost influence in government suggests that political maneuvering was involved rather than an impartial legal process. There is no credible evidence that Dutertes arrest is politically motivated. The ICC is an independent judicial body, and its judges and prosecutors operate under strict legal guidelines to ensure impartiality. The decision to issue an arrest warrant followed a years-long investigation based on witness testimonies, forensic evidence, and reports from human rights organizations. READ: Timeline: ICC investigation of Duterte As the case unfolds, it is important to separate facts from misinformation. The ICC has followed proper legal processes, and Duterte will now have the chance to defend himself in court. His supporters claim the case is weak, but the legal process is clear: The charges are serious, the evidence is strong, and international law is being upheld.

De Lima to Duterte: Its your time to face charges,"MANILA, Philippines After standing up before the courts due to the cases filed against her, former Sen. Leila de Lima said it is now time for former President Rodrigo Duterte to face his share of raps and let the rule of law take its course. De Lima on Tuesday admitted that Dutertes arrest, based on the arrest order issued by the International Criminal Court , is personal for her since she believes she was imprisoned due to her criticism of the past administrations drug war. Duterte was held earlier by the Philippine National Police to implement the International Criminal Police Organization red notice for the ICC arrest order. This is for the alleged crimes against humanity of mass murder charges filed against the ex-leader. This is deeply personal for me. For almost seven years, I was imprisoned on fabricated charges, accused of crimes I did not commit all because I dared to speak out against Dutertes drug war. While I was behind bars, thousands of Filipinos were killed without justice, their families left to grieve with no answers, no accountability, she said. I faced my case, knowing I was innocent. I stood before the courts because I had nothing to hide. Duterte now has to answer for his actions, not in the court of public opinion but before the rule of law. This is how justice should workthose in power must be held to the same standards as everyone else, she added. De Lima said that Duterte was being made to answer now because the world refuses to forget his actions. Today, Duterte is being made to answer not to me, but to the victims, to their families, to a world that refuses to forget. This is not about vengeance. This is about justice finally taking its course, de Lima said. To those who have fought this long and difficult fightyour voices mattered, your courage mattered, and today, the pursuit of justice continues, she added. Earlier, de Limas party-list group Mamamayang Liberal also maintained that Dutertes arrest is not about retribution but rather is merely the service of justice and the pursuit of accountability for all the extrajudicial killing victims of the past administrations drug war. According to the group, the arrest is a reminder that while justice may take time, it will always find its way. Over the weekend, there were rumors that the ICC would soon issue an arrest order for Duterte. During this time, the former president, his relatives, and key allies flew to Hong Kong to meet overseas Filipino workers. Duterte was slapped with complaints before the ICC over his administrations war on drugs, where thousands of individuals were killed. While many lauded Dutertes campaign, it was also flagged by human rights defenders for being violent and bloody. In Hong Kong, the older Duterte addressed talks on the arrest order, saying that his actions during the war on illegal drugs were for the Philippines benefit. Several official and independent investigations of the drug war have shown that there were many instances where innocent individuals were dragged into the anti-drug operations. In August 2017, 17-year-old Kian delos Santos was summarily executed in Caloocan City, even though he was not the original target of the operation. The three police officers involved in the killing of delos Santos were convicted of murder. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

In August 2024, the House of Representatives quad committee started an extensive probe into the past administrations drug war and other issues.

"Remain loyal to PH despite calls for partisan activity, AFP, PNP told","TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte The Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police must to remain loyal to the country despite calls from different sectors to engage in partisan activity, former senator Panfilo Ping Lacson said on Saturday. Lacson, in a radio interview with DZRH, said that it is important for people especially those from the uniformed services to verify information spreading on social media, as they may be swayed by misinformation and disinformation. The former senator, who also served as PNP chief, said this after some of former President Rodrigo Dutertes supporters on social media urged police and military personnel to leave the service and back the ex-leader. They should remain professional and loyal to their duty. That is the best message, Lacson said in Filipino during the interview, transcripts of which were sent to reporters. In this day and age of information technology, fake news spreads fast. And we know that is in their training to conduct fact-checking first. If there are reports of partisan activity, they should not get involved, he added. According to Lacson, the issue of misinformation and disinformation may be one of the issues that he will look into should he be reelected. We must focus on penalizing the spread of fake news. This threatens our culture, and contributes to the destruction of our good manners and right conduct, he added. On social media, there have been posts allegedly made by police and military officers who resigned from office as they cannot accept that Duterte was arrested and handed over to the International Criminal Court . However, there were netizens who also fact-checked these posts. For example, a post from a male police officer claimed that he left the service after finding it hard to still be part of the PNP after it assisted the International Criminal Police Organization in enforcing the ICC arrest order. The police officer was criticized by his alleged ex-girlfriend who claimed that the resignation of the officer happened months before Duterte was arrested.

"ML party-list: Rodrigo Dutertes arrest not retribution, but justice","MANILA, Philippines Instead of being about retribution, former president Rodrigo Dutertes arrest is the serving of justice and the pursuit of accountability for all the extrajudicial killing victims of the past administrations drug war, Mamamayang Liberal party-list group said on Tuesday. In a statement, the ML party-list said that Rodrigos arrest is a reminder that while justice may take time, it will always find its way. Duterte was detained earlier by the Philippine National Police , to implement the International Criminal Police Organization red notice for the arrest order issued by the International Criminal Court . READ: Rodrigo Duterte now under police custody This moment is not about retributionit is about justice. The fight does not end here. Those who enabled and profited from this bloody campaign must also be held accountable, ML party-list said. To the victims and their families, we see you, we stand with you, and we will continue to fight alongside you. Justice may take time, but it always finds its way, it added. According to ML party-list, their first nominee, former senator Leila de Lima was actually one of the first personalities to raise concerns about the EJKs in Dutertes drug war which they believe resulted in the trumped-up cases against her. The arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte by the International Criminal Court is a long-overdue step toward justice. For years, victims and their families have waited for accountability, and today, the world has affirmed that no one is above the law, ML party-list said. Our first nominee, Leila de Lima, was among the first to challenge Dutertes drug warwhen few dared to do so. She stood up against the killings, exposed the truth, and paid the price with almost seven years of unjust imprisonment. While she faced her case with dignity and courage, Duterte must now answer for the crimes committed under his watch, it added. De Lima was one of Dutertes fiercest critics, probing the former presidents anti-drug campaign even when she was still the former Commission on Human Rights chairperson, and he was Davao Citys mayor. The former senator was detained for almost seven years due to different drug-related charges filed when Duterte was still in office. De Lima has been acquitted for all of the cases. READ: De Lima acquitted in last drug case Aside from the ML party-list, Akbayan party-list first nominee and human rights lawyer Chel Diokno also lauded Dutertes arrest, saying that the former president must be placed under the ICC jurisdiction immediately. I stand with the families and victims of extrajudicial killings in welcoming the ICCs arrest of former Pres. Duterte. Justice demands that this warrant be enforced without delay. Duterte must be placed under the ICCs jurisdiction immediately, Diokno said. The Philippine government must fully cooperate with the Interpol and the ICC, mobilizing all law enforcement agencies to bring him in. The government must act decisively and ensure that he has nowhere to hide. No more safe spaces for tyrants, he added. Diokno said this is the law catching up on Duterte, who has been accused of allowing EJKs in the drug war. For decades, Duterte thought himself untouchableabove the law, beyond accountability. But history catches up with even the most ruthless despots. His reign of terror must meet its inevitable end: his conviction, he said. This is a critical step towards justice, but the fight is far from over. His allies will attempt to shield him, manipulate the system, and derail the process. The government must guarantee full protection for the witnesses and victims families, who are now at risk of retaliation, he added. Over the weekend, there were rumors that the ICC will soon issue an arrest order for Duterte, due to the crimes against humanity of mass murder cases against him. During this time, the former president, his relatives and key allies, flew to Hong Kong to meet overseas Filipino workers. Duterte faced the crimes against humanity raps due to his role in his administrations waron drugs, where thousands of individuals were killed. While many lauded Dutertes campaign, it was also flagged by human rights defenders for being violent and bloody. In Hong Kong, the older Duterte addressed talks on the arrest order, saying that his actions during the war on illegal drugs were for the Philippines benefit. READ: Duterte on possible ICC arrest warrant: I did everything for Filipinos Several official and independent investigations of the drug war have shown that there were several instances where innocent individuals were dragged into the anti-drug operations, like in the case of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos who was summarily executed even if he was not the original target of the operation in Caloocan City. last August 2017.

Espiritu: Dont let politics trump justice in handling Duterte,"CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY Lawyer Luke Espiritu, a senatorial candidate of Partido Lakas ng Masa, has urged justice and human rights advocates to follow closely how the Marcos administration behaves in relation to the legal issues hounding former President Rodrigo Duterte. Espiritu, who is on a nine-day campaign swing in Mindanao, told journalists in Cagayan de Oro City on Monday that he is worried that if the public let their guards down on Dutertes cases, political considerations could take precedence instead of the cause of justice. If Duterte eventually succumbs to the ICC and he is rendered politically irrelevant, there might be a tendency not to complete the process of seeking justice, Espiritu said. But what we are after for here is not just politics, so we should push further until real justice is achieved, he added. Espiritu cited the case of former President Joseph Estrada who was convicted for plunder but was eventually pardoned by then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Estrada went on to run again for president in 2010 and placed second in the race. In 2013, Estrada was elected Manila mayor. Recently, there have been talks about an arrest warrant for Duterte from the ICC which is investigating him for crimes against humanity owing to thousands of deaths during his administrations war on drugs. Based on the official count, the drug war deaths reached over 6,000. But human rights groups estimated the casualties at over 20,000. Although the Philippines is no longer a state party to the ICC, the Marcos administration had said the government is prepared to cooperate with Interpol to implement an arrest warrant against Duterte. The speculations of the impending arrest of Duterte were fueled by the increased presence of police officers at the Davao International Airport beginning on Sunday. However, the Davao regional police leadership said it was only for a simulation exercise. Government must administer justice to Duterte and to his infrastructure of death, Espiritu said.

DepEd set to reduce public school teachers paperwork by 57%,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Education on Monday announced that it is set to reduce school paperwork by 57 percent to ease the administrative burden on public school teachers. According to the DepEds statement, public school teachers will soon be required to regularly complete only five school forms from the previous 174. Additional forms will be filled out only based on specific teacher designations, following DepEd Order No. 005, s. 2024, Teachers have repeatedly raised this issue, and were addressing it. Reducing their bureaucratic workload will improve their well-being and allow them to focus on delivering quality education, Education Secretary Sonny Angara said. Angara said the initiative is part of the Marcos administrations broader education reform agenda, which seeks to make the public school system more efficient while at the same time improving the working conditions of teachers. It was also based on a study by the DepEds Technical Working Group which found that teachers spend excessive hours on non-teaching tasks. Another study from IDsight also showed that 42 percent of teachers work over 50 hours per week, with 17.8 hours dedicated to ancillary duties and 8.1 hours to program-related tasksmost of which is spent filling out forms instead of engaging with students or preparing lessons. To support the transition, DepEd will issue a formal department order outlining the new guidelines. Nationwide orientation sessions will be conducted to ensure a smooth rollout, the DepEd said. The agency will also develop a Data Management Framework to standardize school data collection to eliminate redundant and outdated reporting requirements. Furthermore, advocacy campaigns will also be launched to inform stakeholders about the reforms and promote teacher-friendly policies.

With collective action, we can stop its spread through proper awareness, community cooperation, and timely intervention, ensuring a healthier and safer country for everyone, Delos Santos said. The rise in dengue cases is a serious public health concern that requires swift government response and community cooperation. We must act now to prevent further infections and save lives, he added. Meanwhile, House Deputy Majority Leader Janette Garin reiterated that vaccination is the key to addressing the surge in dengue cases. Garin cited Brazil and Mexico for their single-digit number of deaths due to dengue. She also noted that those who received dengue vaccine do not experience severe symptoms. Hindi na kailangan dalhin sa ospital kapag mild [ang dengue]. Sayang ang oportunidad sa Pilipinas dahil nakinig tayo sa mga pekeng balita, she said also on Sunday. In October 2023, the Office of the Ombudsman filed complaints against Garin and other Department of Health officials before the Sandiganbayan, over the alleged realignment of public funds to purchase anti-dengue vaccines. The anti-dengue vaccination program was initiated under the term of then-president Benigno Aquino III during which Garin was DOH secretary.

Delos Santosnoted that Tarlac has seen a 144 percent increase in dengue cases in the first six weeks of 2025, totaling 792 cases with one fatality. He added that the disease mainly affected the 10 to 19 age group. Moreover, he said Bulacans 83 percent increase prompted the provincial government to establish the Dengue Fast Lanes initiative in hospitals.

"EJK victims mom: Duterte arrest not enough as Dela Rosa, Albayalde still free","MANILA, PhilippinesWhen former President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested on the basis of a warrant from the International Criminal Court on Tuesday, March 11, a mother of two EJK victims said the fight for justice is far from over. Llore Pasco, mother of Crisanto and Juan Carlos Lozano, who were killed by the police in Quezon City in 2017, said Duterte is not the only one responsible for the thousands of killings in Dutertes murderous crackdown on drugs. Hindi lang dapat si Duterte ang maaresto , she told INQUIRER.net on Friday, March 14, the same day the former chief executive is expected to make his first appearance before the ICC. RELATED STORY: Bato dela Rosa, Oscar Albayalde next on ICC arrest list? For Pasco, Sen. Ronald Bato dela Rosa, who was Dutertes first Philippine National Police chief, and even Oscar Albayalde, who succeeded him, are also responsible for the thousands of killings in the war on drugs, which the government waged starting in 2016. Sila ang mga pangunahing personalidad sa giyera kontra droga , she said of Dela Rosa and Albayalde, who were PNP chiefs from 2016 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019, respectively. Last year, former Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV shared a July 3 ICC document, which tagged Dela Rosa, Albayalde and three other police officials as suspects for their concrete involvement in the widespread and systematic killings in the war on drugs. READ: ICC prosecutor tags Bato dela Rosa, 4 PNP execs as suspects It was Dela Rosa who signed on July 1, 2016 Command Memorandum Circular No. 16-216, the document that operationalized Oplan Tokhang and ordered the police to neutralize and negate drug suspects. READ: Diokno: House can focus on Dela Rosas drug war memo Albayalde recalibrated the war on drugs when he became PNP chief after Dela Rosas mandatory retirement. He, who had stressed that he cannot guarantee that his drug war will be less bloody, led the PNP until he retired in 2019. Sagutin din nila yong papel nila sa giyera kontra droga , Pasco pointed out. Sila ang nag-implement . As of Wednesday, March 12, Malacaang said it has not yet received official communication regarding an International Criminal Police Organization red notice alert for Dela Rosa and Albayalde. However, Dela Rosa already said he will seek protection from Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero for him not to be handed over to the ICC in case a warrant of arrest will be issued against him. READ: Bato dela Rosa to seek Senate protection from ICC Albayalde, who described the arrest of Duterte for alleged murder as a crime against humanity as a sad day, told CLTV36 News that he is hoping the government will provide him with legal protection.

Its time for Imee Marcos to decide where she stands Garin,"TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte After skipping the administration-backed senatorial campaign rally in Tacloban City in protest of the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte, Sen. Imee Marcos now needs to decide where she will stand in terms of political alliances, Iloilo 1st District Rep. Janette Garin said on Friday. Garin, in an online press briefing, said she understood Marcos when the latter withdrew from the campaign sortie because she disagreed with the governments decision to allow Dutertes arrest. But Garin said the senator, the sister of President Ferdinand Marcos, now needs to clarify her politics. Marcos is a member of Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas, the administration-backed senatorial slate, but she continues to defend the Dutertes despite its family members attacking her brother. Kababayan po si Senator Imee Marcos ano, I was born and raisedin Leyte, Waray-waray din ako, naiintindihan koyong kanyangmga nararamdaman, but I think the bigger problemthat Senator Imee Marcos hasisyong pagbalanse nong kanyang sariliat kanyangpolitika, Garin told reporters.

Kung nasa pula ka,sa pula ka; kung nasa puti ka, nasa puti ka, so in this casesiyempre lalo nat medyokailangan niya pa ng kadagdagan na boto, she cannot afford to losethe votes of the Duterte supporters [] Pero kung nandidito naman siya na talagang openly defendingthe former president, mawawala naman yongsuporta ng Alyansa sa kanya, she added.

Lacson: Excessive giving of aid may contribute to unemployment in PH,"CAMARINES SUR, Philippines Does providing too much financial aid make Filipinos lazy? Former Sen. Panfilo Ping Lacson, who is aiming for a Senate comeback, wants to reassess the various forms of the ayuda system in the country if he is reelected. Lacson raised concerns over whether excessive aid provision discourages people from working. He made this remark during a press conference with the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas Senate slate in Camarines Sur on Friday when asked if the distribution of aid contributes to the rising unemployment rates in the country. The Philippine Statistics Authority had earlier reported that the number of jobless Filipinos rose to 2.16 million in January, up from 1.63 million in December. Maybe, with the overwhelming amount of aid, our fellow Filipinos have become lazy and dont want to work. So, I think this is my personal opinion we should revisit the many forms of aid we are giving, Lacson said partly in Filipino. He proposed enhancing the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program instead, noting that this national poverty reduction strategy is institutionalized. READ: Philippine unemployment rate rises to 4.3% in January If we keep giving aid without basing it on data provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority or the national government, the money might just go to waste. On the other hand, if we enhance 4Ps, it is time-bound. After seven years, a family graduates, and another family takes their place. It addresses nutrition and education, provides jobs, and offers opportunities for livelihood, Lacson explained in Filipino. Lacson expressed hope that his fellow Alyansa candidates would support his position and advocate for focusing on 4Ps. Meanwhile, other forms of aid may be contributing to the rising unemployment rate, from 3.1% to 4.3%. People may become lazy, thinking there will always be aid coming to them just because they are related to a leader or patron, he added. Senatorial hopeful Camille Villar, meanwhile, supported Lacsons remarks, emphasizing the need to identify the root causes of the rising unemployment rate. This is also what I advocate for: we need to help our micro, small, and medium enterprises because 67 to 70% of jobs in the Philippines come from MSMEs, Villar said, mostly in Filipino.

"Abalos expresses deep gratitude to HK OFWs, stokes Filipino pride","HONG KONG Former Interior Secretary and senatorial candidate Benhur Abalos Jr. received overwhelming support from overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong and vowed to champion legislations that will uplift the lives of Filipinos both overseas and in the Philippines. Speaking before a packed gathering of OFWs, Abalos expressed his deep gratitude to the Filipino community in Hong Kong for their unwavering trust and support. Hong Kong is home to over 140,000 Filipino migrant workers, most of whom are household service workers. While they provide for their families back home, many face challenges such as labor exploitation, lack of legal protection, and high placement fees. Mga kababayan ko dito sa Hong Kong, tandaan ninyo, iisang pamilya tayo. Inaalay ko ang sarili ko sa inyo, Abalos said. Abalos reminded the OFWs that despite lifes challenges, there is always hope and a way forward. Mga kasama, tandaan ninyo ito. Walang taong walang problema at walang problemang walang solusyon. Whether we like it or not, iisang bangka tayo. Matanda, bata, lalaki, babaehenerasyon natin ito. Tandaan niyo yan, walang imposible, he said. Abalos assured OFWs that he understands their struggles and will work towards policies that protect and empower OFWs. Abalos also highlighted the importance of preserving Filipino values, no matter where they are in the world. Ang katangian na dadalhin mo bilang Pilipino, maski saan sa mundo, dadalhin mo talaga dahil proud ka to be a Filipino dahil gusto mong lumaki ang anak mo na makatao, maka-Diyos. At lalo-lalo na, alam niya sagrado ang buhay ng tao, he emphasized. One of the priority pieces of legislation Abalos will push through, if elected, is lowering electricity costs by scrapping value-added tax on electricity, which he believes will open doors for more investments and job opportunities in the country. Uunahin ko ang pagpapababa ng kuryente sa bayan. Tayo ang pangalawa sa pinakamahal na kuryente. Kapag natanggal ang buwis diyan, bababa ang kuryente at dadami ang negosyo, dadami ang trabaho, at marami pang ibang benepisyo, he explained. Abalos has been consistent in his stand against VAT on electricity. During the 13th Congress, Abalos, who was then a congressman, opposed the imposition of VAT on electricity and petroleum products, arguing that it would have severe inflationary impact and only add to the financial burden of Filipino consumers. After the e-VATs passage, Abalos immediately filed a joint resolution declaring a two-year moratorium period on the lifting of exemptions of petroleum products and generation companies from the coverage of VAT. With over 30 years in public service, Abalos underscored the importance of making bold decisions, even when unpopular, if they serve the greater good.

DENR orders developer to vacate Masungi Georeserve property,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Environment and Natural Resources ordered the developer of Masungi Georeserve in Rizal to vacate the 300-hectare property. The DENR said this was due to irregularities, but the Blue Star Construction Development Corporation, an affiliate of a foundation that manages the property, blamed the agency for project delays. After several investigations that started in 2014, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources today cancelled its 2002 Supplemental Agreement with government housing contractor Blue Star Construction Development Corporation due to illegality, failure to go through a bidding process, and failure to execute, the DENR said in a statement. The DENR said it canceled the agreement due to the following: lack of the required Presidential Proclamation declaring the subject matter of the contract for housing purposes, lack of documents proving that the proposed construction went through regular procurement or bidding process; and failure to deliver the 5,000-unit Garden Cottages housing project within five years from signing on November 15, 2002. DENR assistant secretary for legal affairs Norlito Eneran said that Blue Star initially signed a joint venture agreement with the DENR in 1997 for the survey, design construction, development and marketing of a project called Garden Cottages on a 130-hectare government property in Tanay, Rizal Province. Despite this, Eneran said Blue Star was then still able to secure a supplemental agreement in 2002 that even increased their project area to an additional 300 hectares, despite no substantial housing units built on the original 130 hectares awarded. Eneran further noted that since the original joint venture agreement for the housing project was never executed, and no bidding process occurred despite the five-year timeline, making the 2002 Supplemental Agreement without basis. However, the Masungi Georeserve Foundation Inc. asserted that the project was competitively bidded out by the DENR and won by Blue Star. Let us be clear it is the DENR who is at fault here. It has stubbornly refused to carry out its contractual obligation to clear the area of large-scale illegal occupants, liens, and encumbrances, causing delays to the project and significant injury to its private sector partner, the MGFI said in a statement. This is not just an assault on Masungi Georeserveit is an attack on every Filipino striving to protect our natural heritage in the face of worsening floods, landslides, and droughts that threaten our communities, it added. The MGFI said it has yet to receive the 15-day notice to vacate the area. TheMasungiGeoreserve, is within the rainforests of Rizal, in the Sierra Madre Mountain Range. In April 2024, two forest rangers were injured after they were attacked by alleged residents of Baras, Rizal. READ: Malacaang: Probe Masungi resorts The MGFI noted that this move endangers the safety not only of the public but more recklessly, of the rangers and environment defenders who fight a risky battle to defend this threatened landscape. It is apparent that this case is part of a larger, more insidious effort to weaken environmental protection, silence advocates, and clear the path for selfish commercial interests to exploit our natural resources. We will fight not just in defense of Masungi but in defense of environmental justice for all, MGFI said. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

"Govt assisted in arresting Duterte because of Interpol, not ICC","MANILA, Philippines The Philippine government assisted in the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte because it was a request from the International Criminal Police Organization and not due to the International Criminal Court , President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. clarified on Tuesday. Marcos, in an address at Malacaang after the plane carrying Duterte left Manila for The Hague in the Netherlands, stressed that it was Interpol that asked for help in enforcing the ICC arrest order. Duterte was stopped from leaving the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3 earlier, as the Philippine National Police assisted Interpol in serving the arrest order from ICC. This arrest order is related to the crimes against humanity raps faced by Duterte when he initiated the drug war during his administration. Its very simple, its a request to the Philippine government from Interpol to enforce the arrest warrant. And of course, we comply with our commitments to Interpol. We did not do this because it was derived from or it came from ICC, we did this because Interpol asked us to do it, and we have commitments to them, and we live up to those commitments, Marcos said. When asked if Dutertes arrest equates to ceding sovereigntyas a Filipino citizen was turned over to a foreign bodyMarcos disagreed, saying that he was consistent in not helping the ICC. No, bakit naman ? Dahil consistent naman tayo, hindi tayo tumutulong sa imbestigasyon ng ICC [] meron tayong contact sa kanila natural, pero, no, not on an official level, we did not help them in any way, the Chief Executive said. The arrest that we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol. It just so happened that that came from ICC. But its not because it came from ICC, its because it came from Interpol, he explained. Marcos in the past, when political relations between his family and the Dutertes were still good, had been adamant that the government would not help the ICC in its investigation of former President Duterte. Last February 2024even when Duterte had already issued some choice words for Marcos and his alliesthe incumbent president said his views that the government would not assist the ICC probe had not changed. READ: Marcos adamant: No ICC probe into PH war on drugs Previously, Marcos also assured Dutertes co-accused, former police chief and currently Sen. Ronald dela Rosa, that his administration would no longer engage with the ICC after the international body rejected the Philippine governments appeal to stop the investigation of crimes against humanity complaints. READ: Bongbong Marcos: Thats it; were done talking with ICC However, there have been several rumors over the past months that ICC investigators have been coming in and out of the country to conduct its probe on Dutertes drug war. Then, over the weekend, talks about the ICC possibly releasing an arrest order against Duterte mounted. During this time, the former president, his relatives, and key allies flew to Hong Kong to meet overseas Filipino workers. In Hong Kong, the older Duterte addressed talks on the arrest order, saying that his actions during the war on illegal drugs were for the Philippines benefit. Several official and independent investigations of the drug war, however, showed that there were many instances where innocent individuals were dragged into the anti-drug operations. In August 2017, 17-year-old Kian delos Santos was summarily executed in Caloocan City, even though he was not the original target of the operation.

Silent no more: How children with disabilities fight online sexual abuse in PH,"MANILA, Philippines One in every hundred Filipino children has been abused to create new child sexual exploitation material. If this can happen to children in general, how much more to those with disabilities isolated, overlooked, and at even greater risk? With the Philippines long considered the global epicenter of Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children , the numbers paint a horrifying picture. Over 400,000 children have fallen victim, yet fewer than 2,000 have been rescued since 2014. The vast majority suffer in silence. For many children with disabilities, social media serves as a lifeline one of the few ways for them to connect with others. However, for traffickers, it acts as a hunting ground. They spend so much time online, more than you would imagine, Gamilla Avena, NORFIL Foundations program manager, toldINQUIRER.net. Children with disabilities, especially those who feel isolated in their own communities, seek friendship online. That makes them more vulnerable because they dont always know whos behind the keyboard, she added. The harsh reality is that children with disabilities are easy targets. Despite the increasing prevalence of OSAEC, research specifically focusing on children and adolescents with disabilities remains limited. However, the few existing studies indicate that children with severe physical disabilities, autism, Williams syndrome, or intellectual disabilities face the highest risk of online victimization. Many do not realize theyre being exploited until its too late. But something is changing. In a historic moment, children and youth with disabilities took the stage to demand action against OSAEC, standing firm in their fight for change. Held in Quezon City and Palawan, the conference,Break the Prevalence, End the Violence: Protecting Children, Creating a Safe Philippines,was not just another forum for adults to speak on behalf of children. This time, the children spoke for themselves. The event will next be held in Bicol to reach even more children with disabilities. Over two days in each location, children and youth with disabilities from across the country shared their experiences, concerns, and ideas. Many were hearing about OSAEC for the first time a stark reminder of how little awareness exists in vulnerable communities. In Palawan, they are not aware of OSAEC. It was their first time to hear [and] learn about it, said Avena. Ive been telling our partner organizations in Palawan [that] Im surprised they werent aware of OSAEC, [especially considering] that Palawan is a very touristy [area], she continued. Through workshops, role-playing, and photovoice activities, participants explored how online abuse happens, why children with disabilities are at risk, and, most importantly, how they can protect themselves and each other. One of the most crucial moments unfolded when the children drafted their own manifesto a document outlining their demands for better education, stronger protections, and improved accessibility in health and safety services. In a decisive call for change, children and youth with disabilities demanded stronger protections and equal rights. Their manifesto outlined four key priorities: 1. Access to education: The children emphasized that education should be more inclusive and tailored to their needs. Parents, in partnership with teachers, should provide guidance to make learning easier, especially for those who require personalized approaches. To support their education, they called for the provision of Accessible Learning Materials resources designed to accommodate their disabilities. Financial constraints are also a major barrier. Many children with disabilities struggle to stay in school because of costly assistive devices, therapy sessions, and transportation challenges. To address this, the children demanded scholarships and government support for assistive devices, ensuring that no child is left behind due to financial difficulties. 2. Access to health: Children with disabilities often face significant obstacles in accessing medical care. Many hospitals and clinics lack the proper facilities, and medical personnel are not trained to communicate with patients who have disabilities. The manifesto called for free medical services, better-equipped health centers, and faster, more efficient processes for children needing medical attention. One specific request was for health workers to be trained in sign language. Deaf children and youth often struggle to communicate their health concerns, which can lead to misdiagnosis, neglect, or poor treatment outcomes. The children also urged the government to provide free medicines, particularly for chronic conditions that require continuous treatment. 3. Access to information: Many children with disabilities are left in the dark about their rights, their daily needs, and how to protect themselves from abuse and exploitation. The lack of accessible information puts them at greater risk of OSAEC, human trafficking, and other forms of violence. The manifesto stressed that all children and youth with disabilities should have access to age-appropriate, disability-friendly materials that teach them about personal safety, online dangers, and their legal rights. They also called for community-based programs that will help spread awareness, equipping children with the knowledge and confidence to seek help when needed. 4. Access to protection: Children with disabilities are among the most vulnerable to violence not just online but in their everyday environments. They called for local governments and barangays to strengthen safety measures to ensure that they can live free from harm. Among their specific demands were: These concrete, immediate measures could greatly reduce risks for children and youth with disabilities, enhancing their safety both online and offline. The conferences may have ended, but the fight for change continues. NORFIL Foundation a non-profit dedicated to protecting the rights of neglected, abused, and disabled children along with the Netherlands-based Liliane Fonds and local partner organizations, plan to expand its program to reach more children, particularly in underserved areas like Bicol.

"Govt, private sector urged to do more vs online child abuse","MANILA, Philippines An advocacy group on Wednesday raised concerns over the increasing prevalence of Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children and Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials in the country, calling on the government and private sector to take stronger action against it. CitizenWatch made the pronouncement after the International Justice Mission recently revealed that at least 500,000 minors in the country have fallen victim to OSAEC and CSAEM. READ: Boosting child online protection These figures, said CitizenWatch Philippines co-convenor Kit Belmonte, may even be higher due to underreporting and lack of awareness. We cannot allow the internet to be weaponized against our children. We need tighter regulation of digital platforms, stronger international cooperation to dismantle syndicates, and intensified efforts to educate parents and children alike, Belmonte said in a statement. The group also stressed the need for full enforcement of existing laws, such as Republic Act 11930, the Cybercrime Prevention Act, and the Anti-Child Pornography Act. However, Belmonte stressed that legal frameworks would not be enough and that efforts from telecommunications companies and internet providerslike blocking websites with child abuse materials and educating consumers in responsible internet use, scams and cybercrimeswould be vital in addressing the rise of OSAEC and CSAEM cases. This fight is not just for lawmakers, enforcers, or tech giantsit is a fight for our youth, the future of our nation. Parents must be the first line of defense. Schools must integrate digital literacy into curricula. Tech companies must continuously refine their safeguards. And every citizen must refuse to turn a blind eye, he said.

"Group urges Ombudsman to expedite graft cases vs DA, NFA execs","MANILA, Philippines The Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura has urged the Office of the Ombudsman to expedite the filing of cases against former and current officials of the Department of Agriculture and the National Food Authority involved in irregularities in the rice industry. In a press release on Sunday, President Rosendo So called on Ombudsman Samuel Martires to speed up the investigation process and reveal the identities of those involved. We strongly urge Ombudsman Martires to unveil the identities of the Department of Agriculture officials, including those at the graft-ridden NFA, both past and present, who have been involved in graft and corruption at the agency, in the interest of public transparency, So said. We are asking the Ombudsman to inform us about the progress of the case against the former NFA administrator and other officials, he also said. READ: NFA chief faces graft raps for diversion of rice funds In February 2024, NFA Assistant Administrator for Operations Lemuel Pagayunan submitted a complaint letter to the Office of the President alleging that former NFA administrator Roderico Bioco and other officials sold 75,000 bags of rice to the private sector, which may have defrauded the government of millions in revenue. A preventive suspensionhad been ordered by the Ombudsman the following month against 139 NFA officials, including Bioco, amid an ongoing investigation into the alleged disadvantageous sale of rice buffer stocks. The order against more than 100 NFA officials and employees has already been lifted, but the anti-graft body said they are still included as respondents in the case. Furthermore, So is seeking updates from the Ombudsman on other cases filed against former NFA officials who have engaged in similar irregularities with the anti-graft body. There was also another case involving a different administrator who purchased palay and subsequently authorized rice imports. We want to know what has happened with these other cases, So said. The Ombudsman must resolve these cases without delay. If no one is prosecuted before the Sandiganbayan, then those involved in such anomalies will not be deterred, he lamented.

"Cat dies after being kicked by man in Makati, sparking outrage","MANILA, Philippines A community cat at the Ayala Triangle Gardens in Makati City died after reportedly being kicked by a person who is most probably a foreigner. The cat was resting in the park when a Chinese kicked it, according to nonprofit animal organization CARA Welfare Philippines said. Citing a closed-circuit television footage taken on January 4, the group said the kick appeared to have killed the animal. When confronted and brought to the barangay, the man was arrogant and refused to provide his address, the group said in a Facebook post on Thursday. He told us to write to the Chinese Embassy. Because of this, he remains free to roam the streets, to roam the gardens, the organization reported. We seek your help to know the mans identity and whereabouts in order to proceed with the filing of a case against him, CARA Welfare Philippines pleaded. The group pointed out that the incident was a blatant violation of Republic Act No. 8485. Under RA 8485, also known as the Animal Welfare Act of 1998, any acts of cruelty, abuse and killing of animals are punishable by law. READ: Ignoring animal cruelty, neglect will lead to more severe abuses, says Poe Meanwhile, in a statement on Friday, Sen. Grace Poe condemned the incident and urged authorities to hold the cat killer accountable. That community should be a safe haven for pet cats and dogs. No animal should be subject to cruel and unwarranted abuse, Poe said in Filipino. Poe then pushed for the passage of her bill that would impose a heftier fine on animal abusers. The bill also seeks to empower local government units, particularly barangays, to handle cases of cruelty and neglect of animals. A stronger and more responsive Animal Welfare Law in place would have immediately caught the perpetrator and made him answerable to his crime, she said.

"Duterte, dela Rosa ask SC to stop govt from cooperating with ICC","MANILA, Philippines Former president Rodrigo Duterte and Senator Ronald Bato Dela Rosa on Tuesday filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to stop the national government from cooperating with the International Criminal Court investigation on the Duterte administrations war against drugs. In a 94-page petition for certiorari and prohibition, Duterte and Dela Rosa asked the Supreme Court to issue a temporary restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction to prevent the government from assisting the ICC in any way. This included enforcing ICC arrest warrants and summons and cooperating with any other individuals or foreign law enforcement coordinating or providing assistance to the Interpol or any foreign law enforcement agency assisting in the execution of ICC-issued warrants, red notices, or other legal actions pertaining to the Philippines. The petition also seeks to have the SC order the immediate release of any individuals arrested amid the ICC investigation. The respondents of the petition are Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, Philippine National Police chief Gen, Rommel Marbil, Criminal Investigation and Detection Group chief Nicolas Torre III, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, former Immigration chief Norman Tansingco, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo and Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner. In a chance interview with reporters, Davao-based lawyer Israelito Torreonwho represented Duterte and Dela Rosa in filing the petitionargued that the ICC lacked jurisdiction in the country since the Philippines withdrew from the Rome Statute in 2019. There, the Philippine government should no longer cooperate with the International Criminal Court, and all the actions therefore of the respondent are null and void and we call on the Philippine government to stick with the law, with the rule of law that since the Philippines is no longer a party to the International Criminal Court, then it has no business anymore cooperating with such body, including the International Police, said Torreon. We are earnestly praying to the honorable Supreme Court to grant us a temporary restraining order, restraining the Philippine government, the respondents from cooperating with the ICC, and to release outright from custody our beloved Former President Rodrigo Duterte, on the grounds that his detention now is illegal, unconstitutional, and has no basis under the law, he added. The petition was filed the same day the former president was arrested upon his arrival in Manila on Tuesday morning. As of posting time, Duterte is under police custody at the Villamor Airbase.

Hontiveros rebukes elusive Roque,"MANILA, Philippines Kung talagang travel lang yan, bakit iligal ang pag-alis mo sa bansa at bakit ayaw mo nang bumalik dito, Harry Roque? Sen. Risa Hontiveros couldnt help but blurt this question on Wednesday after former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque clarified that he is not fleeing from Philippine authorities because he is not a fugitive and he has a right to travel. In a post on Facebook, Roque argued that there was no warrant of arrest issued against him. Citing Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, Roque said he is only being pursued not as a criminal but as a resource person. This, however, did not sit well with Hontiveros. Travel lang ba talaga yang ginagawa ni Atty. Harry Roque, o paglabag na sa batas ng Pilipinas? Hindi ba pagtakas iyan? said Hontiveros in a statement on Wednesday. In his own words, he explains his extended disappearance as flight from a congressional contempt. That is a clear admission of his liability for the crime of disobedience to summons by Congress under Article 150 of the Revised Penal Code, she emphasized. According to the opposition lawmaker, it is extremely ironic that Roque is talking about his right to travel, when the Bureau of Immigration has declared that it is studying the filing of cases against him for leaving the country via illegal means. Ayon nga sa BI, malamang ay gumamit si Roque ng falsified immigration clearances para makapasok sa ibat-ibang bansa, o di kaya ay tinutulungan ng masasamang indibidwal, said Hontiveros. That is on top of the qualified human trafficking complaint he is already facing in connection to his ties to the massive, crime-ridden POGO complex in Porac, Pampanga, she added. During the Senate subcommittee on justice and human rights hearing on Tuesday, Hontiveros questioned Roques whereabouts.

"3 female boarders robbed, one of them raped in Lucena City","LUCENA CITY A man with a face mask broke into a boarding house in this city on Wednesday, March 5, stole personal belongings, and raped one female boarder.

CAPHRA expresses worries over corruption allegations against WHO,"MANILA, Philippines The Coalition of Asia Pacific Tobacco Harm Reduction Advocates expressed concern over corruption allegations against the World Health Organization , citing the United States withdrawal of support. CAPHRA said it had deep concerns about recent events involving the WHO. The group raised questions about the effectiveness of the organizations global public health policies, pointing to accusations of corruption and mismanagement in the Asia-Pacific region. Its time to hold the WHO to its mandate and core mission of protecting global health based on science, not ideology; that is inclusive of all stakeholders, without judgment or prejudice, said Nancy Loucas, CAPHRA executive coordinator. CAPHRA cited evidence of inappropriate influence, primarily by Bloomberg Philanthropies, in domestic policymaking in the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam. In the Philippines, a 2021 House of Representatives public hearing revealed that the local Food and Drug Administration received grants to fund the drafting of local regulations for cigarette alternatives from foreign private organizations funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies. In Bangladesh, the appointment of Saima Wazed as WHO regional director for South East Asia is under scrutiny. Wazed, the daughter of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was elected in November 2023 amid allegations that her mother improperly influenced the election. The director of Bangladeshs Anti-Corruption Commission was quoted in a newspaper saying corruption was suspected in Wazeds appointment. In Pakistan, the government suspended the activities of Tobacco-Free Kids and Vital Strategies, two international non-governmental organizations funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, citing several violations. The Interior Ministry also asked the State Bank of Pakistan to freeze the organizations bank accounts. In Indonesia, the Ministry of Health faces allegations of incorporating the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control agenda into a draft regulation on plain packaging for cigarettes. This sparked concerns about potential foreign intervention in Indonesias tobacco policy. Hikmahanto Juwana, a professor of international law at the University of Indonesia , said that Indonesia should protect its national sovereignty from foreign intervention and that all government policies should be based on domestic conditions. In India, New Delhi stopped a small nonprofit funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies from conducting tobacco-control work after it failed to disclose its funding, according to a Reuters report. An official said other foreign-funded organizations will need prior approval for anti-tobacco activities in the capital. In Vietnam, the Consumer Choice Center said Bloombergs harmful interference threatens smoking reduction. A Facebook post showed WHO officials in Vietnam thanking Bloombergs organizations for their support in providing technical assistance to the government on smoking and nicotine products. The push from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the WHO represents a form of regulatory colonialism, where foreign entities dictate policies without considering the unique challenges of individual countries, the Consumer Choice Center said. CAPHRA said it finds the allegations concerning, particularly as the WHO prepares to convene the 11th Conference of the Parties to the FCTC despite funding constraints from the US withdrawal. COP11, scheduled for Nov. 17 to 22, 2025, at the Geneva International Conference Centre in Switzerland, is expected to cost the WHO millions of dollars. The US withdrew its WHO membership, citing concerns over the organizations handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its response to global health crises, and its ability to implement reforms and maintain independence from inappropriate political influence. This decision has prompted other countries, including Argentina, Hungary, Italy, and potentially Russia and the UK, to reassess their affiliations, raising broader discussions about the WHOs impartiality and political influence. CAPHRA also urged Asia-Pacific countries, including the Philippines, to assert independent policies and reject influence from foreign funders. At this years COP, it is crucial that the Philippines assert its sovereignty against Bloombergs influence over the FCTC and advocate for its own policies. This ensures that smokers who do not quit will have access to less harmful alternatives, CAPHRA said. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

"Lawmaker bares more odd names linked to Piattos, OVP confi funds","MANILA, Philippines New findings unveiled chips brand and cellphone model-sounding names linked to Mary Grace Piattos, one of the nonexistent recipients of confidential funds under the Office of the Vice Presidents aid program, according to a lawmaker. House Deputy Majority Leader La Union Rep.

He, however, pointed out that Pia and Renans middle and last names only have a single T. Ortega further revealed that another name surfaced similar to the Xiaomi cellphone model from 2018. He said the name Xiaome Ocho also appears on the list. Similarly, these names dont appear in any birth, marriage, or death records from the Philippine Statistics Authority . We thought only one name was odd on the list of confidential fund recipients. But it seems that there is already a whole family of Piattos and even a cellphone model that has joined, Ortega said in Filipino. Youll be torn between laughing and getting furious when you see Xiaome Ocho on the list, Ortega pointed out, he added. The lawmaker cited these findings as one of the reasons why Duterte must answer where the funds go. She needs to explain who exactly makes up this Budol Gang when she presents her defense at the impeachment trial, Ortega said. We will continue reviewing the documents attached to the impeachment complaint to expose more members of this Budol Gang. The public deserves the truth, he added.

"Sandiganbayan junks Maslogs motion for reconsideration, affirms conviction","MANILA, Philippines The Sandiganbayan has junked the motion for reconsideration filed by Mary Ann Maslog , affirming its decision to convict her in the graft case related to the controversial textbook scam in 1998. In a six-page resolution dated March 5, the anti-graft courts Second Division denied the motion for reconsideration filed by Maslog last February 12 for lack of merit. The Court finds that her motion is mainly a mere rehash of arguments already resolved in the Decision dated January 28, 2025, the document reads. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit. The Decision dated January 28, 2025, finding accused Mary Ann T. Maslog guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3 of R.A. 3019, stands, it adds. Maslog filed her appeal before the Sandiganbayan, seeking to reverse her conviction for graft, which resulted in her 10-year prison sentence. In her motion, Maslog argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish all the elements of the offense under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and the prosecution failed to prove the existence of a conspiracy between her and her co-accused Emilia Aranas and Ernesto Guiang of the then Department of Education. But based on the resolution, the prosecution maintained that there is proof beyond reasonable doubt convicting Maslog of graft and that her assumption of multiple aliases and attempt to fake her death constitute consciousness of guilt. These acts demonstrate a calculated effort to escape legal accountability, contradicting her claim of innocence, the Sandiganbayan pointed out. The prosecution likewise mentioned the direct and circumstantial evidence establishing her active role in facilitating the fraudulent disbursement of government funds and proof of her collusion with Aranas and Guiang through her submission of falsified sub-allotment release orders to facilitate disbursements; active coordination in ensuring the unlawful release of public funds; and receipt of proceeds from the fraudulent transactions. The accused was a private individual who conspired with public officers. While Maslog was not a public officer, her collaboration with Aranas and Guiang-who had control over the disbursement of public funds-makes her equally liable under Section 3 of RA 3019, the anti-graft court said. The accused, with evident bad faith, caused undue injury to the government. The fraudulent transactions resulted in the illegal disbursement of millions of pesos, causing grave injury to the government and unwarranted benefits to Esteem Enterprises, it added. Maslog, along with Aranas and Guiang was implicated in a P24-million graft case in 1998. They were accused of allegedly faking records to secure payments from the Department of Budget and Management. In 2020, Aranas and Guiang were both convicted and sentenced to a maximum of prison term of 10 years by the Sandiganbayan. Meanwhile, Maslogs case was archived as she was reported to have died in 2019. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Responding to lifes great calling Teaching students with special needs,"MANILA, Philippines Elsa Pabustan has dedicated more than half of her life to teaching. For her, it is not just a profession. It is a life-long devotion. She believes she is being used by God as an instrument to change the lives of many children, especially those who need special attention and care. Teacher Elsa, like what her students call her, has been practicing her profession for almost 30 years. From years of teaching basic education curriculum to elementary students, she answered one of her lifes biggest callings to teach under the Special Needs Education program. In an interview with INQUIRER.net, she recalled how she became the pioneer teacher of the SNED program in Lawa Elementary School in Meycauayan City, Bulacan. She said the school principal told her that she has the heart, patience and dedication as a teacher. I accepted the challenge kasi kung aayaw ako, if I would reject yung request sa akin, sino ang kukuha and paano yung mga batang nangangailangan ng tulong ko? she recalled her her questions to herself. READ: #HerStory: Women Transforming Society The 55-year-old teacher said she may not be not have been equipped with adequate preparation at first, but she wanted to touch the childrens lives. She finished her Masters Degree specializing in special education in December 2022. She also attended seminars and training for the special education program. READ: Teachers give kids with special needs special attention [Ang mga magulang], hindi rin nila tanggap, unang-una, yung mga anak nila na ganun. So, ang hirap ding magpaliwanag sa kanila kung paano ma-a-accept yung ganung klaseng behavior ng anak nila, Pabustan said. Kasi nasa in denial stage lagi ang mga magulang natin noon. Ngayon, at least, may awareness na yung mga magulang about doon sa mga batang may special needs, she recalled. Further, through the years, she said teaching under the SNED program has become rewarding and fulfilling. Its not the material things but yung inside talaga [ng puso mo], yung joy na hindi ko nako-contain when I see my students or learners grow and learn, teacher Elsa beamed. Even in small things lang, it is a big win for me. Maliliit na bagay pero sa mga batang tinuturuan ko, big na yun, she said with pride. Those moments are considered as a victory that should be celebrated, she emphasized. Teacher Elsa admits there were times she wanted to quit teaching the program in the beginning. Noong first day of class, talagang windang. Hindi ko alam [kung] paano iha-handle sila kasi first time ko. Wala pa akong gaanong seminar na na-attend-an, she remembered. Pero sabi ko, by the grace of God, talagang niyakap ko kung anong mayroon na dapat kong maranasan sa paghawak, pag-handle ng mga batang kagaya nila, she said. For her, treating the children with special needs like any other children is important, not just in teaching, but in everyday living. I-embrace mo talaga kung anung mayroon ang mga batang ito and i-treat mo sila na they are just normal children or learner na mayroon ka rin, she said. We should not concentrate sa mga disability nila, but on their abilities, she pointed out. For starters, Teacher Elsa thinks that the childrens behavior must first be modified and so are their fine motor skills. Self-help and gross motor skills must be enhanced before introducing academics to them, according to her. Teacher Elsa observed that the children are equipped with their own talents and skills; and unleashing their full potential is crucial for their growth. She also bared the struggles of the parents in accepting and adjusting to the difficult and complex conditions of their children. READ: Teachers, parents share burden of educating special needs students She said that her silent victories include witnessing moments when the children improve, learn how to follow instructions, and start interacting with other kids. Teachers are regarded as the students second parents. Since the school is an extension of a home to nourish and teach the kids valuable lessons in life, Teacher Elsa finds herself learning from her profession as well. READ: Col. Maria Christina Basco: Mother and pilot She shared that teaching children with special needs highly increases her level of empathy. Teacher Elsa herself is a mother of two. She said her kids are already grown up but she is looking forward to more things to learn from the special kids. These pieces of education will prepare her for the role of a grandmother someday. Mas lalo mong maiintindihan, magagamit as a mother on how to handle yung mga bata, yung apo, yung anak mo sa pagpapalaki sa kanila, she said. Kasi sa pagiging teacher ng special education, kung mayroon kang patience, kailangang ipo-prolong nang mas mahaba yung patience, pang-unawa at pagmamahal sa kanila, she explained. Looking back at her journey as a teacher, she said that her fulfillment with her profession has come a long way. Actually, habang minamahal mo sila, at the same time, you pray for them, she shared. Teacher Elsa shared that she has become an advocate of special education. She said she conducts outreach programs for advocacy campaigns on raising awareness for her learners with special needs. READ: Advocacy for children with special needs Sinasabi ko na yung mga batang ito hindi lang dapat batang mga regular. Dapat ma-feel nila na belong sila sa ginagawa natin sa community, the teacher expressed her sentiment. should also feel that they belong in whatever we are doing in the community.) She also said while she is nearing the retirement age of 60, she is planning to extend her profession abroad. She applied as a SNED teacher in the United States, and is awaiting results of her interview.

READ: COA flags P152-M idle freezers for vaccines In line with this, COA said it recommended the provincial government to instruct the Provincial DRRM Officer to submit the provinces plan for the implementation of the unbalanced fund and submit a written justification, explaining the observations cited in the audit report. Moreover, COA recommended the review and evaluation of the LDRRMF Investment Plan with emphasis on the proper identification and selection of specific priority programs/projects/activities to accelerate their implementation and judiciously plan on how to significantly increase the utilization of the fund. Aside from the unspent disaster funds, COA also flagged the P54.59 million in unsettled suspension, disallowances and charges, which stem from procurement issues and unvalidated expenses. Additionally, the agency revealed that in the province only 17 audit recommendations were implemented, while 15 others were not implemented out of the 32 ones mentioned in the 2022 audit report and prior years. Based on reports, the Philippine Statistics Authority recorded 39,500 poor families in Batangas in 2023 7,200 higher than the 32,300 logged in 2021.

PNP nullifies order to sack anti-kidnap chief due to poll-related rule,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine National Police nullified the order relieving the chief of the Anti-Kidnapping Group . The PNP decision came after Col. Elmer Ragay, PNP AKG director, was administratively relieved of a pending investigation into the case of the abducted 14-year-old Chinese national in an order dated February 28. However, the order relieving Ragay was nullified in another order dated March 3. The new order cited Section 9 of Commission on Elections Resolution No. 11059, which prohibits the transfer of details of any PNP personnel. The administrative relief of PCol.

The AKG was alleged not to have been responsible for the operation, despite the PNPs statement last Wednesday that attributed the recovery of the Chinese minor to the national police forces anti-kidnapping arm. In a briefing in Camp Crame on Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Jean Fajardo, PNP spokesperson, explained that the police force issued the relief order last Friday under the initial impression that the Comelec rule did not apply in Ragays case.

However, she added that during the poll bodys second Security Task Force meeting with the PNP on Monday ahead of the 2025 midterm elections, the Comelec clarified that the rule against the transfer of detail still applied in Ragays case.

"Scientists urge SC: Protect fisherfolks rights, municipal waters","MANILA, PhilippinesA scientist group has urged the Supreme Court to uphold the rights of small-scale fisherfolk amid legal battles over commercial fishing operations encroaching on municipal waters, which are meant to be reserved for artisanal fishers. AGHAM Advocates of Science and Technology for the People expressed support for small fisherfolk, religious groups, and local government units resisting commercial fishing in municipal waters. The group said allowing large-scale fishing operations in these areas could worsen the decline of the countrys fish stock and further threaten the livelihood of coastal communities. A provision in the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998 allows LGUs to grant commercial fishing vessels access to municipal waters under certain conditions. AGHAM, however, warned that this could dramatically shrink the fishing grounds available to over a million small-scale fishers. Based on studies from various organizations, if the Supreme Court upholds its ruling on the Mercidor petition, municipal fishers could be left with just 2 percent of their traditional fishing grounds. In comparison, 98 percent of the countrys waters would be open to commercial fishing vessels. Under the law, commercial fishing inside the 10-15 kilometer municipal water zone is allowed only if the area is deeper than 7 fathoms and if LGUs permit it. However, some coastal areas reach this depth just a few kilometers from shore, raising concerns about the ease with which commercial fishers could enter municipal waters. Mercidar Fishing Corp. challenged fishing restrictions on October 25, 2023. Less than two months later, the Malabon RTC ruled in its favor, nullifying municipal control over commercial fishing in the 15-km zone and lifting the ban on waters shallower than 12.8 meters. On August 19, 2024, the Supreme Court upheld the decision, citing the OSGs late appeal. READ: Petition filed vs SC ruling on big-scale fishing in town waters AGHAM also flagged the poor enforcement of rules prohibiting commercial fishers from using active fishing gear within these waters. Compounding the issue, some commercial operators continue to resist vessel monitoring systems a key tool in tracking illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing under the amended Fisheries Code . If commercial fishing operators and companies refuse to follow the existing rules, fully allowing them inside municipal waters would spell ecological disaster, AGHAM warned. Recent data from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Philippine Statistics Authority showed an alarming trend. As of 2022, the country had 370,000 registered municipal fishing vessels compared to just 5,090 commercial vessels. Despite being only 1.3 percent of total registered fishing vessels, commercial fishers produce almost as much catch as municipal fishers. With the Supreme Court ruling allowing more commercial fishing in municipal waters, AGHAM fears that fish stocks will deplete even faster, pushing small-scale fishers deeper into poverty. If commercial vessels with highly efficient fishing gear gain wider access to municipal waters, it will only accelerate the exhaustion of our marine resources, the group said. AGHAMs warning echoed a previous one by Oceana, an international marine protection group. They stated that the declining marine municipal fisheries output already threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and pollution faces an even greater risk if commercial fishing is legitimized within municipal waters, which are legally reserved for small-scale fishers. READ: Fish harvest drops to lowest amid legal fight over municipal waters A preliminary report from the PSA stressed the reported declines in marine municipal fisheries, inland municipal fisheries, and aquaculture. Only the commercial fisheries sector showed growth in 2024. Marine municipal fisheries production dropped by 8.8 percent, from 879.96 thousand metric tons in 2023 to 802.77 thousand metric tons in 2024 its lowest level since 2002. This reduced the sectors share to 19.8 percent of total fisheries production. In contrast, commercial fisheries output increased by 4.2 percent, reaching 857.33 thousand metric tons in 2024, up from 822.43 thousand metric tons in 2023. It now accounts for 21.2 percent of total fisheries production. AGHAM also refuted claims from commercial fishing groups that municipal waters are underutilized because many small-scale fishers lack the means to fish farther out at sea. Most municipal fisherfolk cant afford fuel for longer trips, while others rely on loan sharks for capital. They often have no choice but to sell their catch to their creditors at unfair prices, AGHAM said. Instead of opening municipal waters to commercial fishers, AGHAM urged the government to step in with direct support for small-scale fishers. Among their proposed solutions: In line with AGHAMs appeal were concerns raised by Oceana, which earlier described the Supreme Courts ruling as highly disturbing. Oceana argued that municipal waters are legally designated for small-scale fishers and that opening them to commercial vessels violates their rights and threatens food security.

PNP disputes report saying Chinese wasnt rescued and ransom was paid,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine National Police disputed a story which alleged that an abducted 14-year-old Chinese was not rescued by the police force, and that a ransom was actually paid in exchange for the victims freedom.

Monsod: Disclose names of senators who refuse to act on VP impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines Former Commission on Elections Chairman Christian Monsod on Friday said that the names of the senators who refused to start the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte immediately must be disclosed to the public. I was asking, who are the senators who refused to act immediately? Please name them for the sake of public information, so they will know what they feel, Monsod said at the sidelines of a forum in San Juan City. He also said that the refusal of the senators to act on the impeachment proceedings may implicate the voters perceptions towards them. I feel that they wanted to postpone the trial because theyre afraid that the true self will be revealed in the deliberations of this impeachment trial. They might say something there that may turn off voters, Monsod added. Further, when asked if the delay of the trial is political, he answered: Maybe. READ: Senate break not reason to defer VP impeachment trial Monsod Monsod, one of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, also said that the Senate session break is not an excuse to delay the impeachment trial. Monsod cited Article XI, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution which states that the trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed once it receives the verified impeachment complaints. He also said that the impeachment trial should not be treated as a legislative task, but as a special task. This is an important part of the Constitution on impeachment for the protection of the people. And sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them. This is a constitutional mandate of the Constitution is certainly superior to a recess, he noted. Meanwhile, Senator Risa Hontiveros previously said that it would be great neglect of duty if the senators of the 19th Congress would fail to act on the impeachment complaint. She added that they would not be able to enforce the rules because it will be the 20th Congress that will implement it. READ: Hontiveros warns of neglect if Senate delays Sara Duterte impeachment Senate President Francis Escudero earlier revealed that no impeachment trial will be conducted during the Congress break because the impeachment court was not convened.

Dutertes diverting attention away from OVP fund misuse issue Ortega,"MANILA, Philippines La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega has accused the Dutertes of diverting public attention away from fund misuse allegations hounding the office of Vice President Sara Duterte. In a press briefing on Monday, Ortega said Davao City Mayor Sebastian Dutertes recent statements on the 2025 national budget are just a distraction. Ortega and Bataan 1st District Rep. Geraldine Roman were asked about Mayor Dutertes statements on his podcast where he also claimed that the impeachment trial of his sister, Vice President Duterte, was a distraction from the budget controversy and the Marcos administrations decreasing support. According to Ortega, Vice President Duterte has yet to answer questions related to the identity of Mary Grace Piattos the name that appeared on the acknowledgment receipts of the Office of the Vice Presidents confidential fund disbursements. Likewise, what theyre doing is just a distraction because they still have not answered who Mary Grace is, so what they are doing is to look for distraction, look for diversion so that the issue would not be discussed publicly. Thats their strategy, he said in Filipino. Roman, meanwhile, said that the allegations that the General Appropriations Bill submitted to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for his signature had blank allocations for some items have been addressed already by the House committee on appropriations. She also noted that the grounds for the impeachment of the Vice President came first before the budget issue, which is now being tackled by the Supreme Court. I think it is clear, our committee on appropriations has talked about it and everything, theres a perfect explanation to how the GAA was crafted, how it was signed into law, she added. Ortega also said that the issues raised by lawmakers against Vice President Duterte were publicly available and on record. We saw that we had the quad comm hearing, the committee on good government and public accountability had a hearing,so these are all inquiries, there were witnesses presented, there was concrete evidence submitted, compared to the theatrics and distractions that they are doing, he said in Filipino. Theres a big difference. The people can see that because everything is on record, we were live, we were open to the public as compared to people who do not talk but are now suddenly talking. So thats just theatrics, diversion, he added. Mayor Duterte, in his podcast Basta Dabawenyo, repeatedly questioned the timing of the impeachment of Vice President Duterte. He also insisted that Congress, particularly the House of Representatives, must explain why there were blank items in the 2025 budget bill. The issue stemmed from Davao City 3rd District Rep. Isidro Ungab and former President Rodrigo Dutertes allegation that the GAB had blank provisions. Ungab said this was based on the copy of the bicameral conference committee report that was sent to House lawmakers before it was ratified. READ: Duterte ally: Will raise budget blanks issue before SC However, acting appropriations chairperson and Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo clarified last January 27 that the blanks in the bicam report on the 2025 budget were only just for the final computation of the amendments made by lawmakers. Quimboreiterated that the 2025 General Appropriations Act is legal, as the allocations on the then-proposed budget were already decided by the bicam members before both the House and the Senate ratified the report. READ: Quimbo: Blanks in 2025 budget only for final computation Vice President Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of CF lodged within her offices, threats to government officials including President Marcos, and conduct unbecoming of a high-ranking official.

Budget Secretary Pangandaman hails 5.7% budget deficit drop,"MANILA, Philippines We are very pleased with the report that our budget deficit for 2024 has gone down to 5.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product or P1.506 trillion. This is better than expected, Department of Budget and Management Secretary Amenah Mina F. Pangandaman said. This came following the recent release of the Cash Operations Report of the Bureau of the Treasury on the national governments full-year fiscal performance for 2024. This is the lowest rate recorded since the pandemic started in 2020, Pangandaman noted. It is a marked improvement compared to the 6.2 percent deficit recorded in 2023, given the better-than-expected revenue and spending performance. This is also well within the fiscal outlook of the Development Budget Coordination Committee at our last meeting. Pangandaman stressed that this is thanks in large part to the dynamic leadership of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. and the Philippine Economic Team who have been at the forefront of ensuring that the macroeconomic targets of the administration are met. The DBCC met on December 2, 2024, to revisit the governments medium-term macroeconomic assumptions and fiscal targets, including the deficit outlook for 2024, which is expected to reach 5.7 percent of GDP. This performance reaffirms that we are on track with our Agenda for Prosperity, Pangandaman added. This solidifies the Philippines position as one of the dynamic emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific region. The DBCC aims to gradually reduce the budget deficit to 3.7 percent by 2028. Pangandaman said that the countrys economic managers remain committed to achieving growth-enhancing fiscal consolidation while prioritizing long-term investments in key sectors such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare to sustain our economic recovery. Through these efforts, we will continue to build a Bagong Pilipinas that fosters job creation, increases incomes, and reduces poverty, the Budget Secretary and Chair of the DBCC assured. This positive outcome underscores the effectiveness of the Department of Budget and Managements efforts to optimize agencies budget utilization rates, Pangandaman said. Government spending rose by 11.04 percent compared to the previous year, surpassing the target by 2.97 percent, driven primarily by the accelerated implementation of various health and social protection programs, increased salaries for qualified government employees, and strong infrastructure and other capital outlays of the Department of Public Works and Highways, among others.

"Manila Water enhances preparedness for summer, Fire Prevention Month","MANILA, Philippines Manila Water has implemented a series of proactive measures to ensure adequate water supply during Fire Prevention Month and at the onset of the dry season. Manila Water has prepped and checked 3,294 active yellow fire hydrants across the East Zone of Metro Manila and parts of Rizal to support the Bureau of Fire Protection during emergencies. These hydrants are strategically positioned to maximize coverage and efficiency. Each hydrant in commercial areas has a coverage radius of 350 meters, while those in residential areas have a 250-meter service radius. The build quality and spacing of the hydrants strictly adhere to the standards outlined in the Fire Code of the Philippines . Additionally, four purple hydrants have been installed at the water companys Marikina North Sewage Treatment Plant , Ilugin STP, Poblacion STP, and UP STP to provide additional firefighting resources for BFP-NCR. These purple hydrants source water from the wastewater system lessening the strain on our water supply. To address the usual increase in demand for water during the summer months, Manila Water continues its aggressive leak detection and quick response across its water network spanning over 5,500 kilometers to ensure treated water goes directly to its 7.7-million customers. Manila Waters non-revenue water, or water lost due to leaks and illegal connections, remains one of the lowest in Asia averaging only 13.51% in 2024. For supply management, operations for the East Bay Water Supply System Phase 1 have commenced, adding up to 50-million liter per day . The Binangonan Pumping Station, completed in 2024, supports East Bay Phase 1 with a 7-million-liter reservoir. Final testing is also underway for the Calawis Water Treatment Plant, an 80 MLD facility set to bolster water availability. The Cardona Water Treatment Plants capacity is also expected to be maximized up to 110 MLD to meet rising demand especially in drier months. Furthermore, a backwash recovery system is being implemented at its Balara Treatment Plant 1 and 2, recovering 30 MLD of water. As we work to ensure our water network distribution operates efficiently, we seek the cooperation of our customers to always practice responsible water use to further extend the limited supply, especially in Metro Manila, Manila Water Corporate Communications Director Jeric Sevilla said.

"VP Duterte impeachment trial delay may endanger evidence, witness Chua","MANILA, Philippines Manila 3rd District Rep. Joel Chua on Friday warned that delaying the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte may endanger the evidence and witnesses. Chua, a member of the House of Representatives prosecution team,said that while they respect Senate President Francis Escuderos views on when the impeachment trial should start, they cannot help but express concerns about the risks brought by the delay. The reason why we want the impeachment to start is because you know, we are also looking at the evidence that we have gathered, these may be tampered, Chua said during a press briefing. Second, our witnesses, of course, we are concerned that if the hearings would take some time before starting, many of them might be scared, he added. On Wednesday, Escudero said the trial would start on July 30 when the 20th Congress starts office and end in October. READ: Senate can wrap up Sara Duterte impeachment trial in 3 months Escudero As of now, what we can do is to appeal. At the end of the day, of course, we also respect the views of the senators, especially the Senate President. We will talk about that, but that is one thing that me and the other prosecutors are considering and worrying about, Chua said in Filipino. The House impeached Duterte last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a Vice President. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5. It means Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. There are also conflicting opinions regarding whether it is proper for the current Senate to start the trial when the 2025 midterm elections will surely change the composition of the legislative chamber. Despite these concerns, the House and the Senate have started preparing for the impeachment trial. On Friday morning, House Secretary General Reginald Velasco confirmed that he released Memorandum order No. 19-1006, which directs the following offices to perform these duties: Among the functions of the units would be to provide plenary support, legal research, records management, stenographic transcription, information technology, security, and administrative coordination. The Houses formation of the secretariat comes after Escudero last Wednesday outlined the duties of offices and officials once the impeachment trial starts.

Sana po ay makonsulta at laging makasama, lalo sa pagpaplano. Sabi nga natin, nothing about us without us.

SolGen seeks dismissal of SC petition vs 2025 budget,"MANILA, Philippines- Citing fatal procedural defects and utter lack of merit, government lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the petition questioning the constitutionality of the General Appropriations Act for 2025 signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. last December. The petition before this Honorable Court does not represent a genuine concern for constitutional integrity but appears to be an attempt to merely impede the implementation of a law that is vital to the nations progress and the well-being of its people, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said in his offices 89-page comment dated February 27 but only made public Friday. The petition, filed by Davao Representative Isidro Ungab and former Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, raised several violations of the 1987 Constitution with the approval of the 2025 budget, including the supposed blank items in the bicameral conference committee report of the spending plan. READ: Solon, other petitioners ask Supreme Court to nullify 2025 GAA Petitioners said the Bicameral Conference Committee Report showed several blanks, particularly the budget allocations for theNational Irrigation Administration , Department of Agriculture, and the Philippine Coconut Authority. Here, the Bicameral Conference Committee not only made several amendments to the 2025 General Appropriations Bill but left blanks in their reportwhich is very dubious and dangerous as the budgets for the said offices and programs remain to be undetermined, read the petition. But Guevarra said the claim of a blatant violation of the Constitution is without legal basis and, in fact, is a bare assertion without citation. He said the petitioners failed to point out specific provisions of the Constitution that were violated. Petitioners cannot do so because, in fact, there exists no prohibition, Guevarra said. He added: Whatever doubt petitioners have against the contents of the GAB, whether they were duly deliberated and agreed upon by both houses, and any claim that anything anomalous occurred within the BCC, falls in the face of the enrolled bill. The enrolled bill, he said, has been transmitted to the President, was complete in itself, contained no blanks, and was duly approved by both Houses of Congress.

The decommissioned names were Aghon, Enteng, Julian, Kristine, Leon, Nika, Ofel, and Pepito, Pagasa announced in a statement on Wednesday. It added that Pagasa Administrator Nathaniel Servando first disclosed the retirement of the tropical cyclone names during a press conference on February 17.

Security for Mindanao bets must come from same Army unit Lacson,"MANILA, Philippines Candidates in hotly-contested areas in Mindanao must be given security coming from the same Philippine Army unit to prevent election-related violence, former senator Panfilo Ping Lacson said on Thursday. In a statement, Lacson a former Philippine National Police chief said that having the same personnel from any Armed Forces of the Philippines unit would prevent armed confrontations. The former senator said this after Vice Mayor Mohammad Omar Samama of Datu Piang, Maguindanao del Sur, who is seeking reelection, was shot while he was speaking during a medical mission in Barangay Magaslong last Monday. Beyond the usual reactive investigation of election-related violence in Maguindanao, government may consider replacing all the security escorts of the opposing candidates with AFP personnel belonging to the same army battalion or division in the region, Lacson said in a tweet on X. Having Army personnel belonging to the same unit and under the same field commanders replacing PNP and private armed groups securing both camps will prevent armed confrontations, he added. Samama, son of Datu Piang Mayor Victor Samama, was brought to an undisclosed hospital in Maguindanao del Sur. Police are looking at politics as the possible motive, as the elections are just three months away. Both Samamas are running under the United Bangsamoro Justice Party, the political party of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. But aside from this attempt on Samamas life, two more shooting incidents were recorded in Mindanao in Cotabato City on Tuesday and in Lanao del Sur on Wednesday. On Wednesday morning, Abdulazis Aloyodan, 60, former mayor of Lumbaca-Unayan in Lanao del Sur, was killed by unidentified gunmen who emerged from a pickup truck. Aloyodans relatives, particularly Lumbaca-Unayan Mayor Jamalia Aloyodan, said the former mayor had no known enemies and had already retired from politics. Meanwhile, an engineering faculty member of Notre Dame University was killed in Barangay Rosary Heights 3 in Cotabato City. Footage from a closed circuit television camera showed that a gunman, aboard a motorcycle from the opposite lane, shot Angas several times along the busy Notre Dame Avenue. But Lacson said that he has actually received information that at least six more candidates for municipal council posts, along with their supporters, were killed in politically-motivated incidents in Maguindanao.

"DOH reports 1,046 diarrhea cases in Eastern Visayas","TACLOBAN CITY The Department of Health has reported 1,046 cases of acute watery diarrhea in Eastern Visayas from Jan. 1 to mid-February this year. The situation is largely due to prolonged rainy days. The number of cases is still lower compared to a year ago. DOH Eastern Visayas regional information officer Jelyn Lopez-Malibago gave the information in a phone interview on Thursday, She also said the count in the first six weeks of the year is lower by 24 percent compared to the 1,376 cases logged in the same period in 2024. Eastern Samar province recorded the highest number of patients at 304, followed by Samar, 224; Biliran, 216; Leyte, 114; Northern Samar, 106; Tacloban City, 62; and Ormoc City, 20. Despite clusters of cases in 41 villages across the region, no outbreak has been declared, Malibago told the Philippine News Agency. DOH defines an outbreak based on a significant rise in cases over the past five years, local government capacity, and recommendations from health authorities, she noted. The decline in acute watery diarrhea cases early this year is attributed to preventive measures such as awareness campaigns, advisories during flooding, and the distribution of water testing kits, she added. The DOH funded the acquisition of 99 water testing kits to local governments last year, significantly increasing the number of kits available in towns and cities. Previously, water testing kits were provided by the World Health Organization , according to Rez Dacoco, DOH regional coordinator for food and waterborne diseases. Dacoco said diarrhealoose, watery, and possibly more frequent passage of stoolis a common problem during rainy days as runoff contaminates water sources, especially in open sources. Meanwhile, Dacoco reported that suspected cholera cases in the region significantly dropped by 79 percent, from 564 cases last year to 118 cases this year. Southern Leyte recorded the highest number, with 90 cases concentrated in the towns of Padre Burgos, Macrohon, and Maasin City. The situation is largely attributed to damaged water sources caused by Typhoon Odette in 2021. DOH continues to monitor waterborne diseases and urges local government units to prioritize water safety. Even purified water from refilling stations isnt guaranteed safe unless tested, Dacoco added. Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms will manifest between 12 hours and five days after ingesting contaminated food or water. Among its symptoms are acute diarrhea, vomiting, and rapid dehydration.

Fishermen in Palawan find human arm inside sharks belly,"PUERTO PRINCESA CITY, Philippines Fishermen from Barangay Calandagan in Araceli town, Palawan province found a human arm inside the stomach of a shark they caught recently, police said on Thursday, Feb. 27. READ: 2 Russians dead, one loses arm in suspected shark attack off Batangas According to the Palawan Police Provincial Office, the fishermen were fishing about 26 miles off Calandagan near Canaron Island, using hook and line, when they caught a 20-kilogram shark. Upon returning to shore, the fishermen slaughtered the shark to sell it to waiting residents. During the process, a human arm measuring approximately 12 inches fell out of the sharks stomach. The fishermen immediately buried the severed arm and reported the incident to authorities. On Feb. 17, personnel from the Araceli Municipal Police Station and the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office went to the barangay to retrieve the arm for fingerprinting and possible identification. However, the arm was too decomposed to obtain fingerprints. Meanwhile, the Sangguniang Barangay of Calandagan released an official statement explaining that they did not publicly disclose the incident to avoid confusion and to allow authorities to handle the situation appropriately. Barangay officials also said they investigated and interviewed the fishermen involved and subsequently turned the matter over to higher authorities for further examination.

"DBM, DOH want special audit of health emergency allowances","MANILA, Philippines The Department of Budget and Management and the Department of Health on Friday sought a special audit of the previously released and disbursed funds for the payment of all Public Health Emergency Benefits and Allowances amid requests for additional funding. The DBM and the DOH said that the special audit will assist the health department in validating and consolidating all requests and disbursements related to health emergency allowance . The government recognizes and lauds the significant contributions of our healthcare workers during the pandemic. It also has serious concerns among economic managers regarding why the funding requirements to cover the incentives remain a moving target, even more than a year after the state of public health emergency was lifted. This situation creates uncertainties regarding the governments payment obligations for this purpose, they said in a joint press release. READ: Bong Go appeals to DBM, DOH to settle health workers unpaid allowances In light of these developments, including further appeals for additional funding requirements for PHEBA, the DBM and the DOH agreed during the Monthly Economic Managers Meeting held on February 17, 2025, to request the Commission on Audit to conduct a special audit of the previously released and disbursed funds for the payment of all PHEBA claims to ensure proper accounting of public funds spent for this purpose, it also said. Moreover, the request was sought after the DBM and the DOH received various appeals and additional requests for HEA payments not covered by the earlier release, the agencies said in the same statement. The DBM has previously allotted and released P121.325 billion to DOH to cover all healthcare workers and non-HCW worker benefits for eligible claims from 2020 to 2023. This amount covered the grant of Special Risk Allowance, HEA, COVID-19 Sickness and Death Compensation, and other benefits, such as meal, accommodation, and transportation allowances. During the hearings of the Senates committee on health and demography on April 2 and May 20, 2024, the DOH requested additional funds worth P27.453 billion to fully cover the requirements of the PHEBA Program. In July last year, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman approved the release of a Special Allotment Release Order amounting to P27.453 billion to cover the full amount of the PHEBA arrears final computation. Accordingly, the Advice of SARO specifically provides that the allotment release therein shall cover the full funding requirements for the PHEBA of eligible healthcare and non-healthcare workers, based on the submitted report dated April 26, 2024, the joint statement read. This is the final and validated computation by the DOH based on submissions before a set deadline. Consistent with the discussions and agreements, any additional funding requirements for the same purpose, if any, shall be charged against the DOHs available budget, it added. They further said that the PHEBA requirements now amount to P110.30 billion as of December 12, 2024, instead of the earlier reported P103.5 billion.

BFP: Electrical appliances still the leading cause of fires,"MANILA, Philippines The Bureau of Fire Protection on Tuesday urged the public to use electrical appliances responsibly as these remain the leading cause of fires. Speaking at a public briefing, BFP spokesperson Senior Supt. Annalee Carbajal-Atienza said the public must be wary of using defective appliances as these may ignite a fire. READ: Public enjoined to observe fire prevention measures Electrical causes are the leading cause of fires, and this is related to our electricity use, especially now that the weather is hot. We should be responsible when using electric fansif they are old or slightly damaged, it is advisable to replace them with a new one, she said at the Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon briefing. Do not settle for temporary fixes or repairs, as it may cost us even more in the long run. Worst, it could put our familys lives at risk, she added. She also urged the public not to steal electricity through illegal connections known as jumpers. While we understand that some people struggle financially and resort to using jumpers, we hope they consider the dangers this may cause. At the same time, electrical companies must also ensure the safety and proper maintenance of our power lines through regular monitoring, Carbajal-Atienza said.

SC rules media accreditation guidelines must not infringe free speech,"MANILA, Philippines Freedoms of speech, expression and of the press should not be suppressed by guidelines and procedures for media accreditation, the Supreme Court said. The SCs reminder is contained in a decision dismissing as moot and academic the petition for prohibition with prayer for the issuance of temporary restraining order filed by the Customs Tri-Media Association Inc., and several journalists covering the Bureau of Customs . READ: Tri-comm probe on fake news online not meant to gag free speech Barbers In recognition of all these, this Court has not wavered in its duty to uphold these cherished freedoms by striking down laws or regulations, which while guise as promoting a legitimate government interest, are in reality nothing but naked means to suppress the exercise of free speech, expression, and of the press, the SC said through Associate Justice Jhosep Lopez. It added that any limitation on the exercise of free speech must be justified on legitimate grounds that are clear and indubitable and with means that are narrowly tailored and only specifically calibrated to achieve those purposes. Thus, no matter how laudable the objective of respondent in weeding out illegitimate media personalities, the means used to achieve such an objective must not unnecessarily sweep on the rights of legitimate media personalities. The furtherance of a substantial governmental interest must not amount to an infringement of the freedom of expression. Otherwise, any rule or regulation that encroaches on this area of protected speech will be stricken down, the SC said. The petition assailed Custom Memorandum Order No. 37-2011 issued by then Bureau of Customs Commissioner RozzAno Rufino Biazon requiring media practitioners to submit accreditation requirements to the Office of the Public Information and Assistance Division of the BOC who would screen and issue the identification card. Columnists can enter the BOC premises as long as they can present clear documentation that they were on assignment from a specific news organization or publication. The memorandum also provides, among others, that: the editorial content of the publication must at all times be compliant with the Philippine Journalists Code of Ethics; the No I.D., No Entry shall be strictly enforced; and media interview with the BOC officials and employees must be pre-arranged with the PIAD to avoid work disruption. Petitioners argued that the BOC converted into law the Philippine Journalists Code of Ethics, which is only a private undertaking agreed upon by journalists. They added that requiring members of the press to prearrange the conduct of interviews and to obtain visitation passes before they could enter the BOC, would enable the BOC to receive advance information as to who will be interviewed, allowing its errant employees to avoid the discovery of illicit activities. The case is already moot and academic after the BOC repealed the questioned memorandum. With the repeal of Custom Memorandum Order No. 37-2011, the SC said there is nothing left for this Court to declare as unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Senior Associate Justice Marvic Leonen dissented with the majority of the justices as he insistedthat the Court should have ruled on the merit of the petition despite the repeal of Customs Memorandum Order No. 37-201 to guide the Bench and the Bar, and to avoid its repetition in the near future. Leonen said a memorandum can be considered as a form of prior restraint as it infringes on the right of members of the media to free speech and free press.

Poe urges help to find those who shot dog with arrows in Negros Occ.,"MANILA, Philippines The search is on for all individuals who harmed a dog named Tiktok, a stray aspin who shot with Indian arrows in Negros Occidental. This, after Sen. Grace Poe enjoined dwellers in the area to help the local government unit and animal welfare groups in finding the individuals who harmed the dog. Those found liable deserve to be punished under the law, said Poe in a statement on Wednesday. Such cruelty to an innocent creature has no place in our civilized society.

Marcos tirades vs Duterte admin way of showing hes not weak Palace,"MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s tirades against the Duterte administration during campaign rallies are just his way of showing that he is not and will never be a weak leader, the Palace said on Thursday.

In all the campaign rallies attended by the President, his candidates state their proposed programs and projects for the progress of the nation and the well-being of the people, she said in Filipino.

Lacson suggests running buses in opposite direction on Edsa Busway,"MANILA, Philippines To curb the misuse of the Edsa Busway, former Senator Panfilo Ping Lacson on Friday suggested having buses travel in the opposite direction of their usual route. This recommendation came after recent reports of violators, including a convoy of the Philippine National Police , in the exclusive bus lane. EDSA BUSWAY: To prevent unauthorized vehicles from using the busway, MMDA [Metropolitan Manila Development Authority] may consider studying the infrastructure reconfiguration to reverse the direction of buses passing through the bus lanes and make the problem solve itself, Lacson said in a post on X.

House offices assigned to help impeachment prosecutors Velasco,"MANILA, Philippines After the Senate, it is now the House of Representatives turn to prepare for the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte. Different offices in the Batasang Pambansa have been tasked to provide technical and administrative support to the prosecution panel. In a statement on Friday morning, House Secretary General Reginald Velasco confirmed that he has released Memorandum order No. 19-1006, which directs the following offices to perform these duties: Among the functions of the units would be to provide plenary support, legal research, records management, stenographic transcription, information technology, security and administrative coordination. The House Secretariat plays a vital role in ensuring the orderly conduct of legislative proceedings, including impeachment trials, Velasco said. This directive ensures that the prosecution team has access to essential logistical, research and documentation support to facilitate a smooth and efficient trial process, he noted. According to the memorandum, personnel from these offices are required to report to the Senate full-time during the impeachment trial, while attendance would be monitored through the HousePass system. Velasco noted that the assigned personnel will adhere to strict House rules and ethical guidelines, ensuring transparency and professionalism throughout the process. This is a routine function aligned with our constitutional duty. The House Secretariat remains neutral and professional in fulfilling its mandate, he said. As the impeachment process moves forward, the Impeachment Secretariat will continue to provide the necessary support to uphold the integrity of the proceedings, he added. The formation of the House secretariat comes after Senate President Francis Escudero last Wednesday outlined the duty of different Senate offices and officials once the impeachment trial starts. READ: Escudero readies administrative support to Senate for VPs impeachment Prosecutor and Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Raul Angelo Bongalo said Escuderos decision may be a signal that the Senate is now tackling the matter with a sense of urgency. However, Bongalon still hopes that trial starts sooner than Escuderos prediction that the trial would start by July 2025 and end by October 2025. READ: Senate can wrap up Sara Duterte impeachment trial in 3 months Escudero Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The case was hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a vice president. The Articles of Impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate. The 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-thirds of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, trial has yet to start as the Articles of Impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5. This means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. There are also conflicting opinions regarding whether it is proper for the current Senate to start the trial when the 2025 midterms elections would surely change the composition in the legislative chamber. Former Senator Ping Lacson believes though there is no issue if the impeachment trial starts within the 19th Congress and crosses over to the 20th Congress.

Starting VP Duterte impeachment trial in July is too late solons,"MANILA, Philippines Lawmakers have admitted that they are already sounding like a broken record when it comes to insisting that Vice President Sara Dutertes impeachment trial should start forthwith as the Constitution states. In an online briefing on Tuesday, Assistant Majority Leaders Tingog party-list Rep. Jude Acidre and Taguig City 2nd District Rep. Amparo Maria Zamora said that while they respect the Senates impeachment trial timetable, starting the trial by late June or July would be too late and would run contrary to the 1987 Constitutions definition 0f forthwith. Three months is too long for us to say that we can start the trial there. We can do it after the elections and we do not have to follow the legislative calendar which will end, and if we start it after the elections, then we can move on and we do not have to wait until June or July, Acidre said in Filipino. We have been repeatedly saying this but honestly, nothing has happened. We seem to sound like a broken record but that is what is right. We hope our senators would listen to us because we would not get tired of giving our reminders as in the end, history will be the better judge of us, he added. Zamora saidshe does not understand why senators insist on delaying the hearings when legal minds and even the Constitutions framers have agreed on the interpretation of forthwith. Under the 1987 Constitution, an impeachment trial should start forthwith if at least one-third of all House of Representatives members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. On February 5, 215 lawmakers signed and endorsed the fourth impeachment complaint against Duterte. There are many legal luminaries who have said that we do not need to follow the legislative calendar of the Senate or of Congress for that matter just so the impeachment proceedings can start, from [retired Supreme Court Associate] Justice [Antonio] Carpio, different justices, other legal luminaries, have spoken, Zamora said in Filipino. However, we would still follow what the Senate would do, so again, as what Cong. Jude said, we sound like broken records already but we have no choice but to adhere to their will, what they want to happen will be followed, she added. Acidre said despite their call, they still respect the Senate, as the legislative chamber would be in charge of the impeachment proceedings. Its hard for us to comment as to how the Senate would do their jobs because, with all due respect to parliamentary courtesy, inter-chamber courtesy, the Senate will have to be responsible for their own actions especially if the question is about whether they should do their mandate immediately, he said.

Abante tells House: Pass bill banning Pogos or risk games return,"MANILA, Philippines The House of Representatives must approve a bill disallowing Philippine offshore gaming operators , as the lack of a law institutionalizing the Presidents ban might risk the return of these games in the future, Manila 6th District Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr. said. In a statement on Thursday, Abante said that failing to approve a law that will ban Pogos means the door remains open for these games, and the illegal activities that have been associated with some of the operators. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. during his third State of the Nation Address last July 22 ordered a ban on all Pogos, saying that these games must stop before 2024 ends. The House leadership backed this, with key lawmakers filing House Bill No. 10987 a consolidation of five bills seeking to ban Pogos. The proposed measure however was not approved on third reading before the session adjourned last February 5. READ: House approves Pogo ban bill on 2nd reading The President made the right decision in declaring a ban on Pogos, but we must ensure that this policy cannot be easily reversed by future administrations, Abante, a longtime anti-gambling advocate, said. Without a law in place, there is always a risk that these Pogos will be allowed back in, bringing with them the same lawlessness, corruption, and crime that we have already seen, he added. READ: Marcos: All Pogos are banned! Abante, chairperson of the House committee on human rights and one of the principal authors of HB No. 10987 said that the latest reports of kidnappings linked to the Pogo industry is another proof that many of the games are linked to illegal activities and criminal syndicates. The latest kidnapping case is just another example of how Pogos go hand in hand with organized crime in our country. From human trafficking to financial fraud, prostitution rings to drug-related offensesthis industry has done nothing but harm our people, he said. The lawmaker was referring to the incident where the father of a 14-year old Chinese national who was abducted, was eventually revealed to have ties to Pogos. Initially, one of the members of the family used to be involved in the Pogo business. They may have been talking about payment for the outstanding debt. Thats the lead that the AKG is pursuing, PNP public information chief Col. Randulf Tuao said in a briefing in Camp Crame on Wednesday.

AFP: Allowance hike for troops approved contrary to social media claims,"MANILA, Philippines The Armed Forces of the Philippines refuted a social media post claiming the daily subsistence allowance increase for its personnel was disapproved, calling it false and baseless information. According to screen grabs shared by the AFP, the social media post alleged that current fiscal constraints and budgetary considerations hindered the increase. The military blurred the name of the person who posted it in its screen grabs. Contrary to these misleading reports, the PHP 350 daily subsistence allowance increase has been successfully incorporated into the approved 2025 General Appropriations Act, the AFP said on its Facebook page. This allocation demonstrates the governments unwavering commitment to improving the welfare and support of our dedicated soldiers, it added.

Louie Dema-ala said on Tuesday. Dema-ala said Antonio Oreo Cerbito and Ariel Oreo, were arrested on Feb. 25 in a joint operation in Barangay Mapalad in Arayat town.

Sen. Bong Go rises to second spot in latest SWS survey,"MANILA, Philippines Senator Christopher Bong Go has climbed further to second place in the latest Social Weather Stations survey on voter preferences for the 2025 senatorial elections, securing 38% support in the February 15-19 poll. This marks a steady rise from his ranking in January, where he placed between third and fourth with 37%, and in December 2024, when he held the same bracket with 32%. Expressing gratitude for the publics trust, Go reaffirmed his commitment to service. Taus-puso ang aking pasasalamat sa patuloy na suporta at tiwala ninyo sa aking pagseserbisyo, he said. Gos strong showing extends across multiple surveys. In Pulse Asias January 18-25 poll, he ranked 2nd to 3rd with 50.4% voter backing. Meanwhile, in the SWS survey conducted around the same period, he placed 3rd to 4th. The OCTA Research Tugon ng Masa poll from January 25-31 saw him secure 58% voter preference, ranking within the statistical top three. With a potential second term on the horizon, Go vowed to double down on his advocacy for the marginalized. Kung papalarin at mabibigyan ako ng bagong pagkakataong maglingkod sa bayan at maging representante ninyo sa Senado, lalo kong sisipagan ang pagseserbisyo sa kapwa ko Pilipino sa abot ng aking makakaya, he said. Gos legislative track record has reinforced his reputation as a public servant dedicated to improving essential services, particularly in health and social welfare. Sipag, malasakit at more serbisyo ang maiaalay ko sa inyo dahil bisyo ko ang magserbisyo at naniniwala ako na ang serbisyo sa tao ay serbisyo sa Diyos, he added. As chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, he continues to advocate for better healthcare access, particularly for indigent and underserved communities. He is the principal author and sponsor of Republic Act No. 11463, or the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019, which institutionalized Malasakit Centers nationwide. These one-stop shops streamline access to medical assistance programs, especially for indigent patients. Currently, 167 Malasakit Centers operate across the country, benefiting over 17 million Filipinos, according to data from the Department of Health. Go also championed the establishment of more Super Health Centers nationwide to decongest hospitals by offering primary healthcare, consultations, and early detection services at the community level. More than 700 Super Health Centers have been funded through collaborative efforts involving Go as Vice Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, the DOH, local government units, and fellow lawmakers. Additionally, he is one of the principal authors of RA 11959, or the Regional Specialty Centers Act, which aims to decentralize specialized healthcare by establishing specialty centers in every DOH-run regional hospital. Recently, Go has pushed for PhilHealth reforms, advocating for a significant increase in benefit packages for the ten leading mortality diseases, a 50% across-the-board increase in case rates, and the expansion of benefit coverage to include dental, preventive, emergency, outpatient drug, mental health, and optometric services. He also called for the removal of policies deemed anti-poor, such as the 24-hour confinement rule and the single-period-of-confinement policy. Go has also been vocal about creating a Center for Disease Control and Prevention and establishing a Virology Science and Technology Institute to strengthen the countrys pandemic preparedness. He continues to champion the welfare of healthcare workers. On education, he acknowledges the impact of the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, signed during the Duterte administration, but seeks to expand the coverage of the Tertiary Education Subsidy to assist more students. Edukasyon ang susi sa mas magandang kinabukasan para sa ating kabataan na pag-asa at future leaders ng ating bayan, he said. As chairperson of the Senate Committee on Youth, Go actively pushes for policies that empower the younger generation, foster their participation in nation-building, and equip them to be productive citizens. He co-authored and co-sponsored several key education laws, including RA 12077, or the Student Loan Payment Moratorium During Disasters and Emergencies Act; RA 11510, which institutionalizes the Alternative Learning System to improve education access for underserved communities; RA 11984, or the No Permit, No Exam Prohibition Act, which prevents schools from barring students from taking exams due to unpaid fees; RA 12006, or the Free College Entrance Examinations Act, which waives entrance exam fees for top-performing students in private higher educational institutions; RA 11997, or the Kabalikat sa Pagtuturo Act, which increases teaching supply allowances for public school teachers; and RA 12080, or the Basic Education Mental Health and Well-Being Promotion Act, which seeks to address the growing mental health crisis among students. As chairperson of the Senate Committee on Sports since 2019, Go has played a key role in shaping Philippine sports development. His tenure saw the countrys historic first Olympic gold medal wins, the successful hosting of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, and consistently strong performances by Filipino athletes in international competitions. He also authored and co-sponsored RA 11470, which established the National Academy of Sports in New Clark City, Capas, and Tarlac. Go continues to advocate for increased funding for sports programs to enhance athlete training, preparation, and international competitiveness. He also supports grassroots sports development to nurture young talents. As I always remind our youth, get into sports [and] stay away from illegal drugs to keep us healthy and fit! he said.

Max suggested retail price of imported rice down to P49 starting March,"MANILA, Philippines The maximum suggested retail price for imported rice will drop to P49 per kilo starting March 1, the Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday. In a statement, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said this is the first time since the MSRP was introduced six weeks ago, that it will fall below the P50 mark. The new pricing will be implemented selectively in Metro Manila, key cities, and other urban centers using a more surgical approach, Tiu Laurel added. In many provincial areas, weve seen prices of imported rice already lower than the MSRP. So we will apply it more selectively, he explained. Tiu Laurel noted that the MSRP was initially set at P58 per kilo when it was launched on January 20. This was a non-coercive measure aimed at steering retail prices of imported rice to reflect the steady decline in world market prices and the decision of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to slash rice tariffs from 35 percent to 15 percent, effective last July, the DA secretary pointed out. READ: Revised rice tariff law triples farmers support fund to P30B Given this development, Tiu Laurel also hinted at the possibility of further price reductions. We will review the numbers in the coming days to determine if theres room to lower the MSRP further. As of now, there could be scope for additional reductions, but well have to see, he said.

4 cars fall into river as newly retrofitted bridge in Isabela collapses,"ILAGAN CITY, Isabela, Philippines A portion of the newly retrofitted Cabagan-Santa Maria Bridge in Isabela province collapsed on Thursday night , authorities said. Four cars were initially reported damaged after falling into the Cagayan River due to the bridges collapse. Injuries were reported, but data is still being gathered. No fatalities were immediately recorded. The responsibility of the Department of Public Works and Highways and the contractor is still being assessed, and neither party has issued any statement. During calamities, especially when the nearby old bridge is submerged due to overflowing rivers, the other bridge would be open only for tricycles and light vehicles. The structure has yet to be formally declared safe for public use. The 720-lineal-meter bridge was first funded with a budget of P640 million. It was supposed to be completed in 2019, after more than five years of construction. However, an alleged defect in its foundation led to the release of an additional P200 million for retrofitting, which was just completed this year.

Fair weekend weather seen in most of PH Pagasa,"MANILA, Philippines Fair weather is seen in most parts of the country nationwide over the weekend, the state weather bureau said on Friday. Lets expect this coming weekend generally fair weather in most parts of our country, said Obet Badrina, a specialist of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration during a public weather forecast. Badrina also predicts that warm weather is likely in huge parts of southern Luzon, the entire Visayas, and most parts of Mindanao. The warm weather comes as the northeast monsoon, or amihan, continues to weaken, only affecting parts of Northern Luzon. Nevertheless, rains are likely in parts of Visayas and Mindanao. Cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms are expected in the entire Mindanao along with Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, and Southern Leyte due to the easterlies or the warm winds coming from the Pacific Ocean. On the other hand, partly cloudy to cloudy skies with only isolated light rains are seen in Cagayan Valley, Ilocos Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, and Central Luzon due to amihan. Easterlies will also prevail in Metro Manila and the rest of the country, along with partly cloudy to cloudy skies only with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms.

"Rushing to impeach VP Duterte? Study, do better Escudero","MANILA, Philippines Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero has offered a bit of unsolicited advice for those who are eager to rush the impeachment case against Vice President Sara Duterte: Study and do better. Several sectors, including the House prosecutors, have been prodding the Senate leadership to convene the chamber as an impeachment court and try the case against Duterte even during the Congress break. Sa mga nagmamadali, ang payo ko na lang siguroy mag-aral na lang muna sila siguro at galingan dahil pagka nagsimula ito, baka mamaya, dun sila hihingi ng oras at kung anu-anong arte, Escudero said in a Radyo 630 interview on Friday. Sa haba ng panahon, wala na silang dahilan na hindi maging handa pag nagsimula ang paglilitis, he added. Escudero is proposing to start the impeachment trial on July 30, 2025 , with the new set of senators sitting as judges. The House of Representatives impeached Duterte on February 5 and immediately transmitted the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate for trial. But Escudero noted that the transmittal to the Senate was made just two hours before the Senate ended its session. He has repeatedly explained that the Senate can only convene as an impeachment court when Congress is in session. Other lawmakers, however, argued the Senate could still convene as an impeachment court even during the break, as the Constitution specifically states that the trial shall forthwith proceed. Senate Minority Aquilino Koko Pimentel even raised the possibility of the upper chamber convening as an impeachment court on its own, without requesting a special session from President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos. Escudero disagreed with Pimentel. The court needs to convene in an open session, the Senate leader stressed during last weeks press conference in Quezon City.

The petition said the House of Representatives circumvented the one-year bar by ordering its Secretary-General to allegedly give them more time to file the Fourth Impeachment Complaint, despite the fact that three prior separate impeachment complaints had been filed on December 2, 2024, December 4, 2024, and December 19, 2024, respectively. the 36-page petition said. By directing the respondent House Secretary-General to freeze the first three impeachment complaints to make way for the fourth impeachment complaint, which was filed a month or two after, the House of Representatives committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of excess of jurisdiction by circumventing and violating the One- Year Bar set by no less than the 1987 Constitution, it added. The fourth impeachment complaint was transmitted to the Senate after 215 members of the House endorsed it, while the three other impeachment complaints filed earlier had not been transmitted to the Office of the Speaker or taken up by a House committee and were later archived. Dutertes petition is separate from the petition filed by a group of Davao City-based lawyers led by Israelito Torreon and former Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board chairperson Martin Delgra III. The Court is still studying whether these cases should be consolidated. But as of now, no action, Ting said. That is okay. It turned out that VP Sara filed her own petition a day ahead of our petition, hence, it is but natural that her petition would be first acted by the SC than our petition, said Torreon.

Remembering Padre Rudy Romano on 39th EDSA anniversary,"MANILA, Philippines This year marks the 39th anniversary of the Edsa People Power Revolutionbut for the Redemptorist brothers, it also marks 39 years since the abduction and disappearance of their comrade, Padre Rudy Romano. For nearly four decades, the memory of Padre Rudy Romano, a Redemptorist priest from Cebu, has remained a powerful symbol of resistance against the regime of then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. His story is one of courage, faith, and an unwavering commitment to human rightsa story that continues to resonate amid todays debates about the legacy of the EDSA People Power Revolution. Si Padre Rudy Romano ay isa sa mga pari ng mga Redemptorist sa Cebu, and hes one of the organizers [of community and religious activities] doon sa Cebu, Brother Zebaztian Ranches of the Redemptorist Seminary told INQUIRER.net on Tuesday. Noon po ay papunta po siya ng misa, tapos bigla po siyang dinukot at bigla po siyang nawala. At hindi na po siya nakita noong panahon po ng diktadurya, he narrated. Several records and archives say Romano disappeared on July 11, 1985. Romano served as the chairperson of the Visayas Ecumenical Movement for Justice and Peace, tirelessly advocating for social justice during the Martial Law era, according to Ranches. His work often placed him in danger, as he championed the rights of the poor and marginalized under a regime known for its human rights abuses, Ranches added. Sila po yung nag-work for social justice and peace from that time po ng Martial Law or mga diktadurya, Ranches shared. The 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution, which ousted the Marcos regime, was seen as a victory for democracy and justicevalues that Romano fought for. Ranches, however, expressed concern over the current administrations treatment of Edsas legacy, particularly its designation as a special working holidaya move critics say diminishes its significance. Parang tinatanggal nila sa isip natin na may Edsa People Power, Ranches said. Iniiba yung parang parang tinatanggal sa isip natin iniinstill sa kaisipan natin na walang nangyaring People Power noong February 25, he underscored. Despite this, the Redemptorist congregation remains steadfast in continuing Romanos mission. Ranches said their efforts include engaging with impoverished communities and amplifying the voices of those they encounter in mission areas like San Roque, Quezon City. Nag-rarally na po talaga kami. Isa ito sa mga steps namin bilang mga misyonero, na pupunta sa mga mahihirap na lugar isigaw yung mga panawagan ng mga nakakasalamuha naming tao sa mission area na pinupuntahan, he said. For Ranches, the tactics to discredit Edsa and rewrite history are ultimately ineffective. He pointed to the presence of students and citizens who continue to commemorate the revolution and defend its ideals. Kita po naman natin na marami pa ring tao, marami pa ring estudyanteng lumalaban, he said. Pati nga po ang PUP na hindi na nag-announce na walang klase ay nandito. Kaya hindi po effective yung mga tactics nila dahil nandito pa rin ang tao ang lumalaban sa Edsa, the Redemptorist brother added. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Senate can wrap up Sara Duterte impeachment trial in 3 months Escudero,"MANILA, Philippines The impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte is not expected to take more than three months, Senate President Francis Escudero said on Tuesday, adding that the verdict on the articles of impeachment filed against the countrys second top official is more likely to be announced by October 2025. In a press conference in Sorsogon, Escudero said this would be the case if the proper impeachment trial would begin in July or after the 20th Congress begins. According to Escudero, all cross-examinations of evidence and other legislative matters will be done during the pre-impeachment proceedings so the time for the actual trial will no longer be wasted. Dahil dyan sa tingin ko hindi sosobra sa tatlong buwan o dalawang buwan ang trial so by the time na mag-recess kami sa October 2025, tapos na ito at mapagbobotohan na, said Escudero in Sorsogeo. In the same interview, Escudero emphasized the need for the impeachment to be tackled in an open session. Hence, it would not be legally possible to do so at present time since Congress is on break. According to the Senate chief, once the session resumes in June, the Senate will convene as an impeachment court and approve the impeachment rules.

As the doctors addressed the media and declared that he is not out of danger, we continue to pray for the well-being of Pope Francis, Du said. Our continued prayers and Masses offered for his health and well-being are our powerful way of showing our love for the Holy Father, he added.

In the Archdiocese of Palo, we remember how Pope Francis brought a profound sense of hope and solidarity to our communities affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan, Du said. His presence as the vicar of Christ served as a powerful symbol of Gods mercy and compassion, reminding us that we are not alone in our collective efforts of healing and rebuilding, he added. During his visit, the Pope presided over a Mass in Tacloban attended by more than 200,000 people despite a typhoon hitting the province. He also visited the Palo Cathedral and met with families affected by Yolanda. The Archdiocese of Palo also debunked rumors circulating on social media that the Pope had died. Fr. Chris Arthur Militante, the archdioceses information officer, dismissed the claims as fake news and urged the public to refer only to official sources such as the Vatican News for updates on the Popes condition. According to the Vatican, Pope Francis, 88, is being treated for double pneumonia and early kidney failure, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy. Despite his serious health issues, he has remained alert and communicative, attending Mass and expressing gratitude for the global outpouring of prayers and support.

"Mark Villar continues fight vs scammers, pushes for Scam Prevention Center","In response to the rising number of online scams and financial fraud cases, Senator Mark Villar has filed Senate Bill No. 2924, also known as the Philippine Scam Prevention Center Act, to establish a dedicated government agency for the enforcement and implementation of laws related to online or digital fraud and financial-scamming related complaints. The proposed measure seeks to create the Philippine Scam Prevention Center under the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center . The PSPC, which shall serve as a one-stop-shop for financial scam-related offenses, will be composed of agencies comprising the CICC with the Department of Trade and Industry , Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas , National Telecommunications Commission , National Privacy Commission , financial institutions, telecommunication companies, online marketplaces, financial technology companies, and operators of online or payment systems, among others. With the increasing reliance on digital platforms, criminals have become more sophisticated in deceiving the public. This bill aims to strengthen our response by creating a dedicated center that will ensure timely action against scammers and protect Filipinos from financial losses, which in turn negatively affects critical industries, Senator Villar said. The PSPC will primarily function as the central office that will lead enforcement efforts against digital fraud and online financial scams. The bill also proposes the establishment of regional and local centers to ensure accessibility and rapid response to cases across the country. The center will assist victims in filing cases against individuals or entities violating the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act , or the AFASA, and the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 . Villar highlighted the importance of the measure, being the principal sponsor and author of AFASA and the Internet Transactions Act, which are both targeted to the fortification of the countrys financial cyberspace. I have continuously worked towards enacting legislation that will arm up our cyberspace and stimulate the countrys digital economy. He further emphasized the urgency of the measure, noting the growing number of Filipinos falling victim to online scams. This legislation is about ensuring that our laws keep pace with the evolving nature of cybercrimes. Through the PSPC, we can provide a stronger safety net for Filipinos who are now very much involved in cyberspace. The bill is now up for deliberation in the Senate, and Senator Villar urges stakeholders and the public to support its passage to enhance the countrys fight against online fraud.

"Akap not perfect, but needed by people lawmakers","MANILA, Philippines Lawmakers believe that while the controversial Ayuda Para sa Kapos ang Kita Program has room for improvement, it is an important government program as it not only helps people cope with high prices but also stimulates the economy. Lanao del Sur Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong, in a press briefing on Monday, explained that there may be adjustments that have to be made to the Akap, but handing financial aid directly to the people strengthens their purchasing power and, in effect, helps businesses earn more. This aid has been done for a long time by the government; were just trying to improve that. Were not saying that the Akap is perfect; there will always [be] room for adjustment. Thats why we are really trying to really improve the services to the people so that they can feel that the government is working for them, Adiong told reporters at the Batasang Pambansa complex. What they are saying about the ayuda being necessary is because it goes directly to the pocket of the people, and then it will strengthen the purchasing power of these individuals, these people, as part [of] the consumer, that in effect it will contribute positively to the local economy, which in effect is good, he added. Adiong and other lawmakers were asked about the Akap, in relation to a survey from polling firm Octa Research, which showed that 69 percent of respondentsor seven out of 10want the program to extend while 31 percent are against it. READ: Most Filipinos want Akap to expand, continue Octa According to Manila Rep. Ernesto Dionisio Jr., those against these poverty-alleviating programs would not go away, especially if they have vested interests. People who oppose it would not stop, especially if they have [a] vested interest. But what is important is, just like what we have said several times, that the government aid has been present, not only during this administration. It has always been there, Dionisio said. READ: Workers earning no more than P23,000 monthly to get P5,000 aid House Its a way to directly help the people who need itas long as the funds [quickly reach the] appropriate target, we should just allow the government to help the people, he added. Adiong meanwhile said that since the number of people who agree with the Akap is high, it is an affirmation of the programs effectiveness. Actually, were making true to our promise; this administration said it will bring government services closer to the people. That number according to the survey, 7 out of 10, thats high already, he said. Apart from the desire to support the people, this survey also speaks about the programs effectiveness. Because this means the people directly get the aid, the system of releasing it is effective.) Akap was first introduced in December 2023, when lawmakers were crafting the budget for 2024. In an ambush interview on the sidelines of the bicameral conference committee hearing last December 13, 2023, former House appropriations committee chair and Ako Bicol party-list Rep. Elizaldy Co explained that the Akap will be the governments instrument in fighting inflation by equipping near-poor workers with means to buy goods. Controversy followed Akap when the Presidents sister, Senator Imee Marcos, claimed that the Senate was not aware of the provisions creating the program. House Senior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales then clarified that senators, including Marcos, actually signed the page containing the provisions for Akapwhich means that they have checked the page. Eventually, Deputy Majority Leader and ACT-CIS party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo admitted that the Akap was his brainchild, saying that he thought of the program when he was still DSWD secretary. Under the 2025 national budget signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. last Monday, P26 billion was allocated for Akap. According to the Department of Budget and Management, Akap will be placed under conditional implementation, which means that there will be guidelines issued before programs and projects are implemented. Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong, however, claimed that House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez was facilitating the release of the Akap funds and other government aid programs. However, Baguio City Rep. Mark Go disputed Magalongs accusations, saying that there is no truth to such claims. According to Go, the role of lawmakers in government aid programs is limited, as they only facilitate these programs and projects that are implemented by the executive.

In a statement, Ortega criticized the stream of complaints being filed against House leaders who supported Dutertes impeachment, describing them as attempts to intimidate, harass, and create media distractions.

We see this for what it isan attempt to intimidate the House, divert attention from the issues, and create noise to mislead the public, he said.

BOC Chief Rubio vows heads will roll over attempted resale of seized cigarettes,"MANILA Bureau of Customs Commissioner Bienvenido Y. Rubio is assuring that heads will roll if reports are confirmed that some of the agencys personnel were involved in the discovery of attempted resale of P270 million worth of seized contraband cigarettes from Capas, Tarlac. The National Bureau of Investigation reported that they are currently investigating the possible involvement of some personnel of the BOC on this case. I already instructed the Intelligence Groups Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service to look into this matter and report to me immediately. The NBI has our full cooperation and I promise that anyone found involved in this will be held accountable. Heads will roll, Rubio said. We are one with the NBI and thank them in the fight against cigarette smuggling. We have made significant progress in this regard, seizing P5.1 billion worth of e-cigarettes/vapes and P4.1 billion worth of tobacco and cigarettes, for a total of almost P9.3 billion last year, he added. Port of Subic Acting District Collector Marlon Fritz Broto said that upon receiving the report, the Office of the District Collector immediately directed the Acting Chief of the Auction and Cargo Disposal Unit to form a team and coordinate with the NBI, and the local government unit to provide clarityregarding the seized cigarettes. These shipments arrived at the Port of Subic in four intervals between July 2021 and June 2022. They were abandoned and immediately seized and referred for disposal in 2023. Once the bond was settled, the process began and the condemnation started last January 6 and again on February 9 when the last three containers were transported to the said facility, he said. The acting district collector and lawyer cited the results of their investigation that showed the buy-bust operations by the NBI occurred during a shift change for ACDU, ESS, and CIIS Port of Subic Customs personnel guarding the condemnation process. He also noted that the condemnation of the containers occurred within the regulatory period. Of the five containers, which were all later found to be smuggled, four were originally consigned to Hongcim International Corp. and one was consigned to Proline Logistics Philippines Inc. The BOC confirmed Hazchem North as the waste disposal company contracted to dispose the cigarettes. This is the same company whose owner the NBI said allegedly ordered his environmental consultant to find a buyer for the goods. Our coordination with the NBI has always been one of the reasons our operations have been successful. If the investigation targets someone from our team, thats all the more reason we should work together with the NBI to get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable, Commissioner Rubio said.

Poe backs suspension of full cashless payment system on expressways,"MANILA, Philippines Sen. Grace Poe backed the move of Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon to suspend the implementation of the Toll Regulatory Boards full cashless payment system on expressways. The no-cash scheme is ideal, but it cannot be imposed until operators can guarantee that all defects in the system are fixed, such as malfunctioning booms, unreadable stickers and broken RFIDs . There should also be an option for motorists to pay in cash for unforeseen circumstances, Poe said in a statement on Sunday. The new DOTr secretary is heading in the right direction when he suspended the roll out of the full cashless payment on expressways, said Poe, who once headed the Senate committee on public services. READ: Prove RFID devices reliability before fining drivers Poe The TRB previously said it will require that all vehicles passing through expressways be equipped with RFIDs to pay toll fees in a cashless system beginning March 15.

Similarly, the Computer Literacy, Innovation, Connectivity and Knowledge party-list expressed support for Dizons move. In a statement on Friday, CLICK called the implementation of the RFID system premature, also citing technical issues like faulty barriers and unreliable top-up mechanisms. These systemic flaws have led to traffic congestion, unwarranted penalties, and frustrations among motorists, CLICK said. The decision of Secretary Dizon to prioritize system improvements before any mandatory implementation is a welcome move and a victory for Filipino motorists, the group said.

"Romualdez welcomes PhilHealths expanded emergency, critical care coverage","MANILA, Philippines House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez on Sunday welcomed the Philippine Health Insurance Corporations expansion of benefits, including new outpatient emergency care coverage and increased case rate packages for critical illnesses. Romualdez described the move as a crucial step toward making universal healthcare more accessible and affordable for Filipinos. Ito ang klase ng repormang diretsong nararamdaman ng tao. Mas maraming Pilipino na ngayon ang makakapagpagamot agad, hindi na kailangang maghintay ng matagal o matakot sa gastos bago magpunta sa ospital, Romualdez said. Under the newly introduced Facility-Based Emergency benefit within the Outpatient Emergency Care Benefit package , PhilHealth members can now receive emergency medical attention at accredited level 1 to 3 hospitals nationwide without requiring admission. This change addresses a long-standing issue where low-income patients were often forced to delay treatment due to limited coverage, Romualdez noted. The House Speaker also highlighted that PhilHealth raised case rate packages for nearly 9,000 medical conditions, providing increased financial assistance for treatments such as pneumonia, cancer therapies, heart surgeries, and maternal health services. Ang sakit, hindi dapat nagiging pabigat sa bulsa ng bawat Pilipino, Romualdez pointed out. Ngayon, mas malaki na ang sagot ng PhilHealth, at mas maraming buhay na ang maliligtas. Nonetheless, Romualdez still called for further reforms to enhance healthcare delivery, including faster claims processing, improved hospital accreditation, and greater public awareness of PhilHealths services.

Conclave: The secret process of selecting a new pope,"MANILA, PhilippinesWith Pope Francis still in critical condition, some may ask what happens when the Holy See becomes sede vacante after the resignation or death of a pope. Last Feb. 14, the 88-year-old Bishop of Rome was admitted to the Gemelli Hospital because of bronchitis that later developed into bilateral lung infection, which triggered the early stages of kidney failure. READ: LIVE UPDATES: Pope Francis health watch But while the Vatican stated on Monday, Feb. 24, that there was a slight improvement in the health of Pope Francis, doctors declined to decide on the prognosis because of the complexity of the clinical picture. READ: Vatican says Pope Francis is critical but stable So when a pope steps down or passes away, how would the Church select the next vicar of Christ, who is expected to lead 1.375 billion Catholics in over 3,000 dioceses all over the world? Like how Pope Francis was elected in 2013 after the resignation of his predecessor, the late Benedict XVI, the successor would be chosen in a conclave at the Sistine Chapel of St. Peters Basilica. As explained by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , when a pope resigns or passes away, the governance of the Church shifts to the College of Cardinals. RELATED STORY: Thousands gather outside the Vatican to pray for Pope Francis health Cardinals, or princes of the Church, who are recognizable in their distinctive red vestments, advise the pope and elect a new one when the Holy See becomes sede vacante. Most often, a conclave starts 15 to 20 days after the resignation or death of a pope, when the cardinals gather in St. Peters Basilica for a Mass to ask the Holy Spirit to lead them in electing a new bishop of Rome. Based on the Code of Canon Law, someone who is male and Catholic can be elected pope, but since 1379, all successors to the Chair of St. Peter have been selected from the cardinals. As of Tuesday, Feb. 25, the Church has 252 cardinals, with 138 of them eligible to vote in a conclave since only those below the age of 80 can take part in the selection of a pope. Back in 1975, Pope Paul VI directed that the number of cardinals who can elect a vicar of Christ, should not be more than 120, but this has been exceeded in the last three pontificates. The USCCB stated that for the conclave itself, the cardinals below the age of 80 who are called cardinal electors proceed to the Sistine Chapel and make a promise of absolute secrecy before they get locked inside. RELATED STORY: Priests appeal: Stop spreading fake news about Popes health They vote by secret ballot, proceeding one by one to Michaelangelos artwork of the Last Judgment, saying a prayer and dropping the twice-folded piece of paper in a chalice. The results of each ballot are counted aloud and recorded by three cardinals designated as scrutineers. When no one receives the required vote, the pieces of paper are placed on fire with a mixture of chemicals to produce black smoke. To be elected pope, two-thirds of the votes, or 92, are required. Out of the 138 cardinal electors, 110 were created by Pope Francis, while 23 and five were created by Pope Benedict XVI and Pope, now St. John Paul II, respectively. Only four rounds of balloting are taken every day till a candidate receives the required vote. Three of the 138 cardinal electors are Filipinos Luis Antonio Tagle of the Dicastery for Evangelization, Jose Advincula of the Archdiocese of Manila, and Pablo Virgilio David of the Diocese of Kalookan. When a cardinal receives the required two-thirds vote, the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, asks him if he accepts the election. Once accepted, he chooses a name and is dressed in vestments. The ballots of the final round are placed on fire with chemicals producing white smoke to signal to the world the election of a new pope. The new bishop of Rome then proceeds to the balcony of St. Peters Basilica. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Senate hit for stalling VP Sara Duterte impeachment trial,"MANILA, Philippines If theres a will, theres a way.This was the statement of Makabayan senatorial candidate Teddy Casio on Sunday as he criticized the Senate for delaying the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte. He urged lawmakers to fulfill their constitutional duty and uphold the integrity of the institution. Casio questioned the Senates reasons for stalling the proceedings, citing excuses such as the legislative break, the supposed lack of public clamor, and confusion over the term forthwith. It is a shame that the Senate is delaying the impeachment trial on such flimsy excuses, Casio said in a statement. Maybe they should just admit that they are too busy vacationing to be bothered by their official duties, he said. The Makabayan senatorial bet also argued that the delay undermines the governments system of checks and balances and diminishes the credibility of the Senate. Kung talagang gusto, maraming paraan. Pag ayaw, maraming dahilan, Casio said. Casio stressed that while Duterte benefits from the stalled trial, ordinary public servants with lesser offenses often face swift disciplinary actions. The Senates inaction translates to injustice and impunity, he said. The Senate owes it to the people to begin the impeachment trial at once, he emphasized. Most likely when the new Congress already enters into its functions after Sona. Sona, I think, is on July 21. So [the] trial will commence after that day, Escudero said.

Palace dismisses ex-Pres. Dutertes remark on Bongbong dictatorship,"MANILA, Philippines Former President Rodrigo Dutertes claim that President Ferdinand Bongbong R. Marcos Jr. is veering towards dictatorship like his father is a tale from a man prone to lying and inventing hoaxes, the Palace said on Sunday. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, was reacting to Dutertes pronouncement during a rally in Mandaue City, Cebu on Saturday. Bersamin described the former Presidents remarks as another budol emerging from a one-man fake-news factory. We treat the former Presidents baseless and ridiculous statements in the same way that Filipinos are dismissive of them: a tall tale from a man prone to lying and to inventing hoaxes, Bersamin said in a statement. As our actions have consistently demonstrated, we will stay the course in upholding the Constitution, in adhering to the rule of law, and in respecting the rights of the people, he added. He also stressed that the current administration will not backslide into the oppressive ways of the previous one when critics were jailed upon trumped-up charges and when kill orders were publicly issued with glee and obeyed blindly. It is the leader of that troubled past who is depicting us as veering toward a system where anyone can be deprived of life, liberty, and property without due process of law, as many had been on his mere say-so as a tyrant who did not respect the rights of the people, he added.

TOL hails Baguio Citys Panagbenga Festival,"MANILA, Philippines Senate Majority Leader Francis TOL Tolentino today hailed this years celebration of the Panagbenga Festival, which showcases the vibrant culture and flower industry of Baguio City. Baguio is a model for local governments nationwide because of its best practices in tourism, good governance, and entrepreneurship, said the senator. The recent passage by the Senate of important amendments to Baguios charter is aimed to enhance the citys capacity to build on its past successes and pursue a sustainable future, added Tolentino. The senator is referring to House Bill 7406, the Revised Charter of the City of Baguio, which has been approved by both the Senate and House of Representatives. Tolentino is a principal co-sponsor of the bill. Earlier this month, Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong personally visited the Senate to thank the senators, including Tolentino for shepherding the bills passage. By strengthening local governments, we also encourage peoples participation in democracy and nation-building. I can attest to that as a former local chief executive myself, said Tolentino, a former three-term mayor of Tagaytay City and former president of the League of Cities of the Philippines.

Legarda urges action to curb rising dengue cases in PH,"Senator Loren Legarda called on local government agencies to exercise best practices to help bring down dengue cases in the country. Legarda expressed alarm due to the unsettling increase in dengue cases this year. She is the author of the National Environmental Awareness Education and the author and principal sponsor of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act. We call on our citizens, local government units and landfill operators to take proactive measures in reducing mosquito populations by maintaining cleanliness in their areas and ensuring proper waste management and disposal, Legarda said. Poorly managed waste, especially during the rainy season, can collect water and become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, she pointed out. It is essential to eliminate stagnant water sources and properly dispose of trash to prevent disease outbreaks, she added. The legislator also called on the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to properly implement the Philippine Clean Water Act which designates water quality management areas, with local government units manning the board. This is another law she authored. Legarda emphasized that improper water handling can harm public health, leading to illnesses such as dengue. She also said the board should implement strategies and policies to improve and maintain its sewerage or septage program and ensure a clean water supply. Environmental education should be taught in a way that environmental concepts and principles, environmental laws, the state of international and local environment, as well as local environmental best practices should be followed, remarked Legarda. We must make citizens aware of their responsibility to protect and conserve the environment, as well as rehabilitating natural resources and make it sustainable. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak last February 15 after a steep rise in casesalmost 1,800 cases in 2025an almost 200% increase year-on-year.

PNP chief refuses to name convoy members who used Edsa bus lane,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine National Police chief, Gen. Rommel Marbil, refuses to say whether the convoy caught using the exclusive bus lane along Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue was his, as he aired concerns over the disclosure of its plate number. In an interview aired over AM radio station DZBB on Wednesday, he was asked if the convoy was his, and Marbil responded in a mix of Filipino and English: I will not say because the plate number was already revealed. I just told our police officers that if get caught there, we have to respect them [traffic officers]. Lets give them the ticket for the emergency. He made the statement after reports that the convoy carried PNP senior officers.

READ: New DOTr chiefseeks revamp, finds Edsa bus lane efficient Marbil stressed, however, the need for discretion during an emergency. Because its an emergency, you have to protect the people using the lane. As I said, if theyre using blinkers, its because theyre in a hurry. Marbil also urged traffic enforcers to exercise courtesy and protect the identities of those involved in such incidents. All Im saying is Talk to them with better courtesy. If they catch our people, you have to also protect the identity of the people, Marbil added. While the PNP does not condone the misuse of bus lanes, Marbil said protocols had been set for emergencies. Our police are prohibited from using a convoy on the bus lane. In case of emergency, just follow them [and] issue the ticket. Do not argue, and simply explain why it was used, he added. Marbil reiterated that the proper action in such cases is to issue a ticket and allow the police to explain the emergency situation. The PNP spokesperson, Brig. Gen. Jean Fajardo, also said in a message to reporters early Wednesday that the PNP could not divulge the identities of those in the convoy for security reasons.

Senate majority can ask for special session on VP impeachment Palace,"MANILA, Philippines The Senate majority not just the Senate president may proceed with sending a letter requesting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to order convening a special session for Vice President Sara Dutertes impeachment trial. Press officer Claire Castro made the pronouncement amid a deadlock between Marcos and Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero, who both insist that the directive to conduct a special session should come from the other. READ: Palace: Awkward for Marcos to call for session on Duterte impeachment Siguro kung majority ang gusto na umpisahan na ang impeachment trial, mas maganda sila ang makipag ugnayan sa Pangulo.

She made the statement in a Radyo 630 interview when asked about the same recommendation made by Manila Third District Rep. Joel Chua. Kasi kung majority naman ang nagnanais nang ituloy ito, hindi naman dapat na iisang tao lang ang magde-decide nitoang Senate president, she noted. Maaari silang humingi at mag request sa pangulo ng special session kung meron silang majority na matatatawag, she suggested. Asked who could initiate the letter to Marcos, Castrowho at this point separated herself as a lawyer from her government postsuggested that Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Koko Pimentel can do so. This is because it was also Pimentel who wrote a letter to Escudero to immediately act on the impeachment complaint filed against Duterte.

Panelo defends Dutertes statement on Marcos veering toward dictatorship,"MANILA, Philippines Ex-Presidential Chief Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo countered Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin for calling ex-President Rodrigo Duterte a one-man fake news factory, enumerating the reasons why the former chief executive accused President Marcos of veering toward dictatorship. Bersamins remark was made after Duterte accused Marcos of going the path of being a dictator like his father and namesake Ferdinand Marcos Sr. READ: Digong accuses Marcos of veering toward dictatorship According to Panelo, Bersamins words prove that he is singing a different tune now that he is a cabinet member of the present administration. Yet, when he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by former President Rodrigo Duterte, and upon his retirement from the judiciary, appointed to the juicy position of chairman of the Government Security Insurance System by [former president Duterte], he was singing hosannas and praises to [Dutertes] strict and equal enforcement of the laws to all citizens, high or low, said Panelo in a statement on Monday. Panelo likewise argued that Bersamin made the one-man fake news factory label without actually pointing to any false information. It is in fact the current dispensation that has become a huge corporation of fake news, said Panelo. To support his argument, Panelo proceeded to claim that the administration peddled the lie that the special police teams that assaulted the Kingdom of Jesus Christ during the serving of a warrant against Pastor Apollo Quiboloy were unarmed. Apart from this, he also claimed that there was an irregularity and illegality in passing the General Appropriations Bill for 2025. The administration has painted a rosy picture of the economy, trumpeting that we are better off today than the previous years, despite the fact of the continuing high prices of basic commodities that have pummeled the majority of masses of our people, who continue to suffer from poverty, unemployment, lack of education, inadequate health and hospital benefits and [the] absence of new infrastructure to propel this country to heights of development, he said. It bombards us with the false information that criminality and illegal drug trafficking have been contained when the opposite is the reality, he added. Panelo then emphasized that a dictator doesnt follow the Constitution and the rule of law. Violating and assaulting the constitutional rights of the citizens, including a religious group whose only fault is to be critical of government policies and to be expressive of their admiration and support for VP Sara and her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, is anathema [into] democracy, said Panelo.

"Marcos tells public: Cherish time with elderly, learn from their wisdom","MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Wednesday reminded the public to treat senior citizens with respect. He also urged everyone to cherish the time spent with them and to embrace the wisdom of older generations to build a brighter future. Marcos made the pronouncement during the ceremonial payout of cash gifts for qualified beneficiaries of the Expanded Centenarian Act in Malacaang. During his speech, Marcos noted that 73 percent of senior citizens rely on the support of their children, while 55 percent pay their healthcare expenses out of their own pockets, and many lack long-term care. Due to this situation, Marcos urged that elders, under his administration, should be treated with dignity, care, and respect. To the families of our elders, celebrate every moment you have with them, Marcos said in Filipino. Show concern because there will come a time when you too will seek respect and care from your children or grandchildren, he noted. For our youth, you will be the ones who will nurture the continuation of the knowledge taught by those who came before us. Use it to build a brighter future, he added. Marcos expressed hope that senior citizens would be given the chance to spend more time with their loved ones and experience more memorable moments with them. 14 senior citizens were present in the ceremony, three of whom were already 100 years old. Under Republic Act 11982, a P10,000 grant is given to seniors upon reaching 80, 85, 90, and 95 years old, while centenarians receive a gift of P100,000.

Marcos admin cant erase Edsa Revolts memory Aquinos grandson,"MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s administration is failing to make Filipinos forget the Edsa People Power Revolution, according to the grandson of democracy icon and late Senator Benigno Ninoy Aquino Jr. Kiko Aquino Dee, executive director of the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation, made the statement when asked if there was a danger of people forgetting the significance of the Edsa revolution, which toppledFerdinand Marcos Sr.s 20-year dictatorship on February 25, 1986. Since 2024, February 25 has ceased to be a special non-working holiday in the Philippines. READ: Feb 25 school holidays: Protesting distortion of history With this, Aquino Dee acknowledged the risk of historical distortion. I think the current administration is really I think thats what theyre trying to do. But at the same time, I think theyre failing by a significant degree, he told reporters on Monday during the reopening of the Aquino Center and Museum in Tarlac City. Because, if you recall last year, Edsa [People Power commemoration] was also made a non-holiday. It was a Sunday, but what happened? People used that as an opportunity, not just to recall Edsa, but also to protest the sort of secretive charter change that was trying to be pushed on us last year, he added. And then this year, its similar. The administration pushed a really bad budget for 2025. At the same time, [Vice President] Sara Duterte is evading accountability for all of her impeachable offenses, he pointed out. He also said the Edsa revolution remains a symbol for Filipinos to hold leaders accountable. So we want to use Edsa to call out our leaders and say that, Look, if you keep doing what you want, or if you keep doing things that only align with your self-interest, there is a consequence for that, he explained. READ: LIST: More schools suspend classes for Edsa People Power anniversary Aquino Dee also noted how many schools across the country canceled classes on February 25, demonstrating that the administrations efforts to discredit the Edsa revolution are not entirely effective. The schools see what the Marcos Jr. administration is trying to do. And its not terribly not really hidden. I mean, Marcos Jr. seems like he doesnt acknowledge or recognize that what his father did was wrong, he said. And to make that consistent or coherent, he needs to manipulate the story of Edsa. He needs that has to disappear somehow. So he will really attempt to distort what happened, he added. READ: Aquino Museum in Tarlac reopens ahead of 39th Edsa anniversary Aquino Dee also pointed out that the Chinese New Year in 2024 fell on a Saturday, but it was declared a holiday, unlike the Edsa revolutions anniversary which fell on a Sunday. Thats why it was not declared a holiday because they said it wasnt needed since it was the weekend. Never mind that the Chinese New Year weekend was still declared a holiday, he said. This year, the excuse is that its a working holiday. Whatever that means. Its the first of its kind. So its clear that theres an effort to set aside February 25. The karma being faced by Marcos is that his attempts to set it aside actually call more attention to it, he added.

Samar town implements measure to address post-harvest fish losses,"TACLOBAN CITY A municipality that is home to the longest coastline in Samar, covering 181.96 km, is ramping up efforts to combat post-harvest fish losses through a comprehensive five-year development plan amounting to P249.8 million. The initiative, backed by key stakeholders of the municipality of Daram, Samar, aims to reduce fish spoilage, improve storage facilities, and enhance fisherfolk livelihoods. Vice Mayor Lucia Astorga stressed the significance of addressing the high rate of post-harvest fish loss, which stands at 40.34 percent, according to a study conducted by the Center for Sustainable Aquaculture and Agri-based Innovations in 2024. Post-harvest fish loss refers to the measurable reduction in the quantity, quality, or monetary value of fish after they are caught and sold to consumers. Our seas have long been the lifeblood of our people yet many of our fisherfolk suffer due to inadequate preservation, lack of proper storage, and limited market access. By working together, we can reduce these losses, increase incomes, and ensure food security, Astorga said. Reducing post-harvest losses is not just about economics; its about securing the future of our coastal communities. Through sustainable solutions, we can uplift the lives of our fisherfolk and create a more resilient fishing industry, she added. A forum conducted last Feb. 13 tackled the issue and gathered representatives from Oceana, an international advocacy organization dedicated to ocean conservation; the Department of Agriculture-Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources , the Department of Trade and Industry, Samar State University, and fisherfolk leaders, among others. BFAR Regional Director Dominador Maputol affirmed the agencys commitment to supporting post-harvest infrastructure projects, including the construction of cold storage facilities, fish landing centers, and processing plants. We are integrating conservation efforts with livelihood programs to ensure a sustainable fishing industry in Samar, he said. Lawyer Gloria Estenzo Ramos, Oceana vice president, highlighted the role of sustainable fisheries governance and vessel monitoring systems in ensuring responsible fishing practices. Daram can serve as a model for science-based fisheries management. By enhancing fisherfolk training and strengthening policy frameworks, we can create long-term solutions, Ramos said. Oceana recommends the following policies to reduce post-harvest fish losses: establish robust fish catch monitoring and reporting systems; ensure accurate data on fish catch; train women and mobile peddlers in postharvest handling and processing to minimize quality loss; and limit catch volumes of species with high PHFL during peak fishing seasons to reduce physical and market force loss. The group also suggested establishing an organized marketing system to connect fishers and aqua farmers with buyers, enhancing market linkages in the fish distribution chain; and implementing area- and species-specific price regulating mechanisms to control fish prices and ensure fair profits for fishers and aqua farmers, among others. The municipalitys five-year Comprehensive PHFL reduction plan proposes the establishment of cold storage units, drying facilities, fish processing centers, and skills training programs to curb losses and maximize fish value. Stakeholders proposed solutions such as seasonal fishing quotas, expansion of market reach, and value-added fish processing to absorb the surplus supply. The Alliance of Local Governments along Samar Bays and Channels also pledged to collaborate on resolving the issue by improving market coordination and exploring inter-provincial trading partnerships.

Isko Moreno tells business owners: Manila will be clean and stable again,"MANILA We did it before, and we can do it again. This was the pledge of Manila mayoral candidate Francisco Isko Moreno Domagoso to the citys business owners he vowed to bring back cleanliness and stability to the nations capital. In a speech before the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Inc. , Domagoso promised to return the tax amnesty program and the efficiency in garbage collection. The mayoral candidate recalled that upon assuming office in 2019, he not only maintained tax rates but also implemented the longest tax amnesty in Manilas history. Now, Im here. Let me assure you for purposes of certainty, so that you can plan ahead of time with regard to your business in the City of Manila it will stay in the next five years in the City of Manila, Domagoso told FFCCCII members on Tuesday. The candidate explained that this six-month tax amnesty, which began on July 1, 2019, allowed businesses and residents to settle obligations without penalties. He also stressed that consistency in tax policies would encourage economic growth and provide a business-friendly environment in the capital. If you remember the moment I assumed office, I issued and asked the Sangguniang Panlungsod, come up with a law the longest tax amnesty in the history of Manila, he said. That was six months tax amnesty when I assumed July 1, 2019 at nangyari yung pinangako ko at naganap at hanggang ngayon. Hindi pa rin nababago ang tax code ng City of Manila, he noted. Domagosos remarks appear to have resonated with the FFCCCII members, who have long advocated for a stable and transparent business environment in Manila. He also heeded the call of Manila residents and business owners to commit to bringing back his successful cleanliness campaign. Keeping Manila clean was not just a promise but a commitment he had fulfilled during his term as mayor, he recalled. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Hontiveros warns of neglect if Senate delays Sara Duterte impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines It would be a grave neglect of duty should concurrent senators fail to dwell on the impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte before the chamber transition into 20th Congress. This was according to Deputy Minority Leader Sen. Risa Hontiveros who emphasized that theres no reason for the Senate leadership to delay the proceedings. It would be a bad precedent if we at the Senate let this pass not only the chance but also the responsibility to respond to an impeachment complaint seeking accountability for spending the peoples money, Hontiveros said in Filipino in the Kapihan sa Senado forum on Wednesday. Later in the forum, the opposition senator said failure to tackle such a complaint would mean that they have abandoned their duties. For me, it would be a great neglect of duty for us [senators] in the 19th Congress [if we fail] to do our job in this impeachment complaint. Its true that our time wont be wasted because we will be able to do the preliminaries, but we wont be able to enforce the rules because it will be the 20th Congress that will implement it, Hontiveros said. If we leave it to the 20th Congress, we senators in the 19th Congress would have reneged on our responsibility to do just that now, she added. But Senate President Francis Escudero already made clear that the proper impeachment trial against Duterte would commence after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had delivered his fourth State of the Nation Address in July. For Hontiveros, though, theres no longer a need for the chamber to wait months just for them to do their jobs. I hope theres no longer a need for additional cases just for us to do our responsibility in a more timely action. There are still four months from now to June. Theres no reason we should wait four months or even one more month; we can start taking care of our responsibilities now, she said.

Escudero says DOTr to suspend PUV modernization pending review,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Transportation , under its new leadership, will temporarily suspend the implementation of the Public Transport Modernization Program pending review. This was disclosed Tuesday by Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero, citing his recent conversation with newly installed Transportation Secretary Vivencio Vince Dizon. Tinalakay ko sa kanya ito , he said at a press conference in Sorsogon when asked about the PTMP, noting the the agencies implementing the program is under the DOTr. At ayon sa kanya, ipapa-review niya ito at pansamantala niyang sususpendihin ito hanggat hindi tapos ang kanyang review dahil nabasa din niya ang posisyon ng Senado at mahaba-haba din naming tinalakay ito sa kanya mismo bago pa man siya nahirang bilang kalihim, Escudero said. Launched in 2019, PTMP, previously known as the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program, seeks to replace traditional jeepneys that are no longer roadworthy with vehicles that have Euro 4-compliant engines to reduce air pollution. But its implementation was met by strong opposition from affected sectors with some filing cases against it before the Supreme Cour t. In the Senate, Escudero and 21 other senators signed a resolution urging the government to temporarily suspend its enforcement of the PTMP, citing the concerns raised by the drivers and operators who will be affected directly by the program. The Senate chief expressed confidence the new DOTr chief would side with the Senate. So, maakakaasa kayo at buo din ang pag-asa ko na kakatigan ni Sec.

LWUA extends interim management in Cagayan de Oro water district,"CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY The Local Water Utilities Administration has extended, yet again, the interim management it installed in the cash-strapped Cagayan de Oro City Water District . According to COWD interim general manager Fermin Jarales, they were informed of the LWUA boards decision on Tuesday. Jarales told journalists during Wednesdays Meet the Press at SM Downtown Premiere by the Cagayan de Oro Press Club that the extension of their mandate is from March 1 to August 31 this year, or six months. LWUA took over the management of COWD on May 29, 2024, two weeks after President Marcos told the agency to study such a possibility to address the water crisis in the city. But the move met stiff resistance, with almost daily protest actions to bar the entry of Jarales and the interim board members into the COWD building. They were only able to hold office around September last year. LWUA first extended the interim managements stay last December, for three months. We defer to LWUAs wisdom on this matter. We are LWUAs foot soldiers here, implementing a mandate to provide sustainable solutions to the citys water crisis, Jarales said. Earlier, Jarales had described COWD, the countrys first water district, as on the edge of a financial abyss due to poor collection efficiency and revenue loss because of water wastage over a long period. On Wednesday, Jarales debunked as misinformation the claims circulating in mainstream and social media that COWD has increased its water rates to finance its stiff investment requirements. It is just sad that a city councilor who seeks reelection is among those peddling such a lie, Jarales lamented. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

PUP student regent calls for walkout on Edsa anniversary,"MANILA, Philippines The Office of the Student Regent of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines has called for a mass walkout of students on Tuesday, Feb. 25, to mark the 39th anniversary of the Edsa People Power Revolution, joining several institutions in observing this historical event that toppled the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Edsa is a protest, and with or without classes, students will walk out, student regent Kim Modelo said in a Facebook post over the weekend. Modelo made the call after the university administration refused to mark the date as a holiday. She called the move not to declare Feb. 25 as a holiday a form of historical distortion. We are calling for alternative learning and a class suspension on Feb. 25 not only because we want to attend the Edsa mobilization, but because we want our school to stand against all injustices of the Marcos, Sr. regime and show protest to the Marcos, Jr. administration for his holiday downgrade, Modelo said. Not declaring this day a holiday is a form of historical distortion because PBBM [President Bongbong Marcos] does not want to see how strong we are when we collectively walk out he is scared, she added. Meanwhile, Modelo said several PUP students would join the protest rally in the Edsa People Power Monument in Quezon City on Tuesday. Upon Malacaangs declaration that the Edsa People Power anniversary would not be a special non-working holiday, several institutions, including the University of the Philippines, the University of Santo Tomas, and St. Scholasticas College-Manila, declared the suspension of classes.

Zamora: Special session not needed for Senate to convene as impeachment court,"MANILA, Philippines A special session of Congress may not be needed for the Senate to convene itself as an impeachment court and start the trial of Vice President Sara Duterte, prosecution panel member and San Juan City Rep. Ysabel Maria Zamora said on Tuesday. In a statement, Zamora said the Senate does not need to request a special session from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as the legislative body was already an impeachment court the moment it received the articles of impeachment from the House of Representatives last February 5. Zamora hinged her belief on the 1987 Constitutions wording of impeachment complaints filed and verified by at least one-third of the entire House that trial shall proceed forthwith. As to that, we dont need a special session because the Constitution is clear that trial shall forthwith proceed. For us, the Senate is already the impeachment court even if it is on recess, Zamora, one of the 11 House members tapped to form part of the prosecution team, said. Zamora also noted that Marcos is correct in not intervening in the issue, as the legislative is a separate and co-equal branch of the executive. The executive is a separate branch of government; thus it is right for the President not to call for a special session, she added. There have been calls, specifically from the opposition and the Makabayan bloc, for Marcos to call a special session of Congress so that impeachment proceedings against Duterte can start. On Monday, Makabayan bloc lawmakers ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro, Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, and Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel said that Marcos should now call for a special session as the Duterte camps legal maneuvers indicate that the pursuit of accountability is being delayed. A group of lawyers from Mindanao and Duterte, represented by her lawyers, filed separate petitions before the Supreme Court requesting a halt to the impeachment process. READ: Marcos told: Call special Congress session to start Duterte impeachment But Assistant Majority Leader and Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong said that colleagues in both the House and the Senate should refrain from dragging Marcos into impeachment discussions to ensure the separation of powers. Adiong stressed that the impartiality of the court should be maintained, and no moves that may indicate influencing should be done. READ: Solons: Dont involve Marcos in impeachment, Congress is separate body Meanwhile, Assistant Majority Leader and Ako Bicol party-list Rep. Raul Angelo Bongalon said the House has not yet received copies of petitions to stop the impeachment proceedings. Bongalon said he is confident that the SC will not intervene. We have not yet received a copy of the order, but definitely we will comply. We are confident that the Supreme Court will not intervene, Bongalon said. 1-Rider party-list Rep. Ramon Rodrigo Gutierrez also said that Malacaangs stance on the special session aligns with its previous statements regarding the impeachment process. This seems to be consistent with the Palaces first pronouncements on the possibility of calling for a special session, Gutierrez added. But in any case, if we look at the Constitution, this is a responsibility that primarily falls on the Senate. We respectfully and eagerly anticipate the Senates action on this matter. Bongalon and Gutierrez, like Zamora, are members of the prosecution team. Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint against her. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-thirds of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5 which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. There are also conflicting opinions whether it is proper for the current Senate to start the trial when the 2025 midterms elections would surely change the composition in the legislative chamber.

On the other hand, 69 percent of respondents in Metro Manila have a favorable view of Akap, while 66 percent of respondents in Mindanao expressed similar sentiments.

Feb 25 school holidays: Protesting distortion of history,"MANILA, Philippines Since last year, Feb. 25, the day that marked the end of the over 20-year dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., has ceased to be a special non-working day. But this year, schools and students are taking the lead in resisting attempts to diminish the significance of a critical moment in the history of the Philippines one that toppled a dictatorship and restored civil liberties. RELATED STORY: Lagman files bill seeking to declare People Power revolt a holiday This, as Malacaang, which is now led by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., declared in Proclamation No. 727 that Feb. 25 will be a working day this year, a downgrade from how it has often been marked since 1987. As pointed out by the De La Salle Philippines , Filipinos should resist all attempts to erase from our collective memory what our nation achieved in February 1986 and demand accountability from those who govern us. READ: #Edsa36: Remembering those who gave up their lives The DLSP has declared suspension of classes and work in all of its schools on Tuesday, Feb. 25, as a gesture of its commitment to the enduring values of freedom and justice. The Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae-Philippines Schools Network stated, as well, that the commemoration of the Edsa People Power Revolution will be a special non-working day. Its essence should always be recognized, felt, and observed, it said. The University of the Philippines Cebu and Diliman, Edsa-Ortigas Consortium of Schools, University of Santo Tomas, University of the East Manila and Caloocan, and Adamson University , among others, likewise declared a suspension of classes and work. READ: LIST: More schools suspend classes for Edsa People Power anniversary As the Adamson University said, this sinister strategy of sidelining history and downplaying the gains of freedom in the Edsa People Power Revolution is not acceptable to us. Based on data from the Human Rights Violations Victims Memorial Commission, there were 11,103 victims of the dictatorship from 1972 to 19862,326 were killed or disappeared, while 1,922 were tortured. Recognized all over the world as a symbol of courage, the Edsa People Power Revolution was the result of the resistance and sacrifices of thousands of Filipinos, most of them students, who stood against Marcos Sr. Five years after the declaration of martial law in 1972, the dictatorship was shaken by intense demonstrations that were led by students from 10 colleges and universities in Metro Manila, like UP, UE, and AdU. Students walked out of their classes for a massive protest in July 1977, where close to 200,000 students demanded the reinstatement of student councils and campus newspapers, demilitarization of schools and a stop to tuition increases. As pointed out in a column published in the Philippine Revolution Web Central, the extent of the action prompted the dictatorship to heed the call, and inspired the youth to strengthen their resolve to fight for their rights. The First Quarter Storm , which saw Filipinos marching in rage to protest government abuses in 1970, was likewise led by students who inspired workers and peasants to take to the streets to protest police violence and government repression. But this is also exactly the reason that UP President Angelo Jimenezs declaration of Feb. 25 as an alternative learning day has received backlash, with some saying that it was spineless, disappointing. UP has historically been a center of resistance against the dictatorship and fascism of the Marcoses, said Franz Joseph Beltran, vice chairperson of the UP Diliman University Student Council. Resistance is the universitys living tradition, he pointed out. From the Diliman Commune, the FQS, to the present day, the UP Community has tirelessly sought accountability from the Marcoses for all of their crimes against the Filipino people. For Beltran, Jimenezs statement was disappointing because more could have been said in declaring UPs stand on the commemoration of Feb. 25, especially against the backdrop of a Marcos Jr. presidency and attempts to distort history. INQUIRER.net has reached out to Jimenezs office but has not yet received a response. As university officials, we expected them to carry the same principles and struggles that the UP community has historically waged, he said, stressing that other schools have released stronger statements that clearly outline their stand. READ: Over 70 groups to hold protest rally on Edsa anniversary They were able to highlight in their statements why students should be compelled to take part in activities and mobilizations for the commemoration of the EDSA People Power Revolution, Beltran said. He explained that when historical distortionism is at a full offensive, we must not shy away from or be conservative in calling on our fellow community members to mobilize in keeping the memory of People Power alive while actively resisting the Marcos regime and their efforts to sanitize the atrocities of their past. Beltran said while they recognize Jimenezs declaration of an alternative learning day, this is ultimately unclear and undermined by his order to let the various constituent units decide on how they will apply this. Now more than ever, it is crucial for historically significant institutions like UP to not only take clear and courageous positions, but to lead the call in demanding accountability from the Marcoses and in reinvigorating the spirit of the Edsa People Power Revolution among the Filipino people, he said. He said the efforts to distort history are well-funded, highly coordinated, and enduring. Millions of pesos have been spent over the years to fund troll farms, plant dubious recollections of history in media, revise the Basic Education curriculum, and erase the significance of the Edsa People Power in effectively ousting a dictator.

President Marcos is not a dictator Escudero,"MANILA, Philippines Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero thumbed down on Monday former President Rodrigo Dutertes accusation that President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr was veering toward dictatorship, which his father and namesake, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., resorted to during his administration.

Pimentels call came after Senate President Francis Escudero referred his letter asking the chamber to convene into an all-member caucus to discuss the impeachment trial to the panel on rules that Tolentino is heading. Preparatory work for the impeachment can proceed immediately as these actions are separate and distinct from the legislative functions of Congress, Pimentel said. We have a constitutional duty that must take precedence over our reelection bid. While we may be busy with our campaigns, the best campaign is fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities. I trust that the upcoming election will not interfere with our mandate, he added. Following his letters referral to the rules committee, Pimentel said the panel must forthwith or immediately, right away, and without delay review the impeachment guidelines. He also said the committee can either reaffirm the existing rules in their entirety or propose targeted amendments that better align with the constitutional intent. READ: Escudero: Senate needs special session to start VP Duterte trial READ: Marcos: Will call special session if asked by Senate Earlier, Pimentel explained that the Senate can decide to convene as an impeachment court and come up with its court calendar separate from its legislative calendar. He said it is theoretically possible for the chamber to begin the preliminary preparations in March and defer the presentation of witnesses until after the upcoming election.

Church leaders urge Filipinos to uphold Edsa Revolution spirit,"MANILA, Philippines As the nation marked the 39th anniversary of the Edsa People Power Revolution on Tuesday, 163 bishops, priests, nuns, and members of religious groups have called on Filipinos to uphold the spirit of the revolution by standing against oppression and advocating for justice. In a joint statement titled Living Out the Spirit of Edsa: A Call to the Church People, the religious leaders emphasized that the 1986 uprising was not just a political event but a moral and spiritual awakening. The victory of Edsa was not just a political triumph; it was a moral and spiritual awakening, the statement reads. It showed us that courage, compassion, and solidarity could break the chains of dictatorship. Signatories included apostolic vicars and bishops from the Catholic Church, bishops from the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, priests and members of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, nuns from the Asia Missionary Sisters of Sr. Charles Borromeo, Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena Philippines, and members of the United Methodist Church. Notable signatories were Apostolic Vicar of Taytay Broderick Pabillo, San Carlos Bishop Gerardo Alminaza, Gumaca Bishop Eugenius Longakit Caete, Calbayog Bishop Isabelo C. Abarquez, and Archdiocese of Cebu Vicar for Social Advocacies Nazario Ace Vocales. The church leaders warned against remaining silent amid injustices, noting that the same powerful family unseated in 1986 is back in office, perpetuating a system that keeps many Filipinos in poverty, silence, and fear. As a Church, we cannot be neutral. Silence in the face of injustice is complicity, they said, urging the faithful to act as the voice of the voiceless, to expose lies with truth, and to resist evil with love. READ: Edsa is for the young They also called for vigilance against historical revisionism and the spread of disinformation, emphasizing the need to educate communities about the realities of injustice and threats to democracy. Living out the spirit of Edsa means more than remembering history it means embracing a continuing commitment to social transformation, they added. The religious leaders likewise cited biblical teachings, quoting Proverbs 31:8-9: Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy. They also challenged the faithful. The spirit of Edsa is alive whenever we choose to act in faith, speak truth to power, and build a nation where justice and peace reign, they said.

SC justice to govt lawyer: Where is the money?,"MANILA, Philippines Where is the money? An Associate Justice of the Supreme Court asked the governments lawyer on the need to use the unutilized funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation when a loan was granted specifically for the Panay-Guimaras-Negros Island Bridges. During the continuation of the oral argument on the petition questioning the legality of the transfer of PhilHealths unutilized funds to the national treasury, Associate Justice Amy Lazaro-Javier said the PGN Island Bridges project is already fully funded by the Export-Import Bank of Korea for P174.49 billion. READ: SC issues TRO vs transfer of PhilHealth funds to National Treasury Why is there an urgency to transfer [funds] when the project is already fully funded by the Export-Import Bank of Korea, Lazaro-Javier asked. Lazaro-Javier asked if the fund intended for PGN that came for the bank loan in Korea was moved to other unprogrammed funds in the government. Guevarra said he would have to check if it has been moved to unprogrammed government funds or if it was deferred. How can the government have moved this when it is a loan intended for that purpose? Lazaro-Javier said and asked if the government has spent even a single centavo on the project even though it has not even started. There is nothing to spend for if the project has not even started, Guevarra said. So, where is the money? Lazaro-Javier asked to which Guevarra said the money went presumably to the national treasury to use it for projects and programs under the unprogrammed appropriations. Lazaro-Javier added that the unprogrammed funds cover no specific national roads. It depends on the implementing agency to determine which specific road project it wants to be implemented from the funds available, Guevarra said. The associate justice also pointed out that the 2024 General Appropriations Act has set aside P15 million for the maintenance of national roads under its Special Road Fund, P1.6 billion under the maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation of infrastructure and other related activities, and P463 million under maintenance, repair, rehabilitation of national bridges which are all under the Department of Public Works and Highways . Considering all these fundings, why is there a need to get additional funds for the same road maintenance under the category of unprogrammed appropriations, the justice asked. The oral argument is about the petitions against the transfer of PhilHealths excess funds were filed by the groups of Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III and Bayan Muna Chairperson Neri Colmenares, and 1SAMBAYAN Coalition together with members of the University of the Philippines Law Class 1975, Senior for Seniors Association, Inc., Kidney Foundation of the Philippines, and other private individuals. Named respondents in the petitions were Department of Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto, the House of Representatives represented by Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, the Senate represented by Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero; Executive Secretary Lucas P. Bersamin; and PhilHealth represented by its President Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. On October 29, 2024, the Supreme Court issued a restraining order against the transfer of funds.

Palace: Public still free to commemorate Edsa people power,"MANILA, Philippines Malacaang on Tuesday defended the declaration of Edsa People Power Revolution as a special working day, stating that the public is still free to commemorate it. Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary Claire Castro made the pronouncement after Marcos seemingly downgraded the Edsa People Power from being a holiday, which it was traditionally declared as during previous administrations. Feb. 25 is declared as a special working day, and I think it is the prerogative of the President, said Castro in a Palace press conference. When we say special working day, still there is encouragement to the people to commemorate, to join any event and it will not hinder any activity to commemorate Edsa People Power, she added. Castro pointed out that Marcos has never even stopped any activities related to the Edsa People Power since he was elected President. When asked if the Palace thinks the declaration of Edsa not as a holiday but a special working day reduces its essence, Castro responded in the negative. We dont think so, because if there is the intention to erase, ibang klaseng pamamaraan ang gagawin. It was still considered a special working day, she said.

PCO claps back at Dutertes Marcos dictatorship allegation,"MANILA, Philippines A Presidential Communications Office official on Monday clapped back at former President Rodrigo Dutertes accusation that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.sadministration is veering towards dictatorship. READ: Duterteone-man fake news factory Palace What evidence? How can it be proven? As I said, we cannot believe mere intrigues without evidence, PCO Undersecretary and Palace press officer Claire Castro told reporters in Filipino. You probably remember that during the time of former President Duterte, he admitted that even when he was just a fiscal, he was already an expert in fabricating intrigues and planting evidence. We have surely seen proof of this during the case of Senator Leila de Lima, she added. So what else can we expect from former President Duterte? Creating intrigue, planting evidence. Duterte made the allegation during an indignation rally in Mandaue City last Saturday. He said that Marcos would no longer come as a surprise if he also declared martial law, just like his late father and namesake did when he was the chief executive. Mr. Marcos is veering towards a dictatorship. I will place my bet, he will not step down when his term ends. He is like his father.

Palace: Awkward for Marcos to call for session on Duterte impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines Malacaang on Tuesday said President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. believes it is more appropriate to wait for the Senate to request a special session on the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte before calling one himself. This was Palace Press Officer and Undersecretary Claire Castros answer when asked if Marcos could compel the conduct of a special Senate session even without a request from the chamber. The way we see it, it would be an awkward position on the part of the President to voluntarily call for a special session, considering that there is this ongoing [allegation] that the President is behind the impeachment proceeding, Castro told reporters. So it is better for the Senate to request, considering even the President made this pronouncement that if the Senate would ask him to call for a special session he would do so, she added. READ: Escudero: Senate needs special session to start VP Duterte trial Asked if it was legal for the President to call for a special Senate session that would only be limited to the impeachment trial, Castro responded that the President may call for a special session anytime under the Constitution. It is not limited to the urgency of a bill or legislation, but we believe it also includes the impeachment trial because its anytime, without any condition, she explained. The House of Representatives impeached Duterte last February 5. On February 18, she filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to stop the impeachment proceedings.

Sandigan orders Cocolife to return over 255 million UCPB shares to govt,"MANILA, Philippines The Sandiganbayan has ordered United Coconut Planters Life Assurance Corporation to return 255.8 million United Coconut Planters Bank shares to the Philippine government in relation to the controversial coco levy funds. In its decision dated February 24, the anti-graft courts Second Division dismissed the petition for declaratory relief filed by Cocolife in July last year. The Supreme Court defines declaratory relief as a special civil action filed by any person interested under a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, or whose rights are affected by a statute, executive order or regulation, ordinance, or any other governmental regulation. READ: Sandigan junks 2 more Marcos, crony wealth cases As stated in the decision, the Cocolifes petition stemmed from Sandiganbayan Civil Case No. 0033-B, which sought the recovery of alleged ill-gotten wealth from companies created out of coconut levy funds in compliance with the Republic Act No. 11524 or the Coconut Farmers and Industry Fund Act. Under Section 6 of RA No. 11524which was signed into law by former President Rodrigo Duterte in February 2021all government agencies and any person with coconut levy assets shall reconvey them to the Republic of the Philippines as declared by the SC. The anti-graft court said the Presidential Commission for Good Government cited this law in the case, claiming that Cocolife was created and/or funded using the coconut levy funds and that the UCBP shares in the said insurance company were purportedly acquired using such funds. But in its petition, Cocolife argued that shares are not covered by the CFITF Act and the SC has not yet released a decision declaring the stocks as coconut levy assets that belong to the Philippine government. In response, the Sandiganbayan said that it found the petition unmeritorious or lacking in value or merit, as it agreed with the PCGGs position that UCPBs shares of stock in Cocolife are reconveyable coconut levy assets within the purview of the CFITF Act. WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant Petition for Declaratory Relief filed by COCOLIFE on July 1, 2024, is hereby DISMISSED, the decision reads. Being duty bound to comply with the clear provisions of RA No. 11524, otherwise known as the Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund Act, petitioner COCOLIFE is ordered to immediately issue certificates if stocks in the name of the Republic of the Philippines covering the 255,823,678 shares of stocks registered in the name of UCPB for the benefit of the coconut farmer, it adds.

"Solons: Dont involve Marcos in impeachment, Congress is separate body","MANILA, Philippines At least two lawmakers have urged their colleagues in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to refrain from dragging President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. from impeachment discussions, to ensure the separation of powers. In a press briefing on Monday, Assistant Majority Leader and Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong said he disagrees with the position of the Makabayan bloc that Marcos should already call a special session of Congress so that impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte can start. According to Adiong, the impartiality of the court should be maintained and no moves that may indicate influencing should be done. I think we should not directly involve the President in the case of impeachment, thats my opinion in matters relating to the impeachment process because this is entirely within the scope and mandate of the Congress as the Constitution says [] I disagree in this case with the position of the Makabayan bloc, mga kaibigan ko naman sila sana wag na nating directly na i-involve ang President, he said. Sinasabi ho natin, we should maintain impartiality of the court. We should not be using anything or anyone or any organization to influence the senator-judges on how they would approach and appreciate the merits of the impeachment cases [] The more that we should disallow the President to involve directly kasi kailangan ho natin, baka sabihin naman ang mga critic na yan, na pag ang Presidente ang mag-request ng special session, it will translate into influencing, he added. On Monday, Makabayan bloc lawmakers, namely ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro, Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, and Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel, said that Marcos should now call for a special congressional session, so that the Senate can convene as an impeachment court. According to the three lawmakers, the Duterte camps legal maneuvers filing petitions before the Supreme Court requesting a halt to the impeachment process should already prompt Marcos to call for a special session. READ: Marcos told: Call special Congress session to start Duterte impeachment Similarly, Senate President Francis Escudero said that a special session has to be called for the impeachment proceedings to start. READ: Escudero: Senate needs special session to start VP Duterte trial However, Manila 1st District Rep. Ernesto Dionisio Jr. said he agrees with Adiong that Marcos should not be asked to meddle in congressional affairs. Dapat hindi makialam si President Bongbong Marcos in terms of doon sa impeachment process. Kasi yung sinasabing calendar, legislative calendar yun eh, iba naman itong impeachment eh, he said. Its my humble opinion na papaanong mangyayari na si President Bongbong Marcos lang ang pwedeng gumawa ng hakbang para mag-proceed yung impeachment court ng Senate in convening, di parang nakaasa naman yung Senate sa iisang tao, sa Pangulo, he added. Adiong said he also believes, just like Iloilo 3rd District Rep. Lorenz Defensor who is a member of the prosecution panel, that the Senate can act on its own by starting the impeachment proceedings. This may be considered similar, Adiong said, to scenarios where Congress does not not need to call for a special session just to act on a Presidents declaration of war or a declaration of martial law. I tend to lean towards the legal opinion of one of our prosecutors, Congressman Lorenz Defensor, when he describes the impeachment process as sui generis, unique of its own, because this is not legislative work, this is something else, this is the trial of an accused, in this case the Vice President of the Republic.) And number two, there are provisions in the Constitution that once the President declares martial law, it does not need for the President to actually convene the Congress into a special session. The Congress can actually convene itself directly to a special session to discuss the issue, for example, martial law, he added. Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trialto start forthwith if at least one-thirds of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5 which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. There are also conflicting opinions regarding whether it is proper for the current Senate to start the trial when the 2025 midterms elections would surely change the composition in the legislative chamber.

Nicolas Torre said the suspect was a private employee of the Marcoses but was let go. Torre did not say when the suspect stopped working for the First Family.

More bridge collapse incidents likely if execs not held accountable-Lacson,"SAN JOSE DEL MONTE, Bulacan Incidents like the collapse of a bridge in Santa Maria town, Isabela will likely happen again if government officials responsible for such projects are not held accountable, former Sen. Panfilo Lacson said on Friday. In a press conference here with the senatorial candidates of the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas, Lacson said he did not want to preempt investigations on the collapse of the Cabagan-Santa Maria Bridge on Thursday, but he believed that the materials used for the bridge were likely substandard. Ibig sabihin, siguro I dont want to preempt whatever investigation is being conducted or will be conducted pero malamang sa hindi substandard yong materials, he said. This means, maybe I dont want to pre-empt whatever investigation is being conducted or will be conducted but more likely the materials used were substandard.) So hanggat walang nakukulong ng mga responsable, walang nako-convict at nakukulong, talagang hindi ito matigil. This is not the first time, and this wont be the last na mangyayari yan, at sana huwag maraming masasaktan o mamamatay sa aksidente gawa ng mga kalokohan na mga accountable at responsible sa mga ganoong klaseng infrastructure projects, he added. Reports showed that a portion of the bridge, which was just newly-retrofitted, collapsed, leading to four vehicles falling into the river. No casualties were reported, but at least six individuals were injured. READ: 4 cars fall into river as newly retrofitted bridge in Isabela collapses The Department of Public Works and Highways is now assessing the cause and the extent of the damage to the bridge. READ: DPWH: Assessment underway on cause of Isabela bridge collapse The Cabagan-Santa Maria Bridge issue was brought up after Lacson and other senatorial candidates were asked about how their pet legislation can help areas like Bulacan be more developed, should they win in the 2025 midterm elections. Lacson mentioned his advocacy for budget reform, which strives for an equitable allocation of government funds to areas who may need it more. The former senator then mentioned that the collapse of the bridge is an example of funds not being properly allocated or spent. Ang aking pangunahing plataporma hindi lamang sa panahon ng kampanya, kundi lalo kong ginagawa nong akoy nasa Senado na, yong budget reform, kasi hindi kumakalat yong biyaya ng national budget sa mga karatig-lugar ng Metro Manila at lalo na sa malalayo. Nasabi ko na ito maraming beses na taon-taon, napakalaki ng hindi nagagamit, yong unused appropriations, pumapalo siya ng daang bilyon , he said. Hindi nagagamit o kung nagagamit man, mali ang paggamit. May bumagsak na tulay don sa Santa Maria, Cabagan, Isabela. Eh sa aking pananaw, eh bakit babagsak yon? Noon daw nagawa yon, ang sinasabi ng mga taga roon, hindi talaga nadadaanan ng mga truck. Anong saysay ng isang tulay kung hindi pwedeng daanan ng truck kundi mga motorsiklo lamang? he asked. (It is not being used, or it was used improperly. A bridge collapsed in Santa Maria, Cabagan, Isabela. In my opinion, why should that collapse? People were saying that when it was built, trucks cannot pass by. What is the value of a bridge if only motorcycles, and not trucks, can cross it? he asked. It was not the first time that DPWH was hounded by questions regarding its infrastructure projects, which were feared to have used substandard materials and processes. Last December, several potholes were discovered across the 3.17 kilometer Panguil Bay Bridge in Mindanao just after it was opened in September or for a period of two months. Top DWPH officials, however, gave assurance that they have been addressing the damage to keep the bridge safe for public use. Construction for the bridge was said to have cost P7.37 billion.

Marcos no reaction to VP Dutertes remarks on showing anger Palace,"MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has no reaction to Vice President Sara Dutertes remark about peoples right to show anger, Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary Claire Castro said Thursday. Castro explained that people have the right to show their anger to the administration as part of their constitutional right. During the Peoples Indignation Rally on February 22 in Mandaue City, Cebu, Duterte told DySS Super Radyo GMA in Bisaya that It is the right of the people to show their anger; we have what we call constitutional protection of the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. When the President found out about this, he did not react,Castro said in Filipino during a Palace briefing on Thursday. We know the President, he doesnt just react to things like this, she added. Castro questioned whether Vice President Duterte expressed the same sentiments when her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, was hailed as Person of the Year in 2017 for his crackdown on illegal drugs. The Global Investigative Journalism Network gives the title to an individual who has done the most in the world to advance organized criminal activity and corruption. READ: Global investigative journalism network names Duterte its 2017 Person of the Year We have nothing to say about how she expresses her feelings, but why only now? A lot more happened during her fathers time. So, is she encouraging people to be angry somehow linked to the alleged destabilization? Castro asked. The only question is: During her fathers time, did she also say that people could be angry, especially when her father was labeled, recognized, and named the most corrupt in 2017? she added. Do you remember that in 2016, the former president was only a runner-up for the most corrupt title? He was recognized by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. But in 2017, former President Duterte leveled up and became the awardee, officially recognized as the Person of the Year for being the most corrupt, she pointed out. Castro also expressed dismay at how Duterte seemed to encourage anger towards the government. It is saddening that, instead of upholding her position as the second-highest leader of the country, she seems to be encouraging people to be angry at the government, she said in Filipino. So, being the Vice President, it would be better if she encourages people to cooperate instead of having this feeling of hatred against the government. It would be best if we all moved forward together rather than having some individuals who seek to bring the government down, she added. Asked whether the Marcos administration had ever received any formal information about planned destabilization, Castro said there was none. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address. I agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge that I have read the Privacy Policy . We dont have formal information about any destabilization, but we can observe from their statements during rallies that they incite anger and they urge people to believe that the government is abusive and excessive. Just from that alone, we can already see and sense where they are headed, she explained. She also pointed out that Dutertes remarks in the rally cannot be classified as sedition or as conduct inciting the public to rebel against the authority of the state.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2038653/marcos-no-reaction-to-vp-dutertes-remarks-on-showing-anger-palace

Edsa still relevant as long as theres abuse of power Gabriela,"MANILA, Philippines As long as there is abuse of power and corruption in the government, the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution remains relevant, according to Gabriela party-list first nominee Sarah Elago. Elago made the statement in response to criticisms that the historic revolution, which ousted former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., is no longer significant today. As long as there is abuse of power and as long as there are those who steal public funds, Edsa remains relevant, Elago told INQUIRER.net in an interview on Tuesday. READ: Marcos admin cant erase Edsa Revolts memory Aquinos grandson Edsa showed that through the unity and collective action of the people, we do not let the corrupt go unpunished.

"With preps underway, solon hopes VP impeachment trial will start soon","MANILA, Philippines While the Senates move to start preparing for the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte is a welcome development, Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Raul Angelo Bongalon hopes the hearing will start sooner than the leaderships June target date. In a press briefing on Thursday, Bongalon said that Senate President Francis Escuderos move to assign tasks to officials in preparation for the impeachment proceedings could signal that the Senate was now tackling the matter with urgency. For the Senate sitting as an impeachment court, its a positive development in the sense that probably they have realized the urgency as well as the responsibility as enshrined in the Constitution, that as the Senate, who is the sole judge for the impeachment case filed against any impeachable officer, said Bongalon, one of the lawmaker-prosecutors tapped by the House of Representatives. So with that development, I believe that there will be a possibility, a big possibility that trial will commence the soonest possible [] So, its a big development because they have been given the directive to address all the things that they need to do, especially in relation to this impending impeachment proceeding, he added. However, Bongalon still hopes that the trial starts sooner than Escuderos prediction that the trial would start by July 2025 and end by October 2025. READ: Senate can wrap up Sara Duterte impeachment trial in 3 months Escudero Well, hopefully, this changes, considering that theres already a directive asking for the organization of the administrative support to the Senate sitting as an impeachment court, hopefully it changes. Because given that the provision of the Constitution that the trial shall forthwith proceed, so probably there will be a change of mind with respect to the decision, he noted. Anyway, we still have all the time, even before the 19th Congress ends, I guess that remaining months are sufficient to finish the trial. So it was mentioned by him , that in two to three months, I guess, they can finish this impeachment trial, so before June 30 of 2025, I guess trial will already, its already concluded, he added. On Wednesday, Escudero gave the following offices and officials respective duties for the impeachment proceedings: READ: Escudero readies administrative support to Senate for VPs impeachment While Escudero remains adamant that the trial will start by the 20th Congress, observers including other House lawmakers and members of the prosecution team see this as an important point for setting in motion the impeachment process. House committee on good government and public accountability chairperson and Manila 3rd District Rep. Joel Chua said that the Senates latest moves affirms their commitment to upholding accountability at the highest levels of government. The House of Representatives, in transmitting the Articles of Impeachment, has fulfilled its constitutional mandate. Now, it is up to the Senate to conduct a fair and impartial trial to determine whether Vice President Duterte should be removed from office, said Chua, who is also a prosecutor like Bongalon. The Senate must now proceed in accordance with its impeachment rules. This means the Vice President will have the opportunity to present her defense, and we in the prosecution panel will present our case backed by evidence and witnesses, he added. Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint, hinged on several issues such as the alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a Vice President. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5 which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter.

PNP: Convoy caught using Edsa busway carrying senior officers,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine National Police said that the convoy caught by traffic enforcers for using the exclusive bus lane along Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue on Tuesday evening was carrying senior officers. Security personnel reportedly said the convoy carried PNP Chief Gen. Rommel Marbil. However, in a message to reporters on Wednesday early morning, PNP spokesperson Brig. Gen. Jean Fajardo said, For security reasons, we cannot divulge the identities of those in the convoy. What we can confirm is that these are senior officers holding sensitive positions. READ: Vehicles owned by Pacquiao, PNP among Edsa busway violators This convoy was headed to Camp Crame because there is a closed-door meeting that requires the urgent presence of these officers, she explained. Fajardo later added that the meeting regarded an ongoing security operation. The DOTr previously said the Edsa busway was limited to the use of public utility buses, emergency vehicles and clearly-marked government vehicles. However, the enforcers on the scene did not accept the convoys explanation, Fajardo said. Although, we have said that there are guidelines for when its urgent or an emergency in nature for PNP officers, she said. The convoy no longer argued with the enforcers and made a deal with them to allow them to first take the officers to Camp Crame then come back to get the ticket intended for their supposed violation, she detailed. Further, according to the PNP spokesperson, the convoys motorcycle escorts stayed behind as a sign of their intention not to evade the authorities. She added that they would be explaining the incident to the DOTr. We understand the comments coming out about what happened.

Escudero bares proposed calendar of Sara Duterte impeachment trial,"MANILA, Philippines Senate President Francis Escudero released the proposed calendar of the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte, eyeing to start the actual judicial proceeding on July 30. In a press conference on Thursday, the Senate chief disclosed the proposed timeline: Escudero said the Senate was hoping to adhere to the proposed schedule. He also said that considering the prosecution and defense would have ample time to prepare for the proceedings, it would not tolerate any dilatory motion or pleading. According to the Senate chief, all senators were made aware of the proposed calendar, noting that he sent each of them a letter detailing his plans. In his letter, Escudero explained that the impeachment complaint was received late in the afternoon of the Senates session day, without sufficient prior notice that would have prompted the body to discuss and amend the impeachment rules and procedures. According to the Senate leader, his office has been reviewing existing rules and has commenced drafting proposed amendments that would, among others: authorize the Senate President to issue summons on the person impeached and preside over the pre-trial and the receipt of judicial affidavits; incorporate directly or by reference, Revised Rules of Court provisions on judicial affidavits, pre-trial conference, reception of evidence, electronic filing of proceedings, and other matters; and provide clear guidance on the procedure to be followed in case the trial is not concluded before the sine die adjournment of Congress The proposed amendments shall be circulated to all the senators for review, comment, or further amendments on or before March 31 so that the revised rules can be approved by the Senate in plenary when we resume session on June 2, 2025, the letter reads. Earlier, Escudero had ordered offices in the upper chamber to prepare for the impending impeachment trial. He made the directive via Special Order No. 2025-015, seeking the organization of administrative support to the Senate sitting as an impeachment court. Despite this, he maintained that the proceedings would not be rushed, sticking to his earlier pronouncements that the proper impeachment trial against the vice president would commence after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s fourth State of the Nation Address in July.

House releases explainer video on VP Sara Duterte impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines A video explaining why Vice President Sara Duterte was impeached was uploaded to the social media page of the House of Representatives on Thursday with the intent of educating the public about the merits of the case, Ako Bicol party-list Rep. Raul Angelo Bongalon said. Bongalon, in a press briefing, said that he prefers that the almost nine-minute video detailing the basis for Dutertes impeachment be translated into local dialects so that more people would be made aware of the bases used by lawmakers. Well, probably its one way of educating the public because, for me, the Filipino people have the right to be informed of this impeachment proceeding. And it might be better if we can translate it to the local languages or dialects so that our fellow Filipinos could understand it better, he said in a mix of English and Filipino. I guess its one way for us to probably also explain to the people why we have signed the impeachment complaint. There are technicalities here, of course the confidential funds, the misuse of the P612.5 million confidential funds, of course, this spending of more than 100 million in just 11 days. So there are technical matters there that the people need to know using a plain and simple language, he added. The video explained each article of impeachment cited in the House-verified complaint that was sent to the Senate. Some pieces of evidence, like Dutertes online press briefings and other documents, were also shown to describe why lawmakers reached the decision to impeach the Vice President. There were sevenarticlesofimpeachmentin the verified complaint against Duterte: According to Bongalon, the video also aims to dispel the notion that Dutertes impeachment was borne out of politics. They might say that its just political or you are mad at the vice president, but thats not the point. Our point here is that the people have to know what are the violations made by our Vice President, and why she is facing an impeachment case, Bongalon said. So with that, I hope we can help them better understand what the impeachment case is all about and what Vice President Sara Duterte did for her to face an impeachment trial, he added. Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The House immediately transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5 which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season or through a special session to discuss the matter. There are also conflicting opinions regarding whether it is proper for the current Senate to start the trial when the 2025 midterm elections would surely change the composition in the legislative chamber. Former Sen. Panfilo Lacson believes, though, that there would be no issue if the impeachment trial would start with the 19th Congress and cross over to the 20th Congress, based on the same principle used by the judiciary where jurisdiction of a court division does not change despite the resignation or retirement of a sitting justice.

PNP probes alleged memo to overshadow Edsa busway issue,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine National Police is investigating a leaked internal memorandum that allegedly outlines strategies to overshadow the incident where a PNP convoy was stopped along the Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue busway. The convoy, members of which namedropped PNP Chief Gen. Rommel Marbil, was caught along the Edsa exclusive bus lane on Tuesday evening. READ: PNP: Convoy caught using Edsa busway carrying senior officers The memo allegedly issued by the Directorate for Police Community Relations on Feb. 26 reportedly tasks the Police Community Affairs and Development Group to redirect public attention and mitigate any further negative impact for the [PNP Chief] and the organization. We are aware of reports circulating regarding an alleged leaked memorandum and are currently conducting an internal verification process to determine its authenticity and context, the PNP said in a statement on Thursday. The PNP does not condone any attempts to manipulate public perception or divert attention from matters of public concern. We remain committed to accountability and due process in addressing any infractions involving our personnel, it added. The alleged memo from the DPCR also reportedly designated the PNP Public Information Office as the sole unit allowed to speak on the matter and instructed police regional offices to amplify their operational accomplishments to further overshadow the issue. The PNP did not confirm nor deny the authenticity of the memo. The PNP will continue to engage with the public in a transparent and responsible manner. We urge the public to rely on verified sources of information to avoid misinformation and speculation, it said. PNP spokesperson Brig. Gen. Jean Fajardo explained on Wednesday morning that the convoy was carrying senior officers whose presence in Camp Crame was required for a closed-door meeting regarding an ongoing security operation. In a radio interview on Wednesday morning, Marbil did not name the senior officers nor the security operation in question, citing privacy concerns for the former and deferring the latter to Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla.

Laguna cop faces dismissal for alleged robbery hold-up involvement,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine National Police Internal Affairs Service has recommended the dismissal of a patrolman detailed to the Laguna police for his alleged involvement in a robbery hold-up last year. In a statement on Thursday, the IAS did not name the police officer but said the latter was found guilty of grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a police officer. According to IAS, the police officer and two accomplices aboard two motorcycles forcibly took cash and a cell phone from a victim at gunpoint in Western Bicutan in Taguig City last June. A follow-up operation by police resulted in the arrest of the three suspects and led to the discovery that one of them was the active duty policeman, who used his PNP-issued firearm during the robbery hold-up.

Escudero explains stance on VP Duterte impeachment in letter to peers,"MANILA, Philippines Senate President Francis Escudero has warned his colleagues of unintended or even dangerous consequences if the Senate convenes on its own to start the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte. In a letter to senators dated February 24, Escudero explained his stance on the many questions raised on the impeachment case. As an impeachment court, the Senate will not be performing its usual legislative functions. It is my position, however, that an imprimatur from the body is required before the Senate can convene for a non-legislative purpose, he said. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Koko Pimentel III earlier floated the possibility of the Senate convening as an impeachment court even during the Congress break without President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. calling for a special session. READ: Koko Pimentel: Senate may convene impeachment court on its own Escudero, however, invoked the Senate rules, particularly Section 42, which he said provides an exclusive enumeration of the grounds for the Senate President to reconvene the Senate without the need of call by the President. These are limited to the discussion of urgent legislative matters and other grounds likewise found in the Constitution, the Senate chief said. For all other instances not enumerated, the power to call a special session at any time and for unspecified grounds belongs only to the President of the Philippines, he added. A misapplication of Section 42 and the lack of an enabling resolution from plenary can lead to unintended or even dangerous consequences, he stressed. In the same letter, he reiterated his position on the controversial word forthwith in reference to any impeachment case transmitted to the Senate for trial. A provision of the 1987 Constitution states: In case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at least one-third of all the Members of the House, the same shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment, and trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed. Escudero, however, cited the late Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiagos argument when the same issue was raised during the aborted impeachment trial of then-President Joseph Estrada. At that time, Escudero said, Santiago asserted that while the Senate must proceed forthwith, it must do so with circumspection. The body took Senator Defensor Santiagos position and only issued the summons after the Resolution on the Rules of Procedure on Impeachment Trials was adopted, Escudero pointed out. READ: Escudero bares proposed calendar of Sara Duterte impeachment trial Despite all these issues, the Senate chief noted that he has already taken steps to take proper order on the subject of impeachment in accordance with the existing impeachment rules. He said his office has been reviewing the rules and has started drafting proposed amendments that would, among others: According to Escudero, he decided to explain all these in writing so his colleagues could weigh on the issues surrounding the impeachment of Duterte.

DSWD expands workforce for decommissioned MILF fighters,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Social Welfare and Development has expanded its workforce to handle cases of decommissioned Moro Islamic Liberation Front fighters in conflict-affected areas in Mindanao. In a statement on Thursday, the DSWD said the move is part of its ongoing efforts to strengthen peace and development initiatives in the region. Prior to this, the DSWDs Field Office 12 oversaw all decommissioned MILF fighters regardless of their location. However, the agency has delegated this responsibility to Field Offices 9 in the Zamboanga Peninsula and 10 in Northern Mindanao. Previously, the DSWD-12 was responsible for overseeing all MILF decommissioned combatants regardless of their geographic location. However, after extensive consultations with key stakeholders, we recognized that a decentralized approach would be more sustainable, DSWD Undersecretary Alan Tanjusay explained. READ: MILF on next phase of decommissioning fighters: Resolve issues first Tanjusay also said the shift is part of preparations for a seamless implementation of the agencys recalibrated case management approach for former rebels. The DSWD expects that with a more decentralized approach, we can ascertain that the governments commitments and deliverables are closely monitored, and we can better facilitate the reintegration of our DCs into mainstream society, he added. According to Tanjusay, the recalibrated case management approach involves establishing regional offices in Regions 9 and 10, which will focus on monitoring the reintegration of decommissioned combatants. Aside from the turnover of case files, we also spearheaded training sessions for a total of 45 peace and development focals. We are making sure that they wouldnt jump into their respective roles without fully understanding their duties and responsibilities, he added.

Legarda champions cultural preservation as a national investment,"MANILA, Philippines Senator Loren Legarda called on embracing cultural preservation as an indispensable investment in the nations future during her keynote address at Cultural Thoughts and Trajectories, held at Manila House on Monday, February 26, 2025. The event, organized in partnership with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts in celebration of National Arts Month, brought together policymakers, diplomats, cultural leaders, and academics for a thought-provoking exchange on safeguarding and advancing Filipino identity in an era of rapid global change. We cannot possibly fully grasp the world that awaits two thousand years ahead, but what we choose to preserve todayour knowledge, our traditions, our storieswill ripple through time, shaping lives long after we are gone, just as the wisdom of the past continues to guide us now, Legarda declared. The four-term senator opened her address with a vivid image of the ancient Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, emphasizing how ancestral ingenuity offers solutions to contemporary challenges. These terraces endure because of the quiet brilliance of a people who, long before the world had the language for it, understood sustainability, engineering, and balance, she explained. Now, as modern societies grapple with climate crises, food insecurity, and ecological resilience, the world looks back to these ancient marvelsto learn. A recipient of the prestigious Dangal ng Haraya Award, Legarda reframed cultural preservation as both a pillar of national resilience and a source of innovation. In an era where power is measured in economic might, the Philippines carries a different wealth: a soft power that endures rather than conquers, that inspires rather than imposes, she asserted. Within the lessons of our ancestors may be found the answers to questions future generations have yet to ask. And in that, perhaps, lies our greatest advantage. A staunch advocate for cultural preservation, Legarda, who chairs the Senate Committee on Culture and the Arts, has authored landmark legislation such as the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009 and the Cultural Mapping Law , mandating a comprehensive inventory of Filipino tangible and intangible heritage. Her advocacy extends beyond policy into tangible impact: from community-driven programs, sustainable livelihood projects, and international cultural diplomacy. From publications and media productions to museums, galleries, gastronomy, music, built heritage, and indigenous languages, her work has elevated cultural preservation into a national development strategy. But let me be clear about our purpose: culture is not mere adornment; it is a vital engine of livelihood and economic growth. The hands that keep it alive must be equipped with the necessary infrastructure, resources, and market access to sustain their craft as a viable profession. Anything less is a betrayal of the very legacy we seek to protect, Legarda stressed. The event also highlighted how Legardas cultural diplomacy has elevated the Philippines on the world stage. From leading the countrys triumphant return to the Venice Biennale in 2015 after a 51-year absence to securing its role as Guest of Honor at the Frankfurter Buchmesse 2025, she has ensured global recognition for Filipino artistry and scholarship. Her initiatives, such as Sentro Rizal, a global network of cultural centers in Philippine embassies, and the Philippine Studies Program, now housed in over 20 universities worldwide, have institutionalized the academic study of Filipino culture and history across continents. An internationally recognized champion for climate resilience and disaster risk reduction, Legarda, who serves as UNDRR Global Champion for Resilience, also underscored the urgent intersection of culture and climate action. For a nation consistently ranked among the most vulnerable in the World Risk Index, the stakes are nothing less than survival. Integrating the wisdom of our cultural heritage into climate action may very well be the key to climate resilience. Legardas collaborations with state universities have already shaped national conservation policies, informing sustainable approaches to forest management, coastal stewardship, and upland resource governance. By merging indigenous knowledge with modern science, these initiatives offer forward-looking solutions to environmental challenges. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Palace on Edsa busway use: Dont abuse term emergency to break rules,"MANILA, Philippines Malacaang on Thursday reminded the Philippine National Police that the term emergency should not be used as an excuse to break the Edsa busway rules. At a Palace briefing, Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro was asked to comment on the PNPs proposal to let them use the Edsa bus lane during emergencies. If Im not mistaken, there is a provision that allows them to use the busway in case of an emergency and if they are on duty, she said in Filipino.

House panel issues show-cause order vs BARMM execs for skipping probe,"MANILA, Philippines Officials of the Bangasamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao who skipped a congressional probe on the alleged misuse of the local government support fund have been asked to explain their absence, aside from being required to attend the next hearing. During the hearing of the House of Representatives committee on public accounts, show-cause orders were issued against BARMM officials led by Parliament Speaker Pangalian Balindong and Cotabato City Mayor Mohammad Ali Matabalao after the panel members were not satisfied with their excuse letters. Bukidnon 2nd District Rep. Jonathan Keith Flores and Antipolo City 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop made the motions approved by committee chair and Abang Lingkod party-list Rep. Joseph Stephen Paduano after these were seconded. According to Flores, the reason Balindong and his colleagues stated that the parliament is already conducting an inquiry cannot be cited because the House has its own prerogative as the countrys legislative branch to start an investigation. It does not take away the prerogative of the House to conduct its own inquiry, Flores said. Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong said that BARMM funds are bloc grants or subsidies from the national government therefore, these were allocated by Congress as part of the General Appropriations Act. The power of Congress to allocate funds goes with it the authority to monitor the use of those funds, he said. Adiong was the one who delivered a privileged speech last January 27 about the issues hounding the BARMM, including reports where 400 barangay officials in his province supposedly received huge sums of money through their Land Bank of the Philippines accounts. Initially, Adiong said that around P100 million was supposedly released to local officials. More than 400 barangay officials of Lanao del Sur woke up with their LBP accounts containing money, ranging from P500,000 to as much as P2.5 million. Later, officers from BARMM OCM told them to withdraw a big chunk of the money and just leave P200,000 behind, Adiong said in his speech. Adiong said the money was supposedly earmarked for what they called special operations which local officials have failed to explain. This is a grave and urgent matter that threatens the core principles of good governance, accountability, and the sacred trust placed in us by the people of the BARMM, Adiong added. According to Adiong, around P6.3 billion was allocated to the BARMMs local government support fund . However, he believes that documents referring to the Bangsamoro Budget Circular 10 , and the Department of Budget and Management Local Budget Circular 155 were not followed. But eventually, at the hearing, Hedjarah Mangompia-Said of the BARMM Commission on Audit office informed the committee after Basilan Rep. Mujiv Hatamans questioning that the regional government had already released a total of P6.4 billion in LGSF funds over a six-month period, or from August 2024 up to January 2025.

Marcos told: Call special Congress session to start Duterte impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. should now call for a special congressional session so that the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte can start, Makabayan bloc lawmakers said on Monday. In a joint statement, ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro, Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, and Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel said the special session would allow the Senate to convene as an impeachment court and move with the proceedings even if on break. According to the three lawmakers, the Duterte camps legal maneuvers filing petitions before the Supreme Court requesting a halt to the impeachment process should already prompt Marcos to call for a special session. We, the Makabayan bloc representatives, strongly urge President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to immediately call for a special session of Congress to enable the Senate to convene as an impeachment court for Vice President Sara Dutertes trial, they said. The legal maneuvers being employed by the Duterte camp to delay and derail the impeachment process make this call even more urgent. We cannot allow narrow political interests and electoral considerations to obstruct justice and constitutional processes, they added. They also noted that if Marcos is open to a special session, he should no longer wait for a call from either Senate President Francis Escudero or House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez. The people demand accountability now, Makabayan said in Filipino. The continuous delay to the impeachment trial is bothersome. Each day that passes is another day delaying justice for the people, they added. The House impeached Duterte last February 5 after 215 lawmakers signed and endorsed the fourth impeachment complaint against her. The petition was immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the petition was not forwarded to the Senate plenary before its session ended on February 5, which meant that Congress would have to reconvene first after the elections or through a special session to discuss the impeachment. In a press briefing a day after Duterte was impeached, Marcos said he would only call for a special session if the Senate requested it. READ: Marcos: Will callspecial session if asked by Senate Escudero, on the other hand, has been adamant that Dutertes fate would be decided by the 20th Congress. According to him, the earliest trial could be held in June when the 19th Congress resumes its session and after the 2025 midterm elections. READ: Escudero: Next Congress to decide on VP Sara Dutertes impeachment READ: No Senate trial of VP Duterte before June Escudero There are conflicting opinions on whether it is proper for the current Senate to start the impeachment trial when the 2025 midterm elections will surely change the composition of the higher legislative chamber. Former Sen. Panfilo Ping Lacson, however, believes there would be no issue if the impeachment trial would starts within the 19th Congress and crosses over to the 20th Congress based on the same principle used by the judiciary, under which the jurisdiction of a court would not change despite the resignation or retirement of a sitting justice. Two petitions seeking to stop the impeachment trial were filed before the Supreme Court last Tuesday. Initially, it was announced that Mindanao-based lawyers asked the SC to stop the impeachment trial since the House supposedly did not observe the Constitutions rules, which require it to act on filed impeachment complaints within 10 session days. On Wednesday, it was revealed that Duterte herself, represented by allied lawyers including her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, also asked the SC last Tuesday to stop the impeachment proceedings. Dutertes petition was hinged on a supposed violation of constitutional provisions stating that only one impeachment complaint would be initiated against a sitting official per year.

Father-faker? Solon hits ex-President Duterte for fake news,"MANILA, Philippines A lawmaker has tagged former President Rodrigo Duterte a father-faker for his alleged insistence on using misinformation and disinformation to propel his Senate slates campaign. In a press briefing on Monday, Deputy Majority Leader Paolo Ortega said that he was inclined to believe Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamins statements on Duterte being a one-man fake news factory. Bersamin said this after Duterte claimed that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was veering toward dictatorship. Parang talagang, parang literally factory ng fake news kumbaga, tapos pag hinold sila accountable ng tao kakambyo naman sila na joke-joke lang daw yon. Parang nagmumukha tuloy sila ang joke eh, Ortega told reporters He really seems to be a factory of fake news, and when you hold him accountable, he will shift gears and say that its a joke. But he is the one appearing like a joke, Ortega replied in Filipino to reporters at the Batasang Pambansa complex when asked about Bersamins statements. So I dont know how we would call him. Father-faker? Father of fake news? Mother-faker? I dont know if we can call it father-faker, mother-faker. So what do you call the children, fakerist? But thats how they appear, just like supervillains, he added. Ortega believes the spread of misinformation and disinformation will intensify during the 2025 midterm election season, as most of the candidates backed by the former president are not faring well in the surveys. According to the lawmaker, the candidates would try to latch on to President Marcos so that they could grab some airtime. It would be better, Ortega said, if the candidates endorsed by Duterte would just present their platforms, which was what the people would want and need to know. Im sure it will intensify during the campaign because the contenders from their group are just one or two candidates. So the others would just launch tirades against the president, the House of Representatives. They rank 50th, 40th. They are just riding on the presidents fame, trying to destroy him, but they dont rank in the surveys, he said. Plataporma kaya ilatag nila? At hindi paninira, tingnan natin, baka umangat nang kaunti sa survey, mas maganda. Kasi ang tao, nagahanap ng resulta yan, nagahanap ng magandang plataporma yan. Kahit naman saang lugar, sa probinsya, sa school government, kailangan ang ilalatag mo plataporma hindi yong nandyan ka lang tuwing kampanya, he added. Dutertes candidates, running under the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino banner, are facing an uphill battle.

BIR destroys P2.1B worth of illicit cigarettes in Pampanga,"PORAC, Pampanga The Bureau of Internal Revenue on Monday destroyed about P2.1 billion worth of illicit cigarettes and several cigarette-making machines at a waste management facility in this town.. BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. led the incineration and shredding of the confiscated cigarettes, which had been seized from various parts of Luzon since 2023. In an interview, Lumagui said a significant portion of the illicit cigarettes stored at the warehouses of Digama Waste Management Services OPC came from the Caloocan Revenue Region 5, which covers Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, Valenzuela, and Bulacan. We are first, destroying the cigarettes confiscated during our raid in Bulacan and Valenzuela late last year, he said. About 13.5 million packs of various brands of illicit cigarettes stored at the facility would be destroyed within a week, the Inquirer learned. Digama president Robert Gaza said their newly acquired incinerator is more efficient than the companys shredding machines, as it could reduce each rim or pack of cigarettes to ash more quickly. The BIR has designated Digama as its primary destruction hub in Luzon. From Feb. 24 to 28, all nine revenue regions of the BIR across the country would simultaneously destroy the illicit cigarettes confiscated within their jurisdictions, Lumagui said. Through these coordinated efforts, the BIR aims to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring that illegally manufactured and sold cigarettes would not re-enter the market. We want to show that our campaign against illicit cigarettes is a complete processfrom raid and confiscation to the filing of charges and now the destruction of the seized productsto dispel any doubts about where the confiscated cigarettes end up, Lumagui said. He assured the public that all illicit cigarettes in BIRs possession nationwide would be destroyed by February 28, with BIR personnel stationed 24/7 at waste management centers to oversee the destruction process. Representatives from the Commission on Audit were present during the destruction activity. The government estimates that it has lost about P6.4 billion in potential tax revenue from the illicit cigarettes seized since 2023. In a statement distributed to the media on Monday, the BIR said the destruction of illicit cigarettes not only prevents tax losses but also addresses the serious public health risks posed by cigarettes from unknown sources. The agency also confirmed that multiple criminal cases had been filed against individuals and corporations involved in the illegal trade, including Chinese nationals. The destruction of illicit goods is a crucial step in maintaining the integrity of our revenue collection, protecting public health, and safeguarding the interests of legitimate businesses that properly declare and pay the correct taxes, the statement read. At least 20 units of cigarette-making machines were also destroyed by a backhoe at the Digama compound during Mondays operation. INQ Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

How can Marcos be a dictator when he isnt even vindictive? Adiong,"MANILA, Philippines The claim that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is veering toward dictatorship is far from reality since the chief executive has not been vindictive despite uncalled-for attacks, a lawmaker from the House of Representatives said on Monday. Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong in a press briefing at the Batasang Pambansa complex said that he could not see any characteristics of a dictator in Marcos because he had been diplomatic even if the attacks against him involved his relatives. Adiong was referring to Vice President Sara Dutertes threats to kill Marcos, first lady Liza Araneta Marcos, and House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez last November 2024, and her warning that he will dig up the body of the presidents father, former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Are you a dictator if you get badmouthed; your fathers remains threatened to be exhumed and thrown into the West Philippine Sea; your life, your wife, and the House speaker who is your cousin are threatened? Then he did not do anything directly? He has all the power at his disposal and yet he is doing nothing, Adiong said in a mix of Filipino and English. In fact, his responses have been so diplomatic. Is that the characteristic of a dictator? I dont think so Hes not even vindictive, he added. It was Dutertes father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who recently claimed that Marcos was veering toward dictatorship. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin then downplayed the older Dutertes statements, saying that the ex-leader is a one-man fake news factory. According to Adiong, no elected official or sitting Supreme Court justice was arrested nor removed from office during Marcos time in an apparent shade to the fate of former Sen. Leila de Lima and former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. De Lima faced different drug-related charges and was detained for almost seven years, only for her to be acquitted in all cases. Meanwhile, Sereno was removed through a quo warranto petition filed by former Solicitor General Jose Calida. No one during his administration, like a chief justice, was removed through a quo warranto petition. No sitting senator was charged and detained. So theres no indication to me this administration is nearing the middle of its term there is no indication saying that hes a dictator, Adiong said. Adiong also noted that Marcos refrained from ordering the Senate to convene a special session even if that would mean that the impeachment trial of Vice President Duterte would push through.

Aquino Museum in Tarlac reopens ahead of 39th Edsa anniversary,"TARLAC, Philippines The Aquino Center and Museum in San Miguel, Tarlac reopened on Monday, February 24, ahead for the 39th anniversary of the Edsa People Power Revolution . The museum will be open to visitors from 1 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., according to the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation . It added that the museum honors the legacy of the late Senator Benigno Ninoy Aquino Jr., former President Corazon Cory Aquino, and their son, former President Benigno Noynoy Aquino III. Renovated in 2023, the museum now includes an updated section on the 1987 Constitution, an expanded exhibit on Cory Aquinos post-presidency years, and a new wing dedicated to Noynoy Aquinos life and presidency. NCAF President Rapa Lopa, in his welcome remarks, highlighted a newly discovered photograph of Cory Aquino during the Edsa People Power Revolution. Critics have often claimed that she [Cory Aquino] was never physically present during those tense days at Edsa. To dispel such rumors, she often said she wished she had a picture of herself addressing the crowds here in the POEA building at the corner of Edsa and Ortigas Avenue, Lopa said. As it turns out, we had one all along. It was in our archives, and today we are happy to share that this photo, captured by a foreign newspaper, is now part of this new exhibit, he added. Lopa also emphasized the importance of remembering history and preserving the legacy of those who fought for the countrys democracy. Today we choose to reconnect with our history, to tie together the stories of those who came before us with the work we continue today, he said. In a time when truth is undermined and history is repeated, we felt the need to enshrine the legacies of those who selflessly dedicated their lives to restoring freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and good governance, he added. The NCAF president likewise highlighted the Aquino legacy, expressing hope that it would inspire others to commit to advancing a more meaningful and relevant democracy for the people.

We have registered four deaths, Governor Angelina Tan, a medical doctor, said during a live stream interview on Facebook conducted Tuesday by her public information officer. She did not provide further details. READ: DOH launches Alas-Kwatro Kontra Mosquito anti-dengue drive Dr. Kristin Mae-Jean Villaseor, chief of the Quezon Provincial Health Office, told the Inquirer that the fatalities were two residents of Tiaong town and one each from Sariaya and Infanta towns.

However, she noted that most patients from January to February 20 were between 1 and 10 years old. Dengue is transmitted through the bite of a female Aedes aegypti mosquito. The infection causes a severe flu-like illness, often accompanied by a sharp drop in platelet count. Symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, severe headache, intense pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, rash, easy bruising, and bleeding from the nose or gums. Tan reminded the public that dengue poses a year-round threat, with cases peaking during the rainy season.

"Trillanes submits more evidence vs Rep.

Paolo Pulong Duterte and several others in connection with the P6.4 billion shabu haul in a warehouse in Valenzuela City. Submitted before the Department of Justice is documentary evidence offered by the prosecution before the Manila Regional Trial Court that convicted a customs broker and others for the 2017 drug haul. Also submitted are the affidavits of the same Customs broker and a Customs Intelligence Officer. The purpose of the introduction as documentary and testimonial evidence is to prove the conspiracy among the respondents in the complaint affidavit, read the supplemental complaint. Aside from Rep. Duterte, also named in the complaint are Maneses Mans Carpio, the husband of Vice President Sara Duterte, former Bureau of Customs director Nicanor Faeldon and seven others. On the other hand, the testimony of the Customs intelligence officer would confirm the existence of the Davao Group, which is allegedly involved in drug smuggling. In 2018, however, the Office of the Ombudsmans special fact-finding panel already cleared Duterte and Carpio of any criminal and administrative liabilities in connection with the drug shipment. Trillanes anchored his complaint on the Senate investigation conducted by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee then headed by Senator Richard Gordon in 2017, which recommended the filing of criminal charges against several individuals.

"NBI arrests 2 Chinese, 3 others for spying","MANILA, Philippines The National Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday said it arrested five individuals, including two Chinese nationals for alleged espionage activities in Manila. The NBI identified the suspects as Ni Qinhui, his wife Zheng Wei, as well as a certain Omar Khan Kashim Joveres, Leo Laraya Panti and Mark Angelo Boholst Binza. Based on information provided by the NBI, the five suspects were arrested after its Cybercrime Division and Special Task Force were alerted of vehicles reportedly utilizing International Mobile Subscriber Identity catchers while frequenting military and police camps, essential facilities as well government assets within Metro Manila on Feb. 14. After verifying the information, CCD and STF agents detected unlicensed BTS, unauthorized transmissions, and interference sources. BTS refers to unauthorized or malicious base stations that pose as cellular towers to intercept, manipulate, or disrupt mobile networks, often for surveillance, data theft, or network disruption. With the findings, the NBI immediately conducted interdiction operations on Feb. 20, which led to the arrest of Joveres, Panti and Binza. The three said they were commissioned by Ni, and were instructed to drive through key areas, including Villamor Airbase, Camp Aguinaldo, Malacaang, Camp Crame, and the U.S. Embassy, among others, in exchange for P2,500 to P3,000 daily for a month. NBI agents then proceeded to Nis condominium unit in Malate, Manila where he was arrested together with his wife. Zheng admitted that Ni had several IMSI catchers in their condo unit and that he did employ the three other suspects.

"Escudero told: Impeachment is constitutional duty, not cheering contest","MANILA, Philippines Acting on impeachment complaints is a constitutional duty and not a cheering contest, House Deputy Minority Leader and ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro said on Thursday in response to Senate President Francis Escuderos recent remarks on impeachment. Escudero questioned the supposed clamor to expedite the Senates role in the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte. READ: What clamor? Escudero asks amid calls to start trial forthwith Senate President Escudero misses the point entirely when he asks, What clamor? This is not a cheering contest but a matter of constitutional duty, Castro said in a statement. Impeachment is not a cheering contest. It is their constitutional duty, and it would be a disservice to the people whom we ought to serve, she added. Castro also stressed the urgency of convening the impeachment court since Duterte has taken legal steps to nullify the impeachment complaint against her. READ: VP Sara Duterte files petition at SC to stop impeachment moves against her The Senate should all the more fulfill this duty. Further delays might benefit the impeached Vice President, who is exploring various legal remedies to halt the trial, she said. Castro underscored that the Senates constitutional responsibility should not be influenced by public opinion or political timing. The Constitution sets forth clear procedures for impeachment trials. This is not a matter of whether there is sufficient clamor; it is about fulfilling our duties as public servants in accordance with the law, Castro said. On Wednesday, Escudero reiterated that the impeachment trial of Duterte would begin after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s fourth State of the Nation Address in July. Most likely when the new Congress already enters into its functions after Sona. Sona, I think, is on July 21. So [the] trial will commence after that day, he said.

Sotto: Current senators told me they can start impeachment trial now,"MANILA, Philippines Several incumbent senators are of the belief that they can start the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte during the 19th Congress, former Senate president Vicente Sotto III said on Thursday. Sotto said this during the press briefing for Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas senatorial candidates in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, when asked about Senate President Francis Escuderos statements that the trial would likely begin during the 20th Congress. Sotto asked the reporter if that was the opinion of the entire Senate or just Escudero, as some sitting senators told him otherwise. Of course, its a constitutional mandate and therefore it is serious. For us to consider it, in the 20th Congress, if we make it there, definitely we need to be prepared, as we have prepared in the past. But are you sure that it will be the 20th Congress, because they can take it up now if they want, Sotto said. Is that what the senators said or just the Senate President? Sotto asked, when the reporter replied that Escudero prefers having the trial by the 20th Congress. Kasi nakakausap ko yong ibang mga senador, hindi ganon ang sinasabi eh [] Pwede raw eh, pwede raw i-take up . Sotto reiterated his belief that the Senate should have referred the articles of impeachment to the plenary when they received it last February 5, instead of adjourning the session without tackling it. This way, the Senate committees could have discussed the issue even while the session is on a break. Its a pity because I think if they referred it to the body during the time that they received the transmittal, they could have conducted hearings by the committee on rules during the break, and they could have convened if they wanted to by June 2, or even before if they convened themselves as an impeachment court, he said. The former Senate head also believes it would not hinder the campaign plans of some senators seeking reelection, as having the impeachment televised nationwide is better campaign material. Sotto said this is his opinion, but it is shared by some senators whom he believes should be interviewed also. Of course this is my opinion, definitely different from the opinion of others. So yon kasing narinig ko na sabi nong iba kasi the seven senators are reelectionists and they will be campaigning. What better campaign it to be in television everyday, in the impeachment court? Walang tatalo don, parang telenovela yon, panonoorin ng buong Pilipinas yon eh, Sotto said. So yong thinking na ano raw eh, kasi daw Mindanao will be . Bakit, no ba boto nila? O yes ba boto nila? Boboto sila after election na eh, so anong problema sa Mindanao, di ba? But they are exercising their constitutional mandate. As I said thats my opinion, but that is the opinion of other senators also. So I think they should be interviewed also, he added. Escudero, from the time that the House of Representatives transmitted the articles of impeachment, has been adamant that Dutertes fate will be decided by the 20th Congress. According to the incumbent Senate President, the earliest that the trial could be held is by June, when the 19th Congress resumes its session, or after the 2025 midterm elections. READ: No Senate trial of VP Duterte before June Escudero Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5, 2025 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as under the 1987 Constitution, a trial should start forthwith if at least one-thirds of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the articles of impeachment were not sent to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5 which meant that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season or through a special session to discuss the impeachment. There were also questions whether it is proper for the Senate in the 19th Congress to start the trial when the 2025 midterms elections would surely change the composition in the legislative chamber.For the House, it is also being quizzed if it is correct to appoint prosecutors as the lawmakers would have to get reelected first if trial crosses to the 20th Congress. On Wednesday though, former senator Panfilo Ping Lacson believes there is no issue if the impeachment trial starts within the 19th Congress and crosses over to the 20th Congress, based on the same principle used by the judiciary in hearing cases.

Gerville Luistro on Friday rejected Senate President Francis Escuderos remarks that there appears no widespread clamor to begin the upper chambers trial of impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte at once. Escudero on Wednesday said he doesnt think that three position papers and a Supreme Court case constitute a clamor for the Senate to begin its trial forthwith or before the congressional session on June 2. READ: What clamor? Escudero asks amid calls to start trial forthwith With all due respect to the Senate President, we were at the ground. The House members are on the ground. I myself, and even the other congressmen, can attest that a lot of people in our districts are waiting for the Senate to convene as an impeachment court, Luistro said in a TV interview.

Meanwhile, Luistro also addressed allegations that the House lawmakersdeliberately delayed the transmission of the Articles of Impeachment in the Senate. Luistro said: We did not delay. We have to understand that Congress is a collegial body. I cannot decide alone. The Good Government Committee cannot decide alone. This is a collegial body that needs a collegial decision. There are 306 members in the House. As a general rule, we need the majority. And for the purpose of the impeachment case, we need at least one-third, she added.

"Bogus indigenous leader, 20 others nabbed for usurpation of authority","MANILA, Philippines The Criminal Investigation and Detection Group arrested Federal Tribal Group of the Philippines leaders Jorgeto Corpuz Santisas, also known as Datu Adlaw, and Lourdes Latraca Infante for usurpation of authority in Surigao del Norte.

The warrant was implemented on Thursday at 6 a.m. We are now conducting [an] investigation on the legality of the FTGP. Manhunt operations to the other remaining subjects of the warrant of arrest is ongoing, CIDG Director Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III said in a statement. This successful operation reinforces CIDGs commitment to ensuring that individuals who exploit and usurp government authority will be held accountable, Torre said. Police last January filed charges against Santisas, Infante and fellow FTGP leader Jhavie Latraca Infante for usurpation of authority, alarm and scandal, cyber libel, grave coercion, grave threats, malicious mischief, physical injury, serious illegal detention, and other violations of the Cybercrime Prevention Act.

The NCIP said, [FTGPs] main goal is to solicit funds and favors for their personal gain under the guise of a legitimate IPO. The FTGP, in setting up checkpoints and claiming authority over certain areas, is usurping the functions of legitimate government agencies, obstructing justice, and causing alarm and scandal, it added.

Modern post-harvest facilities needed to sustain tamban production,"MANILA, Philippines The government has to equip municipalities with modern post-harvest facilities for the fishing industrylike cold storage facilitiesto ensure that production of tamban and other aqua products are sustained, Bicol Saro party-list Rep. Brian Raymund Yamsuan said on Wednesday. Yamsuan in a statement explained that having a sustained production of tamban would allow the exportation of this fish to the global market, especially since tamban has been included in the Codex Alimentarius Commission or Codex, an international food standards for fish and fishery products. This, Yamsuan said, would yield a positive impact on the livelihood of small-scale fisherfolk. READ: DA: Local fish Tamban can now be exported Post harvest facilities, which are sorely lacking in the fisheries sector, are necessary to prepare for these export opportunities, along with helping small-scale fisherfolk raise their incomes, and create more jobs along the sardine industrys supply chain, Yamsuan said. The lawmaker thanked the Department of Agriculture and its attached agencies for lobbying for tambans inclusion in the Codex. In a statement on Tuesday, the DA said that tamban or Herring fish can now be exported after it was deemed part of the Codex. According to the DA, the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization established the CAC to set global food safety standards to protect consumers and ensure fair trade practices. DA also said that the tambans inclusion in the Codex came after six years of advocacy and technical discussions through the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute . We acknowledge and thank the efforts of the Department of Agriculture, through the [BFAR] and the [NFRDI], in lobbying for the inclusion of tamban in the Codex. This is certainly welcome news for our artisanal fisherfolk, Yamsuan said. The next step is to ensure that tamban and other locally grown and caught fish remain competitive products in the export market by providing our fisherfolk with adequate facilities and equipment to preserve the quality of their catch, which, in turn, would allow them to sell these at higher prices, he added. According to Yamsuan, he expects the government to maximize the inclusion of tamban in the Codex by providing modern facilities for drying, canning and bottling the fish variety as a sardine product. Adding value to their catch by providing them adequate post-harvest facilities is a key factor in helping our small fisherfolk rise above poverty, along with providing support in accessing markets and training them on ensuring the sustainability of our marine resources, he said.

Escudero thinks peers did not feel threatened by Dutertes kill remark,"MANILA, PhilippinesSenate President Francis Chiz Escudero thinks none of his colleagues felt threatened by former President Rodrigo Dutertes joke about killing 15 senators to create vacancies in the Senate.

PCG spokesperson for the WPS Commodore Jay Tarriela pointed out that the 12-seater Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources aircraft was carrying PCG personnel and media members when the Chinese Navys chopper came so close.

Dengue cases in Eastern Visayas decline,"TACLOBAN CITY Unlike other regions in the country, Eastern Visayas has recorded a decline in dengue cases this year compared to the same period in 2024. From Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, 2025, the region logged 812 dengue cases, lower than the 1,141 cases recorded during the same period last year, according to the Department of Health . Jelyn Malibago, regional information officer of DOH-Eastern Visayas, attributed the decline in cases to the sustained implementation of dengue prevention measures. Compared to other regions, we are not seeing an increase in dengue cases here. Our systems remain in place, including active surveillance mechanisms, health promotion initiatives, regular program updates and monitoring for local government units, and the provision of technical assistance, Malibago said in an online interview on Wednesday. Despite the decrease in cases, the DOH continues to urge the public to intensify the implementation of its programs to prevent the spread of dengue. This includes destroying mosquito breeding sites by eliminating stagnant water where mosquito larvae may thrive; seeking early consultation if experiencing sudden high fever for two days and other dengue symptoms; using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved, light-colored clothing and long pants; and supporting fogging activities in communities when a dengue outbreak is imminent. Health facilities are also encouraged to ensure the availability of dengue fast lanes, sufficient healthcare providers, and adequate medicines and supplies to guarantee prompt medical attention for patients.

CIDG chief probably sees teacher 2020 case same with Duterte threat,"MANILA, Philippines The police general who filed inciting to sedition raps against former president Rodrigo Duterte, over his alleged threat to kill 15 sitting senators, may have seen similarities in the circumstances faced by a teacher who set up a fake bounty for Dutertes head in 2020. Former Sen. Panfilo Lacson, during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum on Wednesday, said this might be the reason why Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III, chief of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group of the Philippine National Police , filed the complaint before the Department of Justice . Lacson was referring to the case of Ronnel Mas, a 29-year-old social studies teacher who in 2020 made a tweet about giving a P50-million reward to anyone who kills Duterte. Mas was arrested by National Bureau of Investigation agents in May 2020. Nag-file na yong CIDG and kung makaka-abot sa korte . But I remember one time, during the time of the former president Duterte, merong isang tao na inaresto rin dahil sinabi niya papatayin niya si president Duterte. So hinuli ng pulis, nagmamaka-awa, parang nagkaroonng warrant of arrest yon eh, Lacson said. has filed a case and lets see if it will reach the courts. But I remember one time, during the time of the former president Duterte, there was an individual who was arrested because he said that he will have president Duterte killed. He was arrested, he pleaded, I think it was because an arrest order was issued.) So doon ko pwedeng i-relate, i-connect, baka meron ding sense si General Torre, baka yon ang reference niya. But again, it is up to, first, the DOJ to decide kung merong probable cause; and up to the court to decide kung meron talagang case, he added. Last February 13, at the proclamation rally of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino Senate slate for the 2025 midterm elections, Duterte joked about killing 15 senators to make room for their candidates. Now, theres many of them. What should we do? Lets kill the senators now to create vacancies, he said in Filipino, eliciting laughter from the audience. Several of the former presidents critics have already called him out for the remarks, with ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro saying that murder and terrorism are not joking matters. Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel who used to be a key Duterte ally during the 17th Congress meanwhile noted that mentioning death and killing at any given chance may be a worrying sign of a serious personality disorder.

Samar town tagged as model for low fish harvest losses,"TACLOBAN CITY The coastal town of Daram, Samar has been identified as the countrys model for the reduction of post-harvest losses, with a P249.8 million investment meant to enhance economic opportunities for coastal communities. Oceana Philippines Vice President Gloria Estenzo Ramos said the town has been selected by their campaign as a model for sustainable fishing with the strong support of the local government and the drafting of comprehensive plans. Daram has the longest coastline and largest municipal waters in the Samar Sea and is heavily reliant on fishing, Ramos said in an interview Tuesday. However, its fisherfolk face significant challenges, including the lack of proper storage facilities, market instability, and the impacts of climate change on fish supply and livelihood sustainability. Oceanas 2024 study in Samar revealed that up to 40 percent of fish catch is lost due to spoilage, damage, and lack of processing facilities. The study noted that the fish trading system in Daram contributes significantly to these losses, as many catches are sold at sea, leading to unrecorded landings and price instability. Its alarming that almost half of the fish catch is lost before they are landed or rots before they are sold, Ramossaid. When we address this, imagine how much of a positive difference this will make for coastal communities and the lives of poor families, she added. Oceana Philippines campaign and research director Rhea Yray-Frossard said the local government and fisherfolk came up with a five-year plan with the assistance of Oceana and experts from national government agencies. The plans goal is to reduce post-harvest losses from 40 percent to 10 percent. The P249.8 million budget requirement phased across three main and six auxiliary villages with 10 associations, focuses on infrastructure and access road development, equipment acquisition, skills training, and values formation. The budget will come from various government agencies willing to assist local governments with plans ready for implementation. The local plan in Daram supports President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s Philippine Development Plan to manage harvest waste, Frossard told reporters. The project aims to prevent loss of essential fish nutrients and wastage of fish catch during peak seasons by establishing facilities that support proper handling, processing, and storage, she noted. The campaign will benefit some 9,293 residents in 10 coastal villages of Daram town. In a statement, Vice Mayor Lucia Astorga acknowledged that while Daram has vast marine resources, the absence of cold storage, drying facilities, and organized market access often leads to fish wastage. The official noted that the seasonality of sardines causes drastic price fluctuations, resulting in fisherfolk discarding excess fish during peak seasons due to a lack of buyers.

Jaros historic municipio gets new life as NCCAs cultural hub,"ILOILO CITY A piece of Iloilos rich history is stepping into a new era. The Old Jaro Municipal Hall, an iconic art-deco structure designed by Juan Arellano, has officially been turned over to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts , marking Iloilo as the first city in the country to host its own NCCA regional and cultural hub. During the signing of the deed of usufruct at Iloilo City Hall on Feb. 13, Mayor Jerry Treas emphasized the significance of the turnover, calling the building one of the jewels of Iloilo City. Treas emphasized the buildings historical and cultural importance, expressing confidence in the NCCAs ability to maximize its potential. The Jaro Municipio is one of the jewels of Iloilo City. Iloilo has so many jewels. This is one of the best that we could offer. We hope the Jaro Municipio will really be put to good use, Treas said. Signatories included Treas, NCCA Chairperson Victorino Mapa Manalo, NCCA Executive Director Erick Zerrudo, and Iloilo City Vice Mayor Jeffrey Ganzon. The NCCA plans to transform the 90-year-old heritage site into a center for archiving, heritage conservation, and other initiatives that will enhance Iloilos standing as a cultural powerhouse. The 90-year-old art deco structure has long been a symbol of Iloilos rich heritage. In 2014, it was donated to the National Museum of the Philippines for restoration, leading to a P20 million renovation project. The restored hall reopened in 2017 as an NMP satellite office for Western Visayas. On Feb. 17, 2017, it was officially recognized as an Important Cultural Property, further cementing its historical value. At present, under the NCCA, the site is expected to take on a bigger role in heritage conservation and cultural development. Manalo commended Iloilo City for its progressive approach to cultural mapping, urban heritage conservation, and underground cabling efforts, calling it a model for other cities in the country. To further strengthen local cultural initiatives, the NCCA also signed a memorandum of agreement with the Iloilo Festivals Foundation Inc. , a key player in Iloilos vibrant festival scene. Zerrudo highlighted IFFIs proven track record in managing cultural programming, noting that the organization would receive a grant to fund arts and heritage conservation projects. Weve seen the performance of this organization and I think they will be able not just to deliver but translate the services of NCCA in Iloilo and even for the whole region, Zerrudo said. IFFI President Allan Ryan Tan, who also signed the agreement, stressed the partnerships importance in sustaining and innovating local festivals, as Iloilo continues its push to be recognized as the festival capital of the country.

"Alyansa bets: Support for Duterte, Marcos are two different things","MANILA, Philippines Supporting former President Rodrigo Duterte and incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. should be taken as two different things, several Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas senatorial candidates said on Tuesday. In different ambush interviews after the press briefing in Pasay City, Senator Francis Tolentino, Deputy Speaker Camille Villar, former Senate president Vicente Sotto III, and former senator Manny Pacquiao were asked about how they manage Marcos positioning in contrast to how they were linked to Duterte. During the first three campaign sorties of the Alyansa, Marcos described their candidates as not being involved in bloody drug war, the proliferation of Philippine offshore gaming operators , and Chinas abuse of fisherfolk in the West Philippine Seaissues hurled at the Duterte administration. READ: Marcos: Vote 12-0 for Alyansa if you dont want PHs bloody past According to Sotto and Tolentino, support for Duterte and Marcos can be considered as two different things. Well, thats Ano yan, eh, those are two issues, eh. Kasi, kung may kaibigan ka dati, kaibigan mo naman, hanggang ngayon naman kaibigan mo naman, eh. Kaya lang ikaw ay kinukuha para makatulong, para makatulong sa bansa, hindi naman para sa kung sinong pulitiko, I dont see anything wrong, Sotto said. . These are two issues. Because for example, if you have a friend before, up to now he is still your friend. So when you are called to help, help the country and not just any politician, I dont see anything wrong.) Why? You think, ano, na dapat eh ika nga may dividing line between the old administration and now? Weve been together before, weve been friends before. President Marcos, when President Marcos was senator, we worked together for six years. Weve known each other. And we were tapped to join the slate, he added. Tolentino said that what the President says in his speeches is that the Alyansa bets are supportive of his policies. There has to be a demarcation line, a dichotomy between when the last presidency stopped, and when the succeeding presidency started. So these are two administrations, so if youre looking at continuity iba yon. If youre looking at different policies, siguro yon yon, Tolentino said. So what the incumbent President is saying is that the alliances state is supportive of the current Presidents policies. Plain as you call, yong sinabi niya, yong China, yong sa Pogo , he added. Marcos started throwing jabs at Duterte at the proclamation rally in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte, when he said that the Alyansa candidates are not tainted by Oplan Tokhang, or the past administrations anti-drug campaign. Tignan niyo po ang record ng ating mga kandidato: Wala sa kanila ang may bahid ng dugo dahil sa tokhang, Marcos said. Wala sa kanila ang kasabwat sa pagbulsa ng sako-sakong pera, pinagsamantalahan ang krisis ng pandemya, pinabayaan ang ating mga kababayan na magkasakit at mamatay.

Pacquiao said that he does not understand why people should not support the Marcos administration when it has good programs for the pooradding that the country should deviate from overly criticizing elected officials. Maganda yong programa naman ang Alyansa, anong masama doon na magbigay ng trabaho, sustainable livelihood sa mga pamilya, napakaganda non ah?

The Kaagapay Donations Portal integrates advanced functionalities that ensure real-time donations facilitation, DSWD Spokesperson Irene Dumlao said. Through the portal, donors will have the option to choose if they want to donate through online payment gateways or via logistics partners to personally deliver their in-kind donations to our CRCFs, she added. Meanwhile, the digital platform which would serve as the DSWDs virtual one stop shop for all regulatory services was also launched with the name Harmonized Electronic License and Permit System or Helps. The said system allows DSWDs clients to access its regulatory services anytime and anywhere, including making the certification for the registration, license to operate, and accreditation of social welfare and development agencies , peoples organizations and other civil society organizations much faster. According to Dumlao, the manual process of applying for registration used to take three to six months with multiple walk-in transactions in DSWD offices, but with the Helps online portal, clients can file their applications for RLAs in only 20 minutes and receive their certificates as fast as 14 days. Through the digital application system, the processing of the CRLA will be streamlined from 43 days to just 7 days for registration and licensing and 7 days for accreditation or 14 days in total, Dumlao said. We also trimmed the client steps from 49 to just 12 steps. The documentary requirements were also simplified from 50 to just 11 documents, she added. The DSWD in the same event also unveiled its new online system which would streamline the application and issuance of travel clearances for minors traveling abroad by allowing applicants to complete the process from home without visiting DSWD offices. According to Dumlao, the new online system is seen to reduce the processing time for applications with complete, verified, and authentic documents to just one to three days, along with a real-time status tracking. However, despite the shift to an online system, Dumlao assured that the documents will still undergo human verification, particularly, by concerned Central Office personnel; and that only QR-coded or notarized documents will be accepted to ensure the documents validity and authenticity.

74 ex-rebels from Samar get P3.4M in financial aid,"TACLOBAN CITY The provincial government of Samar, through its Local Social Integration Program , distributed P3.4 million in financial assistance to 74 former members of the New Peoples Army as part of its efforts to promote peace and development in the province. The LSIP is a provincial initiative that provides cash assistance and reintegration services to former members of communist terrorist groups, helping them transition to a peaceful and productive life.

I would like to thank everyone for your decision to reintegrate into society and cooperate with the government, she said. Tan also emphasized the role of infrastructure projects in addressing the root causes of insurgency. Just the other day, the three provinces of Samar Island met to finalize plans for the tri-boundary road projects. These roads are a testament to our commitment to ensuring just and lasting peace, Tan said. The governor was referring to a meeting with Northern Samar Gov. Edwin Ongchuan and Eastern Samar Gov. Ben Evardone on Tuesday, Feb. 11 where they agreed to construct roads and bridges connecting the three Samar provinces. By improving infrastructure, particularly in remote and conflict-affected areas, the government aims to weaken and ultimately eradicate the insurgency that has plagued Samar Island for decades. Authorities continue to encourage active members of communist terrorist groups to surrender and avail themselves of the reintegration benefits, reinforcing efforts to establish long-term peace and development in the region. Meanwhile, 19 former NPA members surrendered before the 20th Infantry Battalion camp in Barangay San Jorge, Las Navas on Feb. 13 to avail of the national amnesty program. Lt. Col.

At the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas press conference on Tuesday, Tulfo was asked to comment on the disqualification case filed against him, his brother Ben, and three other members of the Tulfo clan on the grounds of political dynasty. Tulfo said he was only made aware of the case by his barber because he did not receive a note nor a subpoena from the Commission on Elections.

Tama naman daw po yung sinabi ni Tatang na sinacite raw po ang Article 2 Section 26 ng Constitution na ang sinasabi raw po ay prohibits political dynasty, said Tulfo.

"Petition to stop VP impeach trial moot, says House secretary","MANILA, Philippines A petition to stop the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte due to inaction on the past three complaints can be considered moot already, House of Representatives Secretary General Reginald Velasco said on Tuesday. In a message to reporters, Velasco said that the three complaints have been archived already, after the fourth impeachment complaint was filed, endorsed, and verified by 215 lawmakers last February 5. Velasco was responding to lawyer Israelito Torreonone of the petitioners before the Supreme Courtwho said that the House did not observe the 1987 Constitutions rules on acting on impeachment complaints within 10 session days. This issue is moot. The three impeachment complaints, filed earlier by order of the plenary on February 5th, have been transmitted to the Archives, Velasco said. READ: Petition to stop impeachment trial vs VP Duterte filed at Supreme Court 215 House Members filed an Impeachment Complaint against the Vice President and I was ordered by the Plenary to transmit that to the Senate also on February 5th, he added. Earlier, lawyers from Mindanao filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the Supreme Court, asking that the Senate trial on Dutertes impeachment be stopped, while declaring the complaint null and void. READ: Carpio: Special session possible for GAA, VP trial According to an advisory, the petition questions the impeachment process arising from the said complaint considering that the initiation of the same was procedurally defective, constitutionally infirm and jurisdictionally void. Duterte was impeached after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth complaint. This allowed the House to immediately transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial, as the Constitution states that a trial can start forthwith if over one-thirds of all House membersin this case, 102 out of 306 lawmakershave signed and endorsed the petition. There were seven articles of impeachment in the verified complaint sent to the Senate: Trial however has not started yet, as there are conflicting views on how the impeachment proceedings would go. Some have expressed concerns that if trial starts during the 19th Congress, some members of the Senate who will sit as senator-judges would no longer be in office for the 20th Congress as they are not eligible for reelection. At the House , there are also questions if it is proper to assign prosecutors this early as their seats in the 20th Congress are not assured, due to their posts being up for grabs in the midterm elections. Even former senator Leila de Limasupporter of moves to impeach Duterte and spokesperson for the first set of complainantsadmitted last January 17 that this issue remains an open question. However, other legal luminaries like former senator Franklin Drilon and retired Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio believe Dutertes impeachment is enough basis to call for a special session, so that the Senate can move on with the trial.

So for ByteDance, Philippines, that is Ms. Peachy Paderna. And for Meta platforms or in the case of Facebook Philippines, this is Mr. Genixon David, Gutierrez said. Before this, the lawmaker said that the panel received a letter from White and Case on behalf of Meta, saying that Facebook Philippines was not authorized to receive the invitation. Just for the information of the body, we received the committees in receipt of a letter from Counsel from the US, stating that Meta cannot be invited, Gutierrez said. He noted Google Philippines participation, although it is part of an international entity. Although Google and Alphabet are international, Google Philippines chose to appear. So I think, Mr. Chair, this would not stand as a reason for Facebook Philippines not to attend, Gutierrez stressed. Moreover, he also mentioned ByteDances no-show. ByteDance is the owner of TikTok, it also sent a letter to the panel citing an unsubstantiated engagement in Singapore as the reason for non-attendance.

Alyansa Senate bets deescalating tension after Dutertes kill senators quip,"MANILA, Philippines Several administration senatorial candidates on Tuesday moved to deescalate tensions rather than stoking the fire brought by former President Rodrigo Dutertes remark about killing incumbent senators, with one of the candidates saying he treats it like a joke. In a press conference held in Pasay City on Tuesday, the Marcos administration-backed Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas candidates were asked about Dutertes threats to just kill 15 senators to make way for more of his candidates entering the Senate. Former Senate President Vicente Sotto III said he knows Duterte, and thinks the ex-leader is just joking. Sotto, h owever, also advised other candidates to focus on issues only, as the moment they attack opponents on a personal basis, they have already lost the debate. Im treating it as a joke, kakilala ko naman, magkaibigan naman kami ni President Digong eh, pero sa akin kasi parang piece of advice sa ating mga politicians: kapag pinag-uusapan ang mga issues, its better we stick to the issues, Sotto said. Once you start attacking personally, personal attacks on anyone, you have lost the debate. It means you have lost the debate, Sotto added. Former senator Panfilo Lacson said he does not want to comment on the issue, but noted that he and other Alyansa candidates previously took a stand against negative campaigning , when they were asked about this before the first rally in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte. Pag nag-aaway away yong mga makapangyarihang tao, sana, ang kahilingan ko, tumulong na lang tayo mag-deescalate sa halip na mag-escalate, kasi walang idudulot na maganda ito sa ating mga kababayan lalo na sa pangkaraniwang Pilipino.

"3 Samar governors seek to address poverty, insurgency","TACLOBAN CITY The three governors of Samar Island are pushing for the construction of roads and bridges to end poverty and insurgency in their areas. Governors Edwin Ongchuan of Northern Samar, Sharee Ann Tan of Samar, and Ben Evardone of Eastern Samar, through a representative, met in Calbayog City, Samar on Feb. 11, to discuss key infrastructure projects that would link their respective provinces. This initiative highlights a collective effort to fast-track Samars development through enhanced connectivity and economic growth. Tan said the meeting was intended to align with development partners and discuss the challenges of securing funds and addressing insurgency. We are considering the amount or the funding needed, but there is also another dimension which is the insurgency problem that the military has pointed out, she said. Ongchuan, for his part, stressed that provincial governments alone could not shoulder the multi-billion expenses for infrastructure projects and that they need the help of the national government. While we have made significant strides in infrastructure developmentincluding roads, bridges, and essential public amenitiesthere is still a pressing need for further support. A comprehensive and efficient road network is crucial for propelling Northern Samar, and the entire Samar Island, toward a future marked by lasting peace, Ongchuan said. In the past two years, Northern Samar has invested more than P850 million in various infrastructure projects, including roads and bridges, to boost connectivity and economic activity, he said. Jhon Allen Berbon, head of the Provincial Economic Development and Investment Promotions Office of Northern Samar, expressed optimism about the initiative, citing its wide-ranging impact on the entire Samar Island. The interconnection of the three provinces will pave the way for economic development, improve the delivery of basic services, and, most importantly, help eradicate the insurgency problem, he said. The three Samar provinces continue to struggle with insurgency, a major factor discouraging potential investors. These provinces are also among the least developed in the country with poverty incidences of 35.8 percent in Samar, 35.6 percent in Eastern Samar, and 27.5 percent in Northern Samar, based on the 2023 report of the Philippine Statistics Authority. Berbon stressed the need for full support from all congressmen representing Samar Island, as well as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., to secure funding for these infrastructure projects. The three governors are optimistic that with their endorsement, the backing of all congressmen, and the support of the President, these projects will receive funding, he said. Eastern Samar Gov. Ben Evardone, represented at the meeting by his provincial planning development officer Joselito Abrugar, reiterated the provinces full support for the initiative, emphasizing its role in addressing poverty and achieving long-term peace and stability in Samar. The governors hoped that the allocations for these infrastructures would be included in next years national budget. Among the priority projects discussed were the completion of critical routes such as the E. Duran to Macatingog Road in Northern Samar and the Silvino Lubos-Matuguinao Road in Samar, which aims not only to curb insurgent movements but also to open essential trade routes. The nearly completed Catumsan-Jipapad-Las Navas-Catubig-Rawis Road, also known as the Las Navas -Jipapad Road in Eastern Samar, is 72 percent complete. These roads are particularly vital for connecting remote communities across Samars provinces, improving access to healthcare, education, and other basic services, ultimately enhancing quality of life of Samarnons. The Silvino Lubos-Matuguinao Road, extending 18 kilometers with plans for four new bridges, was estimated to cost P3.2 billion. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

CIDG chief on suing Rodrigo Duterte: What goes around comes around,"MANILA, Philippines What goes around comes around. Brig. Gen. Nicolas Torre III, chief of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group , said this on Tuesday as he defended criminal complaints he filed against former President Rodrigo Duterte for his remark about killing 15 senators to make way for his candidates . Torre cited a past case in which a public school teacher was arrested for offering a P50-million bounty on Dutertes life when he was still president. Its this simple. The same was done to him before he became president. The NBI arrested him. A teacher did the same thing. And what happened? The teacher was jailed. They forced him to issue a public apology. Otherwise, he would have remained in jail. So, its the same. What goes around comes around, Torre said in a mix of Filipino and English. Now, Duterte is facing criminal complaints for unlawful utterances and inciting to sedition, which Torre filed on Monday before the Department of Justice. The case stemmed from Dutertes remarks during a campaign rally, where he joked about killing 15 senators to create more vacancies for the candidates he supports. Despite criticism that the case was politically motivated, Torre maintained that the Philippine National Police would operate strictly within legal boundaries. It is natural for them to say that. But for me, we dont care about politics. The PNP is apolitical, and we operate solely based on what the law says, he said. Director Jaime Santiago of the National Bureau of Investigation previously said there was no need to investigate Duterte, describing the former presidents remarks as political propaganda and rhetoric. However, Torre emphasized that the PNP CIDG acted based on its own findings. Thats the directors opinion. But lets see because they are not the ones who will evaluate or file the case, he said.

"Impeachment court can convene now, cross over to next Congress Lacson","MANILA, Philippines Former Senator Panfilo Ping Lacson believes there is no issue if the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte starts within the 19th Congress and crosses over to the 20th Congress. This is based on the same principle used by the judiciary in hearing cases. Lacson explained that a case that gets raffled to a particular division like for the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Appeals will not be transferred to another division should one of the judges retire or resign from his or her post. The former senator expressed his opinion during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum on Wednesday. The same system, Lacson said, should apply to the Senate once it starts convening as an impeachment court. So ang thinking ko rin is, and I also heard this from several legal luminaries, yung Senate as an impeachment court is akin to a Sandiganbayan division or a Court of Appeals division or even a Supreme Court division, the former senator told reporters. Pag may mag-retire na member yung division, hindi na ito mahinto na lahat yung kaso at ililipat na lang sa ibang division di ba? he wondered. So tuloy-tuloy and Senate being a continuing body at may darating na 12 [] So continuing body, para rin ganoon sa mga court, higher courts natin na hindi mahihinto ang kaso at hindi malilipat, Lacson pointed out. Hindi mawawalan ng jurisdiction yung division maski merong umalis at merong pumalit na bagong justice, he added. Duterte was impeached by the House in February 5, 2025 after 215 lawmakers filed a fourth impeachment complaint. Then, the Senate was urged by some quarters to start its trial as the 1987 Constitution states that trial shall begin forthwith if the verified complaint was submitted by one-thirds of all House members. With 306 lawmakers in the House, the goal was to get at least 102 members to sign the complaint. However, the Articles of Impeachment were not sent to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5. This means that Congress will now have to reconvene first after the election season or through a special session to discuss the impeachment. There were also questions whether or not it is proper for the Senate in the 19th Congress to start the trial when the 2025 midterms elections will surely change the composition in the legislative chamber. For the House, it is also being quizzed if it is correct or wrong to appoint prosecutors since the lawmakers will have to get reelected first, if trial crosses to the 20th Congress. Even former Senator Leila de Lima supporter of moves to impeach Duterte and spokesperson for the first set of complainants admitted last January 17 that these issues are open questions. READ: VP Dutertes trial next Congress? De Lima says its open question But according to Lacson, he believes the Senate does not function as a legislative body in tackling the impeachment which means, it will not be bound by legislative rules. My humble opinion, being a layman, kasi as an impeachment court, the Senate no longer acts as a legislative body. Actually, it is not legislative action being called when there is an impeachment trial. Its a different constitutional body already, he said. The complexion, the personality of the Senate changes. It becomes an impeachment court, and we would not tackle or do legislative action there, but an impeachment trial only, he added. So I think it can cross over. But thats me, he concluded. For his part, former Senate President Vicente Sotto III believes the Senate should have tackled the impeachment matter at the plenary last February 5. He believes the move would have enabled the committee on rules to discuss the matter even during a session break. For us, what they should have done this is just my opinion if they received , they should have reported it to the plenary, and that it be referred; the impeachment be referred to the committee on rules so that during the break, the committee on rules can act, he said. They can talk about it. They can convene a hearing. They can convene a meeting [], Sotto recommended. The Senate also always passes a resolution, sometimes every one year, every year, a resolution saying that the committees may continue and may conduct hearings during the break, he further suggested. The committee on rules can act on this but I dont know. It was their decision not to refer it to the plenary, the former Senate leader observed.

Petition vs impeachment trial shows Duterte camp desperation Makabayan,"MANILA, Philippines The petition filed before the Supreme Court to stop the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte is a mere desperate attempt to evade accountability, according to Makabayan bloc lawmakers at the House of Representatives. The petition is a last-ditch effort to escape scrutiny regarding allegations of confidential misuse involving Dutertes offices the Office of the Vice President and, previously, the Department of Education . This was in a statement issued on Tuesday by ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro, Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, and Kabataan Party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel. We, the Makabayan bloc in Congress, strongly condemn the desperate legal maneuvers of Vice President Sara Dutertes camp to obstruct justice and evade accountability through their recent petition to the Supreme Court seeking to halt the impeachment proceedings, the lawmakers said. This is nothing but a last-ditch effort to escape scrutiny over the millions of confidential funds that were questionably spent under her watch. If they are not hiding anything, why dont they want to show up? they added in a mix of English and Filipino. Earlier, lawyers from Mindanao filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the Supreme Court, asking that the Senate trial on the impeachment complaint against Duterte be stopped and that the complaint be declared null and void. According to an advisory, the petition questions the impeachment process arising from the said complaint considering that the initiation of the same was procedurally defective, constitutionally infirm and jurisdictionally void. However, the Makabayan lawmakers maintained that the impeachment complaint was filed properly and the articles sent to the Senate were valid and as a result, the Senate trial should start already. The Makabayan bloc maintains that the impeachment complaint is valid and properly filed, following all constitutional requirements. The petition filed by VP Saras supporters is a transparent attempt to perpetuate fiscal impunity and protect a culture of corruption, the lawmakers said. We call on the Supreme Court to dismiss this baseless petition and allow the impeachment process to proceed according to constitutional mandate. All the more, the Senate must convene as an impeachment court without delay. The Filipino people deserve no less than full transparency and accountability from their public officials, they added. Meanwhile, Brosas said that the pattern was clear Duterte would again want to evade the impeachment proceedings as she evaded House hearings on the budget and other issues thrown at her. The pattern is clear: She did not face the House hearings. Now she wants to stop the impeachment court. This is the height of arrogance and contempt for public accountability. The question is: Where did the millions of confidential funds go? Manuel added in a mix of English and Filipino. The Filipino people deserve answers, not legal gymnastics. The vice president cannot hide behind her Davao lawyers forever. If their conscience is really clear, she must face the impeachment court, he added. Duterte was impeached last February 5 after over one-third of all House members 215 lawmakers verified and endorsed a fourth complaint. Under the 1987 Constitution, an impeachment complaint could be immediately forwarded to the Senate for a trial if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition.

Court junks ex-BFAR execs bid to quash VMS graft case,"MANILA, PhilippinesA Regional Trial Court in Cainta, Rizal dismissed on Feb. 7 the motions to quash filed by two former officials of the Department of Agriculture-Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and a businessman who are charged with violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Judge Don Ace Mariano Alagar of Branch 141 of the Cainta RTC said in a six-page resolution on Feb. 7 that the graft chargestwo counts under Section 3 and one count each under Sections 3 and 3 of Republic Act 3019should proceed to trial after finding no legal basis for dismissal. Eduardo Gongona and Demosthenes Escoto, who both served as BFAR national director, previously asked the court to dismiss the charges, asserting that the Ombudsman took nearly three years to file the casebeyond the two-year limit for complex cases set under OMB Administrative Order No. 1 of 2020. But the RTC said the Office of the Ombudsman, which filed the cases, did not commit inordinate delay in its investigation, rejecting the claim of the two former BFAR executives that their right to a speedy disposition of cases was violated. As the case was complex and involved voluminous records, the OMB completed the preliminary investigation, including resolutions on the motions for reconsideration, within 24 months as provided in OMB AO No. 1 of 2020, the resolution stated. READ: Ex-BFAR execs post bail for VMS-related graft raps The court pointed out, too, that Gongona and Escoto failed to assert their right to a speedy disposition of the case, saying that they must file the appropriate motion upon the lapse of the statutory or procedural periods [] otherwise, they are deemed to have waived their right to speedy disposition of the case. With the motions denied, the arraignment and pre-trial of the two former BFAR executives, as well as UK-based SRT Marine Systems CEO Simon Tucker, are set for February 26, allowing the prosecution to present evidence on the alleged irregular awarding of the Vessel Monitoring System contract. Looking back, the cases stemmed from allegations that Gongona, Escoto, and Tucker conspired in 2018 to award a P2.09-billion VMS contract to SRT-UK, despite the companys prior disqualification from a French-funded bidding process. The original project, backed by a P1.6-billion French government loan, required bidders to be French or in a joint venture with a French firm. However, the French Ministry of Finance later disqualified SRT-France, a subsidiary of SRT-UK, citing British ownership and lack of operational facilities in France. But rather than rebidding the project, Philippine officials restructured the deal, secured local funding, and expanded the contract to P2.09 billion, compelling the government to procure 5,000 vessel tracking devices, up from the originally planned 3,736 units, increasing costs and government obligations. The court also found no indication that the complaint was politically motivated or maliciously prosecuted. There is no allegation in the pleadings of accused-movants before the OMB and their motions to quash that the prosecution of this case was politically motivated or prosecuted for malice or both, the ruling stated.

Alvarez, along with lawyers Ferdie Topacio and Jimmy Bondoc, a PDP-Laban senatorial candidate, the non-governmental organization Citizens Crime Watch, and et al filed the motion before the Office of the Ombudsman. Alvarezs office shared a portion of the document with the media. Aside from Romualdez, Alvarez and his co-petitioners likewise sought the suspension of House Majority Leader Manuel Jose Dalipe, former House appropriations committee chairperson and Ako Bicol Party-list Representative Zaldy Co, and acting appropriations committee chair Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo. Reporters sought Romualdezs office for reaction, but it has yet to reply as of posting time. On February 10, Alvarez and co-petitioners filed two counts of falsification of legislative documents and 12 counts of graft against Romualdez, Dalipe, Co, and Quimbo. Two others were referred to as John Doe and Jane Doe in the complaint sheet. Romualdez and the three lawmakers also face the same complaints for alleged violation of Article 170 of the Revised Penal Code and Section 3 of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. In explaining the grounds of the complaints, Topacio said the alleged insertions in the national budget reportedly occurred 12 times.

Escudero: SolGen to comment on SC petition to act on VP impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines The Senate leadership is leaving it to the Solicitor General to address the Supreme Courts directive to comment on the petition to immediately act on the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte. In a press conference on Wednesday, Senate President Francis Escudero said no preparations on the side of the Senate are being conducted in relation to the order of the SC. We referred that matter to the Solicitor Generals Office. As a lawyer that stands on behalf of the government, it is the SolGen that will answer, it is the SolGen who will appear, it is the SolGen that will handle the case for the Senate, Escudero told reporters in Filipino. The Senate itself is not doing anything to prepare nor answer the order, he added. The SC on Tuesday ordered the Senate to comment on the petition asking the high court to compel the legislative body to immediately act on the impeachment case against Duterte. The SC gave the Senate 10 days from receipt of notice to submit their comment.

Marcos pokes fun at DSWD chief Rex Gatchalian for being single,"MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday playfully poked fun at Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian for remaining single due to his dedication to his job. Marcos made the remark during the 74th-anniversary celebration of the Department of Social Welfare and Development at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City when he was enumerating the departments achievements, including the Sustainable Livelihood Program . When he mentioned the SLP in his speech, Marcos quickly joked that he did not mean Sustainable Lovelife Program. Maybe someone will ask, Sir, is there training for hearts that always lose? Those are the ones, the personalities without jowa [partner]. Your secretary is leading that, Marcos said in Filipino. Our secretary is very hardworking. No time for romance, he added. READ: Marcos on DSWDs 74th anniversary: Our mission does not end here According to Marcos, since being appointed DSWD chief, Gatchalian along with his staff seemed to have sacrificed sleeping for working pointing out how Gatchalian always answered his calls even past midnight. Marcos jokes did not stop there, he also claimed that if the SLP would be applied to love life, it would receive more applicants, especially those in situationships. The presidents sudden mention of the term visibly shocked the audience, who might not have expected the president to know about it. Especially those in a situationship where youre already invested, yet theres still no label. However, we focus on businesses not hearts. We have no power over that, Marcos said. It was only after the candid moment when Marcos revealed that the SLP program, which sought to empower Filipinos with the skills and resources to improve their livelihoods through free technical-vocational and life skills training, helped 271,000 households in 2024 alone.

"Sara Duterte conviction, acquittal at Senate hinges on poll results","MANILA, Philippines One could already get a hint of the fate that awaits Vice President Sara Duterte at the Senate, which would transform into an impeachment court for her trial on several charges, including betrayal of public trust. As pointed out by a political science professor, most, if not everything, depends on who will win in the election on May 12, especially now that Senate President Francis Escudero already said the proceedings will only commence on the day of the first regular session of the 20th Congress. READ: VP Sara Duterte impeachment trial starts after Sona Escudero With an initial 215 signatures, the impeachment complaint against Duterte reached the Senate on Feb. 5, a few hours before it ended session for the election break, which will last until June 2, the day when the Senate will convene again until June 13. READ: VP Sara Duterte impeachment complaint reaches Senate Lawyer Domingo Cayosa, who served as president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, said the [Senate] can convene to do its non-legislative function even if its legislative session or calendar ended since the Senate does not cease to exist after adjournment sine die and that sitting as an impeachment court is a non-legislative function and duty of the Senate. As stressed by Cayosa, there is a better chance of getting a decision out before the start of the 20th Congress if the Senate will start the trial already, or while it is on break, since both the Constitution and Senate Rules on Impeachment discourage delays. The term of senators is six years and they should continue to do their duty until the end of their term, he told INQUIRER.net . But Escudero seemed to have already decided that the proceedings will only commence on July 28, the day that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will deliver his State of the Nation Address at the Batasang Pambansa, even when Marcos already stated that he would call for a special session once requested by the Senate. If the senators ask for it, yes, he said. Marcos had said this as Escudero pointed out at the Kapihan sa Senado that the Senate cannot legally start the impeachment trial, which can only proceed if the institution has convened as an impeachment court so that the senators can take their oath as judges. This could only be done when Congress is in session, he said. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III on Friday, Feb. 14, already asked Escudero to act without delay on the impeachment complaint against Duterte, saying that Section 3, Article XI of the Constitution provides that once the House of Representatives endorses the articles of impeachment, trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed. As pointed out by Pimentel, who is set to graduate at the end of the 19th Congress, forthwith must be interpreted based on the Verba Legis Rule, so it should be given its plain and ordinary meaningwithout delay. The Senates duty is clearto act on this matter without any delay, he said in the letter, which was released this week. READ: Pimentel tells Escudero: Acting fast on Dutertes impeachment is Senate duty Even the Supreme Court has been asked by lawyer Catalino Generillo Jr., a former special counsel of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, to issue a writ of mandamus directing the members of the Senate to immediately constitute themselves into an impeachment court and forthwith conduct the public trial of Duterte. But on Tuesday, Feb. 18, the day the SC was expected to discuss the petition, which was raffled on Monday, Feb. 17, some lawyers from Mindanao filed a petition, too, asking the SC to direct the Senate to cease and desist from conducting the impeachment proceedings, asserting that it is based on a constitutionally deficient complaint. The impeachment complaint, which is now signed by 240 out of the 306 members of the House of Representatives, stated that Duterte, who ran with Marcos in 2022 and received an overwhelming 32,208,417 votes, should be convicted for culpable violation of the Constitution, betrayal of public trust, graft and corruption, and high crimes. READ: Sara Duterte impeached; House gets 215 to sign As listed out, the alleged violations of Duterte include contracting an assassin to kill Marcos, First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, and Speaker Martin Romualdez, misuse and malversation of public funds, inciting to sedition and rebellion, large-scale corruption, and allowing EJKs to continue when she was the mayor of Davao City. Should the impeachment proceedings start only on July 28, Pimentel and Senators Nancy Binay, Grace Poe, and Cynthia Villar, will no longer be able to cast their judgment since they are already set to graduate after serving two consecutive six-year terms. Education Secretary Sonny Angara was set to graduate, as well, but resigned last year after his appointment. Twelve incumbent senators, or those who got elected in 2022, including Sen. Robin Padilla, who committed last month to block the impeachment of Duterte, will comprise 50 percent of the impeachment court, whether it will start while the Senate is on break, once it convenes again on June 2, or at the beginning of the 20th Congress. READ: Padilla vows to block impeachment complaints vs VP Duterte Senators Pia Cayetano, Bato Dela Rosa, Bong Go, Lito Lapid, Imee Marcos, Bong Revilla, and Francis Tolentino are seeking reelection, and as pointed out in previous statements, three of these seven reelectionists already expressed opposition to the removal of the Vice President from officeImee, Dela Rosa, and Go. While Dela Rosa said on the day the complaint was received by the Senate that he will maintain his political neutrality in the trial despite his closeness with Duterte, he perceived himself and Go last year as blockers of the impeachment, saying that the House of Representatives charged them with crimes against humanity to demolish them so that the proceedings against Duterte would move. READ: Apolitical Dela Rosa says VP Dutertes impeachment expected Dela Rosa was the chief of the Philippine National Police when the previous administration, led by former President Rodrigo Duterte, waged the war on drugs that is believed to have killed thousands of Filipinos. Go, meanwhile, served as Special Assistant to the President, before winning in the 2019 election with Dela Rosa. As of the first month of 2025, both survey results from the Social Weather Stations and Pulse Asia are yielding the same names, with 11 sealing a possible win after making it to the Top 12 in the latest pre-election surveys. Imee and Lapid were the only exceptions as they were 14th and third in the SWS and sixth and 14th in Pulse Asias. Rep. Erwin Tulfo is leading in both survey results, but at the House of Representatives, he did not sign the impeachment complaint against Duterte so that he could remain impartial in case he will take part in the trial as one of the 24 judges who will decide on whether to convict the Vice President or not on at least one of the seven articles of impeachment. Like him, Camille Villar, sister of Sen. Mark Villar, did not sign, too, as well as Revillas son and wife, Representatives Ramon Jolo Revilla and Lani Mercado of Cavite. Tulfo, Villar, and Revilla, and even Imee, who is against the impeachment are part of the administration-backed Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas, which is seen to clash with the one outrightly backing Duterte. READ: Sen. Marcos rejects VP impeachment, wants focus on more pressing issues Sen. Joel Villanuevas father, Rep. Eduardo Villanueva , and Sen. Loren Legardas brother, Rep. Antonio Legarda of Antique, did not sign the complaint, either. Both Villanueva and Legarda will take part in the impeachment proceedings. However, Escudero already pointed out that he has no problem with how their relatives engaged in the process at the House of Representatives. Sen. Raffy Tulfos son and wife, Representatives Ralph Tulfo of Quezon City and Jocelyn Tulfo , signed the impeachment complaint, but Maria Ela Atienza, a professor at the University of the Philippines, pointed out that it is too early to say whether the impeachment complaint would result in conviction, saying that no one is really certain on what would be the verdict eventually. It depends on the results of the midterm elections and behind-the-scenes lobbying and influence, she told INQUIRER.net as she pointed out that most candidates are trying to play safe in the campaigns. They want to get as many votes as possible, Atienza said. For Atienza, the actions of some candidates and their relatives are signs of the weakness of political parties in the Philippines, saying that there is no party discipline but just a coalition of personalities usually crowding around popular and/or resource-rich political figures. Usually, this is the incumbent who controls government resources, she said. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Senate acts as impeach court on its own? Escudero says well consider it,"MANILA, Philippines Although he is against it, Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero said the upper chamber may consider the possibility of convening as an impeachment court to try the case against Vice President Sara Duterte. The idea was first broached by Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Koko Pimentel III in an interview over Radyo 630 on Wednesday. I dont agree with that, but we will consider it, Escudero said in Filipino at a press conference in Quezon City when asked about Pimentels opinion. Why? The court needs to convene in an open session. The impeachment complaint needs to be referred in an open session. The senators need to take an oath as judges in an open session, he added. Now, if I do that, it seems that it would go against my position and stand, which is to carefully proceed with this without rushing and without making any mistakes or missteps. Escudero also said he does not want to give the Duterte camp another ammunition against the Senate based on an idea or opinion that has no legal standing or provision in the Constitution. He said he would just refer the matter to the Senate rules committee and its legal team to study it. Pimentel floated two options on how the Senate can still act as an impeachment court even during the break of Congress. First, for the President to call a special session and second, for the majority of senators to agree to the convening of the impeachment court. READ: Koko Pimentel: Senate may convene impeachment court on its own But for Escudero, only an order of the court can compel the Senate to act immediately on the impeachment case against Duterte. But then again if the court orders that, then the Senate would have to meet and decide But if you ask me, we should accord due respect to the decisions of the court, the Senate chief added.

Chiz: Impeachment trial possible with court order during Senate break,"MANILA, Philippines Only a court order would compel the Senate to convene into an impeachment court while session is on break, according to Senate President Chiz Escudero. Speaking to reporters in a press conference on Wednesday, Escudero repeatedly emphasized that no trial against Vice President Sara Duterte will be conducted prior to the resumption of Congress session. But with the ongoing talks about the impeachment, what would compel the Senate to proceed with the trial now? An order of the court. But then again if the court orders that, then the Senate would have to meet and decide. But if you ask me, we should accord due respect to the decisions of the court, Escudero told reporters when he was asked if theres nothing that could compel the chamber to immediately act on the case. Despite this pronouncement, the Senate chief, in the same presser, repeatedly clarified that within the bounds of law it is illegal for the Senate to convene into an impeachment court while there are no ongoing sessions. I dont want to rush it because the House of Representatives has been delayed for almost two months, and now we are being rushed? If I listen to those who want VP Sara impeached and act on it, the other side will complain that were really rushing it, said Escudero in Filipino. The Senates top leader earlier disclosed that the impeachment trial against Duterte will commence after President Bongbong Marcos fourth State of the Nation Address in July. Most likely when the new Congress already enters into its functions after Sona. Sona, I think it is on July 21. So [the] trial will commence after that day, he said then. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. himself previously said that he would willingly call a special session of the Senate to tackle the impeachment of Duterte if the upper chamber asks for it. But Escudero already made clear that he has no intentions of requesting for a special session , maintaining that it is not one of the reasons to call for such a thing.

Rodrigo Duterte among lawyers in SC bid to block VP Duterte impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines Former President Rodrigo Duterte is among the legal counsel representing his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, in her Supreme Court petition seeking to block her impeachment. Based on a copy of the petition, Vice President Dutertes father-in-law, lawyer Lucas Carpio Jr., also joins former President Duterte and lawyers from the Fortun, Narvasa, and Salazar law firm in blocking her impeachment. Vice President Duterte filed the petition for certiorari and prohibition with the urgent application for a temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction on Tuesday, February 18. The petition sought the SC to issue a temporary restraining order to stop the Senate from proceeding with the impeachment trialand to further desist from doing any and all acts relative and pursuant thereto. It also sought the SC to issue a final injunction, which would nullify and set aside the fourth impeachment complaint filed against the Vice President on February 5. The House of Representatives impeached her on the same day with 215 lawmakers singing the complaint. Her petition is on top of a similar petition filed by a group of Mindanao lawyers on Tuesday.

Sotto: SC can cure 2025 budget without declaring GAA unconstitutional,"MANILA, Philippines The Supreme Court could cure the allegedly unconstitutional provisions in the 2025 national budget without declaring the entire General Appropriations Act as illegal, former Senate President Vicente Sotto III said on Wednesday. At the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum, Sotto reminded the public that the SC can declare parts of a law as unconstitutional without affecting other provisions, which happened several times, including to his pet measure, Republic Act No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. Sotto said the SC declared unconstitutional two provisions of R.A. No. 9165 that sought to enforce mandatory drug testing in schools, workplaces, and for elective post candidates without scrapping the entire law, which can also happen to the 2025 GAA or R.A. No. 12116. Someone filed a petition before the SC seeking to declare unconstitutional R.A. No. 9165. The SC declared as unconstitutional two provisions only, which were the mandatory drug testing for schools and in workplaces, and the proposed mandatory drug testing for candidates because the Constitution states candidates must be able to read and write only, he explained in Filipino. Sotto said he agrees with what the SC did to R.A. No. 9165, and he believes the high tribunal would not go as far as declaring the entire 2025 GAA unconstitutional I have learned a lot from these experiences, thats why I know what might happen, he said in Filipino. They need not declare the budget as unconstitutional, the whole budget. No, I dont think they will, he added. After the budget bill was signed into law by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., several individuals, including former senator Panfilo Lacson, raised concerns that the GAA supposedly did not prioritize the education sector, contrary to the requirement set by the 1987 Constitution. Under Paragraph 5 of Article XIV, Section 5 of the Constitution, the government is mandated to assign the highest budgetary priority to education. However, Lacson and the Makabayan bloc at the House of Representatives pointed out that more funds were allocated to the Department of Public Works and Highways . READ: Education not prioritized in 2025 budget Lacson, Makabayan bloc Lacson, who was also present during the forum, warned that the process of curing the budget would be a tedious one. Sotto, on the other hand, noted that the SC cannot amend the GAA by realigning items, which means that P288 billion worth of DPWH allocations might be sent back to the treasury, just so the education sector would have a higher allocation under the 2025 GAA. It will be a very tedious ruling. How would you put back, correct the lower budget for the education sector compared to public works? Thats a lot of items, P288 billion worth of PPAs, projects, programs, activities. Thats big, P288 billion, and you would put that back to where it came from just so the DPWH budget goes down and the education sector gets prioritized? he said in Filipino. I think they can no longer put that back. The Supreme Court has no power to amend the GAA. What they can do is declare these unconstitutional, and what would happen is they would remove that, lets say, the P288 [billion] mentioned by Senator Lacson They will declare that unconstitutional and after you remove that, the DPWH budget would be lower compared to the education sectors allocation.) On December 12, 2024, Makabayan bloc member and ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro called out the bicameral conference committee for approving a P12-billion cut in the Department of Educations proposed 2025 budget. It will hit the agencys computerization program Lawmakers from the House Majority bloc, however, defended the DepEd budget cuts, with Zambales 1st District Rep. Jefferson Khonghun saying that the DepEd should first show that it can efficiently use its funds before Congress makes a higher allocation. Khonghun also disputed allegations that the DPWH had a higher budget, noting that the bicam allocated a total of P1.055 trillion to theeducationsector. Khonghun also noted that while the DPWH has P1.235 trillion, P82.08 billion of its funds are convergence projects, which means that while these are infrastructure programs, it is intended for the projects of other departments like DepEd classrooms and other facilities and the Department of Health. This would leave DPWH with P1.033 trillion, slightly lower than the allocation for the entire education sector. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Meanwhile, cloudy skies and rain are expected over the Cordillera Administrative Region, Batanes, and Nueva Vizcaya due to the northeast monsoon. Dito po sa may bahagi ng Luzon, particularly dyan po sa may Northern at Central Luzon area, maaaring makaranas po tayo ng maulan na panahon, Torres explained.

Bayan Muna files position paper asking Senate to form an impeachment court,"MANILA, Philippines Bayan Muna chairperson Neri Colmenares has filed a position paper before the Senate, calling on the chamber to immediately convene as an impeachment court. He also asked the senators to expedite the trial against Vice President Sara Duterte. Colmenares lodged the position paper at the Office of the Senate Secretary on Wednesday. In the copy of the document, Bayan Muna listed four key points as the legal and constitutional basis for its position as to why there is a need to conduct the impeachment proceedings immediately, even amid the campaign season. READ: Bayan Muna urges Senate to expedite VP impeachment proceedings For its first legal basis, the group cited Article XI Section 3 of the Constitution, saying that the Senate should forthwith proceed with the impeachment trial as commanded by the Constitutionnot on June 2, 2025, or in the next Congress. Bayan Muna likewise argued that the president has the power to call for a special session and should convene a special session of Congress immediately, citing Article VI, Section 15 of the Constitution. Moreover, the group said, There is no need for the Senate to draft a new set of impeachment rules, as there is a standing set of Senate Rules on Impeachment in the 19th Congress. Found in the Senate website is the Senate Rules of the 19th Congress, which states that, Bayan Muna pointed out in the position paper. This latest and updated edition of the Rules was published by the Legislative Publications Service Senate of the Philippines [in] March 2023, it recalled. Said Rules also contain the Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation and Resolution Adopting the Rules of Procedure in Impeachment Cases, it said. Clearly, therefore, the Senate has rules effectively governing impeachment cases, which [were] duly approved and published and has been the rules used by the Senate under the 19th Congress, it added. Drafting a new set of rules, having it approved by all the members, and publishing the same will only unduly delay the impeachment trialagain in violation of the constitutional requirement that [the] impeachment trial shall proceed forthwith, the group further said. For its final point, Bayan Muna cited Rule I on Rules of Procedure on Impeachment Trials. The rule states: When the Senate receives articles of impeachment pursuant to Article XI, Sections 2 and 3 of the Constitution, the President of the Senate shall inform the House of Representatives that the Senate shall take proper order on the subject of impeachment and shall be ready to receive the prosecutors on such time and date as the Senate may specify. In conclusion, Bayan Muna reiterated its request for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to call for a special session without the need for a request from the Senate. It also urged the Senate to desist from delaying the impeachment trial by drafting a new set of impeachment rules and instead use the already approved and published Rules on Impeachment under the 19th Congress. The organization also argued that Dutertes impeachment should be an election issue and that candidates should categorically make public their position on the impeachment so that the voters and the Filipino people will know. Bayan Munas move came after the camp of Duterte, specifically a group of Mindanao lawyers, earlier filed a petition before the Supreme Court on Tuesday to stop the impeachment complaint against the vice president. The petition for certiorari and prohibition seeks to issue a temporary restraining order and declare the impeachment complaint null and void. On February 5, the House of Representatives confirmed that 215 lawmakers signed the fourth impeachment complaint against Duterte. However, Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero said holding an impeachment trial legally cannot be done, as the complaint was not referred to the plenary to establish a basis for convening the impeachment court by the Senate. Escudero explained that for an impeachment court to be convened, there has to be an ongoing session in the chamber. He said this situation would allow impeachment judges to take oaths.

House on VP impeachment: We complied with constitutional provisions,"MANILA, Philippines The House of Representatives has reiterated that it complied with the 1987 Constitutions provisions when lawmakers impeached Vice President Sara Duterte and sent the articles of impeachment to the Senate, Secretary General Reginald Velasco said on Wednesday. Velasco said this in response to the two petitions filed before the Supreme Court both seeking to stop the impeachment proceedings against Duterte. The House of Representatives ensured compliance with all constitutional requirements when it filed the Articles of Impeachment and transmitted it to the Senate, Velasco said in a statement sent to reporters. READ: Petition to stop impeachment trial vs VP Duterte filed at Supreme Court According to the House official, they only became aware of the two petitions after hearing it from news reports, adding that they have not received copies of the documents as of now. As such, Velasco said they will wait for the official copies before making any comments on the issue. READ: Impeachment court can convene now, cross over to next Congress Lacson We are aware of the two petitions filed before the Supreme Court challenging the validity and constitutionality of the impeachment complaint filed and transmitted to the Senate, he said. READ: Solons fear VP Dutertes vow to face impeach raps is just lip service We came to know about the petitions through the various media outlets. Considering that we have not received copies of any of these petitions, we are constrained to wait until we are furnished copies before we respond to any query on the matter, he added. Two petitions seeking to stop the impeachment complaints were filed on Tuesday. Initially, it was announced that Mindanao-based lawyers asked that the SC stop the Senate from proceeding with an impeachment since the House supposedly did not observe the Constitutions rules, which requires it to act on filed impeachment complaints within 10 session days. Velasco on Tuesday said the issue is already moot, as the three impeachment complaints which were not used have been sent to the archives. But on Wednesday, it was revealed that Duterte herself, represented by allied lawyers including her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, also asked the SC on Tuesday to stop the impeachment proceedings. Dutertes petition was hinged on a supposed violation of Constitutional provisions stating that only one impeachment complaint will be initiated against a sitting official per year. Earlier, several House members questioned the reasoning behind Dutertes petition, as she previously said that she considers the impeachment proceedings an avenue to dispute issues thrown at her. In separate statements, Senior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales, Deputy Speaker David Suarez, and Assistant Majority Leader Jude Acidre questioned the need for a petition if Dutertes camp is confident that they can disprove allegations and issues hurled against her. As early as December 2024 though, House lawmakers have already expressed doubts about Dutertes assurance that she will address issues once the impeachment proceedings start with Zambales 1st District Rep. Jefferson Khonghun saying that this might just be another lip service. Duterte was impeached last February 5 after 215 House members filed and verified a fourth complaint. The articles of impeachment were immediately sent to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution states that trial shall begin forthwith if the verified complaint was submitted by one-thirds of all House members. With 306 lawmakers in the House, the goal was to get at least 102 members to sign the complaint. Despite the transmittal of the articles of impeachment, trial has yet to start as there were questions whether it is proper for the 19th Congress to proceed when the 2025 midterms elections would surely change the composition in the Senate.

Koko Pimentel: Senate may convene impeachment court on its own,"MANILA, Philippines Without the President calling for a special session, the Senate may convene on its own as an impeachment court, Senate Minority Leader Aquino Pimentel III said on Wednesday. Pimentel floated two possibilities on how the Senate can still act as an impeachment court to try the case against Vice President Sara Duterte even during the break of Congress. The first way is for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to call for a special session and for the majority of senators to agree to convene the Senate as an impeachment court, the opposition leader said. You know what Im thinking right now? Because this is an impeachment court, this is a different personality; maybe its possible that just we, senators, as long as we have an agreement and we have a quorum, with more than 12 of us in attendance, maybe we can call for our own session as a court, Pimentel said in Filipino over Radyo 630. Because how can we fulfill our obligation under the Constitution if we are still dependent on another person, the President, to call a special session? he added. It would also appear, he said, that the Senate is just passing its constitutional mandate to the President, who is not part of the chamber. So that seems a bit unclear. So we should be able to act now to fulfill our obligation. We should not be dependent on a person who is not a member of ours, he said in Filipino. Asked in a text message how the Senate can agree to hold a session even during the break, Pimentel said they have yet to think of a way to do it first. Pag-isipan dapat. Buhusan ng Kokote power. Use your Kokote! said the senator, citing his campaign tagline. Pimentel is running as a representative of Marikinas first district in the upcoming May 2025 national and local elections. READ: Pimentel surprised by Teodoros bid as his rival in Marikinas 1st district Last February 5, the Senate went on break without acting on the Articles of Impeachment against Duterte, which was just transmitted by the House of Representatives barely two hours after it ended its session.

VP Sara Duterte files petition at SC to stop impeachment moves against her,"MANILA, Philippines Vice President Sara Duterte has filed a petition before the Supreme Court to block the impeachment complaint filed against her in Congress. According to the SC, the petition for certiorari and prohibition, with urgent application for temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction, was filed on Tuesday, Feb. 18 This is on top of the same petition filed by a group of Mindanao lawyers the same day. The petition seeks to nullify the fourth impeachment complaint filed by the members of the House of Representatives, citing Article XI of the Constitution which states: No impeachment proceedings shall be initiated against the same official more than once within a period of one year. As a consequence, issue a writ of prohibition to enjoin the Senate of the Philippines from acting on the Fourth Impeachment Complaint due to violation of the One-Year Bar under the aforesaid Constitutional provision, the petition further read.

House leaders say VP Sara Duterte ducking accountability again,"MANILA, Philippines It appears that Vice President Sara Duterte is scared of an impeachment trial because allegations against her are true and can be substantiated, different House of Representatives leaders said on Wednesday. In separate statements, Senior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales, Deputy Speaker David Suarez, and Assistant Majority Leader Jude Acidre questioned the need for a petition to stop the impeachment proceedings if Dutertes camp is confident that they can disprove allegations and issues hurled against her. Duterte, represented by close allies including her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, as her legal team, filed on Tuesday a petition before the Supreme Court asking that the impeachment trial at the Senate be stopped. The Constitution is clear impeachment is the sole prerogative of Congress. Natatakot na sila kaya gusto nang pigilan ang impeachment process. Mukhang totoo ang allegations on corruption lalot masisilip ang bank records, Gonzales said. VP Dutertes petition is nothing more than a desperate attempt to evade accountability, he added. Suarez said the latest legal theatrics show that the Duterte camp is panicking already. The House will not be deterred by legal theatrics. We will continue to uphold our constitutional mandate and ensure that the impeachment process proceeds fairly and transparently, Suarez said. reeks of panic and a blatant effort to undermine the impeachment process even before it formally begins, he added. If she truly believes she is innocent, she should face the charges head-on instead of running to the courts for protection. This attempt to short-circuit the process only raises more questions about what she is trying to hide. Acidre shared the sentiments from the House leaders, saying that it seems Duterte is rattled as the Vice President initially said that the impeachment proceedings would be a good avenue for her to disprove allegations. The Vice President is clearly rattled. Her desperation is showing, and no amount of political maneuvering can hide it. Just months ago, she declared she welcomed the impeachment complaint. Now, shes pulling every trick in the book to stop it from moving forward. If she truly had nothing to hide, why the sudden fear? Her hypocrisy is staggering, he said. And she has every reason to be scared. The House Prosecution Panel is prepared to lay out damning evidence against her, and the Filipino people are watching. A recent survey shows that 73 percent believe she must face a Senate trial for her alleged role in a plot against President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, and Speaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez, he added. Earlier, lawmakers from the Makabayan bloc also pointed out that Dutertes petition before SC runs contrary to her initial statements that the proceedings are a chance for her to clear things. In a separate statement on Wednesday, Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas noted that Duterte seems to be backtracking and allegedly looks to evade accountability again. Whatever happened to her earlier statement welcoming the impeachment and preparing her defense team? Brosas asked. It is evident now that she is backtracking on her words. Hindi lang ito tungkol sa kanyang pagtanggi sa accountability, kundi pati sa kanyang mga salita, she added.

Impeach trial not dependent on the whim of Senate president De Lima,"MANILA, Philippines The Constitution did not leave the time period for holding the impeachment trial upon the whim of the Senate President. These were the words used by former Sen. Leila de Lima when she argued that the impeachment trial against Vice President Sara Duterte must be conducted immediately upon the documents transmittal from the lower chamber. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, De Lima explained that public clamor is no longer necessary to push for the trial. READ: Escudero: Senate should not rush to finish impeachment process If public clamor is still needed for the Senate to immediately hold an impeachment trial after the House files the Articles of Impeachment, then the Constitution would have mandated a plebiscite, she said. READ: Chua: Were not rushing Senate, but Constitution says forthwith But the Constitution did not. It said that trial by the Senate shall forthwith follow, meaning immediately. The Constitution did not leave the time period for holding the impeachment trial upon the whim of the Senate President, she emphasized. Similar to what was voiced by Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel, de Lima said the term forthwith as underscored in the Philippine constitution pertaining to the conduct of an impeachment trial means immediate, thus the chamber is mandated to hold the trial as immediately. At anu namang kalokohan na ikukumpara pa si VP Sara kay Kristo para lamang ipagtanggol ang pagdedelay ng Senado sa impeachment trial? It simply shows the Senate Presidents bankruptcy of arguments, she said. De Lima aired her remarks after Senate President Chiz Escudero, also on Wednesday, told reporters that he doesnt believe there is a public clamor for them to convene into an impeachment court now. The Senate chief particularly noted that there are people asking for it, but he emphasized that he doesnt treat a singular case as clamor. Saang libro naman sinabing naging clamor na yung isang kaso. May nakalagay ba sa depinisyon ng clamor at dapat limang kaso, sampung kaso, labing limang kaso, dalawampung kaso bago maging clamor. Iisa pa lang yung kaso. Ang sumusulat lang sa akin, tatlo pa lang. Teka muna, kailan magiging clamor, ilang sulat. Tatlo pa lang. Tatlong sulat, isang kaso clamor na ba yun libro mo? Sa libro ko hindi. Pangalawa, babalik tanawan natin ang panahon ni Jesus. May clamor, napako siya sa krus. Hindi naman ibig sabihin non totoo at tama yun, said Escudero. The Senates top leader earlier disclosed that the impeachment trial against Duterte will commence after President Bongbong Marcos fourth State of the Nation Address in July. President Marcos himself previously said that he would willingly call a special session of the Senate to tackle the impeachment of Duterte if the upper chamber asks for it. But Escudero already made clear that he has no intentions of requesting for a special session, maintaining that it is not one of the reasons to call for such a thing.

Over 32M votes rendered useless if VP impeach trial succeeds lawyer,"MANILA, Philippines The over 32 million votes Vice President Sara Duterte got in the 2022 elections will be considered useless if the impeachment trial against her becomes successful, a lawyer said on Tuesday. This is how Atty. Martin Delgra, former Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board chairman, reacted to the statement of Makabayan block lawmakers that the petition filed before the Supreme Court to stop the impeachment trial is a last ditch effort to escape scrutiny. READ: Petition vs impeachment trial shows Duterte camp desperation Makabayan According to Delgra, if the lawmakers constitutionally followed the impeachment process, they would not have filed the petition. READ: Petition to stop impeachment trial vs VP Duterte filed at Supreme Court Thats the reason why we pursued this because as we, as registered voters who voted for the Vice President, will make our vote inutil kasi kung successful yung impeachment. Mawawalang silbi yung boto namin, Delgra said in a press conference. Duterte won a landslide victory in the 2022 elections with a total of 32,208,417 votes, drawing over 22 million margin against her closest opponent, former senator Francis Pangilinan. Nakita niyo naman siguro, nirailroad yung proceeding. There was no debate, there was no deliberation. It was just introduced, and voted upon, Delgra added. Further, Atty. Israelito Torreon, one of the petitioners, argued that the impeachment complaint is constitutionally deficient, and is a violation of pertinent constitutional provisions and is likewise jurisdictionally void and the same should be dismissed and not entertained by the Senate of the Republic of the Philippines. Under Article 11, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution, a verified complaint shall be included in the Order of Business within 10 session days, and referred to the proper Committee within three session days thereafter. Further, the fourth paragraph of Article 11, Section 3 states that a verified complaint filed by at least one-third of the House members shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment and trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed.

"VP camp in panic mode over impeachment, says House prosecutor","MANILA, Philippines The camp of Vice President Sara Durterte is now in panic mode when it filed a petition to stop the proceedings of the impeachment trial against her before the Supreme Court , according to a lawmaker. A petition for certiorari and prohibition was earlier by a group of Mindanawan lawyers before the high court to halt the impeachment complaint that was filed against Durterte. The said petition requests a temporary restraining order and seeks to nullify the impeachment complaint. READ: Duterte allies ask SC: Stop Sara impeach trial Its panic mode now for VP Duterte. Even without reading the petition filed a while ago, we can assure the public that it can only mean two things: its purely a publicity stunt or unmistakable proof that the camp of the Vice President is in panic mode, said Rep Jil Bongalon of Ako Bicol party list in a statement made on Tuesday. Bongalon emphasized that the impeachment complaint against Duterte filed two weeks ago, meets all constitutional requirements for trial in the Senate. The impeachment complaint against VP Durterte lasted two weeks and met all the constitutional requirements for the trial in the Senate, he said. The Constitution sets clear and basic requirements for an impeachment complaint to move forward: it must be filed by at least one-third of the House of Representatives, verified, have the votes of each member recorded, and cannot be initiated more than once within a one-year period, Bongalon noted. Bongalon likewise claimed that Duretes camp is employing delay tactics in order to avoid a Senate trial that could expose damaging evidence against her. In their utter desperation, the Vice Presidents camp is throwing the proverbial kitchen sink to stop the inevitablefor the Senate to commence trial and for the public to finally see the overwhelming and damning evidence against her, Bongalon asserted. He then called Durteres side to stop legal maneuvers and to stop these stunts and face the chargers head-on.

She said 40 percent of the applicable minimum wages of the beneficiaries will be shouldered by DOLE and the remaining 60 percent by the employer. Interested applicants may directly apply to private and public establishments or DOLE Ilocos Norte Field Office, as the application is now ongoing. As of this posting, private employers like Chowking, Zarks Burgers, and Ramen Naijiro have committed to hiring some of the students and OSY as crew members. Others who will be hired will be deployed to government offices to do clerical jobs and provide general assistance to the public. Martin said all beneficiaries, either working in private or public establishments, are entitled to insurance coverage valid for a year.

Escudero: Senate preparing for VP Sara Dutertes impeachment trial,"MANILA, Philippines The Senate is preparing for Vice President Sara Dutertes impeachment trialbut the proceedings will not start until sessions resume, Senate President Francis Escudero said on Wednesday. Escudero confirmed the matter at a press conference. He explained that the Senate is slowly but surely building up in connection with the case. As part of the preparations, the Senate has begun checking materials used in previous impeachment proceedings, gauging if these can still be reused or must be replaced. Thats part of the Senates preparations. We have inspected if the tables and witness stands that were used have been eaten by termites. We located it and placed it in respective areas for us to see what needs to be done, he said. Just like I said, because the impeachment complaint has already been filed, it is now certain that there will be an impeachment trial so the Senate must prepare. We are not wasting our time despite it being recess, he added. The Senate chief also said that apart from conducting a mock-up, they have begun looking for suppliers of robes that senators would use when the chamber convenes into a court. We are canvassing for robes. We are now fixing the system for visitors, as well as the ID of the other side because they will go there every day like employees. We are doing this so that they would no longer log in the books, he explained. We are now fixing the processes and systems so that the procedure will be smooth.

Makabayan solons slam Sara Dutertes bid to stop impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines Lawmakers from the Makabayan bloc have called out Vice President Sara Duterte again for filing a petition seeking to stop the impeachment trial against her, as it runs contrary to initial statements that the proceedings are a welcome development for her. In a statement on Wednesday, Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas noted that Duterte previously said that the impeachment may be a good venue to address issues thrown against her only for her to backtrack and allegedly evade accountability. Whatever happened to her earlier statement welcoming the impeachment and preparing her defense team? Brosas asked. It is evident now that she is backtracking on her words. Hindi lang ito tungkol sa kanyang pagtanggi sa accountability, kundi pati sa kanyang mga salita, she added. Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel meanwhile said the impeachment trial at the Senate would have been the proper venue for Duterte to address her side, but it seems the Vice President does not want to show up again. The proper venue for raising objections and addressing concerns is within the impeachment court, not through premature legal actions, Manuel said. It is disappointing to see the Vice President attempting to hinder the process instead of embracing it as an opportunity to defend herself, as she claimed she was ready to do. She is deceiving and confusing the few supporters she has left, she added. On Tuesday, Duterte through her lawyers including her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, seeking a temporary restraining order on the impeachment proceedings due to alleged violation of Constitutional provisions stating that only one impeachment complaint will be initiated against a sitting official per year. READ: VP Sara Duterte files petition at SC to stop impeachment moves against her Vice President Duterte was impeached last February 5 after 215 House of Representatives members filed and verified a fourth complaint. The articles of impeachment were immediately sent to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution states that trial shall begin forthwith if the verified complaint was submitted by one-thirds of all House members. With 306 lawmakers in the House, the goal was to get at least 102 members to sign the complaint. READ: House impeaches Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate This is not the first time however that lawmakers expressed skepticism about Duterte addressing issues in a formal setting. Last December 2024, House lawmakers said they think Vice President Sara Dutertes pronouncements that she will address issues thrown at her once the impeachment proceedings start might just be another lip service as she failed to make the most of past chances. Zambales 1st District Rep. Jefferson Khonghun noted that Duterte has had the chance to defend her actions during the House hearings on her offices alleged misuse of confidential funds, and before the National Bureau of Investigation when it investigated her threats against President Ferdinand Marcos, First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, and House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez. However, Khonghun said the Vice President skipped all of these. READ: Solons fear VP Dutertes vow to face impeach raps is just lip service For ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro, this is only proof that Duterte has shown a pattern of avoiding accountability. The Vice Presidents move to halt the impeachment trial through the Supreme Court is a clear indication of her refusal to face the charges against her at the appropriate venue, Castro said. The appropriate venue is the impeachment court, not the Supreme Court. By resorting to legal maneuvers, she is reinforcing a troubling pattern of avoiding accountability, she added. Despite the transmittal of the articles of impeachment to the Senate, trial has yet to start as there were questions whether it is proper for the 19th Congress to start the proceedings when the 2025 midterms elections would surely change the composition in the Senate. For the House, it is also being quizzed if it is correct to appoint prosecutors as the lawmakers would have to get reelected first if trial crosses to the 20th Congress. Even former Sen. Leila de Lima supporter of moves to impeach Duterte and spokesperson for the first set of complainants admitted last January 17 that these issues are open questions.

DA: Local fish Tamban can now be exported,"MANILA, Philippines The local fish Tamban, or Herring fish, can now be exported after being included in the Codex Alimentarius Commissions international food standards for fish and fishery products, the Department of Agriculture said. In a statement, the DA explained that the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization established the CACto set global food safety standards to protect consumers and ensure fair trade practices. This is welcome news for the local fishery industry, a major export earner for the Philippines. This should stimulate new investments in the sector and create new jobs, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday. According to the DA, Tambans inclusion in the codex was the result of six years of advocacy and technical discussions through the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute . Ulysses Montojo, chairperson of NFRDIs Subcommittee on Fish and Fishery Products, led the initiative to complete the technical requirements for Tamban, or Sardinella lemuru. The study, supported by a P17 million funding from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Department of Agricultures Bureau of Agricultural Research, fulfilled the technical criteria necessary for the species inclusion in the Codex, the DA said. READ: Samar town tagged as model for low fish harvest losses Tamban, a sardine species native to the Eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, faced export restrictions in European markets, according to the DA. Between 2016 and 2017, several European Union countries rejected imports of canned sardines labeled as Sardinella lemuru, citing its non-inclusion in the EUs Codex Standard for Canned Sardines and Sardine-Type Products, the DA said. The rejection led to the loss of hundreds of metric tons of exports, underscoring the need to update the codex, the DA noted.

Escudero: Senate budget for Sara Duterte impeachment trial set under P1M,"MANILA, Philippines Senate President Chiz Escudero said the upper chamber is poised to spend less than a million for the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte. At a press conference on Wednesday, the Senate chief said the estimated cost does not include lawyer fees, explaining that the chamber intends to engage with the services of some practicing lawyers and law firms, although the matter has yet to be finalized. [S]a tingin ko, labas ang lawyer fees, because we plan to engage the services of some practicing lawyers and law firm[s] although hindi pa nasasapinal yon, yon wala pang amount. Wala pa sigurong isang milyon ang gagastusin namin, said Escudero. Included in this ballpark figure are the following: Yung lawyer fees, yon ang wala pa. Pero yong basic preparations, yong lamesa, yong ganon mga one lang kasi yong kuryente ganon din naman, yong aircon, yong tubig ganon din pareho lang din naman. Hindi naman magbabago, hindi naman kailangang dagdagan pa yon, because we do hold sessions in the morning sometimes, we do hold committee hearings in the morning so its going to be the same, said Escudero. The Senate chief said each senator-judge may have their own additional expenses, but it would be charged to their respective offices. Most, if not all, have law firms retained to advise them on legal matters so, kasama na yon sa budget nila hindi na kami maglalabas ng dagdag pera pa doon, he said.

A team of intelligence operatives and personnel from Police Station 4 was dispatched to the area. The responding officers successfully located and pursued the suspects.

The motorcycle driver died, while the backrider was wounded and arrested. The alleged armed encounter occurred at around 5:30 p.m., according to a separate statement issued by Police Regional Office 3.

Samar province opens health center for kids with special needs,"TACLOBAN CITY, Philippines A health professional in the region lauded the Samar provincial government for establishing the Center for Developmental Pediatrics which will provide professional and medical intervention for children with special needs. Having a facility that will cater to children with special needs is very important for the region, according to Dr. Sheryll Baez Palami, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician and consultant at the Eastern Visayas Medical Center . Although we already have this at the EVMC, this is not enough, Palami said, adding the medical facility cannot fully cater to the needs of children with special needs considering that they need special treatment and care. The CDP, launched by the provincial government on Feb. 12 at the Spark Samar Development Hub in Catbalogan City, offers occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy. Palami said in an interview Wednesday that having a facility run by a local government unit such as the CDP in Samar would help those who come from poor families. She said other LGUs in the region should follow suit because this will greatly help their constituents. During the launch, Governor Sharee Ann Tan said this initiative is a significant step towards human capital development, ensuring that every child, regardless of their challenges, receives the support they deserve. Investing in the well-being and future of our children is among my top priorities. Through the Samar Center for Developmental Pediatrics, we are building a more inclusive and supportive community where every child has the opportunity to thrive, she said. The center will not only provide therapy services but will also play a crucial role in parent and teacher education to better equip families and educators with the knowledge and skills needed to support children with special needs effectively. The CDP will be under the direct supervision of the Samar Provincial Hospital to ensure that the highest standards of medical and therapeutic care are provided to children in need. Those who want to avail themselves of the services of the health care facility will have to visit the center and present the PhilHealth identification card of the parents and the birth certificate of the child. Non-residents of Samar may also avail themselves of the services of the center by filling out a registration form online, submitting the needed requirements, and sending it through the centers e-mail address.

Joan Padilla told reporters at the unveiling of the cleaning effort at Fort Santiago on Thursday. This is the start of our commitment that we will preserve all the built heritage here in Intramuros, Padilla added. Padilla shared that the fortification in Fort Santiago had gone through manual cleaning before and for the first time, it underwent a restorative, thorough cleaning.

"More Filipinos back Marcos admin than the Dutertes, solon claims","MANILA, Philippines La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V believes that a recent survey showed that more Filipinos support the current administration rather than former President Rodrigo Dutertes family and allies. In a statement on Thursday, Ortega referred to the OCTA Research survey released on Wednesday. The research showed that 36 percent of respondents supported the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., while only 18 percent backed the Dutertes and their allies. According to Ortega, this survey also shows that siding with a political faction is not just about supporting personalities. Rather, it is a decision to back the interests of the Philippines or of China, he said. This survey confirms that Filipinos are firmly standing with Team Pilipinas, rejecting leaders who have compromised the nation for China whether by surrendering our rights in the West Philippine Sea or enabling the unchecked rise of Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators controlled by Chinese interests, Ortega said. According to the survey, 8 percent of the respondents support the opposition those belonging to the Liberal Party and who align themselves with former Vice President Leni Robredo. There were also 26 percent who tagged themselves as independent, while 12 percent did not give an answer. Ortega believes that during Dutertes time, the Philippines territorial claim to the West Philippine Sea weakened, while several moves were made that gave rise to illegal activities in Pogos, money laundering, and other organized crimes. READ: Make PH a province of China, Duterte jokes in front of Chinese envoy READ: Duterte on PH court win over China: Thats just paper; Ill throw that in the wastebasket Dutertes loyalty to China wasnt just about the West Philippine Sea. It extended to Pogos, which became hubs for crime, human trafficking, and corruption, the House member said. The damage his administration caused is still being cleaned up today, he said. President Bongbong Marcos is standing up for the country. He is defending our waters, going after illegal Pogos, and cutting off Chinas backdoor influence, the lawmaker went on. That is why Filipinos are with Team Pilipinas, not Team China, he concluded. When he was president, Duterte was credited with repairing ties with China, which were strained by his predecessors protest and defiance of Chinese intrusion over the WPS.

Calleja also pointed out that only Duterte benefited from Escuderos premature adjournment. We have questions: Why that unconstitutional rush? Who benefited from [Escuderos] premature adjournment?

"Dalipe: Duterte allies weaponizing Ombudsman, targeting House leaders","MANILA, Philippines Allies of former chief executive Rodrigo Duterte are trying to weaponize the Office of the Ombudsman to fight back against the House of Representatives leaders and members following their decision to impeach Vice President Sara Duterte. House Majority Leader Manuel Jose Dalipe said this after Davao del Norte 1st District Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez and others filed a motion with the Ombudsman seeking his suspension, along with Speaker Martin Romualdez, former House appropriations committee chairperson and Ako Bicol Party-list Representative Zaldy Co; and acting appropriations committee chair Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo. READ: Duterte allies seek suspension of 4 House leaders before Ombudsman Alvarez, along with lawyer Ferdie Topacio and others lodged the motion on the basis of an earlier complaint they filed against the four House leaders over the alleged P241 billion worth of insertions in the 2025 national budget. Alvarezs suspension call is a desperate attempt to weaponize the Ombudsman for political retaliation because the House remains steadfast in upholding transparency and accountability, regardless of political affiliations, Dalipe said in a statemen on Thursday. We trust that the Ombudsman will not allow itself to be used as a tool for political games and will dismiss this baseless request for preventive suspension. Speaker Romualdez and the House leadership will continue working for the people, unshaken by these desperate political maneuvers, he added. Dalipe likewise called the moves against them a tactic to divert attention away from the impeachment of the vice president. Clearly, they are using this complaint as a diversionary tactic to shift public attention away from the real issuethe impeachment case against the Vice President and the accountability questions she must answer, he said. Similar to his earlier sentiments, Dalipe questioned the timing of Alvarez and others motion, which he said meant to pressure the House and create a false narrative that undermines the integrity of its leadership. However, we will not be intimidated by these tactics. The House remains focused on serving the Filipino people, ensuring government funds are used properly, and holding public officials accountable, regardless of political connections, the House leader stressed. Lets be clear: the General Appropriations Bill is a product of rigorous, transparent, and lawful deliberations. The allegations of insertions are misleading and baseless, designed to discredit Speaker Romualdez and the House leadership for purely political ends. If there are genuine concerns, they should be addressed within the proper legislative processes, not through political harassment, he maintained. Last February 10, Duterte allies filed two counts of falsification of legislative documents and 12 counts of graft against Romualdez, Dalipe, Co, and Quimbo. Two others were referred to as John Doe and Jane Doe in the complaint sheet. They also face the same complaints for alleged violation of Article 170 of the Revised Penal Code and Section 3 of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

Solons firm: SC wont find blanks in budget documents,"MANILA, Philippines The Supreme Court would not find blanks if it combed through the 2025 national budget documents, two House of Representative leaders said on Friday. House Assistant Majority Leaders Jude Acidre of Tingog Party-list and Jil Bongalon of Ako Bicol Party-list reaffirmed such sentiments as the SC ordered the lower chamber, along with the Senate and Malacaang to submit the original copies of the 2025 General Appropriations Bill and the 2025 general appropriations enrolled bill ahead of the preliminary conference for a petition alleging irregularities in the national budget. I stand by the regularity of the 2025 GAA . It is above board. In fact, we welcome this initiative on the part of the Supreme Court to really require the copy of the enrolled bill, Acidre said in a statement: Bongalon meantime said the House would comply with the High Courts request. But again, we are confident that even if we submit or send the original copies of the GAA of 2025, including the encoded bill to the Supreme Court, nothing in those documents, we can see any blank items, especially the amounts that are being questioned, Bongalon said in a statement. In their petition for certiorari and prohibition, former Executive Secretary Victor Rodriguez, Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab, and other petitioners claimed that the bicameral conference committee submitted a report containing blank items on the GAB, allegedly violating the 1987 Constitution. They asked the high tribunal to declare Republic Act No. 12116, or the GAA of 2025, unconstitutional. The GAB is the proposed law detailing the governments budget and allocations for agencies, programs, and projects, while the bicameral report is the reconciled version of the budget bills from the House and Senate. Once signed by the President, the GAB becomes the GAA. Acidre, meanwhile, noted that the petitioners are allies of House-impeached Vice President Sara Duterte who, he said, only filed such a petition for diversion. While we welcome this, its good to remind the people that this is an attempt to really deflect the issue from the impeachment into all these cases which from our end is simply trying to take attention away from the impeachment process, Acidre said.

House of Representatives that the one-year prohibition on the filing of new impeachment complaints will start only after the charges are forwarded to the House committee on justice. Petitioners who want to stop the impeachment proceedings against Duterte are citing Paragraph 5 of Article XI, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution, which states that no impeachment proceedings shall be initiated against the same official more than once within a period of one year. So the one-year ban hadnt set in, had not set in, because if we recall the case of Francisco versus House of Representatives, the one-year ban will start from what we have as a term which is initiation, whether the impeachment proceedings have been initiated and initiated under this Francisco case, means the filing of the complaint endorsed by a congressman and referred to the committee on justice, Zamora said. So it is not the mere filing of a complaint that will trigger the one-year period within which to count before the next complaint will be considered as part. So hindi pa po nag-set yong one-year , he added. Zamora also maintained that the way the impeachment complaint was verified by 215 lawmakers and how the articles of impeachment were transmitted to the Senate, were regular. This is contrary to the claims of petitioners who want Dutertes impeachment trial stopped. Two petitions seeking to stop the impeachment complaints were filed before the SC on Tuesday. Mindanao-based lawyers asked the SC to stop the Senate from proceeding with the impeachment trial since the House supposedly did not observe the Constitutions rules, which require it to act on filed impeachment complaints within 10 session days. House Secretary General Reginald Velasco on Tuesday said the issue is already moot, as the three impeachment complaints that were not used have been sent to the archives. Vice President Duterte herself, represented by allied lawyers including her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, also asked the SC on Tuesday to stop the impeachment proceedings. Dutertes petition was hinged on a supposed violation of constitutional provisions stating that only one impeachment complaint would be initiated against a sitting official per year. On Wednesday, Velasco maintained that the House has complied with the 1987 Constitutions provisions when lawmakers impeached Vice President Sara Duterte and sent the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Duterte was impeached last February 5, 2025, after 215 House members filed and verified a fourth complaint. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Marcos wants to shift away from car-centric system: Mass transit is key,"MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. wants to veer away from a transportation system centered on private cars, said Department of Transportation chief Vivencio Vince Dizon on Friday. Dizon made the pronouncement during a Palace press conference when he himself admitted that the current transportation system is too car-centric. Absolutely, its true. In the past the solution to traffic has always been building roads, the problem with building roads, building roads attracts more cars. Thats just how it is, said Dizon. Build wider streets, and of course, buying cars is also a function of the development of our fellow countrymen, so we have to veer away from that and I think we are veering away from that and that is what the President wants, Dizon added partly in Filipino. According to Dizon, creating new roads is not the ultimate solution, but rather a high-capacity mass transit and making cities more conducive to walking. We just have to think out of the box and find wayslike the [Edsa Greenways] thats one innovative way of helping our commuting public who want to walk, Dizon said, referring to a project announced in 2024 which seeks to improve the pedestrian environment in Edsa.

PNP: Crimes against property in Lucena City rise due to online gambling,"LUCENA CITY Crimes in this capital city of Quezon province decreased last year, except for crimes against property, which police attribute to gamblers addicted to online gambling. Lt. Col. Dennis de Guzman, Lucena police chief, reported on Friday that crimes in 2024 decreased by 217 cases, or 13.2 percent, compared to the previous year. However, crimes against property surged at an alarming rate beginning in December 2024 and continued into January 2025. Based on CIRAS database records and investigator interviews, 20 out of 29 apprehended suspects [in crimes against property] admitted to being addicted to online gambling via their mobile phones, he added. He also said the crime rate for property-related offenses showed a 480 percent increase compared to the previous year, which had only five recorded incidents. In the report, De Guzman cited the personal profiles of some arrested suspects. An alias May, 24, who was responsible for handling her employers daily sales collection, was lured into an online casino she discovered on Facebook. Hoping to win a jackpot, she continued gambling online, which led to more losses. At the time of her arrest, instead of depositing P20,000 in sales, she had used the money to gamble and lost P16,000. Two other suspects, Ben and Carl, both construction workers in their 30s, were arrested for attempting to rob a fried chicken stand. Both admitted they committed the crime to fund their gambling habit on their favorite online casino, Scatter. The testimonies of arrested suspects confirm that gambling addiction can impair moral judgment, leading individuals to commit theft or fraud to sustain their habits. The promise of quick wealth lures them in, but chasing losses often results in financial ruin and criminal behavior, De Guzman said. He explained that the prevalence of online gambling apps, combined with Filipinos high social media usageaveraging 8 hours and 52 minutes dailyhas made online gambling more accessible and its consequences more severe. To prevent local police from engaging in online gambling, De Guzman said they have been conducting routine checks on officers mobile phones for signs of gambling activity.

Antique airport to fully open as Legarda secures funding for its completion,"MANILA, Philippines Driven by her vision to transform Antique into a thriving hub for commerce, tourism, and economic growth, Sen. Loren Legarda has laid the groundwork of the redevelopment and modernization of Antique Airport in San Jose de Buenavista, Antique. The four-term Senator has secured the funding of the construction of a new airport terminal since 2017, during her tenure as the Chair of Senate Committee on Finance. Now, Antique Airport is poised to fully open soon after Legarda successfully secured the necessary funding for the completion of its terminal building and the extension of its runway to 1,800 meters, making it comparable to Caticlans runway and enabling it to accommodate larger aircraft, particularly Airbus models. Under the 2025 General Appropriations Act , Senator Loren Legarda and Congressman Antonio Agapito AA Legarda have secured 125 million to complete the terminal building and runway expansion of Antique Airport. This long-awaited development marks a major leap in strengthening the provinces air connectivity and economic potential. In less than a decade, with the support of my brother and through the initiatives we have tirelessly pursued, the province will soon witness the full operations of Antique Airport. No longer just a quiet province on the sidelines, Antique is emerging as a vital gateway for commerce, tourism, and development, the senator shared. The transformation of Antique Airport has been a long-term effort led by Senator Legarda. Initially, in 2016, the runway measured only 1,200 meters. By 2018, it was extended to 1,400 meters, allowing 80-seater propeller aircraft to land. Further expansion took place in 2023, extending the runway to 1,700 meters. With the funding secured under 2025 GAA, the runway is now set for another extension to 1,800 meters, enabling it to accommodate larger aircraft, including Airbus models. During her ocular inspection to the airport, Legarda underscored the importance of ensuring that the infrastructure is not only completed but also built to withstand potential hazards and operational and environmental challenges. She tasked the DOTr and DPWH to develop a master plan for the airports drainage system to prevent flooding and prepare a comprehensive update presentation on the airports progress. The former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives representing the province of Antique emphasized the significance of this project in improving Antiques accessibility and economic opportunities. Ensuring the proper development of Antique Airport is crucial in strengthening our provinces connectivity and economic potential. Every peso allocated must translate into real progress for the people of Antique, Legarda stated.

Asean countries asked to work together to stop illicit tobacco trade,"MANILA, Philippines Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations should work together to stop the spread of illegal tobacco trade which has been harming legitimate businesses in the region, according to international experts. The experts made the call during the National Tobacco Administrations Second International Tobacco Summit, emphasizing the need for a regional and holistic approach to address the growing crisis. Rodney Van Dooren, regional illicit trade expert for Philip Morris International, highlighted the cross-border nature of the illicit tobacco trade and the importance of cooperation among ASEAN nations. Local law enforcement in the Philippines is making great strides in shutting down illicit tobacco operations, but this needs constant attention as new threats are always emerging. What I want to emphasize today is that according to trade data and news articles in the Philippines, most non-compliant cigarettes in the Philippines originate from ASEAN countries and India, and from China for non-compliant e-cigarettes, said Van Dooren. He outlined key recommendations, including compliance with destination market regulations, harmonization of transit country regulations, leveraging international trade agreements, and expanding cooperation beyond customs authorities. An export without a corresponding import should trigger international cooperation, Van Dooren said, as he called on ASEAN nations to adopt a shared responsibility framework. He also emphasized using platforms like the World Customs Organization and World Trade Organization to facilitate enforcement. Van Dooren noted that the Philippines has implemented several measures, including a Bureau of Internal Revenue whitelist of approved manufacturers, importers, exporters, and brands; a temporary ban on online sales of e-cigarettes; and amendments to the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Bill to include tobacco products. Despite these efforts, illicit trade persists due to high demand and price gaps between legal and illegal products. Its really about supply and demandonce there is demand, therell be supply, Van Dooren said. READ: Tobacco industry regulator ups fight vs illegal trade with intl summit Australian security expert Rohan Pike, who has studied illicit tobacco markets globally, echoed this view. In a May 2024 interview with ABC News, he pointed out that Australias high tobacco prices have fueled a black market dominated by organized crime. The number one driver of the problem is the enormous price of tobacco, Pike said, noting that even law-abiding citizens turn to illicit products when prices reach extreme levels. Speaking at the summit, Pike emphasized that government action should not rely on seizures alone. Simply seizing tobacco and illicit products is not nearly enough. Seizures have no relevance whatsoever in stopping an illicit market, he said. NTA Administrator Belinda Sanchez also cited the need for a holistic approach. The increasing illicit trade in tobacco is a growing concern, undermining our efforts and threatening the livelihoods of countless individuals, she said. We need a holistic approach to tackle this problem, one that addresses not just the symptoms but also the root causes. A multifaceted approach that combines regulation, education, and community engagement. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

National Rare Disease Week: Easing the pain of suffering in silence,"MANILA, PhilippinesFor many Filipinos, receiving a medical diagnosis is supposed to provide clarity. But for those with rare diseases, it often raises more questions than answers. What comes next? Will treatment be available? How much will it cost? And perhaps the hardest question of all: Will life ever be the same? Living with a rare disease means more than just managing a complex condition. Its navigating a world that isnt built for you one where doctors may not have answers, medicines are out of reach, and understanding from others is scarce. READ: Diagnosed with rare illness, flight attendant finds ways to heal, soar In the Philippines, an estimated 6,500 individuals live with one of the 156 recognized rare diseases, yet many still struggle in silence. From February 22-28, the country observes National Rare Disease Week 2025, culminating in World Rare Disease Day on February 28. This years theme, More than You Can Imagine, highlights the unseen struggles and extraordinary resilience of individuals with rare diseases, while the campaign #CareForRarePH calls for better health care, stronger support systems, and real inclusion for those who often feel invisible. The NRDW in the Philippines was established through Proclamation No. 1989, s. 2010, recognizing the need to increase public awareness and support for individuals with rare diseases. The week-long observance aims to advocate for equitable health care, improve policies, and highlight the struggles of affected individuals and their families. World Rare Disease Day was first observed on February 29, 2008, a symbolic date that reflects the very essence of rarity, occurring only in leap years. Established by EURORDIS , the initiative aimed to raise awareness about rare diseases and their impact on patients and families. Over time, it has expanded to be recognized in more than 100 countries. Held annually on the last day of February, whether the 28th or 29th, it unites patients, health care professionals, researchers, and advocates in a global effort to promote equitable access to diagnosis, treatment, and social care for those affected by rare diseases. Rare diseases are life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect only a small fraction of the population. They require specialized medical care and social support. Globally, more than 300 million people live with rare diseases, spanning over 6,000 different conditions. Most rare diseases are genetic, with 72 percent linked to inherited disorders, and 70 percent appearing in childhood. Many of these conditions have no cure, and treatments if available can be expensive and hard to access. According to Dr. Maria Melanie Liberty B. Alcausin, director of the National Institutes of Healths Institute of Human Genetics, the classification of rare diseases varies by country, depending on their prevalence. In the United States, a disease is considered rare if it affects one in 1,500 people, while in Europe, the threshold is one in 2,000. In the Philippines, a condition is classified as rare if it affects one in 20,000 individuals. These differences result in variations in the number of officially recognized rare diseases across countries. With such low prevalence, patients often face misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, and financial hardship making early awareness crucial. Despite the passage of the Rare Diseases Act of 2016 , which was meant to ensure access to medical care and financial support for Filipinos with rare diseases, many still struggle. READ: Rare, deadly diseases in PH get attention from barely enforced law According to the Philippine Society for Orphan Disorders , the lack of widespread awareness, limited funding, and scarce medical expertise create significant roadblocks. Filipino patients born with rare disorders are orphaned by society. They suffer from social abandonment because of lack of existing network of support to aid them. Medical help is elusive under the conditions of the countrys health priority, PSOD explained. The nature of their illness is hardly known due to lack of information and only a few medical professionals, particularly in the country, are aware of these disorders and know how to diagnose and address these conditions, they added. READ: Healthcare experts: Rare disease law fund remains inadequate Alcausin meanwhile outlined several key challenges in providing health care for individuals with rare diseases during a talk at the NIH 25th anniversary conference in 2023. These include: For many families, the cost of managing a rare disease is overwhelming. When available, treatments can cost millions of pesos annually, making them out of reach for most Filipinos. READ: PhilHealth expands benefits to cover rare diseases, mobility devices Moreover, medications used to treat rare diseases are known as orphan drugs a term derived from their neglect by the pharmaceutical industry due to limited demand. Persons living with rare diseases are continuously confronted by several challenges, including the need for lifelong medical management, which is often hindered by the high cost of orphan drugs and products, stated the Integrated Rare Disease Management Program Strategic Plan 2022-2026. The report further noted that since orphan drugs and medical products are not locally available, persons living with rare diseases must rely on imports. However, both donated and purchased medications remain subject to customs duties and high taxes, further increasing financial burdens. PSOD highlighted that one of the biggest challenges in rare disease research is the slow progress of clinical trials, largely due to the limited number of known cases. This lack of data hinders the development of effective treatments and potential cures. Despite these challenges, the organization acknowledged the relentless dedication of medical researchers, health care professionals, and pharmaceutical companies particularly in developed countries whose work has led to breakthrough therapies and holds promise for lifelong treatments for rare disorders. One critical area of advancement is newborn screening, which plays a vital role in early detection and treatment. The Institute of Human Genetics at the University of the Philippines Manila underscored its importance in identifying and managing rare metabolic conditions before symptoms appear, significantly improving health outcomes. The Philippines has made notable progress in addressing birth defects through the Newborn Screening program, introduced by a group of obstetricians and pediatricians from 24 Metro Manila hospitals. This initiative established baseline data on metabolic conditions, paving the way for the nationwide adoption of newborn screening. The passage of Republic Act No. 9288, or the Newborn Screening Act of 2004, further strengthened these efforts by ensuring that every newborn in the country has access to screening as part of the public health system. The law also heightened awareness among health care practitioners and parents, reinforcing the importance of early detection. The Acts focus on metabolic diseases has driven further research and diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders, supported by the National Institutes of Health Institute of Human Genetics . Since the establishment of the Biochemical Genetics Unit in 1999, the team has identified hundreds of cases of inherited metabolic diseases in the country, including: Raising awareness and pushing for better health care policies are crucial in improving the lives of individuals with rare diseases.

It is important to remember that NRDW is about more than just raising awareness it is about ensuring that individuals with rare diseases receive the care and recognition they deserve. Organizations such as PSOD remind the public that health care should not be a privilege based on how common a condition is. Every person, regardless of their diagnosis, deserves the same chance at life, health, and inclusion. Graphics by Ed Lustan/Inquirer.net.

This is what 1Pacman Partylist first nominee Milka Romero replies when she is asked by the media what her distinguished father, 3-termer 1Pacman Partylist Rep. Mikee Romero, advises her on moving ahead in life. Thus, now that Milka has her opportunity to spread her learnings on discipline, endurance, and strategic thinking, she passionately pushes forward 1Pacman Partylists advocacy for sports and youth development all over the country. Milka states : Early in my life, I have already actively engaged in sports. All the attributes I have developed as an athlete, I now use in my adult life. Una dito ang paghahanda, kasama na ang sipag sa pag-eensayo para mapahusay ang kakayahan. Pangalawa dito ang pag-alaga ng kalusugan. Mahalagang kasama din dito ay ang hindi pagsuko, ang determinasyong makamit ang mga inaasam na matamo kasama ng team. Milka is a leader not just in sports but also with socio-civic organizations and in business. A former womens football national team member, Milka takes care of her food businesses while managing the volleyball team Capital1 Solar Spikers which she co-owns with her sister Mandy. Rigorous training , high regard for fitness, determination to achieve goals as champions . we now bring all these to achieve what is best for our country. These are certainly my guide as I continue my life in public service, says Milka, who already acted as chairman of 1Pacman Partylist, primarily engaging in socio-civic works of the highly prolific 1Pacman group headed by her father which has under its record a total of 144 laws that he authored, sponsored, and co-sponsored. Under Rep. Romero, 1Pacman pursued socio-civic programs such as Save-A-Heart that gave funding to needy families of some 2,000 children with heart diseases for their diagnostic, surgery, and post-operations care. Milka helped carry out 1Pacmans assistance, in coordination with the Heart Center of the Philippines. Milka was also involved with her fathers educational assistance programs that included building of schools and grants that benefited some 30,000 scholars including those with TESDA ; and over 100,000 recipients of various assistance forms including medicines. Among trailblazing laws passed through the initiatives of Congressman Romero are the law that creates the Philippine National Sports Training Center which envisions more systematic and scientific training of gifted athletes in various sports and the Eddie Garcia Law that provides ample protection to workers in the film, TV and related creative industries. Milka states that, similar to the EGL, the protection and well-being of athletes as well as sporting officials such as coaches is a priority move beyond training and accessibility to mentorship for athletes. The whole country unites in pride and cheers vigorously with the honor that our Filipino champions bring. We want more champions to rise among our young people. But first, we need to bring out the mindsets of champions among our young people. And that already makes the nation a winner. 1Pacman is here to support the path to bring out the champion in Filipinos, said the young leader.

"Marcos: Progress, not fearmongering, is solution to PHs woes","MANILA, Philippines Initiatives seeking progress, not threats, would be the solution to the Philippines problems, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told Negros Oriental residents on Thursday. In what seems to be his latest swipe against the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos said during the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas rally in Dumaguete that improving the governments functions would be key to improving the lives of Filipinos. My fellow Filipinos, our direction is clear: Our direction is to improve the state of the Philippines, and not to oppress people. Progress, not fearmongering, is the solution. What we should do is to make our government run more efficiently, he said in Filipino. Alliances candidates are with us in upholding the interest and welfare of every Filipino. We will fight for our sovereignty and our rights through diplomacy and with our dignity maintained, he added. Marcos also doubled down on his belief that the government does not need to kill thousands of individuals just to be successful in the fight against crimes. In the fight against drugs and crimes, we do not need to go through a bloody solution, we do not believe that we need to kill thousands of Filipinos just to solve this problem. There is a proper way to ensure peace in our country, he said in Filipino. To ensure order, we need to craft good laws, ensure effective implementation, and support our police officers and, most especially, our local officials, he added. Marcos has been on the offensive since the campaign for national candidates started last February 11. During his speech at the Alliances proclamation rally in Laoag, Marcos said the administration-backed candidates are neither tainted by Oplan Tokhang nor are they pro-China. These issues were thrown against Duterte. Oplan Tokhang was the anti-illegal drugs campaign implemented during the Duterte administration, which has garnered controversy due to human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings. Duterte was also credited for repairing ties with China, which were strained by the late President Benigno Aquino IIIs decision to sue China for itsintrusion in the West Philippine Sea . Duterte, however, drew flak for joking about making the Philippines a Chinese province, and for saying that the 2016 arbitral ruling favoring Manila in its WPS dispute with Beijing was just a piece of paper that can be thrown into a waste bin. READ: Make PH a province of China, Duterte jokes in front of Chinese envoy READ: Duterte on PH court win over China: Thats just paper; Ill throw that in the wastebasket At the Alliances rally in Pasay City last Tuesday, Marcos initially paused before delivering his speech to check if candidates running under the administration-backed slate are still in one piece. Marcos joked he was checking if candidates were still healthy and safe from grenade attacks in an apparent reference to Dutertes threats to kill 15 sitting senators to make way for Partido Demokratiko Pilipinos senatorial bets. According to Marcos, people attending the Alliances rallies would not hear any threats of violence or any curses from him. He pointed out that what Filipinos would hear are the platforms of their candidates, and what they were able to do while they were in office.

"Lawyer hits promos that skirt senior, PWD discount","MANILA, Philippines The government should go after restaurants with fake promos, and remind them that seniors and persons with disability are still entitled to discounts and tax exemption against unauthorized promos, s eniors rights advocate Atty. Romulo Macalintal said on Friday. Macalintals point was made after a viral social media post from Restaurant Owners of the Philippines recently raised concerns on alleged fake PWD cards. While these are valid concerns of restaurant owners, there are valid concerns raised by PWDs and Senior Citizens about the proliferation of fake promos conducted by certain restaurant owners and even hotels in order to avoid giving [them] their 20 percent discount and 12 percent VAT exemption for the purchase of goods and services in their establishments, Macalintal said in a statement. Citing Article 116 of Republic Act 7394 or the Consumer Act of the Philippines, establishments are required to secure a permit from the Department of Trade and Industry before conducting any sales promotion campaign, commonly known as promo. Macalintal, h owever, pointed out that some restaurants and hotels conduct promos without any permit from the DTI or any concerned government agencieseven using it as a basis to deny PWDs and seniors of their discounts, claiming that its promo price is already discounted. If the restaurant owners are asking our government to implement stricter regulations against the use of fake PWD cards, then it is also necessary to strictly enforce Article 116 of RA 7384 against establishments conducting promos without approval from the DTI, said Macalintal. Hence, Macalintal said the DTI should remind establishments that if their promos are not authorized, their promo price would be treated as regular price with PWDs and seniors remaining entitled to their discount and VAT exemption. Meanwhile, Macalintal also told Resto PH that the alleged financial losses they suffered from fake PWDs could be assuaged under Section 8 of RA 10754, which provides that the establishments may claim the discounts granted as tax deductions based on the net cost of the goods sold or services rendered.

This innovative and sustainable desalination facility will provide a long-term solution to the water challenges of Iloilo, Pangilinan added. Remulla, in his keynote address, said Iloilo is very fortunate to have MPW as a partner because Cavite used to be a large market of Metro Pacific. I am very happy for Iloilo, the province that you are having. You are now a model city for the entire province, Remulla said. From a backward agricultural city, you are now the fastest growing and most progressive city in the Philippines. You are a testament to good governance, good leadership, and a united vision towards a better Philippines, he noted. Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treas and Governor Arthur Defensor Jr. expressed gratitude for the project, emphasizing its role in sustaining Iloilos growth and future water needs. The project is a joint effort between MPW, SUEZ a France-based water management solutions provider and Philippine construction firm JEMCO. The Local Water Utilities Administration hoped the facility would serve as a model for other water-scarce communities across the country.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2037098/p5-5-billion-desalination-plant-to-address-water-scarcity-in-iloilo
