"Palace defends timing of free MRT, LRT rides","MANILA, Philippines The timing of the four-day free Metro Rail Transit Line 3 and Light Rail Transit Lines 1 and 2 rides should not be given a malicious meaning, even if they were announced just weeks before the election, a Palace official said on Wednesday.

"Francis draws Tacloban youth, adults to church even after death","TACLOBAN CITY, LEYTE, Philippines The crowd at the thanksgiving Mass for Pope Francis on Saturday may not be as huge as the swarm of people that welcomed him here 10 years ago, but the spirit and essence of his visit remains alive, even after his passing. Before the Mass near the tarmac of the Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport, several young people were seen eagerly preparing for the thanksgiving mass officiated by Monsignor Ramon Stephen Aguilos. According to Shaina Cartel and Princess Carnecerboth of whom were still young children when Francis visited Tacloban in January 2015they had the urge to thank the late Pope for his contributions to the world, and for standing with the city and the entire Western Visayas region during tough times. READ: Pope Francis in PH: A look back at his 2015 trip to Manila, Leyte Our involvement today is we are some of the servers for this Mass and we are also church volunteers coming from different parishes, Cartel said. It feels an honor and privilege po for us to serve, to give tribute to him, Carnecer added. Cartel said that they felt sad upon learning of Francis passing, which is why they want to show how grateful Tacloban is for the Popes service and efforts.

Another volunteer, John Carl Soledad, said he was not able to attend Francis mass in January 2015 but he knew how important the popes presence was for Eastern Visayas. Actually hindi po, kasi nandon kami sa ibang barrio po kami, pero nakita ko naman po na nandirito siya, tapos, as a Taclobanon super happy kami na nandito siya sa Tacloban, kaya nandito kami ngayon para sa tribute para sa kanya, Soledad said. Maribeth dela Pea, a church volunteer who was able to witness both Yolandas impact and Francis visit, said that they do not understand how they really felt the popes sincerity and love when he came here. Naaalala namin si Pope Francis nang pumunta siya dito sa Tacloban, ramdam namin ang pagmamahal na pinakita niya sa amin, tapos yong parang kahit na malayo ang mga tao, pinuntahan niya pa rin. Ramdam mo talaga yong pagmamahal niya sa amin, ipinakita niya na may pag-asa kami, she said. Masakit sa damdamin namin na nawala na siya iniwan niya ang mga ala-ala, hindi namin makakalimutan, she added. According to Dela Pea, she does not want to recall the hardships caused by Yolanda but the mere presence of Francis gave them the mindset that they can recover from any trial. Parang ayoko nang maalala kasi, kasi ma-ano talaga, parang ano ba pero nang dumating si Pope Francis, nasabi namin na nandito yong kakampi namin, nagbigay ng pag-asa sa Tacloban na bumangon at saka magpatuloy, she added. More tributes poured as Francis was laid to his final resting place at the Basilica of St. Mary Major. Earlier, House of Representatives Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez recalled Francis visit to Tacloban by stressing that more than giving hope to people, the pope showed how it is to lead by example and with compassion. Earlier, Aguilos also said that Francis life is a challenge to Christians to stand with the suffering and marginalized while at the same time leaving ones comfort zones. In his homily, Aguilos said Francis visit to Tacloban in January 201510 years agoshould remind Filipinos to be like the yellow raincoat that the pontiff wore before, shielding other people during times of tribulation. Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, passed away last April 21 morning in the Vaticanor just a day after the Catholic world celebrated Easter Sunday to commemorate Jesus Christs resurrection. He was 88. Francis passing came after making a much hoped-for appearance at Saint Peters Square. Prior to his return to his duties, Francis suffered from a bout with pneumonia, during which insiders said he came close to dying twice. In the Philippines, those who witnessed him in Tacloban said that Francis visit and words enabled them to continue fighting for their future, and having faith that things will be better. But aside from what happened during the papal visit to Leyte and Manila, Filipinos also remembered Francis for ushering change in a Church riddled by controversies, a hardline stance on conservatism, and allegations of indifference for the poor and marginalized. People from all over the globe have thanked Francis for being kind, and for opening the church to people from diverse backgrounds, regardless of age, sexual orientation, financial status, religion, and history.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2056091/francis-draws-tacloban-youth-adults-to-church-even-after-death,others
"Antibiotic-resistant salmonella found in local poultry, says a UP study","MANILA, Philippines Salmonella with high levels of resistance to antimicrobial drugs were found in chicken meat sold in wet markets across Metro Manila. This discovery came from a study by scientists at the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Science Institute of Biology . They made the statement on Friday. Salmonella is a food-borne bacteria that, if ingested, can lead to abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea and vomiting from two to seven days. As for the studys samples, the UPD CS IB said, High levels of multidrug resistance were observed when tested against antimicrobial panels, with a total of 50 ARGs detected, conferring resistance to 12 different drug classes. Antimicrobial drugs are used on food-producing animals like chickens to prevent disease and promote growth, according to the World Health Organization . But WHO also warned that misuse and overuse of antimicrobials can make bacteria resistant to the drugs and then, the bacteria can be transmitted to humans, especially through food. Our study suggests a need for proper surveillance of contaminating bacteria as well as regulations on antimicrobial use at the farm level, the UPD IB CS said.

Abby Binay: `Why criticize P20/kg rice program? The people need help,"DAGUPAN CITY, Pangasinan The government is facing a scenario where it will be criticized whether it implements its latest P20-per-kilogram rice initiative, senatorial candidate and Makati Mayor Abby Binay said on Friday. At the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas press briefing here, senatorial candidates were asked about Vice President Sara Dutertes criticisms about the rice subsidy program, as she claimed that the initiative is too late and reeks of electioneering. Binay, however, noted that it is perplexing why the government is still being criticized even if it has actively soughtsolutions to the rice price problem. The people need help. The government is helping, but it is still criticized. Where should we stand? This position is hard, Binay said in Filipino. The timing is suspicious? Will you tell the people that well just give these lower rice prices after the elections, because they might accuse us of politicking? Thats not how the government works, Binay explained. Regarding Dutertes claim that the administration started selling their P20-per-kilogram rice in Visayas to cope with Alyansas low numbers in the region, Binay said she and former Senate President Vicente Tito Sotto III enjoy good ratings in the area. Had President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s administration intended to woo voters into picking Alyansa bets, Binay said the administration should have picked Mindanao as the pilot area for implementation. Mindanao is considered the bailiwick of the Dutertes, who hail from Davao City. Actually, its funny because I rank okay in Visayas. If you say that it is for politics, the cheaper-priced rice should be distributed to Mindanao, if that is our intention. But as far as I am concerned,personally, I and Tito Sen,in terms of the survey,we are okay inVisayas, Binay explained. And I dont thinkthe Presidentor the administrationchooses it in such a way that they gauge where we are weak or strong. I feel that the judgment callwas based onwho needs cheaper rice, she added. Another Alyansa bet, former senator Panfilo Ping Lacson, said that nothing is too late when it comes tohelping the people. When we seek to address poverty and hunger, nothing is too late, nothing is too little., he said. Duterte, in an ambush interview on Wednesday, said that the administration is resorting to rice subsidies because they know that the Alyansa slate is performing badlyin Visayas. You know that is just for the elections and for their senators who are part of their alliance to win, she said in Filipino. I dont know what their motive is. But yes, they are tricking the people with that P20 per kilo rice. And you will be confused why Visayas only, arent the people from Luzon and Mindanao hungry also? [] Maybe they have problems with votes from Visayas, she added. Last Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. also announced the availability of P20 per kilogram of rice in Visayas, adding that this development came after President Marcos held a closed-door meeting with governors from the Western, Central, and Eastern Visayas. READ: DA will start selling rice at P20 per kilo Tiu Laurel Earlier, Sotto also asked critics of the P20 per kilogram rice initiative if they would rather have these funds go to the pockets of corrupt officials instead of the people benefitting from it. READ: Sotto claps back: Fund rice subsidy for people or lose it to corruption? Theres a saying that its better late than never, right? And maybe they failed to figure this out immediately. As I said earlier, there were concerns about the government shouldering subsidies for rice. So what? That should be the case, because thats taxpayers money, it should be consumed by the people also, Sotto said. Instead of being given to the corrupt officials. Where do they want the funds to go, to the pockets of corrupt officials? Let us give that subsidy to our people so that they would not go hungry and to reduce prices of goods, he added. Sotto also said that he enjoys good support from Visayas since Cebu is his home province.

Alyansas front-runners vow to help allies behind in surveys,"SAN FERNANDO CITY, Pampanga Two of the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas front-runners in the May elections have vowed to do everything possible to help two teammates lagging in recent surveys. In separate interviews, former Senate President Vicente Tito Sotto III and ACT-CIS party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo said they will campaign for other members of the Alyansa who are outside of the Magic 12 circle, and tell voters that they also are deserving of their votes because of their good track record. The two Alyansa candidates lagging in surveys are former Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos and Sen. Francis Tolentino. Tomorrow well be going to Quirino province na hindi pupwedeng maging kampante. Pero at the same time, hindi lang, personal na lakad ko yon I will be bringingthe whole Alyansa, I mean, ika-campaign ko pa rin yong Alyansa don lalo na yong dalawang kasamahan namin na lagging behind, sasabihin ko na we really need help, Tulfo told reporters on the sidelines of a local sortie here. Kanina nga lang when I was speaking here, talking here, sabi ko kailangan ko po ng mga kasamahan ko sa Alyansa kasi kung iba-iba po ang bobotohin po ninyo, hindi po yon Alyansa, mahahaluan po tayo ng iba, baka po mahirapan po akong kumuha ng mga majority ng votes dahil numbers game po sa Senado para maipasa ang isang batas, he added. Sotto said Alyansa would just have to inform the people about what the candidates stand for and of their track record which was a major factor in how President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. came out with his Senate lineup. We just have to keep on informing the people of what we stand for, what they stand for,and what they will be able to do.Kailangan, informasyon sa ating mga kababayan at malaman nila na yong line-up na kasama namin ay pinagpiliian kami, Sotto said. May mga gusto sumama dito sa line-up na to pero ang pinili nila, ang pinili ng Alyansa yong may mga track record, may mga experience, merong ika nga mga pinanggalingan na nakatulong na sa bansa, he added. According to the Pulse Asia survey conducted from March 23 to 29, Tulfo ranked second, while Sotto was fourth. Both men are behind Partido Demokratiko Pilipino stalwarts Sen. Bong Go who is first and Sen. Ronald dela Rosa, who ranked third. Abalos and Tolentino are both inside the 19 to 22 positions, which is way below the Magic 12.

Panfilo Ping Lacson, whose ranking in surveys have fluctuated. Lacson ranked 7th in the Pulse Asia poll, but fell to 11th under the SWS survey. According to Sotto, surveys being done in different areas where one candidate may not be as popular as compared to other areas may explain the issue. We should always take it in stride, but then again, dapat yon medyo inaalagaan at tinitignan kung bakit, kasi don naman sa isang survey, sa Pulse Asia survey, mataas naman siya. As a matter of fact tabla yata kami, sa nakaraang survey. Hindi naman nakakapag-taka yong gumagalaw ang ranking mo, Sotto said. Kasi depending kung saan kinuha yong survey. Ang survey, for everybodys information, hindi the same place all the time, hindi in the same province all the time. Every survey nila palipat-lipat yan, patalon-talon yan. They dont stick to one province. So maaaring may probinsya na mapuntahan na mahina ka, at syempre bababa ang figures, numbers mo don, he explained. Earlier, Tulfo admitted that Alyansa bets expected backlash and lower survey rankings after former President Rodrigo Duterte was taken into custody by the International Criminal Court last March. During the latter part of 2024, Alyansa was dominating the senatorial race, with 10 of the then 12-person slate being included in the Magic 12. Tulfo was also the consistent topnotcher in different surveys. After Dutertes arrest, the ranking ofGo and dela Rosa surged.

Propelling the ESG agenda across Asia,"SINCE its establishment, the Asia ESG Positive Impact Consortium has been dedicated to fostering ESG knowledge-sharing, industry collaboration and meaningful engagement across the region. Over the past year, its consortium members, which consist of media powerhousesStar Media Group , KG Media and the Inquirer Group of Companies have been building a strong foundation by rolling out national-level ESG initiatives tailored to their respective markets. Each country has seen the introduction of programmes aimed at raising awareness on ESG issues and driving corporate sustainability efforts, further highlighting the influence of media in shaping public discussions on such matters. In August 2024, the second edition of the ESG Positive Impact Awards honoured Malaysian winners for embedding environmental, social and governance values into their business strategiesdemonstrating that profitability and purpose can go hand-in-hand. The increased participationsubmissions rose by 38%reflected growing momentum and a broader shift toward responsible business. Star Media Group then hosted its inaugural ESG Summit in November, convening industry leaders, investors and regulators to explore real-world solutions and innovation under the theme Shaping Aseans Sustainable Future. From policy to technology, the summit examined how practical tools are being deployed to future-proof organisations across the region. Beyond the main events, targeted platforms such as the ESG PIA Winners Showcase enabled meaningful dialogue between finalists and ESG leaders, further encouraging knowledge-sharing around regulatory shifts, long-term value creation and implementation challenges. To further strengthen ESG capabilities, the ESG Reporting and Carbon Management Workshop 2024held in March last yeardelivered hands-on training for businesses navigating reporting standards, emissions tracking and carbon management strategies, equipping participants with the tools to meet rising expectations in a data-driven landscape. In Indonesia, KG Media activated its Lestari platform to spearhead national-level conversations on sustainability. In June 2024, the Lestari Forum gathered leaders from government, business, investment, academia and civil society to address urgent environmental and social challenges, while fostering dialogue on corporate responsibility and ESG integration. This was followed by the Lestari Summit in August, which expanded the conversation under the theme Fostering Sustainability Through Inclusivity in Policy & Practices. The event explored a wide range of critical topicsfrom empowering local changemakers and unlocking financing for green industries to rethinking how policies shape sustainable outcomes. The summit culminated in the inaugural Lestari Awards 2024, celebrating companies and public sector institutions demonstrating leadership, innovation and measurable impact in advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals . Meanwhile in the Philippines, Inquirer Group of Companies has continued to grow its ESG Edge initiative, using its media platforms to highlight ESG stories, facilitate discussions and spotlight programmes aligned with its readers values. Its commitment was formalised in March 2024 through a Memorandum of Understanding signed with 11 cross-sectoral partners from business, education, environment and civil societyestablishing a shared pledge to champion best practices, promote corporate accountability and enhance community engagement on ESG matters. The engagements expanded further in September with the launch of the ESG Edge Connect Networka quarterly forum series convened to foster collaborative conversations around thematic priorities. Past sessions have addressed key issues such as quality education and gender equality, as well as hybrid energy adoption, which was explored in a session held in November 2024. Each session offers a platform for stakeholders to explore actionable strategies and co-create solutions for a more resilient and inclusive future. Each country brings unique challenges and opportunities in the sustainability landscape, and it is through these localised efforts that the true impact of ESG principles is realised, said Inquirer Group of Companies president and chief executive officer Rudyard Arbolado. In the Philippines, we focus on fostering strong networks that enable collaboration between businesses and local communities. In Indonesia, KG Medias efforts have demonstrated how media can elevate sustainable practices within industries. Meanwhile, Malaysias initiatives through Star Media Group have underscored the importance of integrating sustainability into national-level dialogues. These local engagements serve as building blocks to a stronger regional network, where shared knowledge and collective action drive the sustainability agenda forward. This is where A-EPICs success liesby creating a platform that connects local initiatives, amplifies their impact and propels the ESG movement regionally.

Sen. Legarda reiterates call: Earth Day must be every day,"In the face of a worsening climate crisis, Senator Loren Legarda underscored the need for daily actionbeyond ceremonial observanceas the true spirit of Earth Day. Earth Day should not be observed only once a year. It must be a daily reminder of our shared responsibility to protect and preserve our environment, Legarda stressed, urging Filipinos to embrace sustainable living and support clean energy policies. Aligning with this years Earth Day theme, Our Power, Our Planet, the Senator called for nationwide action to accelerate the energy transition. The energy transition cannot be left to industry alone. Our energy transition must include every Filipino. When a household installs a solar panel, participates in net-metering, or when a business chooses the green energy option, it is not merely adopting a new technologyit is asserting its right to clean air, lower costs, and a livable future. Community microgrids bring not just power to homes but economic gains to businesses, lower bills for everyone, and stronger resilience during crises, she said. Legarda, author and co-sponsor of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 and principal author and co-sponsor of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act , highlighted how energy choices directly impact public health. Cleaner energy means fewer emissionsand fewer lives lost to asthma, heart disease, and maternal complications linked to pollution. It means protecting women and children, who are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation, she noted. Beyond legislative work, Legarda appealed to the public to adopt simple but impactful habits: This Earth Day, I call on every Filipino to take partat home, in the barangay, at work. Plant trees. Turn off what you dont need. Choose LED lights. Explore solar technologies and local microgrids. Demand clean energy choices from providers and support policies that bring us closer to a decentralized, democratized energy future. Our shift to cleaner energy is more than a change in infrastructureit reflects a deeper shift in values. Throughout her public service, Legarda has championed major environmental laws, including the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act , the Climate Change Act of 2009 , and the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 forming the backbone of the countrys climate resilience and environmental protection strategy.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2055255/sen-legarda-reiterates-call-earth-day-must-be-every-day,others

For the former two-term mayor and Gawad Galing Pook Hall of Famer, whatever time he has leftthough he hopes to see his grandchildren grow upis best spent serving others. I am not going back, he said. I am giving back. Dok Eddie first served Iroson as its mayor from 1992 to 1998, where he was credited for transforming a fifth-class municipality into a model of rural development.

His decision to return to politics, he says, comes after witnessing a decline in governance in Irosin. Too much poverty. Too much corruption. Too much patronage, he said. Irosin deserves better.

Supreme Court decision to reverse ruling on commercial fishing sought,"MANILA, PhilippinesOne of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, a church leader, and environmental advocate on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to reverse a lower courts ruling allowing commercial fishingwithin 15-kilometer municipal waters, which are exclusively reserved for small-scale fishers under the countrys laws. Allowing commercial vessels to operate within municipal waters jeopardizes the livelihoods of thousands of subsistence fishers and accelerates the depletion of already fragile fish stocks, said the petitioners led by Atty. Christian Monsod, one of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, and Atty. Grizelda Mayo-Anda, a veteran environmental lawyer and advocate for coastal communities. The petition named Mercidar Fishing Corporation, Judge Zaldy Docena, the Department of AgricultureBureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and the Office of the Solicitor General as respondents. In their 31-page petition, they specifically sought reversal of the December 11, 2023 decision issued by the Regional Trial Court of Malabon City granting the petition filed by Mercidar Fishing Corporation to declare as unconstitutional Section 4 , Section 16, Section 1 and Section 18, Rule 181 of the Department of Agriculture Order No. 10 issued in 2015 as well as Section 4 , Section 16, and Section 18 of Republic Act 8550 or The Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998. The Malabon Court struck down local government jurisdiction over municipal waters and the laws mandate to give preferential access to small-scale fisherseffectively erasing what the petitioners describe as wholesale constitutional and statutory protections for coastal communities. READ: Romualdez vows to help challenge ruling on commercial fishing in municipal waters Petitioners said the trial courts decision threatens the constitutional rights of small-scale fishers and puts the countrys marine ecosystems at risk. Three grounds were specifically raised by petitioners: the failure of the DA-Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Office of the Solicitor General to discharge the public trust for the welfare of the people Malabon RTC Presiding Judge Zaldy Docena violated the doctrine o separation of powers, and failure of the respondent Mercidar Fishing Corporation to implead indispensable partices which rendered all proceedings and orders before the Malabon RTC branch 170 void. Petitioners said BFAR and the OSGmade a sluggish defense of the Fisheries Code that contributed to the RTC rulings far-reaching consequences. READ: DA appeals SC rule allowing commercial fishing in municipal waters As public service providers, the lackadaisical defense of the Public Respondents DA-BFAR and OSG of their mandates leave much to be desired, and the petitioners are now constrained to directly defend their own interests as Filipinos, concerned citizens, and stewards of nature, on behalf of the Filipino people, the petitioners said. The petitioners also branded the RTC ruling as ajudicial legislation and a gross violation of the constitutional separation of powers. As can be gleaned from the inordinate haste of the proceedings below, his procedural lapses, and his questionable conclusions, it is clear that Public Respondent Judge Zaldy Docena refused to extend any measure of deference to either Congress or the Executive, the petitioners stressed. Despite this, BFAR and several local governments have sought further legal remedies, citing the cases unresolved environmental and constitutional implications. The petitioners expressed hope that the Court will uphold constitutional principles, protect marine ecosystems, and reaffirm the rights of small-scale fishers. This is not only a legal issue, said the petitioners, but a matter of social justice, sustainability, and the future of our coastal communities.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2055585/supreme-court-decision-to-reverse-ruling-on-commercial-fishing-sought,others

FPJ Panday Bayanihans Brian Poe attends forum on natl security,"MANILA, Philippines The National Defense College of the Philippines Alumni Association, Inc. held a forum entitled Equal Voices, Equal Choices: Setting a Robust Security and Development Agenda for the 20th Congress and Beyond on April 22, 2025, in Intramuros, Manila. FPJ Panday Bayanihan Party-list First Nominee Brian Poe was honored to be invited as a panelist, proudly representing the esteemed alumni community of the National Defense College of the Philippines Alumni Association, Inc. He expressed that his fascination with national security has been a long-standing passion, one that has shaped his aspirations from a young age. During the pandemic, I decided to study a little bit on national security. I took an online certificate program with Georgetown on Counterterrorism. It was always my dream to study at the National Defense College of the Philippines. I was finally given the opportunity to do so; I just recently completed my Masters in National Security Senior Executive Program. Immediately after that, I completed my counterintelligence training with NICA to further supplement my defense and security background. I currently serve on the Multi-Sectoral Advisory Board as the co-chair of Communications for the Army Reserve Command. I also previously served until I had to resign because of the elections as an adviser on the Aviation Security Group Advisory Council., he said. When asked Ano po ang bagay na robust national security na nababagay po lalung-lalo na sa panahon po ngayon? Norberto Gonzales, former Defense Secretary and National Defense Adviser said: My major recommendation sana is to make military service compulsory over the next 5 years. I think its about time that the Philippines should start thinking kung ano naman ang kanilang plano for self-defense. Supposing were attacked, what are our preparations for this? Why am I proposing a compulsory military service for our young people? We have more than 20 million young people of the right age. And I am very sad to say this, this is the only asset we have left. To be able to build the kind of defense we need today. This perspective emphasizes the urgency for the Philippines to reevaluate its defense strategies. By advocating for compulsory military service, Gonzales highlights the importance of preparing the youth to contribute to national security, fostering not only military readiness but also a sense of patriotism and responsibility among the younger generation. Poe meantime also expressed his thoughts on economic security. The Philippines is still economically dependent on China; our largest trading partner is still China. So even if we were to get into conflict with China, our biggest problem is that without even firing a single bullet, halting trade with the Philippines would hurt us. Thats one. Without even firing a single bullet, because our energy portfolio is not yet self-sufficient. Were still a net importer of energy and fossil fuels; they could easily just block off trade for energy and then cripple our energy portfolio, he said. Were still building our agricultural backbone. Until now, we argue that food security is a major concern Who is the largest importer of rice in the world? Philippinesnot even Chinaand our population is so much smaller than theirs. My point here is, without even firing a single bullet, economically they could sabotage the country, he added. His remarks highlight the critical dependence of the Philippines on economic ties with China. In addition to economic concerns, cyber security also emerges as a pressing issue. Another major concern, we were talking about having a robust national security is cyber. A big chunk of what were missing out on and where everyone else is advancing is cyber security. Ilang beses na tayong na hack? Ilang government agencies ang na hack? Ano yung mga data sets na nakuha ng ibat ibang bansa dahil hindi tayo handa? When it comes to cybersecurity, its not a numbers game. You can actually train a decent set of Filipinos to be our cybersecurity experts, and that doesnt cost as much as buying a fleet of jets. Its an investment towards our population and the next generation of Filipino leaders in cybersecurity, he said, emphasizing the importance of investing in local talent for a secure future. Meron tayong cybersecurity program sa TESDA that is internationally recognized. That can easily be sponsored by the government to provide us with a cybersecurity portfolio or background. Not everyone has to be a hard military asset. We can also invest in fixing our agricultural backbone, and we could also invest in sustainable energy solutions that we can build here in the Philippines. And we can invest in our people, our best asset, he added, highlighting the multifaceted approach needed for national development.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2055998/fpj-panday-bayanihans-brian-poe-attends-forum-on-natl-security,others
Pope Francis showed us how to lead with compassion Romualdez,"TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte More than giving hope to people from Eastern Visayas, Pope Francis showed how it is to lead by example and with compassion, House of Representatives Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez said on Saturday. In a statement after the thanksgiving mass here for Francis funeral rites at the Vatican, Romualdez said that the pontiffs 2015 visit allowed the people of Leyte and the entire Eastern Visayas to rise again after the extensive damage caused by Super Typhoon Yolanda. Pope Francis gave us more than hope, Romualdez, who represents the first district of Leyte, said. He showed the world how to lead with compassion. He stood with usnot just as a Pope, but as a father to the suffering. His presence gave us strength to rise. He gave us the courage to begin again. When we felt forgotten, he remembered. When we were broken, he came to bless the brokenness. That is something no people ever forget, he added. According to Romualdez, the people of Tacloban and Eastern Visayas would never forget these invaluable actions from the late pontiff. His presence was a comfort to our grief, a spark to our resilience and a reminder that even in the darkest storms, the light of compassion can shine through, he said. Hindi po kailanman mababayaran ng salita o panahon ang ginawa ng Santo Papa para sa mga taga-Tacloban at buong Eastern Visayas. Ang kanyang pagyakap sa ating lungkot ay nagsilbing paalala ng pagmamahal ng Diyos sa mga nawalan at nasalanta ng bagyo, he added. Romualdez said the yellow raincoat that Francis wore which became iconic as he was seen wearing it while smiling and blessing the people despite strong winds and rains became a symbol of Eastern Visayas residents unwavering faith. That yellow raincoat became our banner of faith. We saw in him not a distant leader, but a loving father: present, soaked in our sorrow, and filled with love, he said. Hindi lang siya nakiramay. Pumunta siya, nakiiyak at nakisama sa paghihirap ng mga taga-Tacloban City at buong Eastern Visayas. Hindi lang po ito pag-alala, ito ay pasasalamat. Isang dekada na ang lumipas, pero sariwa pa rin sa alaala namin ang pagmamahal na kanyang ipinadama. Kaya ngayong araw na ito, sinasabi naming muli: Damo nga salamat, Pope Francis, he added. Romualdez was one of the several government officials who welcomed Francis into Tacloban City during the January 2015 papal visit, along with then-senator and now President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Monsignor Ramon Stephen Aguilos, who officiated over the thanksgiving mass on Saturday, was also present when Francis went to Tacloban. Earlier, Aguilos said in his homily that Francis life is a challenge to Christians to stand with the suffering and marginalized while at the same time leaving ones comfort zones. Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, passed away last April 21 morning in the Vatican or just a day after the Catholic world celebrated Easter Sunday to commemorate Jesus Christs resurrection.

Sara Duterte to new cops: Dont betray a Filipino,"MANILA, Philippines Vice President Sara Duterte on Monday told new police officers to uphold integrity by not allowing themselves to be tainted by wrongdoings such as betraying and surrendering a Filipino to a foreign body. Duterte made the pronouncement as she congratulated the Philippine National Police Academy Sinaglawin Class of 2025 and thanked them for choosing a path that is rough, demanding, and may even be extremely perilous. Sa inyong kagitingan at kahandaan na tunay na magsilbi, sana ay lagi ninyong piliin ang tama. Huwag sana ninyong hayaan na mabahiran ang inyong propesyon ng mali katulad ng pagkakanulo sa isang Pilipino ng kanyang kapwa Pilipino, Duterte said in a congratulatory statement. Walang kapatawaran ang pagsuko at pagpapakulong sa mga dayuhan ng isang Pilipinong naglingkod ng tapat sa ating bayan, she added. She also urged the new cops to protect the country from corruption and those who destroy the intrinsic Filipino values of principle and integrity. Just like those who completed this course before you, you are presented with the choice to become citizens who will uphold the interest of the Filipinos above all else, she added. Her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, has been detained by the International Criminal Court in The Hague after he was arrested for crimes against humanity he allegedly committed during his administrations war against drugs. READ: Dutertes ICC arrest: Separating fact from lies The Duterte family and their supporters claimed that the arrest was illegal and a betrayal of the Filipino people, as the Philippines is no longer under the jurisdiction of the ICC. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the government was merely cooperating with the International Criminal Police Organization in enforcing the ICCs arrest warrant against Duterte. The Palace and legal experts also said that the ICC retains its jurisdiction over crimes committed when the Philippines was still a member of the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the ICC. At least 6,000 people died in the Duterte administrations war on drugs, but human rights groups reported at least 20,000, most of whom were killed by active cops. READ: War on drugs: The violence, scars, doubts and families it left behind One such case was Kian Delos Santos, a Grade 11 student who was killed in a police operation in Barangay 160, Caloocan City. Authorities initially claimed that Delos Santos resisted arrest and opened fire at arresting officers when he was apprehended. However, a closed circuit television camera footage showed lawmen dragging the victim before he was found shot to death. On November 29, 2018, police officers involved in the death of Delos Santos were found guilty.

"Taal Volcano records 56 quakes, 14 tremors in past 24 hours","LUCENA CITY Taal Volcano in Batangas continues to exhibit signs of unrest, logging 56 volcanic earthquakes and 14 tremors over the past 24 hours, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology reported Monday. In its morning bulletin, Phivolcs said the volcanic tremors lasted between one and two minutes each. From April 8 to 26, Taal Volcano located in the middle of Taal Lake recorded a total of 126 volcanic earthquakes and 34 volcanic tremors, according to agency data. Phivolcs explained that volcanic earthquakes are generated by magmatic processes beneath or near an active volcano, differing from tectonic earthquakes, which are produced by faulting. Volcanic tremors, meanwhile, are continuous seismic signals with low frequencies, typically ranging from 0.5 to 5 Hz, that can last longer than a minute. These tremors may result from the flow of magma or magmatic gas through cracks and vents, overlapping low-frequency earthquakes, or minor eruptions. Phivolcs also reported a weak emission of 956 metric tons of sulfur dioxide from Taals main crater up from 348 metric tons recorded in previous days. No upwelling of hot volcanic fluids or vog was observed during the latest monitoring, the agency said. Phivolcs maintained Alert Level 1 over Taal, warning that the volcano remains in an abnormal state and unrest has not ceased. The agency cautioned that sudden steam-driven or minor phreatomagmatic eruptions, volcanic earthquakes, ashfall, and the accumulation or expulsion of volcanic gases remain possible, posing threats to areas within Taal Volcano Island.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2056429/taal-volcano-records-56-quakes-14-tremors-in-past-24-hours,others

Lawmaker slams DOTr chief for lack of talks on Roxas City Airport plan,"MANILA, Philippines Pinuno Rep. Ivan Howard Guintu on Monday criticized Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon for his alleged failure to consult stakeholders concerning the redevelopment of Roxas City Airport in the province of Capiz. In a statement, Guintu welcomed the renewed pledge of support Dizon made for the redevelopment of the Roxas City Airport in Capiz, Panay, however, the lawmaker also pointed out that Dizon failed to actually consult him and other stakeholders regarding the project. Guintu pointed out that he has been an open advocate for the project, raising concerns about the airport and how it has never received any major upgrade since its construction almost 70 years ago. READ: Lawmaker wants two major transport hubs in Roxas City renovated Why Secretary Dizon failed to at least give due course to calls and representations made by Congressman Guintu to the DOTr relative to this important advocacy remains a puzzle to the partylist representative, his office said. Unless, it is the intention of the good Secretary to disregard the efforts of a sitting member of the House of Representatives and discount Congressman Guintus efforts to assist the DOTr in improving the facilities of an airport under its care, which is hoped to be not, it added. Guintu then noted that he understands the complexity of Dizons job as cabinet secretary, but insisted that the official should still be thorough in his inspections, conducting proper consultations involving all stakeholders. It is expected that this lightning of a visit by Secretary Dizon to the airport should not in any way define his commitment to redevelop the facility and disappear as quick as the sound of thunder, Guintus office said. More importantly, it should not be a propaganda to promote a person who for the longest time has not hinted at any concern on the development of the airport until this visit by the Transportation Secretary, it added.

PCO to revise newly-released accreditation guidelines,"MANILA, Philippines The Presidential Communications Office will revise its recently released new guidelines for reporters covering Malacaang and the President. This came after PCO officials and officers of the Malacaang Press Corps Inc. held a meeting on Monday to discuss some provisions in the guidelines that appeared to limit newsrooms autonomy in assigning reporters to the beat. READ: SC rules media accreditation guidelines must not infringe free speech One of these is the requirement that reporters must have at least five years of experience covering politics. During the meeting, MPC officers also raised the need to clarify vague terms in the guidelines, such as false reporting, which is cited as one of the grounds for the revocation of a reporters accreditation. In a statement released after the meeting, MPC officers said that, PCO officials led by Secretary Jay Ruiz were open to the suggestions of the MPC, but maintained that stricter accreditation rules are needed because of the nature of Malacaang as a prime beat. The two sides agreed to work together to achieve a middle ground that will ensure the efficiency and integrity of the accreditation process while preserving the autonomy of Palace reporters. The statement also said that PCO officials asked MPC officers to submit a position letter by Friday so the PCO could craft a clearer and more acceptable set of guidelines. Pending the revision of its guidelines, the PCO agreed to defer the submission period of the accreditation requirements, which was supposed to take place from April 29 to May 2, the statement read.

Binay vows to push for use of govt cash aid to give free meds to poor,"MANILA, Philippines Makati City Mayor Abby Binay vowed to push for the re-direction of governments financial aid programs so it could partly fund free maintenance medicines for the poor, if she wins as senator. In a radio interview with Net25, transcripts of which were sent to reporters on Wednesday, Binay stated that funds for the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation and the Ayuda Para sa Kapos ang Kita Program both cash assistance given to indigents can used to improve the countrys healthcare services. In a statement she also released, Binay reiterated her proposal to redirect part of the funds for financial assistance under AICS and AKAP for the provision of free maintenance medicines to beneficiaries, instead of plain cash. At least alam natin kung saan napupunta yung tulong. Gamot ang kailangan ng mga tao, hindi basta pera, Binay explained. Furthermore, Binay said she believes the government has sufficient funds to improve the countrys healthcare system, but it has not been utilized properly yet. According to the local chief executive, the problem is the utilization of funds, and not whether the allocations are enough, as different laws have allowed state agencies to amass the budget for health care. Binay was referring to the funds appropriated to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation under the annual national budget, and the funding generated from excise taxes on vices like Republic Act No. 10351 or the Sin Tax Reform Law, R.A. No. 11346 or the Tobacco Tax Reform, and R.A. No. 11467 which amended the tax code. Kung tutuusin, may pera naman. Ang problema lang hindi po nagagamit nang tama. The problem is utilization, Binay, who is running under the banner of the administration-backed Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas, said. These are the things we need to scrutinize in the Senate. Our resources may be limited, but the funds are there. We only need to determine how best to use them to provide better services to the people, including better health care, she added. AICS and AKAP are both programs of the Department of Social Welfare and Development. AICS aims to assist families who have been hit by emergencies and calamities, while AKAP is a one-time P5,000 payout to individuals earning less thank P23,000. AKAP was a program initiated by the House of Representatives, in a bid to address underemployment and high inflation rates during the early part of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s administration. However, AKAPwas also one of the items in the 2025 budget that was heavily scrutinized, as many observers believed it can be used for politicking. Former Finance undersecretary Cielo Magno said thatAKAPis being merely used by lawmakers for political gain. READ: Ex-Usec:Akapstill susceptible to politicking Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian, however, assured the public that AKAP will not be affected by politics as it is the DSWDs staffers that receive and verify requests for aid with or without referrals from lawmakers and local government unit officials. READ: DSWD:Akapbeneficiariesdont need political backers Binay, meanwhile, said that another solution to the countrys health care woes is to initiate legislative reforms with regards to streamlining the Public Private Partnership approval process, noting that Makatis PPP projects in the healthcare sector were successful. Kung kaya ng Makati, kaya din ng ibang LGUs , basta may tamang mekanismo at suporta, she noted. Healthcare funding was a concern among individuals during the budget season for 2025, as the bicameral conference committee decided to remove the subsidy that PhilHealth gets regularly under the annual budget.

Fire hits sections of Arayat forest in Pampanga,"CITY OF SAN FERNANDO, PAMPANGA, Philippines A series of fires over three days scorched 351.66 hectares of the 3,726.28-ha Mt. Arayat Protected Landscape in Pampanga, damaging parts of 10 reforestation projects, according to a report obtained by the Inquirer on Wednesday. The four separate fires erupted between April 25 and April 27 on the northern slopes of the inactive volcano, affecting communities along the boundaries of Magalang and Arayat towns, Roger Encarnacion, provincial officer of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources , told the Inquirer. On those days, the heat index ranged from 38 to 40 degrees Celsius, according to data from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. READ: Wildfire razes section of mountain in Zambales tourist town The first fire broke out at 10 a.m. on April 25 in Barangays Sto. Nio and Turu in Magalang. A second fire broke out later that day, affecting both Magalangs Turu and Arayats La Paz Turu, and was extinguished by 10:30 p.m. On April 26, strong winds and intense heat reignited the fire in La Paz Turu by morning. Although it was intermittently suppressed, it continued to reignite throughout the day, Encarnacion said. The fire died down by 8 p.m. Due to the steep terrain, Bureau of Fire Protection trucks were unable to reach the blaze. In response, Pampanga Rep. Aurelio Gonzales Jr. requested assistance from the Office of Civil Defense in Central Luzon and the Philippine Air Forces Tactical Operations Group in Clark Freeport. On April 27, two aircraft were deployed to conduct aerial firefighting using Bambi buckets, or specialized water containers suspended on cables. Encarnacion reported that a total of 40 bucket drops, sourcing water from the Pampanga River feeding the Cong Dadong Dam south of Mt. Arayat, put out the fire by 5:30 p.m. Just an hour later, by 6:30 p.m., local farmers helped put out another blaze at Barangay San Juan Bao in Arayat. This marked the first known instance in which the DENR deployed Bambi buckets for a fire that reignited multiple times. Encarnacion said the cause of the fire was still under investigation but was suspected to have originated in Turu, Magalang. The affected sections of MAPL are part of the 811-ha National Greening Program reforestation areas, planted with timber, bamboo, fruit trees and cacao. The immediate loss of ground cover has exposed the soil, increasing the risk of erosion, especially during rainfall, and reducing the areas capacity to retain moisture, both critical for forest recovery, Encarnacion warned. To aid restoration, he proposed a large-scale replanting of native species such as kupang, banaba and tibig, alongside the establishment of fire lines and community-based fire lookout stations.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2057073/fire-hits-sections-of-arayat-forest-in-pampanga,others
Mt. Bulusan erupts anew,"LEGAZPI CITY, ALBAY, Philippines Government personnel in Sorsogon province ordered another clearing operation and evacuation of residents on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the ashfall from the second phreatic eruption of Mt. Bulusan this week. Fritzie Michelena, head of the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office in Irosin, said 65 families, or 211 people, from the villages of Cogon and Monbon were evacuated to Gallanosa National High School and the towns evacuation shelter after the 77-minute phreatic eruption that started 7:43 p.m. on Tuesday. Michelena said the evacuations were prompted by health concerns linked to ash exposure. READ: Heavy ashfall affects thousands in Sorsogon as Bulusan erupts When the volcano erupted, there was zero visibility because of the ashfall. Once the areas are cleared through flushing, especially along the highway, we will decamp them, she told the Inquirer in a telephone interview on Wednesday. During the first phreatic eruption on Monday, six residents from Barangay Cogon in Irosin and 276 residents from Barangay Puting Sapa in Juban, on the western flank of the volcano, were also evacuated but allowed to return home on Tuesday afternoon. In total, thousands of residents across 65 villages in eight Sorsogon towns were affected by ashfall. In a bulletin issued on Tuesday night, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the eruptions ash plumes likely drifted southwest of the volcano. Rumbling sounds were reported in the villages of Cogon and Bagsangan in Irosin. As of 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Phivolcs had recorded 54 volcanic earthquakes. Sulfur dioxide emissions were measured at an average of 548 tons per day, well above the baseline of 200 tons. Ashfall reaching up to a centimeter thick was reported in the Irosin villages of Cogon, Tinampo, Monbon, Bolos, Gulang-Gulang, Gabao, Bulawan and Macawayan. In Bulan town, affected villages included Somagongsong, Beguin, Aquino, San Francisco, Calomagon, Inararan, Cadandanan, Dolos, Zone 7 and Polot. In Juban, ash traces were also observed in Barangay Guruyan. Salvador Mendoza, the provinces information officer, said that most areas affected by Mondays ashfall had already been flushed, but cleanup teams were redeployed for a second round of clearing after Tuesdays eruption. Teams from the Bureau of Fire Protection, Philippine National Police and other government agencies were tapped to help operations following the eruption on Tuesday night. More than 35,000 face masks were distributed to residents and motorists along the Maharlika Highway in Juban and Irosin. Arvee Lodronio, disaster risk reduction and management office chief of Juban, reported that only Barangay Guruyan and a portion of Barangay Buraburan were affected during the Tuesday eruption. No residents were displaced, he said. However, authorities have begun identifying individuals at riskespecially those with medical conditionsfor targeted support and to minimize exposure to ash-affected areas. On Monday, local officials in Juban reported an initial P675,000 in agricultural damage. The figure is expected to rise as assessments continue. Mt. Bulusan remains under alert level 1, indicating low-level unrest with an increased likelihood of further phreatic eruptions.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2057071/mt-bulusan-erupts-anew,others

Creation of Labor Commission pushed,"MANILA, Philippines In time for Labor Day, Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano sees the need to establish a labor commission. Speaking to reporters in a press conference on Wednesday, Cayetano said he discussed this proposal with Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero. Ano ang proposal namin ni Sen. Pia? I am also discussing this with the Senate President a labor commission. Kung love natin ang Pilipinas, kung love natin ang laborers, [at] kung gusto nating ang mga overseas Filipino workers kapag dumating ang araw ay hindi na kailangang mag abroad, we have to have a labor commission, he said. But what difference could this make? Cayetano said instead of a purely congressional labor commission, a legislative labor commission would be better. So three commissioners from Congress, three commissioners from the Senate. Yung Cabinet members na involved [ay] National Economic and Development Authority, Department of Trade and Industry, Labor, and Migrant Workers and then we can get two from big business or from the employers and one or two from micro small medium enterprise and two from the labor sector, Cayetano said. With this, he said labor woes would be easily addressed instead of waiting for lawmakers to tackle issues. In the same presser, Cayetano was asked what would happen to the legislated wage hike should a labor commission push through. The senator said the labor commission would develop industry-specific legislation to address the matter. Yun nga ang problema sa legislative wage hike. Hindi magkaroon ng consensus kung mapasa ng Senate, hindi maipasa ng House. Sinuman ang pumasa ng mataas ina-accuse ng kabilang house [na] nagpapabango lang sa labor sector pero hindi naman kaya yun, said Cayetano. Then when you talk to the business sector, they talk in general. In general hindi kakayahin ang ganito, di ba? The labor comm will not talk in generalities. It will come out industry specific, he added. It has been over a year since the upper chamber passed Senate Bill 2534, proposing a P100 increase in the daily minimum wage of workers in the private sector. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives committee on labor and employment has so far approved a bill mandating a P200 across-the-board increase for workers in the private sector.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2057006/fwd-labor-commission,others

Tolentino: PDP asked me to resign for opposing China-only talks,"MANILA, Philippines The real reason he was asked by the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino to resign from the party was because he did not believe in engaging solely with the Chinese government regarding maritime law discussions, Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino said on Wednesday. At the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum, Tolentino was asked about observations from netizens that he bolted from the PDP the party headed by former president Rodrigo Duterte because he was against Chinas intrusion into the Philippines. Duterte, on the other hand, has advocated during his time for friendly ties with China. I think it was Senator [Robinhood] Padilla who talked about that. Thats the real reason why I left the PDP. I said we cannot just talk with China. Were talking about the law of the sea. Under the law of the sea, 185 countries signed. Why would you only talk to China? Tolentino said in a mix of Filipino and English, referring to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea . Burma, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan also signed this, right? The United Kingdom, too. Then talk to all of these countries. Thats why they asked me to resign, because I want to talk to everyone, he added. According to Tolentino, if the current administration went on with the direction of the past when discussions were largely focused on bilateral talks with China the Philippines would have had a hard time engaging with other countries like Japan. Japans Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru is currently in Manila for a two-day official visit, during which the Japanese leader and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. renewed a commitment to push back against foreign aggression and uphold peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. READ: PH, Japan reaffirm security alliance Look, if we will just talk with China, we cannot talk with Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. We should talk to the whole world, he said. Tolentino said it is perplexing to continue talking with a country whose leaders do not respect Philippine sovereignty. They are all supportive of the measures undertaken to protect the West Philippine Sea Italy, all of them, France. Our next reciprocal access agreements will be with France and Germany, he said. Why would we talk to just a single country when that country wants to grab our seas, territory. Why would we talk to them? They are infringing on our sovereignty. Then we will talk to them? I think thats nonsense. Thats why I told them, I resign, he added. Weeks after Sen. Francis Escudero was elected Senate president in May 2024, Tolentino was also voted to be the chambers majority leader. This development prompted PDP president and Sen. Robinhood Padilla to ask Tolentino to resign as party vice president for Luzon and party member so he could attend to his additional duties. READ: Padilla urges Tolentino to resign from PDP due to new Senate role Tolentino eventually resigned, but he said the reason was a difference in foreign policy directions over the disputed West Philippine Sea. READ: Tolentino leaves PDP, cites differences in West PH Sea policy Tolentinos committee, the Senate special committee on Philippine maritime and admiralty zones, recently led a hearing that revealed Chinas alleged attempt to interfere in the upcoming 2025 midterm elections. During the discussions last April 24, Tolentino asked National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya if any indicators were showing foreign interference in the 2025 elections. Malaya then replied that there are indications that information operations are being conducted or that Chinese state-sponsored groups in the Philippines are actually interfering in the forthcoming elections. READ: China interfering with PHs May 2025 polls, says NSCs Malaya But aside from interfering in the Philippine elections, it was also revealed during the Senate hearing that China, through its embassy in Manila, allegedly paid for a troll farm under a contract with a private company to discredit the Philippine government and anti-China Filipino personalities. Tolentino said a service agreement between the Chinese embassy and InfinitUs Marketing Solutions Inc. in August 2023 included the provision of keyboard warriors that will play a vital role in the overall effectiveness of the issue management project. According to Tolentino, InfinitUs was allegedly contracted to spread pro-Beijing narratives and fake news campaigns targeting lawmakers who support the Philippines claims over the West Philippine Sea.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2056976/fwd-tolentino-reason-why-pdp-asked-to-resign-is-i-dont-want-china-only-talks,others

The PSA defined a functionally literate person as someone who can read, write, compute, and comprehend. If you look at the 2024 figure, there are 18 million students who the PSA detected that are senior high school graduates and junior high school graduates, but are not functionally literate. Meaning they graduated from our basic education system, but they cannot read, they cannot understand, and comprehend a simple story, said Gatchalian. According to the senator, this should not happen, considering that the very basic goal of education is for students to become functionally literate. Thats non-negotiable that a student who will graduate from our basic education system should be functionally literate thats not the case now, he said.

21 Manila Bay reclamation projects equal area of 2 cities,"MANILA, Philippines Manila Bay is alive and vibrant with functioning ecosystems to support marine life and the livelihood of fisherfolk, but it is under threat from 21 projects to reclaim land nearly as big as two Metro Manila cities, which could cause massive flooding, water contamination and loss of fishing grounds, according to key findings of a scientific study released on Wednesday. The most fundamental impact of the proposed and approved reclamation projects is the change in the natural flow of water currents in the bay, causing contaminants to likely stay within reclamation sites, said Charina Repollo, one of the 48 scientists and experts from the Marine Environment and Resources Foundation Inc. . READ: The insane reclamation projects in Manila Bay The expert group was tapped by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in 2023 to determine how project proponents, stakeholders, local governments and concerned state agencies should respond to alleviate the pressure of rapid urbanization from further reclamations in Manila Bay. Reclamation activities significantly disrupt the natural circulation of water in Manila Bay, said Repollo, a physical oceanographer. The construction of large coastal structures and alteration to the coastline weakens water exchange, resulting in stagnation and the buildup of sediments, pollutants and debris in specific areas, she said. Around 6,100 hectares of new land, almost the same size as Manila and Marikina put together, would rise from the bay from the reclamation projectstwo ongoing, 12 approved and seven being proposed. When pollutants accumulate for a long period of at least three weeks, water quality deteriorates, posing a serious and lasting threat to the health of Manila Bays ecosystem and nearby communities, Repollo said. The water quality surveys done by the scientists detected pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Stenotrophomonas, and 11 kinds of metals, including highly toxic cadmium and lead, Repollo said. Risks from exposure to pathogens and toxic substances heighten during extreme weather, she noted, citing the extremely high sediment build-up and total suspended matter , or undissolved particles, which are pollutants, during Supertyphoon Carina in July 2024. This prolonged turbidity is a clear sign that reclamation activities are increasing sediment vulnerability during extreme weather events, said Repollo, who is also the deputy director for research at the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute. She assured the public, however, that despite the deteriorating water quality of Manila Bay, it is still alive and remains a productive and vital fishing ground that is worth protecting as it even surpasses the catch rates of other major fishing sites. From April to October 2024, Manila Bay fisherfolk caught an average of 2 kilograms to 4 kg of fish per hour, a much better yield than the average of 1 kg to 2 kg per hour in other fishing grounds in Masinloc, Siargao, Lingayen, Ragay and San Miguel Bay. The fishing gear used for comparison were gillnet, hook and line, liftnet, scoopnet, spear, traps and trawl. The key species commonly caught in Manila Bay were bisugo, hasa-hasa, alimasag and sardines. The coral cover of the bay, which showed a high species diversity in the coastal waters of Corregidor Island, Maragondon and Ternate in Cavite province and Mariveles in Bataan, showed strong potential for recovery, especially if appropriate management and conservation measures are put in place, Repollo said. However, reclamation is reducing fishing grounds and destroying habitat, especially critical ones like the mangrove, she said, adding that this threatens the livelihood of coastal communities that rely on daily fish catch for income and sustenance. Mangrove loss will also weaken the natural coastal defenses that they provide, reducing protection against typhoons, storm surges and coastal erosion, Repollo said. Existing conditions of Manila Bay waters, specifically its high sedimentation, low dissolved oxygen and elevated nutrient concentrations, create a favorable environment for red tide, Repollo said. She expressed alarm over possible food poisoning among people consuming contaminated shellfish from the bay, where species causing harmful algal blooms, commonly known as red tide, had been detected. She said it was critical to conduct regular monitoring of water quality and shellfish safety. Major urban areas and business districts are also at risk of inland and coastal flooding, because the reclamation activities changes the coastline, resulting in a bottleneck effect, or blockage of the natural floodwater drainage. According to Repollo, the cities of Makati, Manila and Caloocan are at an increased threat of flooding due to fast accumulation of water, while floodwaters in the cities of San Juan, Navotas and Bacoor are already taking longer to drain, taking as long as up to 16 hours. This may worsen with more reclamation works, she added. Following the findings, Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga said that her agency would now pass the buck to the project proponents, the concerned local governments as well as the Philippine Reclamation Authority , which okayed the reclamation projects, to act on the concerns and make the necessary adjustments in compliance with proper flood, water, solid waste and traffic management plans. While she could not say, for now, whether the projects would be canceled, the DENR could modify any that has been granted. The PRA is where these proposals have emanated from. And for us to be able to consider any action moving forward, the PRA needs to be involved, Yulo-Loyzaga told reporters. Clearly, the proponents on the part of the local government units must step up and actually help us determine whether they have considered the depth and the breadth of the findings. At this stage, she noted, the DENR would continue to evaluate and scrutinize the project proponents and they need to be able to defend their proposal. There will be considerable challenges on the part of some of these, if not all. However, there has been some willingness with some of the proponents to already make some changes in terms of their proposals that they have put forward, Yulo-Loyzaga said. The DENR is also setting the stage for the second phase of the study, which would cover visualization of the flooding impact, which is likely to begin by the third quarter of the year, the environment chief added. The initial results of the study had been relayed to President Marcos, who already gave the go-signal to share them to relevant agencies and authorities, she said. The DENR-led study was conducted in response to the writ of continuing mandamus issued by the Supreme Court in December 2008 to rehabilitate, restore and preserve the waters of Manila Bay to the SB class, which is fit for contact recreational and ecotourism activities, such as swimming and skin diving. Aside from the DENR, the other agencies covered by the directive are the departments of interior and local government, education, health, agriculture, public works and highways, budget and management; Philippine Coast Guard, Philippine National Police-Maritime Group; Philippine Ports Authority; Metropolitan Manila Development Authority; Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and Local Water Utilities Administration.

Colleagues condemn killing of Aklan journalist Johnny Dayang,"ILOILO CITY A media organization in Iloilo strongly condemned Tuesdays senseless and brutal killing of Juan Johnny Dayang, a prominent journalist and former mayor of Kalibo, Aklan. In a statement released Wednesday, the Iloilo Media-Citizen Council said Dayang, 89, was a respected figure in journalism and public relations, and a steadfast advocate of press freedom and public discourse. His cold-blooded murder inside his own home where he should have been safest marks a new low in the attacks against journalists and media workers in this country, the council said. We reject violence in all its forms. Murder is not the way to silence voices, settle disputes, or erase legacies. The group warned that Dayangs killing after reportedly expressing concerns about threats to his safety sends a chilling message to the media profession: No one is safe, not even the elderly, not even those who have long stepped away from the daily grind. We call on the Philippine National Police and relevant authorities to act with urgency, impartiality, and transparency in investigating this crime and bringing the perpetrators to justice. Impunity has emboldened attackers for far too long, the statement added. Jun Aguirre, president of the Aklan Media-Citizen Council and a correspondent for the Boracay Island News Network, said Dayangs death was a major loss to the local media community. He was among those who saw Dayangs body after it was rushed to Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital, where the veteran journalist was declared dead on arrival. Dayang was chair emeritus of the Publishers Association of the Philippines Inc. and founder of the Aklan Press Club. Hes a big loss. His wisdom and advice to the media will be missed, Aguirre said. PAPI also condemned the attack. We strongly condemn this killing, and we are calling for justice. He did not deserve this cruel and senseless end, PAPI president Nelson Santos said in a social media post. We join the entire media community in demanding justice for our chairman emeritus and his family. We also extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. Santos urged the Presidential Task Force on Media Security and law enforcement authorities to investigate Dayangs murder promptly, identify the gunman and mastermind, and ensure accountability. The death of Dayang represents a significant loss to the Philippine media and political landscape. His legacy of leadership, dedication to journalism, and public service will be remembered for generations, PAPI added.

"CitizenWatch PH official alarmed over surge in online scams, fraud","MANILA, Philippines CitizenWatch Philippines has expressed concern over the growing threat of online scams that take advantage of gaps in digital security. It also warned that trust in internet services is weakening at a time when the countrys digital economy is rapidly expanding. READ: AFP assures systems in place amid report of Chinese hacking on PH With that, Atty. Tim Abejo, co-convenor of CitizenWatch Philippines, called on government authorities to crack down on the malicious use of International Mobile Subscriber Identity catchers, also known as Cell Site Simulators or Fake Base Stations. These devices mimic real cell towers to intercept phone signals and trick users into sharing personal and financial information. These IMSI catchers act like telco cell sites, Abejo said in a press release on April 25. They trick your phone into thinking its connected to a real telecom network, then send you messages that look like theyre from your bank or mobile service provider. One click on a malicious link, and youre either handing over your private info or unknowingly downloading malware that gives hackers full access to your device, he explained. READ: Garcia: Hackers fail to breach Comelec website, OVCS He also noted that these devices are now small in size, just enough to fit in a backpack and mobile enough to be transported to various locations. Thats what makes them dangerous. Theyre stealthy, mobile, and outside the control of our telcos because they dont need to access the legitimate mobile networks, Abejo said. The CitizenWatch Philippines also recognized government efforts in intercepting some IMSI catchers, but Abejo said the masterminds behind these operations remain at large. Our digital economy was worth $35.4 billion in 2023about 8.4 percent of GDP. But that growth is at risk, he said. People wont use online banking, e-wallets, or e-commerce if they dont feel safe. And if they lose trust in digital transactions, it could also undermine the eGovernment initiative and other digital efforts meant to boost the economy. If trust keeps falling, digital adoption will stall, he added. Seniors and kids are the most at risk. Seniors may not be familiar with how scams work. Kids are always online for school and entertainment.

Tacloban City sends off Pope Francis with gratitude,"TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte Saturday morning in this coastal city starts out like it usually does initially foggy, followed by a gentle breeze, and then with a blistering heat of the summer sun by noon. The city has been on a steady path of recovery ever since Super Typhoon Yolanda barreled through Eastern Visayas in 2013, which led to thousands of deaths, massive destruction, and displaced families. Memories haunt residents though, with some people still refusing to recall details of the harrowing ordeal. But as if a reminder that 10 years ago, someone stood by them to remind them that they are not alone rain fell down in Tacloban, just like when the head of the Roman Catholic Church visited to share in the pain of his flock. Pope Francis may have passed away, but Tacloban residents would forever be grateful for the simple yet touching gesture of listening to their pleas and understanding their suffering. On Saturday, Tacloban and Eastern Visayas come together again to remember Francis, as funeral rites will be held in the Vatican for the late pontiff. Maribeth dela Pea, a member of a church organization in Leyte, said that Francis visit in January 2015 enabled them to continue fighting for their future, and having faith that things will be better. Naaalala namin si Pope Francis nang dumating po siya dito sa Tacloban, naramdaman namin yong pagmamahal na ipinakita niya sa amin, tapos yong parang kahit na malayo siyang tao, pinuntahan niya pa rin, dela Pea told reporters covering the thanksgiving mass here near the Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport. Ipinakita niya na may pag-asa kami, nabigyan kami ng pag-asa, she added. Francis visit to Tacloban, at the height of another storm, was one of the highlights of his visit to the Philippines. After Francis death was announced by the Vatican, different social media pages and personalities, including journalists who covered the event, also remembered how the pope braved the bad weather, blessing people while he was wearing a yellow raincoat. READ: Pope Francis in PH: A look back at his 2015 trip to Manila, Leyte Paul Padasas, the father of a young Filipino volunteer who died in an accident when Pope Francis celebrated Mass in Tacloban City, Leyte, previously said he was at a loss for words as the person who consoled him before is now gone. Padasas met Francis after the Pope honored his daughter, 27-year-old Kristel Mae, during another mass at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. I am really in sorrow now. I was in disbelief when a relative told me, but sadness filled my heart when I checked the page of Vatican News, he told INQUIRER.net. READ: Pope Francis consoled him in his grief, now he mourns his passing Officials from Leyte, including House of Representatives Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez and Tingog party-list Rep. Jude Acidre, meanwhile thanked the Pope for being a guiding light, and for standing with the province after Yolandas onslaught. It is with a heavy heart that I join the world in mourning the passing of Pope Francis, whom we in Leyte and across the Philippines lovingly called Lolo Kiko, Romualdez, who represents Leytes first district, said. To us, he was more than a Pope. He was a father, a friend, a guiding light in times of darkness. I will never forget how he came to Tacloban in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda, when our people were suffering beyond words, he added. READ: Pope Francis was guiding light for Filipinos after Yolanda Romualdez Francis, an Argentinian cardinal born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, passed away early Monday morning in the Vatican, just a day after the Catholic world celebrated Easter Sunday to commemorate Jesus Christs resurrection. He was 88. Francis passing came after making a much hoped-for appearance at Saint Peters Square. Prior to his return to his duties, Francis suffered from a bout with pneumonia.

Tolentino exposes link between Chinese embassy and troll farms,"Senator Francis Tolentino on Thursday dropped a bombshell as he presented evidence linking the Chinese Embassy to the Philippines to the proliferation of troll farm operations in the country. At the third hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Philippine Maritime and Admiralty Zones regarding espionage and underwater drones, Tolentino presented a copy of a service agreement contract between the Infinitus Marketing Solutions Inc. and the Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China in the Republic of the Philippines for the provision of keyboard warriors that will play a vital role in the overall effectiveness of the issue management project. This would reinforce reports from our security sector regarding the different hacking and spying activities conducted by Chinese nationals, he stressed. Tolentino who yesterday described the recovery of drones and espionage activities as just the tip of the iceberg said his revelations today uncover the breadth and depth of Chinas interference initiatives to the detriment of our country. Tolentino also presented a copy of a check issued by the Chinese Embassy to the order of Infinitus Marketing for the amount of Nine Hundred Thirty Thousand Pesos as payment for the activities mentioned in the service contract. Ito mismo ang nagpapatunay na China mismo ang nagbabayad, he said. These troll farms were engaged not only to openly provide information and convey the policies of the Chinese Government but also to act as a covert disinformation and influence operation against the Philippine government and the Filipino people, he added. Tolentino voiced disgust that such contracts threaten our national dignity. Hindi po ito simpleng kontrata, ito pong kontrata at kabayaran na ito ay pagyurak sa mga Pilipino pagyapak sa dignidad ng Pilipinas, the senator stressed. National Security Council Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya supported Tolentinos revelations, saying that the latter is consistent with how the Peoples Republic of China operates. Tolentino, an international law expert, has stood fast in fighting for the Philippines sovereignty and maritime rights and championed Republic Act No. 12064 or the Maritime Zones of the Philippines Act, and Republic Act No. 12065 or the Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act in the Philippine Senate. #",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2055583/tolentino-exposes-link-between-chinese-embassy-and-troll-farms,others

Internal affairs: 674 complaints only 1% of total police work force,"MANILA, Philippines The public may be more motivated now to file complaints against police officers for violating law enforcement rules, according to Philippine National Police Internal Affairs Service Inspector General Brigido Dulay. He said this in a press conference at Camp Crame on Wednesday, sharing with reporters that as of April 22, 2025, there had been 674 complaints against erring police officers. You can also look at it this way. Are they more confident in filing complaints now? Maybe the reason it went up is people are now more motivated to file charges, Dulay said. For comparison, according to Dulay, there were 1,897 cases against cops for the entirety of 2023; and 2,073 cases for the whole of 2024. If you were to do it on the basis of the total workforce, its around one percent of the total workforce of the PNP. The 99 percent are actually dedicated policemen, Dulay said. The PNP is not defined by this one percent. IAS has yet to provide a detailed breakdown of the complaints statuses and the nature of the offenses for which theywere lodged. In all honesty, for us at IAS, if our citizens have a complaint, they should file the complaint. If they dont, we cant do anything about it, unless we do a motu proprio , Dulay stressed.

"Tolentino: Drones, espionage just tip of the iceberg, affront to Filipinos","MANILA, Philippines The recent recovery of submersible drones and the foiling of foreign espionage activities in different parts of the country is part of a determined, continuous, and pervasive assault on Filipinos and Philippine institutions from the Peoples Republic China. Thus concluded Majority Leader Francis TOL Tolentino, who presided over a Senate inquiry today attended by ranking officials of the Philippine Navy, Philippine National Police, and other law enforcement and security agencies. All of us have watched over the last weeks, and months, at mayroon nga ngayong Abril, individuals caught in the act of secretly collecting information about our country. [Their] criminal, illicit activity bears all the hallmarks of espionage, Tolentino noted. In every single case, the same nexus of responsibility has emerged. Iisa lang po ang patutunguhan ng lahat ng imbestigasyon. Ang lahat po ay tinuturo, base sa mga indibidwal na naaresto, sa Peoples Republic of China, he stressed. We are facing a wave of Chinese espionage that is nothing like we have experienced in our nations history. This is not an isolated event. Again I repeat the words coming from a resource person, that this is just the tip of the iceberg, the senator added. Asked by Tolentino during the hearing to report the findings of their forensic examination of two drones recovered in San Pascual, Masbate in December last year, and in Sabtang, Batanes last February, Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad of the Philippine Navy said that the drones are capable of gathering critical information on the countrys undersea terrain and characteristics. The yellow drone is designed to collect, what we call bathymetric data: depth of water, salinity, conductivity, [and] oxygen content, Trinidad said. The black one has the same capability, but it also has an AVS: acoustic vector sensor. Nagpi-pick up siya ng sound, how sound propagates or travels underwater, the Navy spokesperson added. Sound propagation is very critical when it comes to undersea warfare. Pero lahat naman ng nakukuhang information ng mga drone na ito have different uses, pwedeng commercial, academic, scientific research, at military use, he explained. Tolentino then linked the recovery of the drones to the series of espionage activities in Makati, Palawan, and Zambales that were foiled by operatives of the PNP and National Bureau of Investigation , after being alerted by local residents. The information [being gathered by the espionage activities] puts our security at risk, including information on activity at our military bases, our state of military preparedness, our ability to protect the West Philippine Sea, and where our ships and sailors are located. Ito po yung nakakabahala, Tolentino remarked. Finally, Tolentino lamented what he suggested as a veiled threat conveyed to the Philippines recently by China Ambassador Huang Xilian and the Chinese foreign ministry. Referring to Huang, Tolentino said: Yun po ang sinasabi at naririnig natin, at nangako pa siyang magkaroon ng kapayapaan at pagkakaibigan mula sa China kung ang Pilipinas ay matalinong magde-desisyon. Let me underscore that. He has promised that we will enjoy peace and friendship from China so long, of course, and I quote, we make a good choice, unquote. And the Chinese foreign ministry has offered the same message, time and again, without fail, [that] they seek only friendship, want only what is best for the Filipino brethren, with all kindness. Their ministry spokesperson urges us, and I quote again, to uphold good neighborliness, friendship and peaceful development, unquote, if we wish to remain safe, Tolentino underscored.

Romualdez: Govt can shift from cash aid to rice subsidies,"MANILA, Philippines The government can transition from providing direct cash ayuda to allocating its funds for aid to rice subsidies so that people can buy grains at P20 per kilogram, House of Representatives Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez said on Friday. In a statement, Romualdez said that it seems possible now for the government to fulfill President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s campaign promise of bringing rice prices down to P20 per kilogram, as the Department of Agriculture started such a program in Visayas. With this initiative, the Speaker said the government can be assured that funds allocated to poverty alleviation really translates into food and anti-hunger measures. Providing affordable rice directly addresses hunger and ensures that assistance reaches the dining tables of Filipino families. This approach guarantees that government support translates into actual food security for our citizens, Romualdez said. Instead of giving out cash that may not go directly to food, this system ensures the ayuda reaches the dinner table, Romualdez said. Mas mainam kung bigas ang mismong naipapamigaynakakabusog, nakakatulong, at tiyak ang patutunguhan. While conditional cash transfer and social amelioration programs were important safety nets for families below or within the poverty line, one major criticism of these ayuda is the huge uncertainty that cash grants are actually used to purchase basic and necessary needs. It has been a usual scene for politicians overseeing aid distributions to remind beneficiaries that these financial assistance should be spent on food, and not on gambling platforms like online cockfighting or e-sabong hence the Tagalog phrase ang ayuda hindi para sa tupada which literally translates to aid should not be for illegal cockfighting. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, 10 individuals from Palayan City, Nueva Ecija were arrested for gambling hours after the city government distributed cash assistance to families. A Luzon-wide lockdown was in place during that time. READ: 10 nabbed for gambling after receiving cash assistance from Ecija town govt Last Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. announced the availability of P20 per kilogram rice in the Visayas, adding that this development came after Marcos held a closed-door meeting with governors from the Western Visayas, Central Visayas, and Eastern Visayas. READ: DA will start selling rice at P20 per kilo Tiu Laurel According to Laurel, the program will run until December but it may be extended until February 2026. Romualdez noted that the provincial government of Camiguin has also successfully implemented a similar measure, where local government units , the Department of Social Welfare and Development , and local retailers partnered to make rice accessible sold at half of usual market prices. Under the DA program, the department in partnership with the Food Terminal Inc. and participating LGUs will shoulder the price difference between the market rate and the subsidized P20 per kilogram rice. In Camiguin, the cost of the rice was brought down through LGUs coordinating with DSWD and local retailers. This initiative from Camiguin Governor Xavier Jesus Romualdo and Rep. Jurdin Jesus Romualdo, Romualdez said, has already helped hundreds of families buy affordable rice. The Camiguin model demonstrates the effectiveness of coordinated efforts among national agencies, LGUs, and private sector partners in delivering tangible benefits to the people. Its a blueprint worth replicating nationwide, he said. If it works in Camiguin, it can work across the country. This is a clear example of how the national government, LGUs, and private retailers can come together to deliver direct, practical relief to Filipino families, he added. Romualdez said the House is prepared to push for additional funding in the 2026 national budget to institutionalize this rice subsidy system. Ang panawagan ko sa ating mga LGU: pag-aralan ninyo ang modelong ito. Kami sa Kongreso ay handang tumulong sa pagbuo ng pondo at patakaran para mailunsad ito sa inyong mga komunidad, he said. This is not just a subsidyits a signal that we are serious about food on every Filipinos table, Romualdez said. Sa tulong ng mga LGU, DSWD, at ating mga local store owners, kayang-kaya nating gawing realidad ang P20 kada kilong bigas.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2055781/fwd-romualdez-says-govt-can-shift-from-ayuda-to-rice-subsidies,others
Trillanes cyberlibel complaint vs Harry Roque junked by QC prosecutor,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that the cyberlibel complaint filed by former Sen.

Palace on Sara Dutertes reply to P20-per-kg rice: Dont be a termite,"MANILA, Philippines Lets not allow crab mentality to prevail, and lets not be termites in society. This was the message of Presidential Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro to Vice President Sara Duterte on Thursday. She made the comment after the vice president called the plan of the Department of Agriculture to sell rice at P20 per kilogram in Visayas as just another attempt to deceive Filipinos. At a briefing on Thursday, Castro said such an allegation is not new. However, she questioned why Duterte was making this statement now, just as the administration was finally fulfilling its promise. Theyve long been making an issue that the presidents aspiration to provide rice at P20 per kilo seems unachievable, Castro said. Now that this aspiration is gradually being realized, why are they speaking up again? Its becoming negative, she added. Hopefully, our leaders true leaders and true Filipinos should support their fellow Filipinos, especially the countrys leader, she said. Agriculture Secretary Francisco Kiko Tiu Laurel Jr. announced the plan to sell rice at P20 per kilogram on Wednesday, following the directive of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Duterte criticized the move, calling it an attempt to manipulate Filipinos. Well, I dont really know what their motive is. Maybe, yes, theyre trying to mislead the people again fooling them once more with that P20-per-kilo rice promise, Duterte said in a mix of English and Filipino in an ambush interview held the same day. Duterte also observed that the administration-backed Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas might be having difficulty securing votes in Visayas, which might explain the programs pilot implementation in the area. However, Castro dismissed this outlook, saying: First of all, NFA [National Food Authority] has abundant stocks in the said area, Castro said. And they are the first ones to express cooperation with the president in terms of giving them subsidies. This is why Visayas is first. This is also backed as true by [Cebu] Governor Gwen Garcia, she added. Let us not block it. Let us not prohibit the people from buying cheap rice. Once again, this is for the people. Let us not allow the people to go hungry, she went on. Although the program was announced amid the campaign for national and local elections, Castro said it has no smear of politics, and candidates must not take advantage of it. Dapat po hindi po sila involved, dapat nga po ang kanilang mga mukha ay hindi makikita sa mga tarpaulin patungkol po dito, she said. Ang pagbibenta po ng bigas sa halagang P20 kada kilo ay para po sa taumbayan, hindi po para sa mga kandidato, Castro added. Castro further criticized Duterte, particularly her pronouncement that the rice to be sold at a low cost was fit only for animals. Duterte said: When we say rice at P20 per kilo, we mean rice that people can actually eat. The one being sold at P20 is the one being fed to pigs. In reaction, Castro said the rice to be sold to the public was of good quality, the same quality as the rice presently being sold at P33 per kilogram. So let us not belittle our farmers, because this rice will come from our local farmers. When anyone says that this is an animal-grade rice, they are belittling our farmers who sell rice to the NFA, to our government, she said. The program is not linked to the recent drop in Marcos trust and approval ratings in the latest Ulat ng Bayan survey by Pulse Asia Research, Castro further noted. This was already discussed by the DA and the NFA even before those survey ratings came out, she said. The selling of P20 per kilogram rice will be piloted in Western, Central, and Eastern Visayas next week. This program will run until December, but it may be extended until February 2026. Marcos ordered the DA to formulate plans to continue the project until 2028.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2055456/palace-on-sara-dutertes-budol-reply-to-p20-kilo-rice-dont-be-termites,others

Kanlaons ashfall destroys almost P1 million worth of high-value crops,"BACOLOD CITY The ashfall from the eruption of Mt. Kanlaon in Negros Island last April 8 has damaged close to P1 million worth of high-value commercial crops in four villlages of La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. The Office of the Provincial Agriculturist said the ashfall hit 34 hectares of farms that produce high-value crops like coffee, bananas, vegetables, and root crops. It affected 48 farmers in Barangays Haguimit, Ara-al, Cubay, and La Granja. Damage to these crops was pegged at more than P952,000. La Carlota was worst hit by the ashfall following a moderately explosive eruption that occurred at the crater, which lasted for 56 minutes. The Negros Occidental provincial government has realigned the P14 million originally intended for a permanent relocation site in La Castellana town. The money went to fund the meals of the evacuees displaced by the continued unrest of Mt. Kanlaon. Provincial Administrator Rayfrando Diaz, in an interview on Wednesday, said the proposed relocation site in La Castellana was rejected because it was near a sanitary landfill. This enabled the local government to realign the funds. Once there is an approved relocation plan, Gov. Eugenio Jose Lacson has assured that the provincial government can source other funds for it, he noted. Of the P50 million released by Malacaang to aid the evacuees, P31.9 million was already spent on the community kitchens as well as on materials for the Bago City evacuation site. Only P18 million was left. We hope President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will provide more assistance, Diaz said. Ma. Antonia Bornas, chief of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division, warned of a possible major eruption of Mt. Kanlaon. The warning comes following the volcanos ash emissions and a minor explosive eruption. She said the ash emissions indicate that the volcano is preparing for a major eruption. But there is no telling when the next big event will happen. We have no blueprint for this, Bornas said. Phivolcs is assessing the situation day by day. It compares Kanlaons movements with the previous activities of other volcanoes like Mayon and other volcanoes worldwide. Bornas said the unrest at Mt. Kanlaon can take a long time. Phivolcs is advising residents to stay away from the 6-kilometer expanded danger zone. Aside from the unrest at the volcano, there is restiveness among the evacuees and even a bit of resentment at what is happening to them, she observed. But again, there is a lot of danger from this volcano, and its very difficult to predict an eruption, she pointed out.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2055757/kanlaons-ashfall-destroys-almost-p1-million-worth-of-high-value-crops,others
10 quakes recorded in Kanlaon Volcano; Alert Level 3 continues,"MANILA, Philippines Alert Level 3 remains raised over Kanlaon Volcano in Negros Island after 10 volcanic earthquakes were recorded within its vicinity in the past day. This report comes from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology on Thursday. According to its bulletin, the earthquakes were recorded from 12 midnight of April 23 to 12 midnight of April 24. READ: High level of volcanic unrest stays at Kanlaon During the same period, the volcano emitted more than 2,7000 tons of sulfur dioxide, with plumes reaching a height of 150 meters. Ground deformation has also been observed, with the volcanos edifice still inflated. Due to this, Kanlaon is still on Alert Level 3. This means remains communities within its 6-kilometer radius of the summit crater must still be evacuated. The situation is brought about by the danger of potential pyroclastic density currents , ballistic projectiles, rockfalls, ashfall and other related hazards. Both local government units and residents must also exercise increased vigilance during intense rains. Loose ash or pyroclastic materials that have been deposited in the upper slopes of the volcano can lead to lahars and sediment-laden streamflows. Pilots must also avoid flying any aircraft close to the volcanos summit. Kanlaon Volcano last erupted on April 8, producing a voluminous, bent plume approximately 4,000 meters tall.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2055403/ten-quakes-recorded-in-kanlaon-volcano-alert-level-3-continues,others

"53 quakes, 13 tremors detected in Taal Volcano in past 24 hours","LUCENA CITY The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology recorded 53 volcanic earthquakes and 13 tremor episodes in Taal Volcano over the past 24 hours, indicating continued low-level volcanic unrest. In its bulletin released Wednesday morning, April 30, Phivolcs said the volcanic tremors lasted between two to 50 minutes. These findings suggest ongoing magmatic activity beneath or near the volcano. This activity follows a pattern of increased seismic events in recent days. On Monday, April 27, Phivolcs logged 37 volcanic earthquakes and eight tremors. On Sunday, April 26, 56 quakes and 14 tremors were reported. Between April 8 and 26, Taal recorded 126 volcanic earthquakes and 34 tremor episodes. Despite the uptick in seismic activity, Taal Volcano remains under Alert Level 1, which indicates low-level unrest. Phivolcs emphasized, however, that this does not mean the volcano has returned to normal and that eruptive activity remains a possibility. Phivolcs defines volcanic earthquakes as being caused by magma-related processes beneath an active volcano, distinguishing them from tectonic earthquakes which are caused by fault movements. Volcanic tremors, on the other hand, are described as continuous seismic signals with low-frequency oscillations, typically lasting over a minute. During the latest monitoring period, sulfur dioxide emissions from the volcanos main crater measured 672 metric tons still within normal parameters. No volcanic smog or upwelling of hot volcanic fluids from the main crater lake was observed. Authorities continue to monitor the volcano closely and advise residents and visitors to heed official advisories and remain vigilant.

Through Executive Order No. 3, Series of 2025, the use of plastic bags and packaging, styrofoam , disposable dishware such as paper plates, plastic utensils, PET bottles, plastic and paper cups will no longer be allowed inside Quezon City Hall buildings and other city-owned facilities starting April 21, 2025. Non-biodegradable and single-use plastics take thousands of years to break down, polluting our land and waterways in the process. Studies now show that microplastics have made their way into our food, drinking water, and even our soilposing serious health risks to our communities, said Mayor Joy Belmonte. Plastic waste clogs our drainage systems and contributes to severe flooding, as seen during recent typhoons. Plastic pollution is a growing crisis that endangers our health, our economy, and especially the well-being of our most vulnerable communities. Plastic even chokes our marine animals. This is precisely why the city government is pioneering policies and long-term solutions to reduce plastic use and advance sustainability, she added. Employees will have to bring their reusable eco-bags when buying food and products outside the building facilities. They should also bring their reusable take-out containers when purchasing food from vendors and food stalls within and around the City Hall compound. Likewise, single-use cutlery will be prohibited for employees within the workplace. For clients and visitors, food from vendors may be served in disposable take-out containers, including utensils upon request. However, these items must not be brought inside the building. Food deliveries will still be allowed inside city government buildings provided that recipient offices are required to recover the food containers and trade them at the Trash to Cashback booth. Deliveries that use plastic packaging, on the other hand, will not be permitted inside city government buildings. The EO also reinforces the provisions of the Quezon City Green Public Procurement Ordinance , which sets the guidelines for eliminating single-use plastics and disposable materials in all city-led activities, promoting the use of reusable and recyclable alternatives. To ensure effective and comprehensive rollout of the policy, the Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability Department and the General Services Department have conducted orientation sessions to discuss the policys provisions and address concerns and suggestions of affected concessionaires and stakeholders. Ambulant vendors who fail to comply with the EO within city government premises will face penalties. Employees and officials found violating the rules will be issued formal reprimands or memoranda. We hope that this policy inspires other government units and private institutions to champion circular economy and sustainability, and to reduceor avoidunnecessary plastic waste, Belmonte added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2054839/qc-bans-disposable-single-use-plastics-at-city-hall-city-run-facilities,others

Pope Francis in PH: Things to remember,"MANILA, PhilippinesI felt that I had to be here. This was Pope Francis in 2015, expressing his love to thousands of Filipinos hit by a typhoon that killed over 6,300 people and left damage worth P571 billion. He had said in a Mass in Tacloban City, considered as ground zero of Supetyphoon Yolanda which unleashed a seven-feet high storm surge, that when I saw from Rome that disaster [] I decided to come here. READ: Oh, what a beautiful mornin but storm Amang cuts trip short A little bit late, I have to say, but Im here, he told 200,000 to 500,000 people drenched in rain, as no one left. They all wanted to see Pope Francis. It was all worth it the Vicar of Christ consoled them, saying that we have a Lord who is able to weep with us, who can be at our side through lifes most difficult moments. READ: Pope Francis in PH: A look back at his 2015 trip to Manila, Leyte Ill be with you silently, with my heart, he said. Pope Francis visit to the province of Leyte, and in the Philippines, was indeed a sparkle of hope. As Archbishop Socrates Villegas of Lingayen-Dagupan said, we knew that in him, Jesus was in our midst. READ: At lunch with survivors, Pope reduced to silence He left for Rome on Jan. 19, ending his five-day pastoral visit that was concluded with a Mass at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila, which was attended by six to seven million people a crowd that would later be regarded as the largest in history. But theres a lot more to remember about his stay in the Philippines 10 years ago, such as the food prepared for him and the vehicles he rode to traverse the streets of the metropolis and the province of Leyte. A Filipino chef, Jessie Sincioco, was chosen to serve Pope Francis throughout his stay at the Apostolic Nunciature, and has prepared four different menus for the four meals that he had at the residence. One of the dishes prepared for him was the Chicken Chimichuri, which reminded him of home, or Argentina, and the Philippines. A special ube was likewise served as his dessert. He liked everything, Sincioco said. Interestingly, when Pope Francis visited the United States the same year, a Filipino-American executive chef of the White House, Cristeta Comerford, served him food, too. The altar where Pope Francis celebrated Mass at the Quirino Grandstand a day before he left the Philippines for Rome was not decked with blooms but with San Francisco and Pandan plants that are a mainstay in rural backyards. READ: Pope Francis: Around PH without leaving Luneta altar Rev. Fr. Alex Bautista, who designed the papal chair, said in the design consideration [] the concept is to serve the liturgical purpose and to have Filipino character and reflect the simplicity of the Vicar of Christ. For his five-day stay in the Philippines, three popemobiles have been prepared: one for Manila, one for Tacloban City, and one backup vehicle. Throughout his travels in Manila, Pope Francis rode a white converted single cab vehicle, except when he used a Volkswagen Touran for his state visit to Malacaang as the head of the Vatican City. READ: Why Pope Francis didnt ride popemobile on the way to Malacaang The vehicle he used in Tacloban City was the same one he rode when he went to South Korea in 2014 for the celebration of the World Youth Day. Pope Francis took a jeepney ride at the Rizal Park when he said Mass before millions of people who gathered for the second to the last day of his pastoral visit. READ: Jeepney popemobile drives to history The vehicle was built on a brand-new jeepney chassis, converted to a secure platform to give the faithful a good view of the Pope. Pope Francis, then 78 years old, exhibited his lighter side as he responded to the bishops, priests, and religious men and women who answered yes to the first words of his homily. Celebrating his first Mass in the Philippines, the Pope started his homily at the Manila Cathedral by saying do you love me? The people immediately answered and said yes. Pope Francis laughed and said thank you very much, but eventually explained that he was actually reading the word of Jesus, as stated in the Gospel of John: Do you love me? [] Tend my sheep. When Pope Francis celebrated Mass in Tacloban City before thousands of people drenched in rain, he opted to disregard his prepared English homily to speak from the heart in his native Spanish.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2054819/pope-francis-in-ph-things-to-remember,others

He picked up news reporter Hannah Ty from her workplace in Quezon City around 8 p.m. Friday . But it was already midnight when Daquiz, who was already in Marikina City that time, realized that Ty left her laptop. It was encased in a brown leather case placed in his motorcycles top box. Despite being tired from an entire days ride and already near his Antipolo City home, Daquiz said he still wanted to return the item at once. I was trying to call her around 12 midnight because I want to return it, he told INQUIRER.net over the phone on Wednesday. He also left a text message informing her about it. Ty did not answer his calls. Upon reaching home, she had a shower before throwing herself in the bed, then dozed off. She woke up with a text and missed a call from the rider. I only saw it the next morning, still clueless that I had even lost it, Ty said. Daquiz offered to drop the valuable item off to her office in Quezon City, which Ty immediately accepted. He even said sorry! Ty told INQUIRER.net in an interview. When the rider then dropped off the item on Saturday noon, he was surprised that a man whom Ty asked to receive the item on her behalf gave him P1,500 for his effort. I messaged Maam Hannah, then I told her, Maam, Ill return the money, this is too big an amount, Daquiz said. She doesnt want to accept it, he added, noting that Ty said she doesnt have an e-wallet account where he could send the amount back in an apparent white lie. It was no big deal for Daquiz, who always returns any valuable items left by his passengers as he usually does. I dont even look at its contents; I just return it, he said, adding that he has done it many times already.

Former OP staff attests how Popes mere gaze calmed troubled souls,"MANILA, Philippines It is not uncommon for people to feel shy or to just retreat into a cocoon after having the chance to meet well-known people, like celebrities or politicians who have larger-than-life personalities. Some may even feel unworthy of their idols attention. This was what Katherine Adraneda, a former officer at the Office of the President, felt when she had the chance to meet Pope Francis, as she was part of the team preparing for the pontiffs visit to the Philippines in 2015. May parating na bagyo non, but the Pope decided na itutuloy niya, so as part of the National Secretariat, minabuti ng boss namin na pumunta kami don ahead, parang advance, to check yong dadaanan ni Pope, yong lahat ng mga pupuntahan niya, dahil nga may paparating na bagyo [] but yong pinunta ko don is work, hindi ko naman naisip na magkakaron ng chance, she said. READ: Pope Francis was guiding light for Filipinos after YolandaRomualdez But you know, habang nandon ka, parang iniisip mo, mami-meet mo ba, may chance ba, kasi minsan mafi-feel mo parang hindi ka worthy kasi you know, marami tayong may nagagawang . But nagkataon na kung saan kami nag-aabang, doon siya dumaan, she added. However, Adraneda said Francis never made her feel unworthyeven if she thought she was. Instead, what she felt was a sense of peace after looking into the Popes eyes. So na-realize ko, well, siguro, ito yon, napagbigyan kami and siyempre yong opportunity na yon hindi mo malilimutan kasi very humbling siya parang sometimes na feeling mo unworthy, but meron ka pa ring chance na ito yon, humingi ka ng tawad, isipin yong mga bagay [] Surreal pero very humbling talaga, she said. Sobra-sobrang overwhelming [] hindi ka talaga makakapaniwala, so nanginginig ka pa, malamig yong kamay mo pero kapag nakatingin ka sa kanya, pag nag-eye to eye, parang may sense of peace, hindi ko rin ma-explain. Parang in a way kakalma ka, she added. Adraneda also believes that this meeting with Francis had a lasting and immediate impact on her life, as she was inside the second plane that was supposed to fly after the one carrying the Pope left Tacloban, Leyte. READ: Pope Francis consoled him in his grief, now he mourns his passing Instead of following the Popes plane, the aircraft carrying Adraneda and other officials of the Aquino administration faced problems while taking off and skidded through the runway. Dahil ang sama ng panahon so ang naging usapan, okay, dahil pasama nang pasama ang panahon, paunahing mag-take off yong plane ni Pope papuntang Manila. So nauna si Pope and then sumunod yong sa amin. Pero [] nag-take off kami nang kaunti pero sumabog yong gulong and yon na yong aksidente na nangyari, so pa-ikot ikot kami, akala ko katapusan ko na dahil nakikita ko na yong dagat eh, she said. Feeling ko don na kami papunta, so lahat nagdadasal. So I think yon yung test din nong faith, so lahat lang kami nagdasal, humingi ng kapatawaran and all. Tapos biglang huminto yong plane, and then buhay kaming lahat, walang major na nasaktan, but of course may mga pasa-pasa. Pwede kong masabi na second life eh, she noted. Catholics from around the world are mourning Francis death, which came just a day after he participated in the Easter Sunday Mass at the Vatican. Tributes also poured in, including from Filipinos who thanked the late pontiff for standing with the country, particularly Eastern Visayas, which was still reeling at that time from the effects of Super Typhoon Yolanda. Yolanda barreled through the country, leaving extensive damage over Eastern Visayas in 2013, a few months after Francis took over the papacy. Earlier, Filipino priest Francis Lucas recalled the popes humility, as he still asked for prayers even if he was already the highest official in the Roman Catholic Church. Other Filipinos also noted how Pope Francis mere presence was enough to give them hope during dark times. Even during his last days, Francis tried to participate in the Vaticans activities, earning praise from observers as he seemingly willed himself out of a life-threatening ailment. Francis was hospitalized for 38 days due to recurring respiratory issues and was released just this March 23.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2054666/former-op-staff-attests-how-popes-mere-gaze-calmed-troubled-souls,others

Solon downplays Sara Dutertes alliance-building moves ahead of trial,"MANILA, Philippines La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V is not bothered by Vice President Sara Dutertes supposed attempt to build alliances in the 2025 midterm elections for her impeachment trial, noting that the evidence gathered against her is strong enough. Ortega was asked in an interview with reporters covering the House on Monday if he was still confident that the prosecution team would secure a conviction against Duterte, even after she has started to endorse senatorial candidates in the upcoming polls. According to Ortega, the evidence gathered during the House committee on good government and public accountability and at the budget briefings is strong enough. He noted that Duterte may just be trying to influence possible winners in the senatorial race. Well, we have strong evidence as seen during the committee hearings on good government and the previous budget briefings. But as I have said, we cannot help but think that this is an attempt to influence possible senator-judges, to have an influence should their endorsement result in wins, he said in Filipino. But for me, the obligation of senator-judges is to the people, not to a single person or politician. Their accountability is to the people, and the entire Philippines will see how they handle the proceedings like the impeachment, Ortega added. Ortega also said that it is not surprising that Duterte went back on her word to refrain from endorsing senatorial aspirants. He said this is not the first time that the Vice President said something only to do otherwise. We all know what she said since the pronouncements were made on television, that she will not endorse senatorial bets or other candidates because she will leave the decision to pick the right candidates to the people. But true to the same form, true to her form, she acted differently compared to her pronouncements, he said. Definitely thats their political strategy, he added. Duterte said in November 2024 that she would not endorse any candidate, whether for the local or national race, due to her experience in the 2022 national elections. Thats when she supposedly endorsed candidates who turned out to be bad for the country. READ: Sara says she wont endorse bets in 25 polls However, the 2025 midterm elections were seen to be crucial to the impeachment trial against Duterte, as the Senate of the 20th Congress would conduct the proceedings. No less than the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino , the party of Dutertes father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, appealed to voters to elect senatorial bets who would prevent a conviction, as they will sit as senator-judges. READ: PDP-Laban seeks votes to save Sara for 2028 Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. Under the Constitution, the Senate will act as an impeachment court with sitting senators serving as judges. The impeachment of Duterte was largely based on the House hearings conducted in 2024, where allegations of confidential fund misuse within the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education were revealed. At one point in the hearings, Antipolo City 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop noticed that one of the acknowledgement receipts for the OVPs CF expenditures was signed by a certain Mary Grace Piattos, who he said bears a name similar to a restaurant and a potato chip brand. ARs are proof of payment or that funding for projects reached its intended beneficiaries and in the case of OVP and DepEd, these are informants who provided confidential information to authorities. Later on, Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong showed two ARs one for OVP and another for DepEd which were both received by Villamin.However, the signatures and handwriting used by Villamin in the two documents differed. Both Piattos and Villamins names did not appear on the Philippine Statistics Authority database.

"Benhur Abalos reflects on loss, love, and enduring faith","MANILA, Philippines This Easter, Benjamin Benhur Abalos Jr. reflects on the pain of loss, the power of love, and a faith that continues to lead him forward. Abalos looked back on the silence that surrounded him in the hospital room where his daughter lay unconscious in 2005 and the kind of silence that enveloped his familys home in 2021, when they learned that their beloved mother, Corazon Abalos, had died alone in a hospital bed, in the middle of a pandemic. These two moments, years apart, left a permanent hole in his heart and changed everything. Walang mas matindi kaysa sa mailibing mo ang sarili mong anak, Abalos said. And to lose your mother without even saying goodbyeits a grief you carry in silence. READ: Corazon Abalos, wife of ex-Comelec chairman Benjamin Abalos, dies Its the children who bury their parents and not the other way around. Dapat mas mahaba ang buhay ng mga bata [The young ones should live longer], he said. He prayed for a miracle. But when it did not come, he surrendered everything to God. Ang dasal ko noon ay simple lang, he recalled. Panginoon, ako na lang po. Pero natutunan ko rinkahit anong gawin mo, may mga bagay talagang ang Diyos lang ang nakakaalam. For a grieving parent, the pain never truly ends. There are moments of denial, anger, and deep longingand often, questions that have no answers. You begin to ask: Will I ever see my daughter again? Where is she now? Makikita ko pa ba ang anak ko? Nasaan na siya? Nawawala ba siya? Makikilala pa ba niya ako kung magkita kami? Masaya ba siya ngayon? Abalos recalled. Just thinking about those questions is enough to break you all over again, he added. Faith is what gives him strength, according to Abalos. And when I see others go through the same loss, I assume theyre asking the same silent questions. Thats when we need to reach out and connect with the grieving. Years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, his family lost their matriarch, Cora Abalos. Abalosthen serving as MMDA chair and leading the governments vaccination rollout in Metro Manilafaced the same heartbreaking reality endured by thousands of Filipino families during the pandemic: they could not be with their loved ones in their final moments. Hindi ko man lang siya nayakap. Hindi namin siya naihatid. Wala kaming pagkakataon na magpaalam, Abalos recalled. Isa ito sa pinakamabigat na naramdaman ko bilang anak. Napakahirap, he said. Hindi mo siya mahawakan. Hindi mo siya mayakap. Wala kang magawa kundi umiyak sa harap ng telepono. Abalos finds solace in the time he was able to spend with her mother before she passed. Before she died, I made sure to be with my mother and my father as much as I could, he said. Whenever I traveledwhether out of town or abroadI brought them along. Im grateful for those years. But the truth is, kahit gaano ka pala kahanda, kahit sineguro ko na kasama ko sila sa kanilang pagtanda, losing a parent still breaks you. Abalos thus has an advice to all the sons and daughters: Habang naririyan pa ang mga magulang nyo, dapat ipadama na natin ang pagmamahal at pasasalamat, he said. Huwag nating ipagpaliban. Ang mamaya na ay maaaring huli na. For Abalos, in those moments, only two things held him together: his faith, and his family. Tinanggap ko na. Sa huli, ang kalooban pa rin ng Diyos ang masusunod. Doon ko nakita na sa gitna ng matinding sakit, may pagkakataon pa ring lumalim ang pananampalataya. After everything he had been through, he found himself asking a question that many people ask during times of loss. What, then, is the purpose of life? he asked. For him, the answer is simple. READ: Abalos urges DPWH to construct motorcycle and bicycle lay-bys nationwide Its not about money or power. Its about taking caring of your family and others. What truly matters are the people we love and the lives weve touched. More than anything, life is about making a difference every single day. The spirit of caring, sharing and giving must live on, Abalos said. This Easter, Abalos hopes that everyoneespecially those who are grievingwill find comfort in the message of the season: that faith and family are the foundations that carry us through lifes most painful moments.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2054302/benhur-abalos-reflects-on-loss-love-and-enduring-faith,others

"Solon hits Piols criticism of PH debt, calls it brazen hypocrisy","MANILA, PhilippinesFormer Agricultural secretary Manny Piols criticism of the countrys mounting debt is brazen hypocrisy, according to Zambales 1st District Rep. Jefferson Khonghun. Khonghun said in a statement on Tuesday the borrowings ballooned during former president Rodrigo Dutertes time. He claimed that Piol, who is running for North Cotabatos gubernatorial post in the 2025 midterm elections, is just trying to rewrite history when he called out the current administration for having a P16.63 trillion debt. The lawmaker stressed that after the term of former president Benigno Aquino III, Dutertes predecessor, the countrys debt was only at P6.6 trillion. However, during Dutertes time, the government borrowed P7.2 trillion. Duterte administrations debts, according to Khonghun, was bigger than the combined debt left by all previous presidents. Lets set the record straight: It was under your boss, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, when our countrys debt truly ballooned with P7.2 trillion added in just six years, Khonghun said of Piol, who was Department of Agriculture head during Dutertes time. Thats more than the combined total debt of all Philippine presidents from Manual Quezon to Benigno Noynoy Aquino III over 89 years amounting to only P6.6-trillion. If theres a death burden, it was the one the Duterte administration created, he added. Khonghuns statement was a reaction to Piols statements during a campaign sortie at North Cotabato, video footage of which was uploaded on the former DA officials Facebook page. Piol spoke using the local dialect, but he claimed that programs of the government like aid distribution have a hidden agenda a desire to stay in power beyond their term. Furthermore, Piol said that the governments debt has ballooned to P16.6 trillion under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s term. LINK TO VIDEO: https://www.facebook.com/gobmannypinol/videos/1236623568071441 Khonghun, however, said Piols statements are laughable, given that the former DA secretary presided over a controversial time in the department. He presided over rice crises, proposed legalizing smuggling, bungled the bird flu outbreak, and was linked to questionable behavior in the Recto Bank incident. And now he wants to lecture us on responsible governance, Khonghun said. We in Congress are now pushing for reforms to make sure future administrations dont recklessly mortgage our nations future the way it was done under Duterte, Khonghun said. That includes investigating how the P7.2 trillion in loans was used, and whether the Filipino people truly benefited from that borrowed money. Piol, who headed DA in from 2016 to 2019, was criticized publicly in September 2018 after he said that he saw nothing irregular in rice infested with bukbok or weevils, saying that these grains are safe to eat. I was born poor and Ive always known that weevils are part of rice. As Ive said, weevils are to grain as black ants are to fruits, Piol said in the vernacular. Piols statements came after it was revealed that 133,000 sacks of rice stored on a ship docked in Subic, and 177,000 in Albay were all infested with weevils, requiring the need for fumigation to remove the insects. Piol and former Health secretary Francisco Duque III both assured the public that fumigated rice is still safe to eat. READ: DA chief sees nothing irregular in rice infested with weevils Regarding Recto Bank, Piol was accused of allegedly intimidating Filipino fishermen whose boat, F/B Gem-Ver, was allegedly rammed by a Chinese vessel over the West Philippine Sea last June 2019. The allegations came after Piol relayed that one of the crew members told him that it is possible that the Chinese vessel did not see their boat before it smashed into their fantail. Critics, however, noted changes in the fishermens narration of their encounter with the Chinese vessel before and after meeting Piol. But Piol said it is unfair to hint that the fishermen were intimidated into changing their story about what had happened, into a version favorable to the government. READ: No intimidation in meeting with Recto Bank fishermen Piol According to Khonghun, Piol should look himself in the mirror before pointing fingers, as the current administration is trying to fix the problems caused by the past administration. The truth is simple: the current government is paying for the sins of the past. The ones who bloated the debt are now acting like saints. Its shameless, Khonghun said. Before pointing fingers, look in the mirror. You resigned in disgrace. And you still owe the Filipino people answers not lectures, he added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2052981/solon-hits-pinols-criticism-of-ph-debt-calls-it-brazen-hypocrisy,others

Lawmaker to vlogger held for contempt: Do you still have honor?,"MANILA, Philippines Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong has questioned vlogger Sass Rogando Sasot who said that she was honored to be cited for contempt by a congressional chamber if she even has honor in the first place. During a press briefing at the Batasang Pambansa complex on Thursday, Adiong was asked about Sasots statements in a Facebook livestream, wherein she said it WAS an honor to be cited for contempt by a rotten House of Representatives, whose members are supposedly under corrupt leadership. According to Adiong, Sasot and the other vloggers DID not even have the honor to face a legitimate investigation. The House tri-committee is conducting an inquiry in aid of legislation into misinformation and disinformation on social media. First of all, does she still have the honor? I mean these are people who portray themselves as heroes but do not have the honor to face a legitimate investigation and to face the public and explain themselves under oath as to why they are saying things that are not true, Adiong said in Filipino. So I think being honorable is not only [about] being brave online but [being] brave enough to face the charges and under oath express your sentiments, he added. Sasot and two other social media personalities Jeffrey Celiz and former communications undersecretary Lorraine Badoy were all cited for contempt by the House tri-committee as they continued to skip the hearings. The contempt order was handed down last Tuesday, after a motion from Abang Lingkod party-list Rep. Joseph Stephen Paduano. Both Sasot and Badoy reasoned that they were outside of the country right now. READ: Sasot, Celiz, Badoy cited for contempt for skipping House hearing Meanwhile, Adiong thanked the vloggers and bloggers who showed up before the House, as their input would be vital in the tri-committees probe of misinformation and disinformation spreading on social media. During the third tri-committee hearing on March 21, several online vloggers including former press secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles appeared before the House after they skipped the first two hearings. Most of the vloggers showed up again during the fourth hearing. And by the way, I thank those bloggers who have participated in our committee hearings, I think these people [were] courageous enough to explain themselves and take the chance and to take the opportunity granted to them because they were really given invitation and due process, Adiong noted, speaking in a mix of English and Filipino. So I thank them for continuously engaging the committee and for explaining their side. Because thats what we want to happen [] they are part of a very active sector on social media platforms. So their inputs would be very much valued and very much appreciated, he added. Thetri-committees probe started after lawmakers filed resolutions and delivered privilege speeches, as misinformation and disinformation were spreading about the chairpersons of the House quad committee. At that time, the quad committee was probing illegal activities in Philippine offshore gaming operators, the illicit drug trade, and extrajudicial killings in the past administrations drug war. Aside from Sasot, Celiz, and Badoy, the tri-committee also cited for contempt blogger Mark Anthony Lopez for speaking against the investigation, which lawmakers deemed to be a violation of the chambers internal rules. During the hearing, Paduano read portions of Lopezs blog, which he made after he appeared at the March 21 meeting. In it, the blogger criticized the House for spending time scrutinizing their actions on social media. According to Paduano, it was already discussed before the hearing was suspended that maligning and attacking the chambers investigation can be tantamount to disciplinary action.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2051726/honored-to-be-held-in-contempt-adiong-asks-sasot-if-she-has-honor,others

Bukidnon capitol building gets historical marker,"Established in 1917, the province of Bukidnon recently received its third historical marker from the National Historical Commission of the Philippines , this time for its capitol building in Malaybalay City. Described by the NHCP as one of the most exceptional capitol buildings in Mindanao that preserved its original neoclassical elements, the building, built of concrete and wood, was designed by the famed Juan Arellano of what was then the Bureau of Public Works. It was inaugurated in 1933 by then-governor of Bukidnon Antonio Rubin and was restored after World War II through the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946. This is the provinces second nationally recognized historical site following the installation of the marker for Camp Kasisang also in Malaybalay in 1948 and an updated marker for the same site last year. The camp was where Brigadier General Manuel Roxas, American forces head in Mindanao Gen. William Sharp, and about 6,000 allied forces were imprisoned by the Japanese in 1942. The marker is just one of the latest unveiled in Mindanao by the NHCP, which hopes to recognize more historic sites in the area. To date, the agency has marked hundreds, if not thousands, of sites, structures, and personalities all over the country and abroad since its founding as the Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee in 1933. On April 1, Lifestyle published my article on the lost pulpit panels of the San Miguel Arcangel Church in Argao, Cebu, mentioning that the panels, totaling to six, were lost many years ago and are yet to be found. However, in a message to this writer on April 4, historian Jobers Bersales said the pulpit panels were indeed lost in the past, but have since been returned to the church. Heres the final word I think: the pulpit panels were lost but recovered later, he said, adding, I guess the ones there now are the originals.

South Luzon Water improves water supply infrastructure in Tanauan City,"South Luzon Water , an operating unit of Manila Water Non-East Zone subsidiary Manila Water Philippine Ventures, has significantly enhanced the water supply infrastructure in Tanauan City, Batangas, through continuous investments in capital expenditure projects. Since it began operations in 2019, SLWC has invested 609 million in CAPEX to improve water access in Tanauan City. Most of these investments were allocated to pipe replacement projects, which have significantly reduced Non-Revenue Water levels in the city. In 2020, the water company implemented the 116-million Mainline Pipelaying Projects to improve the deteriorating water quality following the Taal Volcano eruption that year. This project enabled supply clustering and allowed the decommissioning of deep well facilities that are not compliant with the Philippine National Standards for Drinking Water . It also reduced NRW and improved supply pressure at customer taps through proper pipe sizing based on demand. In 2023, SLWC launched the 84-million Poblacion Pipe Replacement Projects to address low to no water pressure issues in Tanauan. This project reduced NRW levels of the Poblacion Area from 47% to 27%, significantly improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. I hope this is the first step in the long journey for a better water system in the City of Tanauan. Ito po ang unang hakbang para sa mas maganda, mas malakas, mas malinis, mas available na tubig para sa ating mga kababayan. So ito pong hakbang na ginawa ng South Luzon Water, pinasasalamatan namin kayo. Sinikap po ng Pamahalaang Lungsod ng Tanauan na maipakita ang aming suporta sa inyo, said Tanauan City Mayor Nelson Sonny Collantes during the inauguration of the Poblacion Pipelaying Projects. [This marks the beginning of a journey towards providing our beloved citizens with better, stronger, cleaner, and more accessible water. We deeply appreciate South Luzon Water for taking this crucial step. The City Government of Tanauan supports you in this endeavor.] Since 2019, SLWC has added and upgraded a total of 60 kilometers of water pipes. By early 2025, NRW levels were further reduced to 21% through continuous pipe replacement, leak detection and repair, manpower training, stakeholder engagement, and partnerships with the City Government of Tanauan and the community for immediate reporting of leaks and illegal connections. Water service is now available 24/7 with 100% compliance with water quality standards. To enhance sustainability and ensure reliable service, SLWC has installed 64 kW solar panels at two of its deep well facilities, reducing power consumption by an average of 4,000 kWh per month. For long-term service improvement, SLWC will embark on clustering projects, which involve decommissioning small, unreliable, and deteriorated deep wells and constructing large-capacity deep well facilities as replacements. By investing in capital expenditure projects, we have achieved significant improvements in NRW levels. This not only reduces costs but also enhances operational efficiency, leading to better water pressure and increased supply volumes, which greatly benefits the community, said Angelie Miranda, Operations Manager of South Luzon Water. SLWC is a joint venture between the Tanauan City Water District and Manila Water Philippine Ventures which was established in 2019. The operating unit currently serves more than 110,000 customers from 42 barangays in Tanauan City and one barangay in Sto. Tomas, Batangas.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2052077/south-luzon-water-improves-water-supply-infrastructure-in-tanauan-city,others
Pasig opens revamped museum,"When Pasig is mentioned, an institution that easily comes to mind is the 126-year-old Panaderia Dimas-Alang, known for its pandesal, bonete, and biscuits called hindi ko akalain. Apart from this, Pasig, founded in the late 16th century, is likewise known for other landmarks such as its church complex, sprawling market, the revolving tower which is an impressive modernist structure, and the Pasig River itself, an important historic waterway. Peopled since at least 200 BC, Pasig has a rich history and heritage as evidenced by archaeological findings, customs, traditions, and its built environment. It has a precolonial pottery tradition, particularly in the areas of Buting and Malapad na Bato . It was an ancient trading post, and its society was forged by many local and foreign influences. It likewise played important roles in history such as being the battleground in 1762 during the British occupation of Manila and neighboring areas, the place of the successful Nagsabado Uprising of the Katipuneros in 1896, a bastion of dissent during the administration of Ferdinand Marcos, as the former capital of Rizal Province, and the hometown of its illustrious sons and daughters. It also has a popular devotion to the Our Lady of Immaculate Conception, its patroness. Pasigs church, now a cathedral and dedicated to the latter, was used as a stable by the British forces in 1762. All of these, as well as the other facets of the citys historical, cultural, religious, and economic fabric, are featured in its recently reopened Pasig City Museum, housed at the historic American-era Concepcion Mansion thats located on Plaza Rizal across the cathedral. Closed for eight years, the museum, which started as the Pasig Library and Museum in the 1980s following the citys acquisition of the house from its owners, was inaugurated on March 26 with local officials led by Mayor Vico Sotto in attendance. Prior to its reopening, the house, an Important Cultural Property, was renovated more than 20 years ago and, in 2001, became exclusively the citys museum. It was again rehabilitated in 2008 and temporarily closed down less than a decade after. At the recent reopening, Sotto was quoted as saying that the goal of the museum is for all Pasigueos to appreciate the citys history, culture, and the arts. The museum chronicles Pasigs development from a rustic town to the highly urbanized city that it is today. A gallery is also dedicated to the Pasig River and its tributary, the Bitukang Manok River. Also presented in the museum are its business district forming part of the Ortigas Center, and other landmarks as well as programs on inclusive development and climate resiliency. A room reserved for the original owners displays original period furniture as well as other artifacts. The museum also takes pride in institutions and personalities who helped shape the city into what it is today and contributed to the development of the country as a whole. Some of the companies include Universal Robina Corporation, RI Chemical Corporation, and the shirt brand Crispa. Distinguished Pasigueos include National Artist for Music Ramon Santos, National Artist for Film Lamberto Avellana, National Artist for Theater Daisy Hontiveros Avellana, and National Artist for Visual Arts Francisco Coching. Former Senators Jovito Salonga and Rene Saguisag, philatelic designer Nemesio Dimanlig Jr., historian Luciano P.R. Santiago, and former Rizal governors Mariano Melendres, Lope K.

Vlogger says Roque behind Pulvoron video edited to look like Marcos,"MANILA, Philippines The so-called pulvoron video, which showed a man allegedly sniffing an illegal drug, was digitally manipulated to make it look like President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., a vlogger who was invited to propagate this content on social media, said on Tuesday. During the third hearing of the House of Representatives tri-committee, vlogger Vicente Cunananknown online as Pebblesadmitted that Marcos was not in the video, as the mans facial features were far from those of the President. The raw version if you look at it you cant really say that it is him; its not PBBM [President Bongbong Marcos]. So they enhanced the video, and after doing that, the face was seen better, Cunanan, speaking in Filipino, told Antipolo 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop. Do you mean to say the video was edited? Its an enhanced version? Acop asked in mixed Filipino and English. Yes, sir. Even the raw video, I did not believe that was PBBM, Cunanan replied. A video supposedly showing Marcos using illegal drugs spread online last July 2024 just before he delivered his third State of the Nation Address.

During the dinner, Roque told the vloggers that a politicians relative had given him a video showing Marcos supposedly using cocaine.

Acop asked. Yes, Mr. Chair, Cunanan said. And according to you, it was Harry Roque behind this? Acop asked her again. Yes, Mr. Chair, Cunanan replied. When asked why she is coming out now, Cunanan said she wants to correct what happened in the past. To correct the mistakes, she noted.

"Abante, socmed personalities argue if cursing part of freedom of speech","MANILA, Philippines Should cursing on social media, particularly for public officials, be considered beyond the tenets of freedom of speech? The question was the subject of a lengthy debate between Manila 6th District Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr. and different vloggers and bloggers online. That is after a lawmaker called out a social media personality for cursing him and threatening to slap him. At the third hearing of the House of Representatives tri-committee held on Tuesday, Abante scolded another blogger, this time Elizabeth Joie Cruz, for badmouthing him. Ito babasahin ko ah, ang sabi mo ganito: Cong. Abante, paswelduhan ka ng taxpayer, gago.Tinawag mo akong gago, bakit, bat mo ginawa sa akin yon, gusto mo ba akong umiyak sayo ngayon, bat mo ginawa sa akin yon?Bakit mo ako tinawag na gago? [Ill read it, this is what you said: Cong. Abante, your salary comes from taypayers, stupid.You called me stupid, why did you do that, do you want me to cry now and ask you why?Why did you call me that?], said Abante. What is your right to call me gago? Cruz countered: Because I am a citizen of the Philippines [] that is part of my freedom of speech, Mr. Chair. That is part of my freedom of speech. So your freedom of speech is to tell a person that he is gago? Freedom of speech ba yan? [Is that freedom of speech] Abante asked again. My freedom of speech, part of my freedom of speech is to react on the action of a public official, Cruz noted. Abante was reminded by other bloggers, including Elijah San Fernando a labor leader who cited Supreme Court decisions that cursing public officials due to their work is allowed under free speech. Mr. Chair, no other than the highest court of the land, has repeatedly said that it is not bad to curse especially towards public officials, especially if it is referring to their official functions, not the person, but their official functions, San Fernando said in Filipino. So we stand on that ground, especially us workers, because even though you have Tiktok, Facebook or social media, at the community level, that is the language of the workers and ordinary Filipino who are mad at the government. It is not the fault of vloggers or Facebook, Tiktok, X users, why people curse, added San Fernando. Abante, however, noted that vloggers cannot be considered ordinary Filipinos because of the influence they held. When Abante turned to people from news and information website PressONE PH, researchers John Hurt Allauigan said that it is beyond their capacity as they deal with debunking misinformation and disinformation online. READ: Palace: Anti-profanity ordinance in Baguio violates freedom of speech Mr. Chair, no, we were confined with the facts as researchers, so I think as long as, if Ms. Joey Cruz is giving her opinions and her opinions alone I think it is beyond our capacity [] because she is entitled to her own truth. But again, if it has something to do with the known facts, I think we can debunk what is being said, he said. Antipolo 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop, meanwhile, noted that freedom of speech is not absolute, as it does not give people the right to violate other peoples rights. Whoever said that we should understand the person who badmouthed others because of their frustration, I just want to say that frustrations wouldnt give you the right to violate the law, Acop said in Filipino. Because there are avenues legal or provided by law to express your frustrations. That is precisely the reason why the freedom of expression is not absolute, he added. This is not the first time that Abante scolded a vlogger. Last March 21, at the second tri-committee hearing, Abante lashed out at some vloggers who insinuated that lawmakers are dimwits, firing back by saying that these social media personalities are stupid because they write without thinking. Abante grilled vlogger MJ Quiambao-Reyes due to her claim that there were no extrajudicial killings that happened during the Duterte administrations drug war.

READ: Big One scenario in Metro: 52,000 dead, 500,000 injured Concerns were raised with the state of buildings in the Philippines after a Magnitude 7.7 earthquake hit Myanmar and Thailand last March 28, leading to the destruction of several buildings, including high-rise ones. As of Sunday, over 3,300 individuals have been confirmed dead, with 4,850 injured. In the Philippines, experts fear that at least 52,000 may die with 500,000 others injured should the West Valley Faulta segment of the Marikina Valley Fault System that cuts from Bulacan down to Metro Manila and then Lagunawould cause a Magnitude 7.2 earthquake. A special report PSA Philippines Consultancy Inc. in 2019 showed that the possible quake, dubbed as the Big One, stated that at least two major earthquakes had been recorded originating from the West Valley Fault in the last 1,400 years. With no significant movement over the West Valley Fault since the 16th centuryas the fault system is expected to move every 350 to 400 yearsthere is a belief that a strong quake is ripe. After the Myanmar quake, several lawmakers and observers have called for the passage of proposed amendments to the countrys building code. Last March 31, House of Representatives committee on public works and highways chairperson and Surigao del Sur Rep.

"PH goal: Reduce maternal deaths to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030","MANILA, Philippines The World Health Organization has urged countries in the Western Pacific region, including the Philippines, to ensure that every mother and baby receive the care they deserve. Based on the WHO report released on Monday titled, Trends in maternal mortality estimates 2000 to 2023, there has been progress in reducing deaths among pregnant women worldwide. The maternal mortality ratio indicates the number of women who die during pregnancy or childbirth, which serves as a crucial measure of both womens health and how well health-care systems protect mothers. READ: Preventing maternal deaths For every 100,000 babies born in countries and areas in the region in 2023, 35 mothers died. This was 29 percent lower than in 2010 when 49 mothers died per 100,000 live births. However, despite this progress, too many families and communities still lose mothers and newborns to preventable causes. For instance, the number of pregnant Filipino women who died in 2023 was higher than the regional average. According to the report, 84 Filipino mothers died for every 100,000 babies born in 2023. This was despite the improvement of the MMR in the country, a 28-percent decrease from the 117 maternal deaths every 100,000 live births recorded in 2010. For the Philippines, it will be a race to meet the Sustainable Development Goal MMR of 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. Pregnancy and childbirth should be a time of joy, but for some families and communities, it ends in tragedy. The life of every mother and every newborn is precious, and we must do everything possible to save them, said Dr.Saia Mau Piukala, WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, at a press conference in Manila on Monday, which is World Health Day. We have the power to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths in our region. Every woman and every baby deserves the highest quality of care to ensure their survival and well-being, he said. According to Piukala, this requires not just better access to care, but a transformation in the quality of health care that women and newborns receive, particularly in the most vulnerable communities. The WHO also kicked off on Monday a yearlong campaign on maternal and newborn health called Healthy beginnings, hopeful futures to urge the health community to ramp up efforts to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths, and to prioritize womens longer-term health and well-being. According to the WHO regional director, governments can support better quality maternal health care by making sustained investments in safe and accessible maternal newborn care; supporting an enabling environment for health workers such as safeguarding uninterrupted access to water and sanitation; and ensuring health facilities are well-stocked with essential medicines and supplies. Health authorities should also equip their health-care workers with proper training and supplies so they can identify issues early, prevent infections and handle difficult situations confidently.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2050738/ph-goal-reduce-maternal-deaths-to-70-per-100000-live-births-by-2030,others
Supreme Court asked to nullify Naia concession deal,"MANILA, Philippines A group of lawyers on Monday asked the Supreme Court to nullify the concession contract for Ninoy Aquino International Airport , citing violations of constitutional rights to due process and equal protection under the law. In a 182-page petition for certiorari and prohibition, lawyers Joel Butuyan, Ma. Soledad Derequito-Mawis, Antonio Gabriel La Via, Roger Rayel, and Jose Mari Benjamin Francisco Tirol urged the high court to declare unconstitutional, illegal, and void both the Manila International Airport Authority Administrative Order No. 1, series of 2024, and the Naia Public-Private Partnership project concession agreement. They also sought to stop the implementation of both measures. The petitioners further asked the high tribunal to direct the respondents to restore the status quo at Naia as of Sept. 13, 2024, before the handover to a private operator and before the effectivity of MIAA RAO No. 1. READ: Consumers question Naia concession deal, fee hikes Named respondents were Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, representing Cabinet members; the Department of Transportation ; MIAA; the Prequalification, Bids and Awards Committee for the Naia PPP Project; and the PPP Governing Board, as well as private concessionaire New Naia Infra Corp. . According to the petitioners, the government has left the Filipino people and Naia users to fend for themselves under an administrative rate regulation that they said not only violates the law and public policy but also defies the all-important constitutional provisions on separation of powers, due process, and equal protection of laws. They warned that a Supreme Court ruling upholding the concession agreement would open the floodgates to an open and institutional connivance between the government and business conglomerates or other private entities to partner in operating public utilities, government monopolies, and government facilities, which will disregard the mandate of the law to protect the public interest and to shirk from the obligation to provide affordable and accessible public services. As it stands, the Naia PPP Project is just privatization for privatizations sake. From inception to implementation, the Project was never designed with the common good or public welfare in mind, the petition read in part. The P170.6-billion concession agreement, dated March 18, 2024, is a contract between the DOTr, MIAA, and NNIC covering the rehabilitation, operation, expansion, and eventual transfer of Naia. It grants NNIC the right to operate and maintain the airport for 15 years, extendable by another 10 years. NNIC began collecting fees and charges at Naia on Oct. 1, 2024, following RAO1, enforcing substantially increased rates from higher vehicle parking rates to land lease rentals and office space rentals, to aircraft landing and takeoff fees, to tacking fees and passenger processing fees, among others. The lawyers argued that the bidding did not comply with and was in violation of the provisions of the new PPP Code signed into law on Dec. 5, 2023, and took effect before the bidding on Dec. 23, 2023. They also argued that the adoption and integration of RAO1 into the concession agreement violated their right to procedural due process, pointing to the lack of genuine and meaningful public participation. The petition cited strong opposition and serious objections from airline groups, including the Air Carriers Association of the Philippines, the Board of Airline Representatives, the Airline Operators Council, and the International Air Transport Association Philippines. None of these objections, they said, were addressed during the sole public hearing conducted by MIAA on Feb. 12, 2024. The lawyers warned that without immediate action from the high court, the continued implementation of RAO1 and the concession agreement could cause grave injustice and irreparable damage to millions of Filipinos and foreign travelers, as well as to airlines, concessionaires, and lessees now paying increased rates under the contested administrative order. Given the circumstances, the extreme urgency of and paramount necessity for a temporary restraining order, writ of preliminary injunction or status quo ante order issued by the Honorable Court cannot be overstated, the petitioners said. They also asked that respondents be compelled to return all sums collected under RAO1, whether from airline passengers, airlines, aviation service providers, lessees, concessionaires, or the general public, that exceed the rates in place at Naia on Sept. 13, 2024.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2050726/supreme-court-asked-to-nullify-naia-concession-deal,others

Roque doubts vlogger after he gets tagged as polvoron video source,"MANILA, Philippines Former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque has cast doubt on the credibility of the vlogger who claimed that he was the source of the polvoron video, which showed a man allegedly sniffing an illegal drug. In a livestream on Tuesday, which was posted on his social media pages, Roque and vlogger Maharlika questioned the motives of vlogger Vicente Cunanan known online as Pebbles for claiming that he was behind the video accusing President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of drug use. Cunanan earlier told the House of Representatives tri-committee that the video was edited to make it seem like Marcos was doing drugs, adding that Roque was the source of the clip. READ: Vlogger says Roque behind Pulvoron video edited to look like Marcos His character is truly questionable from being a fierce critic of Marcos to now being a bootlicker. Why? How much was it? Whats the reason? Tell us, why?Roque, who is currently in the Netherlands to seek political asylum, said in Filipino. Sorry Pebbles, but I really share the view of Maharlika that we are not mad at you, but if ever, we pity you because we understand that we are not like you who rely only on online selling for a living, we have some savings because we happened to get by with our work, he added. Roque also disputed Cunanans sworn affidavit wherein the former Malacaang official supposedly said that he was good at overthrowing governments. According to Roque, what would bring down the government is the growing anger of people who are allegedly tired of the Marcos administrations mismanagement. Now, is the video enough to overthrow the government? No, because what would overthrow the government is a combined opinion from the masses that they no longer deserve to stay in power. Not Harry Roque, dont give mo too much credit, as if Im too good, he said in Filipino. Cunanan was referring to a video accusing Marcos of using illegal drugs, which spread on social media in July 2024 just before he delivered his third State of the Nation Address. However, cybercrime experts from the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation said the video did not feature Marcos. READ: NBI, PNP Cybercrime findings on video: Definitely not the President In a sworn statement submitted to the House, Cunanan said that she was invited to a private dinner along with other vloggers supporting former President Rodrigo Duterte. During the dinner, Roque allegedly told the vloggers that a politicians relative had given him a video showing Marcos supposedly using cocaine. So do you think Pebbles, there was an intentional alteration of the video to manipulate the image of that one in the video [] this means, it appears that the sharing of this video to destroy PBBMs reputation was planned, correct? Antipolo 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop asked Cunanan. Yes, Mr. Chair, Cunanan said. And according to you, it was Harry Roque behind this? Acop asked again. Yes, Mr. Chair, Cunanan replied. The tri-committee has been tasked to probe the spread of disinformation online after several resolutions were filed and privilege speeches about the matter were delivered. Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Robert Ace Barbers was one of the lawmakers who delivered a privilege speech following rumors about him and the other chairpersons of the House quad committee. During that time, the quad committee was probing illegal activities in Philippine offshore gaming operators, the illegal drug trade, and extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administrations drug war. In May 2024, lawmakers urged the public to exercise discretion amid the spread of videos where Marcos voice was mimicked to announce that the Philippines was getting ready for war against China.

"More Baguio residents engage in rooftop, backyard food production","ROOFTOP GARDEN BAGUIO CITY, Philippines The City Veterinary and Agriculture Office here said more residents are engaging in rooftop and backyard food production, which is seen to help boost the countrys food sustainability. CVAO head Dr. Silardo Bested said in a report to the city government on Thursday that there are now 94 Gulayan sa Paaralan from the 40 initially targeted to be established. There are also 1,757 home gardens. He said seedlings distribution reached 6,121, exceeding the target of 4,000. The remarkable outcomes in the implementation of agriculture interventions that demonstrated significant dedication in exceeding targets across various initiatives improve the current state of agriculture in the urban center, he said. Aside from vegetables, Bested said they were able to disperse 1,166 chickens and 30 bee colonies in addition to the distribution of 10,550 fish fingerlings for inland aquaculture. He said some residents have maintained container fish pens or backyard fishponds for both personal consumption and for sale to neighbors. We give out free [agricultural] products so that we can encourage the residents to grow food, whether vegetables, fish, or animals, [in] their small spaces and pots, he said in a phone interview on Thursday. This will ensure [an] available food supply for the familys consumption or income [from] the extra production that they sell to friends or neighbors, he added. Bested said they also intervene in terms of marketing by conducting farmers market days and Kadiwa activities. The citys Kadiwa trucks are utilized to help in the transport of goods from farms to markets and buying agricultural inputs from markets to farms, thereby increasing profitability. Bested further said they continue to improve agricultural infrastructure such as irrigation systems, production facilities, farm-to-market roads, and seedling nurseries. These initiatives are meant to increase farming efficiency and reduce post-harvest losses. He said, The initiatives underscore a strong commitment to sustainability, food security, and empowering local communities with knowledge and resources for long-term impact. Meanwhile, the local government continues to provide programs and opportunities that nurture the talents and potential of young people and lure them into agriculture. The city government has also sent young farmers to an internship program in Taiwan, allowing them to see the great potential of the foreign countrys agricultural industry.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049900/more-baguio-residents-engage-in-rooftop-backyard-food-production,others
MRT 3 suspends rule vs carrying of heavy luggage following DOTr order,"MANILA, Philippines Metro Rail Transit-3 on Friday suspended its policy against carrying heavy luggage on its trains. This directive comes following the order of Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon . Pending review, luggage exceeding two feet by two feet will now be allowed. On Thursday, Dizon questioned MRT-3s policy, stressing that the rail service should not make the lives of commuters even more difficult. In response to Department of Transportation Philippines Secretary Vince Dizons instructions, MRT-3 General Manager Michael Capati ordered the suspension of the old policy on bringing hand-carried luggage inside the train, the rail management said in a statement. Capati also said he would review the policy again to ensure the comfort and welfare of commuters. He added that peoples inputs are always considered in crafting policy decisions. MRT 3s previous reiteration of its policy on not allowing luggage exceeding its designated limit earned the ire of the people. The trains management tried to justify the policy by saying that bigger luggage could occupy space inside its wagons, eating up the space that could be used by other passengers. However, Filipinos on social media criticized the rule, which they deemed as one that aggravates the plight of the passengers. This is anti-commuter. What if I want to save money and lessen emissions when going to the airport? Please reconsider, a social media user pleaded to the MRT 3 officials on Facebook on Wednesday. Its not like everyone brings big [luggage] daily, the person pointed out. Not to mention, the stations themselves are not luggage-friendly to begin with, the media user lamented. Another Facebook user noted that MRT-3 is in close proximity to major transport hubs that link Metro Manila to provinces, and the transportation lines will soon be integrated through the construction of rail projects. The person is referring to the North-South Commuter Railway and the Metro Manila Subway. Both train systems will serve two major airports, the Clark International Airport and NAIA , the user said. Wouldnt your baggage policy contradict [the] DOTrs mission of providing a safe and efficient experience for all commuters? the person asked.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049921/mrt-suspends-luggage-rule-following-dotrs-order,others
"Ex-Solon to Abalos: Go down to Guimba, talk with farmers on rice tariff","MANILA, Philippines A former House of Representatives member has called on former Interior Secretary and senatorial candidate Benhur Abalos to sit down and discuss with farmers his proposed amendments to the Rice Tariffication Law so that he will have firsthand information about the issue. In a statement on Thursday, lawyer and former Magsasaka party-list lawmaker Argel Cabatbat extended an invitation to Abalos to visit Guimba, Nueva Ecija, for a face-to-face dialogue with farmers. Cabatbats invitation came after Abalos called for amendments to the RTL, as the law supposedly harmed local farmers while failing in its promise to stabilize rice prices. Secretary Abalos proposal to amend the Rice Tariffication Law is good. But it will be more meaningful if he hears the sentiments and stories of people from the farmlands, Cabatbat said in Filipino. Thats why we are inviting him to go down to Guimba so that we can listen to the grievances of farmers and farmworkers, he added. According to Cabatbat, he hopes Department of Agriculture officials would also attend the meeting, noting that their goal is not to argue but to listen, clarify, and find solutions for the problems hounding the agricultural sector. On Tuesday, Abalos said that there should be a continuous dialogue between farmers and the DA so that rice tariff issues faced by agricultural workers would be addressed. The Rice Tariffication Law has been around for a long time. The goal was to improve and make rice cheaper, but now its problems are starting to show. Congress and the Senate should look at it closely and see what needs to be fixed in the law to help our farmers, Abalos said. Abalos noted that the RTL has serious flaws that Congress should fix, like stripping the National Food Authority of the power to sell rice and import grains. READ: Abalos seeks stronger NFA to protect farmers, stabilize rice prices In the 19th Congress, the House approved on the third and final reading House Bill No. 10381, which seeks amendments to Republic Act No. 11203 or RTL to bring back some of NFAs functions. If enacted, the Agriculture Secretary can declare, based on the recommendation of the National Price Coordinating Council or Local Price Coordinating Council, a food security emergency due to the following reasons: During a food security emergency, the NFA would be allowed to intervene and sellricedirectly by purchasing grains from local farmers, with importation as a last resort. READ: House amendments to rice tariff law approved on 3rd reading With the current status, the NFA had to wait for a food security emergency declaration before it could sell cheaper rice. However, the bill faced opposition in the Senate amid fears that giving back some of NFAs mandates might lead to corruption again. House committee on agriculture and food chairperson and Quezon 1st District Rep. Wilfrido Mark Enverga, meanwhile, assured senators that reinstating some of NFAs powers would not translate into corruption because the agency will still have a limited role in terms of importation. Senator Cynthia Villar, principal author of the RTL, is one of the several senators who have warned against amending R.A. No. 11203, as the law specifically barred the NFA from importing and selling rice due to rampant corruption in the agency. READ: Rep. Enverga assures public of NFAs limited role on importation Cabatbat called out people spreading misinformation online, particularly about a farmer who allegedly took his own life due to the low prices of palay. The DA and the National Bureau of Investigation have already debunked these claims. Lets be clear: farmworkers are farmers. They give life to agriculture, and they should not be used as tools for false information. We should not let fake news overpower the true fight the fight against high prices of goods, the call for support [for] local harvesting, and the fight for a dignified life for our farmers, he said. This isnt about sides. This is about truth. And if we really want to fix the system, we have to start with listening, he added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049928/ex-solon-to-abalos-go-down-to-guimba-talk-with-farmers-on-rice-tariff,others

Students frustrated with VP Dutertes stint at DepEd Solons,"MANILA, Philippines The high number of students wanting to see Vice President Sara Duterte removed from her office is a reflection of frustration and anger over her allegedly anomalous stint at the Department of Education , a lawmaker said on Wednesday. In a statement, Assistant Majority Leader and Zambales Rep. Jefferson Khonghun said that the students surveyed by the Center for Student Initiatives may have seen Dutertes time at the DepEd, which was marred by accusations of irregular confidential fund expenditures. CSI recently said that a survey of 2,000 students nationwide, done from February 28 to March 16, revealed that 84.8 percent of students want Duterte removed from office. READ: 84% of students want VP Sara Duterte removed from office CSI survey We can see through this survey that students who may have seen her stint as DepEd secretary believe that she should be removed from her post. Why, you may ask. Maybe because they know that she did not manage DepEd well when she was there, Khonghun said in Filipino. If she was already problematic at DepEd, how much more now with the grave corruption allegations against her? he asked. The House of Representatives committee on good government and public accountability last September 2024 started an investigation of issues hounding DepEd and the Office of the Vice President , including the CF expenditures. At one point in the hearing, officials from DepEd and OVP admitted that upon Dutertes instructions, she left the release of the CFs to individuals who are not designated as special disbursement officers . Last November 25, Gina Acosta, OVPs SDO, said she left the release of CFs to Vice Presidential Security and Protection Group chief Col. Raymund Dante Lachica. Aside from Acosta, former DepEd SDO Edward Fajarda said that Dutertewhen she was still Education secretarydesignated Col. Dennis Nolasco as the official responsible for disbursing the CFs. Aside from this, lawmakers also observed that DepEd under Duterte supposedly made it seem that CFs were used for a youth training program, when it is the Armed Forces of the Philippines and local government units who shouldered most of the expenses. At an October 17 hearing of the same panel, Batangas Rep. Gerville Luistro asked Army Col. Manaros Boransing during the hearing regarding what agencies funds were used for the Youth Leadership Summit an anti-insurgency campaign for young people which DepEd supposedly allocated P15 million of its CF. Boransing said the Philippine Army and the local government units spent funds for the YLS. These issues are on top of the allegedly fictitious names used to sign acknowledgement receipts of CF disbursements. Antipolo Rep. Romeo Acop noticed that some of the ARs were signed by a certain Mary Grace Piattos, which had a first name similar to a coffee shop, and a last name of a famous potato chip brand. Later on, Lanao del Sur Zia Alonto Adiong showed two ARsone for OVP and another for DepEdwhich were both received by a certain Kokoy Villamin. However, the signatures and handwriting of Villamin differed. READ: House probe: OVP, DepEd CFs received by same man, different signatures Khonghun said that this kind of leadership at DepEd is why students want Duterte removed from office. If this is how she led DepEd, it is not surprising why many students believe that she should be removed from her post. We can also include in the discussions that the Vice President did not really address the problems hounding DepEd, like the low quality of education, the shortage in school supplies, and other issues at the department when she was at its helm, he said. Let us listen to the voice of our youth. They are the sector most affected by the decisions and shortcomings of a leader who failed her duties. She should face the allegations against herif she did nothing wrong, why is she evasive? he added. Iloilo Rep. Lorenz Defensor meanwhile in a separate interview said that the students frustration is a good sign that the youth sector is aware of issues hounding Duterte. If 84 percent of the surveyed agree that the Vice President should be held accountable, it only means that our people, the youth sector, is aware of the issues and its a good sign for them to call for accountability through an impeachment process that we will go through. Its a good sign for me, he noted. Last February 5, Duterte was impeached by the House after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint, hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a Vice President. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-thirds of all House membersin this case, 102 out of 306have signed and endorsed the petition. Under the Constitution, the Senate will act as an impeachment court with sitting senators being judges. Duterte can be removed from office if the Senate convicts her for the articles submitted by the House. However, trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049421/students-wanting-vp-ousted-shows-anger-over-her-deped-stint-solons,others

NIA sells 1.2 million kilos of cheap rice in Western Visayas in 6 months,"ILOILO CITY, Philippines The National Irrigation Administration in Western Visayas has sold some 1.2 million kilograms of low-cost rice since its rollout in September 2024. NIA-VI data showed that as of this time, it has sold 604,356 kg of the Rice for All at P35 per kg and 63,899 bags of the Bagong Bayaning Magsasaka rice at P29 per kg. Our P29 per kilo rice is intended for 4Ps members, solo parents, PWDs , and senior citizens, said NIA VI public relations officer Danielle Pijuan in an interview on Tuesday. We also have P35 per kilo. Thats for everybody, he added. She said NIA prepared a total of 668,605 kg for the Rice for All and 67,566 bags of the BBM rice at the start of the program implementation last year. Currently, they are left with 64,248 kg for the Rice for All and 3,667.3 bags for BBM rice, translating to around 100,921 kg in total. The products are available in local government units based on a schedule set by irrigation management offices. But mostly, these are sold at the Kadiwa ng Pangulo in NIA outlets. For the P29 per kg rice, buyers are advised to purchase only one bag per week and bring their identification cards. Pijuan said they will continue to sell cheaper rice as long as it is available. Supply for the Rice for All and BBM rice is sourced from the agencys contract farming program. Under this program, a farmer or an irrigators association receives a total of P50,000 in cash and farm input subsidies for every hectare of rice field. Upon harvest, the farmer will deliver five metric tons to NIA. Fifty percent of the well-milled rice will go to Kadiwa stores to be sold at P29 per kg, and the remaining 50 percent at P35 per kg or whatever the prevailing price in the market is. Currently, the contract farming program covers 1,290.3 hectares across the region. The goal of NIA is to provide the masses with low-cost and affordable rice. What we want to achieve is for our local farmers to provide very affordable rice and eliminate middlemen, Pijuan said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049132/nia-sells-1-2-million-kilos-of-cheap-rice-in-western-visayas-in-6-months,others

Ex-DOF chief: Reallocating idle funds for emergency response not new,"MANILA, Philippines Reallocating idle government funds to respond to national emergencies is not a new practice, former Finance Secretary Margarito Teves told the Supreme Court. Teves is one of the amici curiae during the oral argument on the petitions assailing the transfer of P89.9-billion unutilized funds of PhilHealth to the national treasury. He said even previous administrations did similar fund sweeps to address local crises. In the case of President [Fidel] Ramos, it was done when the Philippines and Asia were confronted with the Asian financial crisis. I recall he said, lets try to get all the balances from different institutions that are now in the different banks and utilize this to address the crisis, Teves said. Teves said that during his time as secretary of the Department of Finance, they managed to address the fiscal challenge and even recorded a surplus following the reallocation of idle funds. He said, special funds tend to have a tendency to increase and that there probably should be a way of making use of these funds if they are not utilized. He added that under the Duterte administration, government balances were again reallocated as part of the COVID-19 response. These circumstances, in fact, were already there, Teves explained, adding that even in 2024, the lingering effects of the pandemic necessitated the expansion of unprogrammed appropriations. Teves explanation gave weight to the position of Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, who maintained that transferring idle, unused, and excess government subsidies, such as PhilHealths, back to the National Treasury is constitutional. Sleeping funds serve no one, Recto said. Every peso unused is a benefit denied to a Filipino citizen. We wouldnt be doing our job, Your Honors if we willfully neglect our duty to exercise fiscal prudence in this matter just because it is unusual. We wouldnt be doing our job if we clung to convention over common sense, he added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049730/ex-dof-chief-reallocating-idle-funds-for-emergency-response-not-new,others
"PH needs to boost quake preparedness, says OCD","MANILA, Philippines Following the destructive magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck Myanmar and Thailand last week which claimed thousands of lives, an official from the Office of Civil Defense on Tuesday admitted that the Philippines still has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to disaster preparedness. At a public briefing, OCD spokesperson Director Chris Noel Bendijo emphasized how crucial it is to comply with the National Building Code, noting that preparations for the Big One would be in vain if the infrastructure is not robust enough. Our duck, cover, and hold measures during earthquake drills will be meaningless if our buildings and structures collapse because they did not comply with the Building Code, said Bendijo in Filipino during the Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon briefing. Bendijo also emphasized the need for lawful issuance of building permits. When we take shortcuts here, we put ourselves and our families at risk when disaster strikes, because the resilience of our structures depends on our adherence to the Building Code, he added.

Ilocos police probe viral cops involved in violence in Pasuquin,"MANILA, Philippines The Ilocos police are investigating the circumstances surrounding a viral video wherein Pasuquin policemen were seen engaging in acts of violence by hitting civilians who were reportedly trying to report an incident at the municipal police station. Ilocos Region Police Director Brig. Gen. Lou Evangelista said he had already ordered the immediate validation and investigation of the case. Any violation of the PNP rules and standards committed by police officers, once proven, will be addressed with utmost seriousness, Evangelista disclosed in a statement on Monday. For now, we urge the public to remain calm and allow an impartial investigation of the incident. Rest assured that the PNP will remain committed to ensuring transparency throughout the process and will provide updates of the case as development arises, he added. In a Facebook post on Monday morning, user Step Ha Nie claimed that her stepfather was brutally attacked after reporting an incident to Pasuquin Municipal Police Station. Instead of listening to their concerns, the police attacked them out of nowhere. They began kicking my stepfather, who had already sustained injuries from the earlier attack. Not only that, but they also attacked those trying to intervene, the post reads. Whats more disappointing is that they pointed a gun at a minor who was simply trying to tell his father not to fight back. Afterward, they detained their companions, including a 14-year-old minor, without a valid reason or warrant, it adds. Attached with the post is a video showing three police personnel attacking the alleged complainants.

Palace admits failure to reach 1 million target housing units per year,"MANILA, Philippines The Palace on Monday admitted failing to reach its target of one million housing units per year due to certain obstacles relating to construction and contracting.

May mga pagkakataon po gustuhin po natin na matapos po ang lahat pero may mga causes of delays, said Castro in a Palace press conference. These delays, she said, included challenges in processing and releasing development loans, permitting and due diligence processes involving land ownership and issues with longer construction periods, particularly for vertical housing. Castro also cited issues with limited contractors, as only a few participate in the housing projects due to the low rates offered to the public. So, ito po ay mga issues na hindi po ninanais ng administrasyon but katulad ng sinabi ng ating Pangulo, We aim one million houses a year and we will try very, very hard, she added.

Abby Binay OKs landmark ordinance lowering property taxes in Makati,"MANILA, Philippines The Makati City government approved the highest amount of real property tax reduction in the city so far. Makati said it could still weather the revenue loss, thanks to the savings made following the departure of the 10 embo villages which the local government said are subsidiaries to the city coffers. Outgoing Makati mayor and senatorial candidate Abby Binay on Tuesday said she approved the ordinance that lowered existing real property tax rates on all classes of land in the city, effective January 1, 2025. On March 24, Binay signed City Ordinance No. 2025-047 amending sections of the Revised Makati Revenue Code, or City Ordinance No. 2004-A-025, which pertain to the imposition of basic real property tax and assessment levels. READ: Abby Binay, Pia Cayetano okay in same slate amid clan row Tiangco Following a comprehensive review of current tax rates and prevailing economic conditions, we have proceeded with our plan to lower tax rates for all classes of land in the city, Binay said in a statement. Binay said this move comes as the city had a substantive savings of up to P7.9 billion a year following the the removal of subsidies to 10 embo barangays. Residents and property owners in the city will now enjoy substantial savings from the biggest tax reduction and lowest assessment levels implemented by the city government to date, she added. Binay said the tax rate for residential properties has been reduced from 1.5 percent to 1.0 percent; commercial properties from 2.0 percent to 1.5 percent; industrial properties from 2.0 percent to 1.5 percent; and special properties from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent. Moreover, the additional tax rate for properties classified as residential/commercial has also been reduced from 0.25 percent to 0.125 percent. This move is expected to provide relief to residents and boost Makatis competitiveness as a premier investment destination for large corporations, startups, and small entrepreneurs, Binay said. READ: Senatorial bet Abby Binay not dwelling on being Alan Peters workmate The Supreme Court declared that Taguig has the rightful jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio Military Reservation where Bonifacio Global City and theEmbobarangays are located and not Makati. SC stated that that 10 barangays in Makatis second district based on historical, documentary and testimonial evidence, indeed fall within the territorial jurisdiction of Taguig. I believe we can manage very well even with lower RPT collection, Binay said. As more businesses choose to locate in Makati, our revenue from business tax and relevant fees will increase as well. More importantly, more jobs will be created for our residents, she continued. The tax rates for buildings, machinery, and other improvements remain the same, as follows: Under the amended of the revenue code, the assessment levels applied to the fair market value of real property to determine its assessed value have also been significantly lowered. For residential properties, the assessment level per classification has been adjusted as follows: Commercial and Industrial properties, previously assessed at 40 percent, are both assessed at lower rates. For commercial properties, the following assessment rates now apply: For industrial properties, the following assessment rates now apply: Under special classes, assessment levels have been retained for lands located in predominantly commercial/industrial areas at 0.70 percent, and lands situated in predominantly residential areas, 0.30 percent. For buildings, machineries, and other improvements, assessment values based on actual use remain as follows: Under Section 4, any excess that may result from the application of the ordinance on real property tax assessments that have been paid before the approval of the ordinance, covering the period Jan. 1, 2025 onwards, will be considered as a tax credit that may be applied to succeeding real property tax assessments. This landmark ordinance highlights the Makati city governments commitment to a fair, efficient, and transparent tax system, while ensuring fiscal stability and adaptability to changing economic conditions, the statement said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048551/makati-oks-less-property-tax-cites-savings-made-as-embo-subsidies-stop,others

Ito kasi ang katotohanan sa ating lipunan: hindi madaling ipa-trending ang konsepto ng human rights sa ating bayan, Palpal-latoc said. Para sa masang Pilipino, hindi sila kayang busugin, patawanin, o aliwin ng mga teknikal na salitang pumapalibot sa karapatang pantao. Hindi naman dapat maging komplikado ang human rights. We have to acknowledge they are beyond a legal framework they are a moral compass that guides our work, he added. According to Palpal-latoc, the media plays an important role in delivering the message of human rights so that the public can understand how each persons dignity should be protected. Hindi lamang ang technicalities sa usaping pamamahayag ang dahilan kung bakit narito tayo. We will go beyond the formalities. Bilang Fourth Estate, ang layunin natin ay maging effective storytellers para sa mga karapatan ng isang jeepney driver, isang manininda, isang magsasaka, at para sa bawat ordinaryong Pilipino, he said. Each story we convey must be based on respect for the inherent dignity and equality of all. Malawak ang impluwensya ng media sa paghulma ng isang mapagpalayang bansa kung saan ang karapatan ng bawat isa ay nirerespeto, kinikilala, at isinasabuhay. Tinig ninyo ang nagpapalakas sa mga usaping mahalaga ukol sa karapatang pantao, he added. CHR received a huge amount of backlash during the time of former President Rodrigo Duterte after it raised concerns over the spate of killings under his war against illegal drugs. During his second State of the Nation Address in July 2017, Duterte threatened to abolish the CHR for being critical of his administrations drug war, adding that he would not allow the police or the military to be investigated by the commission without them first talking to him. I will not allow my men to go there to be investigated. Human Rights Commission, you address your request through me because the Armed Forces are under me, and the police are under me. Kaya pag kinuwestyon ninyo sila for investigation, dadaan muna sa akin , he said. In the following years Sona, Duterte delivered a line that has been repeatedly used by CHR criticsthat his concern is human lives, not human rights. READ: Duterte threatens to abolish CHR In January 2021, the CHR called out the administration for not including them in the inter-agency panel that was tasked to review the drug war deaths, saying that this goes against the Duterte governments commitments during the 44th Session of the Human Rights Council. In a 2022 report, CHR said that Duterte left a government that has failed in its obligations to protect human rights and that has encouraged a culture of impunity as it has not allowed officers involved in questionable drug war operations to be brought to justice. READ: For the record: Duterte leaves a legacy of impunity CHR Palpal-latoc hopes the training will allow the media to help the CHR promote more meaningful discussions on human rights. Umaasa ang CHR sa isang makabuluhang talakayan kasama ninyong lahat, tungo sa pagtataguyod ng isang mas makatarungang Pilipinas. Ang pagtitipong ito ay para rin sa CHR, para mas makilala namin kayo bilang aming force multipliers sa pagtatanggol ng mga karapatang pantao, he said. Sama-sama nating itaguyod ang midyang makatao, malaya, at mapagpalaya, he added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048562/chr-says-its-not-easy-to-make-human-rights-a-trending-topic,others
Castro: P65-million DepEd voucher mess happened under Dutertes watch,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Education is not heading to the dumpster following the recovery of P65 million from private schools, Malacaang said on Friday. These schools were flagged for irregularities in the Senior High School Voucher Program for school years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023. With this result, we can now say that DepEd will not be put to dumpster, Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary and Palace Press Officer Claire Castro said in a Palace press briefing. Hindi po mapupunta sa basurahan ngayon ang [DepEd] dahil may ginagawa, she noted. Castro was referring to the recovery of the funds from 40 of the 54 private schools that were terminated from the voucher program, after the DepEd in February carried out an investigation regarding ghost beneficiaries. She believed the issues surrounding the SHS-VP would not be investigated if the DepEd was still under Vice President Sara Duterte. Itoy nasa pamumuno na po ang DepEd ni Secretary Sonny Angara, she made the distinction. Naimbestigahan po ng mabuti yung ghost students, yung voucher program anomalies at ito po ay magreresulta ng P65 million na mare-recover po natin, she explained. Tandaan po natin, itong mga ghost students na ito ay nagsimula noong 2021 to 2022 [at] 2022 to 2023, Castro recalled. Ito po ay panahon ni dating Pangulong Duterte, at panahon noong naging DepEd secretary si VP Sara, she pointed out. The DepEd on Wednesday said around 38 of the 54 schools removed from the SHS-VP have fully refunded the government, while two have made partial payments. Only 14 schools have yet to return the disbursed funds, prompting the issuance of final demand letters. The DepEd said it is still determining whether or not the flagged irregularities amount to fraud. For the current school year, 12 schools are under review by DepEd.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048035/catro-p65-million-deped-voucher-mess-happened-under-dutertes-watch,others

Napolcom after MMDA tickets cop on video: Dont shame cops for clicks,"Updated @ 10:15 p.m., March 29, 2025 MANILA, Philippines Please dont shame our police just for the clicks and views. National Police Commission Commissioner Ralph Calinisan made this statement on Friday, following a video where the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority ticketed a Quezon City cop for parking on the sidewalk. The video supposedly posted online showed MMDA Special Operations Group Strike Force head Gabriel Go in clearing operations affecting the Anonas Police Station on March 25. Mutual respect between the MMDA and the PNP [Philippine National Police] would be most appreciated. Law enforcement is not a contest of who looks better. We dont need to one-up each other as we are partners in this effort, Calinisan said in a mix of English and Filipino. I agree that Metro Manila streets must be cleared of all obstructions from private individuals or government officials. Pero wag naman sana natin ipahiya ang pulis natin just for the clicks and views, he added. According to the Napolcom commissioner, Go had never spoken with the station commander of the Anonas Police Station to call his attention to the matter, as the MMDA strike force head supposedly claimed in the video. However, it is still not an excuse for policemen to park on the sidewalk, he added. Further, Calinisan appealed that the video be uploaded unedited and unspliced. READ: PNP eyes talks with DOTr, MMDA for Edsa busway exemption In the event that our policeman was overbearing, disciplinary action would be initiated against him. We will file a case against him if needed, Calinisan said. But maybe there is no need to shame on video a police officer who was humble enough. Let us do our work passionately.

Majority of Gen Z Filipinos who plan to marry prefer to wed after 35,"MANILA, Philippines Fewer couples in the Philippines are tying the knot as marriage rates continue to decline, according to government data. Meanwhile, many young Filipinos are in no rush to marry a recent survey found that among Generation Z respondents who do plan to wed, most intend to wait until after age 35. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, 414,213 marriages were recorded in 2023, a 7.8% drop from 449,428 in 2022. This downturn brought the crude marriage rate down from 4.0 to 3.7. A separate survey by Arkipelago Analytics, focusing on Gen Z Filipinos , found that only 40% of respondents said they want to get married someday. Of those who do, 60% prefer to do so after age 35 well beyond the typical marrying age of earlier generations. The survey also found that a majority of Gen Z feel little pressure to marry: 55% of respondents reported no compulsion to tie the knot. For those open to marriage, most pointed to emotional factors love, trust, and long-term companionship as their main motivations. Far fewer cited raising children, religious obligations, or financial and legal stability as primary reasons to wed. The findings indicate that Gen Z Filipinos are approaching marriage with greater intentionality, said Anna Mae Yu Lamentillo, founder of Arkipelago Analytics. Rather than following traditional timelines, many are prioritizing emotional readiness, personal goals, and long-term compatibility. Regionally, CALABARZON had the most weddings in 2023, accounting for 14.6% of the total, followed by the National Capital Region and Central Luzon . By contrast, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao had the fewest marriages at just 0.5% of the total. February was the most popular month for weddings.

CDO creates special justice zone to combat online child abuse,"CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY The city government has institutionalized its status as Northern Mindanaos first justice zone against online sexual abuse and exploitation of children . It created a coordinated legal framework to protect minors and prosecute offenders. Ordinance No. 2025-743, which was passed during Fridays city council session, formalizes the citys role as the countrys 14th designated justice zone under the Justice Sector Coordinating Council . The measure is authored by Vice Mayor Jocelyn Rodriguez and Councilor Joyleen Mercedes Balaba. This creates an inter-agency shield for our children, Rodriguez said in an interview, noting the ordinance strengthens coordination between city hall, police, prosecutors and courts. The ordinance builds upon the citys existing anti-OSAEC ordinance passed last year, which was partly inspired by the high-profile conviction of Australian sex offender Peter Gerald Scully. The justice zone initiative implements several key components including a rapid response protocol requiring 72-hour case assessments for all OSAEC reports. It also establishes specialized family courts to handle abuse cases and provides new digital forensic equipment for evidence processing. The ordinance also mandates comprehensive psychosocial services for victims through partnerships with local hospitals and child protection units. City records show 20 documented OSAEC cases since 2004, with seven convictions secured in the past three years. As of July 2024, authorities are actively investigating 14 additional cases.

10 non-Moro tribe leaders asks BARMM chief for protection from violence,"DAVAO CITY, Philippines Ten leaders of non-Moro indigenous peoples in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are asking new Interim Chief Minister Abdulraof Macacua for protection amidst the continued killings and displacement of the IP tribes in the region. Following are four of the leaders who made the appeal in a statement issued last Tuesday: READ: New BARMM chief mends ties with MILF Along with six others, they called on Macacua to take action on the killings of the Lumad. Among the appeals they made in the statement are the following: First and foremost, recognize and look forward to working with the newly appointed Interim Chief Minister Abdulraof Macacua. We are hopeful that your leadership will foster peace and security in the region. Secondly, we would like to appeal to the Interim Chief Minister to take immediate action in response to violence and killings affecting non-Moro IPs in the region. Just last February 17, another NMIP leader was brutally killed and beheaded in Datu Hoffer Ampatuan. He was the 85th NMIP killed since 2014 the year when the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro was signed. Among the four immediate actions that they called on the Macacua to take is the establishment of permanent military detachments, in coordination with the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines , in areas of non-Moro IPs experiencing increasing violence. These include the towns of Datu Odin Sinsuat in Maguindanao del Norte and South Upi and atu Hoffer Ampatuan in Maguindanao del Sur. These detachments should collaborate with local mediation bodies to prevent violent transformation of conflicts, the statement said. The non-Moro IP leaders also sought assistance for the displaced evacuees in line with Section 9g of the Bangsamoro Indigenous Peoples Act of 2024 on their rights in case of displacement and Section 8 of the Bangsamoro IDP Act of 2024 on the immediate assistance to IDPs. According to the last count of the Teduray-Lambangian tribe, at least 3,000 non-Moro IP families displaced by continued harassment by armed groups have not yet returned to their homes. They asked Macacua to enjoin the Ministry of Social Services and Development and other relevant regional and national government agencies to facilitate their return to their home communities. The statement also asked the chief minister to help address impunity and lack of justice for the victims of killings by coordinating with the Department of Justice for the designation of a DOJ special prosecutor to respond to non-Moro IP killings. They also asked for the mobilization of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples Affairs of the BARMM and the Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission to provide legal and paralegal support to families of victims, witnesses, and other non-Moro IPs at risk of being killed. According to the statement, 15 non-Moro IPs were killed in the year 2024 alone, and so far, no perpetrator has yet been brought to justice up to this day. While families of victims, especially witnesses to the crime, face continuing threats to their lives, the killers still roam around scot free, the IP leaders said in the statement. As head of the BARMM government, the Interim Chief Minister is in a position to create strong and reliable protection and justice mechanisms for NMIP communities in the region guided by the safeguards and guarantees enshrined in the Philippine Constitution, Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Bangsamoro Internally Displaced Persons Act of 2024 and the Bangsamoro Indigenous Peoples Act of 2024, leaders went on. We appeal to the new Interim Chief Minister to act on our calls to help restore hope and alleviate the fear in our communities. We need bold, decisive measures that guarantee our protection and deliver long-overdue justice.

DSWD refocuses Akap to aid those earning below minimum wage,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Social Welfare and Development has redirected its Ayuda sa Kapos ang Kita Program to support Filipinos earning below the minimum wage. Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian announced the policy shift on Thursday during a press conference at the DSWDs central office in Quezon City. Last year, the term used in the special provision was low income. So now, it is more defined as below minimum wage it is more focused because if you remember in the presidents veto message, he says below minimum wage. So, those who qualify are citizens who are below minimum wage, he said in Filipino. The revised guidelines require the publication of Akap beneficiaries on the DSWD website and social media platforms to enhance transparency, he added. As the mid-year elections are fast approaching, measures have been set to prevent political interference. Candidates will not be allowed to attend payout events or display campaign materials linking them to the program. READ: DSWD bans politicians, political materials during Akap distribution We will make sure that in the conduct of the payouts because that is becoming an issue, right? there are no politicians. And we will make sure that their materials are also not there, Gatchalian said in Filipino. Nearly five million near-poor Filipinos benefited from Akap during its first year. The program achieved a 99.31 percent utilization rate of its P26.7-billion budget. Regions such as Cagayan Valley, Davao, and Caraga posted 100 percent fund utilization. For 2025, P26 billion has been allocated to AKAP, targeting five million below-minimum-wage earners with medical, funeral, food, and cash relief through DSWDs Crisis Intervention Units and satellite offices. Gatchalian said the guidelines were crafted with input from the National Economic Development Authority and the Department of Labor and Employment READ: DSWD: Nearly 5M Filipinos got help thru Akap; 99% of funds used I want to emphasize that the Akap guidelines were thoroughly studied and shaped.

NBI urged to probe red-tagging of Makabayan bets,"MANILA, Philippines House Deputy Minority leader and ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro has requested the National Bureau of Investigation to probe the social media red-tagging and purported circulation of false content about her and other Makabayan senatorial candidates. In a letter she sent to the NBI on Thursday, Castro reported a pro-Duterte account claiming that she had died from a heart attack upon learning of the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte. She said this account could no longer be searched and had already been fact-checked by a media organization. READ: Rep. Castro asks Meta to restore her Facebook pages This video used edited photos, a misleading thumbnail, and utterly false claims to portray in a bad light myself and the legitimate issues for which I advocate, i.e., transparency over confidential funds and the Vice Presidents accountability for them, Castro said. Castro also said the channel or video could no longer be searched, and it could have been taken down. However, she said the NBI should still look into this account and coordinate with YouTube and Google as to the links of the video and channel. She also referred Makabayans request addressed to the Commission on Elections to the NBI. In particular, we referred to the attention of the Comelec an impersonation account creating and disseminating AI-generated and red-tagging videos through Facebook and essentially urging the public not to vote for progressive candidates under the Makabayan, Castro wrote. However, we at the Makabayan wish to stress that any investigation and all related actions thereto should strictly comply with the requirements of due process and should neither impair nor undermine free speech and other democratic rights of users and consumers of online content, she added. We believe that spreaders of red-tagging and false information online only get more vile and damaging to the public with every second that they are allowed to exist on YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms unchecked. We therefore hope for your immediate and favorable consideration of our requests, the lawmaker also said. Last week, Castro demanded Meta to restore her Facebook pages after the company unpublished them and restricted the personal accounts of the pages administrators. Castro said her first official Facebook page was unpublished last February 16, while the second was unpublished on March 15. She called these acts a form of digital censorship and an attack on freedom of expression. This is a clear case of digital harassment and censorship. Meta is systematically silencing progressive voices that speak truth to power, she added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2047679/nbi-urged-to-probe-red-tagging-of-makabayan-bets,others

Manila Water maintains 24/7 water service with facility upgrades,"MANILA, Philippines Manila Water has successfully completed six major facility upgrades to enhance its 24/7 water service for customers in the East Zone of Metro Manila and Rizal, particularly in preparation for increase in demand and possible power outages. Pumping stations play a crucial role in providing uninterrupted water service to customers in Metro Manila and Rizal. Recognizing this, Manila Water has focused on optimizing these stations to ensure they remain in top condition.

NPA commander from Negros yields to Cebu City police,"CEBU CITY An alleged commander of the New Peoples Army on Tuesday surrendered to the police in this city. Misael Atadero Dela Cruz, 57, a resident of Sitio Kakha, Barangay Talalak, Santa Catalina, Negros Oriental, was accompanied by his wife. He said he decided to surrender in Cebu City for security purposes as he feared yielding to authorities in Negros. Dela Cruz, also known as Jimlan, Layan, Ly, Totoy, Yanyan, Naldo, and Yaksel is facing multiple charges in court and said he was tired of hiding. The suspect is considered a national level most wanted person. I think he feels more at ease surrendering and revealing himself in Cebu City, possibly because of the media presence here. That might be a way for him to protect himself, said Lieutenant Colonel Macatangay, deputy director for operations of the Cebu City Police Office. The police served multiple warrants of arrest against him when he surrendered to the Abellana Police Station in Cebu City with the assistance of the Regional Intelligence Unit. The suspect has outstanding warrants for three counts of rebellion issued by the Regional Trial Court Branch 63 in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental; and violations of Republic Act 9851 issued by the Regional Trial Court Branch 64 in Guihulngan City. He also has three counts of murder charges issued by Regional Trial Court Branch 63 in Bayawan City and Branch 64 in Guihulngan City; two counts of frustrated murder issued by Regional Trial Court Branch 64 in Guihulngan City and Branch 63 in Bayawan City; and violations of Republic Act 10591 , Republic Act 7166, and Comelec Resolution No. 10728, all issued by Regional Trial Court Branch 38 in Dumaguete City. He also faces two counts of robbery issued by Regional Trial Court Branch 64 in Guihulngan City and six counts of theft issued by the same court in Guihulngan City.

Groups ask SC to nullify provisions of 2025 national budget,"MANILA, Philippines Cause-oriented groups and other individuals petitioned the Supreme Court on Friday to declare certain provisions of the 2025 national budget unconstitutional. In a petition for certiorari, they challenged the absence of a subsidy for the state health insurer Philippine Health Insurance Corporation , arguing that it violates the Constitutional provision on the right to health. READ: PhilHealths zero subsidy for 2025 an insult to members group They also questioned the budget allocation for education, which was much lower than the budget given to the Department of Public Works and Highways. Another provision that petitioners want to declare unconstitutional is the provision on post-enactment and enactment identification and endorsement of the beneficiaries of the Ayuda sa Kapos ang Kita Program . While the petition is pending, petitioners asked the SC to issue a temporary restraining order against the enforcement of the 2025 budget. Petitioners include the 1Sambayan coalition, party-list group Sanlakas, Advocates for National Interest, former Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales, health advocate Minguita Padilla, and University of the Philippines professors Cielo Magno and Dante Gatmaytan. The respondents are the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Office of the Executive Secretary, the Department of Budget and Management, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Public Works and Highways. In their 92-page petition, they pointed out that the Constitution states that education shall have the highest budgetary priority. However, they argue that this mandate was disregarded in the 2025 budget, with the Department of Education receiving only P737,084,501. The budget was made to appear higher at P1.0559 trillion due to the inclusion of budgets from other agencies related to skills training. Meanwhile, the DPWH has a budget of P1,113,764,447, making infrastructure the highest-funded sector, violating the Constitution. The allocation for the infrastructure sector was the highest, in violation of the Constitution, the petition stated. READ: Palace maintains DepEd has highest allocation in 2025 budget On the zero budget for PhilHealth, petitioners said it violates two constitutional provisions: Article II, Section 15, which states that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Another constitutional provision allegedly violated and mentioned by the petitioners is Article XIII, which mandates the state to provide an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development to make essential health and social services accessible and affordable to all. The legislature does not have the discretion to determine when, or whether, they shall be effective and cannot be rendered entirely meaningless by simply refusing to pass the needed implementing statute, the petitioners said. The petition alleged that a big chunk of the 2025 budget was diverted to projects and programs that effectively constitute pork barrel as it would allow politicians, including legislators, to effectively control certain aspects of the funds utilization through various post-enactment measures. Respondents committed grave abuse of discretion in diminishing the share of the education sector and eliminating budgetary support for PhilHealth while providing allocations to pork barrel, the petitioners said. Early this year, former Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, Davao 3rd district Rep. Isidro Ungab, and several others filed a petition to nullify the 2025 budget due to zero allocation to PhilHealth and allegations of blank items in the bicameral report.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2047909/cause-oriented-groups-ask-supreme-court-to-nullify-provisions-of-2025-national-budget,others

Manila Water Non-East Zone activates summer mitigation plan,"MANILA, Philippines As the dry warm season begins in the Philippines with the end of the northeast monsoon or amihan, Manila Water Philippine Ventures , the Non-East Zone subsidiary of Manila Water Company, has begun implementing its summer mitigation plan to ensure continuous water supply across its service areas. Although El Nio is not in effect this year, MWPV is proactively executing a comprehensive summer mitigation plan to address potential water availability issues, considering the impacts of global warming and climate change on water sources. The summer mitigation plan incorporates integrated water resource planning, enabling all operating units across diverse geographic areas to simultaneously implement localized, data-driven mitigation programs. These measures have been in place since the onset of El Nio in 2024. Historical data from PAGASA indicates that provinces such as Batangas, Laguna, Isabela, Aklan, Cebu, Samar, and Davao Del Norte have experienced dry spells and droughts. MWPV is actively serving these regions through its operating units: Laguna Water and Laguna Aquatech in Laguna; South Luzon Water in Batangas; Metro Ilagan Water in Isabela; Boracay Water in Aklan; Cebu Water in Cebu; Calbayog Water in Samar Province; and Tagum Water in Davao Del Norte. With the early, uniform, and coordinated execution of summer preparedness plans across multiple MWPV operating units, MWPV is leveraging predictive models and historical trends to proactively deploy resources, rather than reactively responding to issues. This approach ensures a reliable water supply, minimizes service interruptions, and boosts customer confidence during peak summer demand. As we enter the dry and warm season, we are taking proactive steps to ensure that our water service remains uninterrupted despite any challenges. Recognizing the global impacts of climate change and global warming on water supply, we are committed to implementing strategies that bolster the resilience of our water sources and facilities, assuring our customers of our hands-on approach to maintaining reliable service, says Melvin John Tan, Chief Operating Officer of Manila Water Non-East Zone. Since last year, the company has been actively rolling out preparedness activities and programs across all its business units. These initiatives encompass Non-Revenue Water recovery efforts, network enhancement projects, performance monitoring and rehabilitation of deepwells and surface water sources, pressure management recovery, and preventive maintenance of facilities including pumps, tanks and generator sets. Moreover, the company has launched mitigation programs and initiatives, including optimizing network influence areas and reservoir utilization, transitioning between supply- and demand-based operations as needed, and exploring and developing new water sources. On critical situations, MWPV has devised countermeasures such as deploying water tankers, augmenting water supply through the installation of static tanks and interconnectivity network lines, operating standby deepwells and in-line boosters, and optimizing the backwash recovery program in water treatment plants.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2047902/manila-water-non-east-zone-activates-summer-mitigation-plan,others

DOE: Limit energy consumption during LNG terminal maintenance,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Energy has urged consumers in Luzon to conserve energy this weekend as two major natural gas power plants undergo a scheduled shutdown to facilitate mechanical activities at Linseed Field Corporations liquefied natural gas terminal. The agency announced on Friday that the shutdown will be from 9:00 a.m. on Saturday, March 29, to 6:39 a.m. on Monday, March 31. It involves South Premiere Power Corporation and Excellent Energy Resources Inc. , facilities jointly owned by Meralco PowerGen, San Miguel Global Power, and Aboitiz Power. According to the DOE, the temporary shutdown is critical for completing Linseed Field Corporations first onshore LNG storage tank by the end of April. Simple actions such as maximizing natural lighting and ventilation when possible, turning off lights and non-essential appliances when not in use, and setting air conditioners to 24 to 26C can significantly contribute to reducing demand on the grid, the DOE. Despite the shutdown, the Independent Electricity Markey Operator of the Philippines initially assessed that there were no expected yellow or red alerts. However, a temporary increase in spot market prices may occur. A final evaluation will be conducted once the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines updates its Market Management System with the latest outage schedule. Meralco has confirmed that supply reserves for the weekend are projected to be adequate. However, the company said it will remain on high alert and is prepared to activate its Interruptible Load Program should the need arise. In addition to the urgency of conservation efforts, summer has begun, as announced by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration on March 26.

Dismissed Cebu City Mayor Rama faces another dismissal from service,"CEBU CITY Dismissed City Mayor Michael Rama is facing another legal obstacle. The Office of the Ombudsman has ordered another dismissal from service, Ramas second in three months. This time, the former mayor was found liable for awarding three purchase orders for garbage collection and disposal to three private firms without conducting a competitive bidding process. The Inquirer tried to reach Rama for a statement but he had not responded. But his wife, Malou, took to Facebook her sentiments regarding her husbands second dismissal from the service, saying the setback was yet another tactic used by his political enemies to stop his reelection bid. Rama, she added, would continue to campaign and run in the May 12 elections. Do not be worried about the recent development. That is just a tactic of our opponent, Malou said in Cebuano. They want to destroy Mayor Mike Rama. But more people are instead drawn to Partido Barug Bag-ong Sugbo Team Rama. The fight continues, she added. In an order dated Jan. 3, 2025 but was released only on March 28, the anti-graft office found sufficient basis to hold Rama liable for grave misconduct. The order also applied to five former members of the Bids and Awards Committee Leizl Jacobe Calamba, Lyndon Bernardo Jao Basan, Conrado Acha Ordesta III, Janeses Bordario Ponce, and Dominic Amigable Dio. Verily, because of respondents grave misconduct, ACM Hauling Services, Jomara Konstruckt Corp., and ARN Central Waste Management Inc. derived unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference from the contracts awarded to them, the anti-graft office said. The decision was signed by Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officers Myra Nimfa Solidum Mendieta and Roseann Claudine Pasion, reviewed by Preliminary Investigation and Administrative Adjudication Director Nellie Boguen-Golez, and approved by Deputy Ombudsman Jose Balmeo Jr. The case stemmed from a complaint filed by Jundel Bontuyan on Aug. 11, 2023, alleging that Rama and members of the BAC issued three purchase orders for garbage collection and disposal to Jomara Konstruckt Corp., ACM Hauling Services, and ARN Central Waste Management Inc. According to the Ombudsman, misconduct is the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment. When the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules are manifest, the public officer shall be liable for grave misconduct, it added. In this case, there is sufficient evidence to adequately conclude that the elements of corruption and flagrant disregard of established rules are manifest when respondents awarded the contracts to ACM Hauling Services, Jomara Konstruckt Corp., and ARN Central Waste Management Inc. , the Ombudsman said. The recent Ombudsman decision was just the recent in the series of legal debacles being faced by Rama. In May 2024, the Ombudsman ordered a six-month preventive suspension on Rama and seven other government officials of this capital city pending an investigation of their alleged failure to pay the salaries of at least four employees for seven months. Rama started serving his six-month preventive suspension on May 10, 2024. Still, before he could fully serve it on Nov. 6, the Ombudsman issued another order on Oct. 3 dismissing him from the service for nepotism and grave misconduct for appointing his two brothers-in-law to government posts. Ramas dismissal order carried a perpetual disqualification from public service. Five days after the Ombudsmans order came out, the DILG installed Vice Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia as the new mayor of Cebu City. Rama went to the Supreme Court and challenged Commission on Elections Resolution No. 11044-A that mandated the cancellation of all Certificates of Candidacy of aspirants who have been slapped with a penalty of disqualification by the Ombudsman so he could seek reelection. The SC en banc issued a temporary restraining order, stopping the Comelec from disqualifying Rama while the high court reviewed the case against him.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048283/dismissed-cebu-city-mayor-rama-faces-another-dismissal-from-service,others

INQToday: Police to file raps vs suspect in bloody Antipolo road rage,"Heres a quick roundup of todays top stories: Rescuers braved aftershocks to scour the devastated city of Mandalay in Myanmar for survivors on Monday, March 31, after a massive earthquake killed at least 1,700 people in the country and at least 18 in neighbouring Thailand. Vice President Sara Duterte should stop making public comments about the case of her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, before the International Criminal Court and leave it to their lawyers instead, a lawyer accredited by the court said on Sunday. The younger Duterte over the weekend questioned the widely reported figure of 30,000 drug war deaths during her fathers administration, saying the prosecutions claims were far from the 181 pieces of evidence submitted to the ICC. This time, House lawmakers found names resembling groceries on the list of recipients of the Office of the Vice Presidents confidential funds . House Deputy Majority Leader Paolo Ortega V of La Union said on Sunday that the newly discovered names, dubbed Team Grocery, further raised allegations that large sums of public money were allegedly funneled to fictitious individuals. Authorities will file complaints of multiple frustrated homicide against the motorist who went on a shooting rampage during a melee in Antipolo City on Sunday, according to the city police chief Lt.

"Gabriela calls for urgent action as hunger hits more women, children","MANILA, Philippines The Gabriela Womens Party on Sunday called for urgent economic relief amid an alarming rise in hunger rates across the country, which disproportionately affects women and children in low-income households. Rep. Arlene Brosas made the call following the latest Social Weather Stations survey, which revealed that 27.2 percent of Filipino familiesaround 7.5 million individualsexperienced involuntary hunger in March. READ: Hunger among Filipinos hits new high in Q4 2024 SWS survey The shocking 27.2 percent hunger rate revealed by the latest SWS survey represents millions of Filipino families, particularly women and children, going to bed hungry. This is the direct result of the governments continued implementation of anti-poor economic policies in the midst of a worsening crisis, she said, as quoted in a press release. The lady lawmaker also pointed out that women bear the brunt of economic hardship, as they struggle to feed their families amid rising food prices and stagnant wages. Ang mga kababaihan ang unang nagtitiis kapag walang makain ang pamilya. Sila ang pumipila sa mumong pa-ayuda, sila ang nag-iisip kung paano paghahati-hatiin ang kakarampot na budget para sa pagkain ng buong pamilya, she lamented. She also emphasized the direct link between hunger and child malnutrition, adding that the Philippines still has one of the highest stunting rates in Southeast Asia. Hunger today means stunted future for our children. The rising hunger rate will inevitably worsen our already critical child malnutrition problem, with long-term consequences for the nations health and productivity, Brosas said. With that, the womens party urged the administration to promptly implement concrete measures to address the hunger crisis, such as scrapping the Value Added Tax on essential food items and raising the national minimum wage to P1,200. Kailangan ng mamamayan ng agarang kaluwagan, hindi ng mga pangakong walang katuparan. The government must scrap the VAT on basic food items now and legislate a P1,200 national minimum wage to help families cope with the skyrocketing prices, she said. The continuous rise in hunger rates from January to March shows that the so-called economic growth is just a half-baked promise. While the administration boasts of macroeconomic gains, Filipino families are being left to scrape the bottom of the barrel. This is the clearest indictment of the governments failed economic policies she concluded.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048274/gabriela-calls-for-urgent-action-as-hunger-hits-more-women-children,others

Explainer: How a quiet court case threatens small-scale fishers,"MANILA, PhilippinesA small courtroom decision in 2023, quietly affirmed on a technicality, could unravel decades of protection for the Philippines smallest fishers. At the heart of the issue: Who really controls municipal waters? And do small fishers still have the right to call them their own? On October 5, 2023, Mercidar Fishing Corporation, a commercial fishing company, filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief before the Malabon Regional Trial Court . A Petition for Declaratory Relief is a legal move where someone asks the court to clarify whether a law or regulation is valid even before its enforced against them. In this case, Mercidar wanted the court to declare certain fisheries laws as unconstitutional, meaning they believed these laws go against what the Philippine Constitution says. Mercidar challenged parts of the Philippine Fisheries Code and its implementing rules, specifically Department Administrative Order No. 10, series of 2015. According to lawyer Rose-Liza Eisma-Osorio, acting vice president of Oceana, the case focused on two main issues: Limit the users of municipal waters to municipal fisherfolk, and give LGUs jurisdiction over municipal waters and the authority to allow limited access to commercial fishers under specific conditions. In simpler terms, Mercidar questioned why the law allows only small-scale fishers to fish in waters up to 15 kilometers from the shore . They also challenged the power of local government units to control these waters and set the rules for who can fish there. On December 11, 2023, the Malabon RTC declared unconstitutional the following provisions: From the Fisheries Code: From DAO 10-2015: The RTC held that these provisions violated constitutional supremacy. In its ruling, the court emphasized that control over natural resources belongs to the national government not local governments. As summarized by Atty. Osorio, the decision stated: The Constitution provides that municipal water is a natural resource that is owned by the State, and the authority over such resources is vested and delegated by the Constitution to the concerned national government agency, not with the LGUs. It further held that the Fisheries Codes provision for preferential treatment did not expressly exclude commercial fishing operations. The Malabon RTCs decision went unchallenged at the lower court level not because the government agreed with it, but because the Office of the Solicitor General , which represents the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Department of Agriculture , failed to file a timely response. During a hearing on November 10, 2023, the OSG made an oral motion asking for more time to submit its answer. But instead of acting on it directly, the court proceeded without granting a clear extension. The OSG later filed a written Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer, but again, the court did not approve it. Kahit may rules tayo, under the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, kapag may mga ganitong kaso dapat yung korte [ang] magbibigay ng kaalaman sa lahat ng apektadong ahensya []. Hindi nila ginawa, said Atty. Osorio. With no official response from the government, the court issued an Order of Default on December 7, 2023, which allowed Mercidar Fishing Corporation, the petitioner, to present its evidence ex parte meaning without the participation of the other side. Mercidar also withdrew its request for a temporary restraining order , submitted affidavits and documents, and rested its case. The RTC granted Mercidars motion and declared the petition submitted for decision, without any input from the government. This move raised serious questions among legal experts and environmental advocates. As Atty. Osorio pointed out, under Section 2 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, motions to declare a defendant in default are not allowed. Despite this clear rule, the court proceeded with the default ruling a highly unusual and controversial step in a case with national implications. Sana kung binigyan ng pagkakataon mag file ng answer yung gobyerno, nandoon yung mga substantibong argumento na pwede nilang ipasok sa kaso, Atty. Osorio explained. That same day, the OSG filed an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration, asking the court to reverse the Order of Default and allow them to submit their response. An Omnibus Motion is a legal filing that asks for multiple forms of relief in one motion. In this case, the OSG was trying to cancel the default ruling and participate in the case. But on December 20, the RTC denied the motion, calling it moot and academica legal term meaning it was no longer relevant because the court had already ruledand lacking in merit, meaning the court didnt find the arguments convincing. After the Malabon RTC declared parts of the Fisheries Code and its implementing rules unconstitutional on December 11, 2023, the OSG attempted to reverse the decision. But the process got off to a late start. On January 2, 2024, the OSG filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 before the Supreme Court. This type of petition is a formal request asking the high court to examine the decision of a lower court , but only if theres a legal question involved such as whether the lower court misinterpreted the law or went beyond its authority. But on August 19, 2024, the Supreme Courts First Division dismissed the petition not because it disagreed with the arguments, but because it was filed too late. The Court said the deadline to appeal had passed, and that the RTC ruling had already become final and executory. In legal terms, final and executory means that a courts decision is closed, settled, and can no longer be changed or appealedunless a very narrow exception applies, such as correcting a clerical mistake or invalidating a clearly void judgment. As Atty. Osorio explained during the Atin ang Kinse: A Convergence Summit for the Protection of Municipal Waters held on March 20: The Supreme Court reiterated the long-standing rule that when a judgment becomes final and executory, it becomes immutable, unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, except to correct clerical errors or to make nunc pro tunc entries or when it is a void judgment. The Supreme Court also pointed out that BFAR and DA, through the OSG, failed to prove that the RTC had made a reversible error a serious legal mistake that would justify canceling the original decision. However, Oceana and other petitioners are questioning the Supreme Courts timeline. According to Atty. Osorio, the Court considered December 11, 2023 as the date the RTC decision became final and started counting the 15-day appeal period from there. However, the government had filed an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration, which the RTC only denied on December 20. Sabi nila out of time na yung appeal na finile ng DA [at] BFAR [through] OSG noong December 11, 2023 [] Pero maalala natin, nag-file ng Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration pero sinasabi nila out of time na eh kasi December 11 [] Pero if you go back to the timeline, noong December 20 may decision sila [], said Atty. Osorio. She explained that if the court had used December 20 as the starting point, the OSGs January 2 filing would have been within the 15-day limit for appeals. Instead, the Court followed the December 11 date even though the motion for reconsideration was still pending at the time. So dapat ang counting nila na finile noong January 2, within the timeline, which is 15 days. Pero pag kinount mo from December 11, parang out of time kasi 20 days na yun So yun yung isa sa mga katanungan, she added. In simpler terms, Osorio argues that if the RTC decision wasnt yet final until December 20, then the OSGs January 2 appeal should have been considered on time. Because the Court chose to stick with the December 11 timeline, the petition was rejected, and the ruling that struck down key legal protections for municipal waters remains final and binding unless the Supreme Court later agrees to reopen the case. The full impact of the court ruling has yet to be felt and could still shift, depending on how the Supreme Court rules on the pending motions and interventions filed by government agencies, coastal communities, and advocacy groups. For now, the decision by the Malabon RTC stands. With key provisions of the Fisheries Code and its implementing rules struck down, local governments have lost their legal footing to regulate municipal watersthose stretching up to 15 kilometers from shore. These powers once allowed LGUs to issue permits, limit access to commercial fishing boats, and enforce local ordinances meant to protect coastal ecosystems and support small fishers. Also gone is the legal basis for giving municipal fisherfolk first rights to these waters. That opens the door for commercial fishing operations to enter the 10.1 to 15 kilometer zone an area previously subject to restrictions and LGU oversight. Whether or not that will happen widely remains to be seen, but the uncertainty alone has left many small-scale fishers anxious. Hindi ako sang-ayon, kasi kawawa talaga ang ating maliliit na mangingisda lalo na kung papayagan ang mga commercial fishing vessel na pumasok. Gumagamit sila ng mga gear na talagang nakakasira sa ating pangisdaan. Mas lalong mahihirapan ang maliliit na mangingisda, said Tomas Limboc Jr., barangay captain at Barangay Papaya in Nasugbu, Batangas. Sa pinatutupad na [desisyon] ng Supreme Court sa commercial fishing, tutol ako kasi kapag nakapasok yan dito sa pangisdaan namin, sigurado ang maapektuhan ang maliliit na mangingisda. Pag pumasok iyan sa ating area, wala nang isda pa na madadatnan [yung mga maliliit na mangingisda], he added. The fear is that increased competition in nearshore waters will push already vulnerable fishing communities further to the margins. Some groups say its not just a legal issue its a question of survival. Para sa aming maliliit na mangingisda, napakalaki talaga ng epekto nito. Ngayon pa lang, ramdam na namin ang mga panahong wala kaming nahuhuli. May mga gamit silang [modernong] gear, samantalang kami mano-mano lang. Alam pa nila kung saan maraming isda, said Mang Jin, a fisherfolk. Inaagawan nila yung mga tulad naming mahihirap na mangingisda, maliit na nga ang kita, kukunin pa nila [ang mga isda], he added. At the national level, the concern comes as fish production continues to slide. Data from the BFAR show that fish harvests in the third quarter of 2023 were the lowest in a decade, raising questions about sustainability and long-term food security. Yes and this question lies at the heart of the petitions now being filed by fisherfolk, local governments, and environmental advocates. According to Atty. Osorio, both the Constitution and the Local Government Code uphold the rights of small fishers and empower local government units to protect marine resources and manage their municipal waters. Several constitutional provisions support this: In addition, Osorio points to the General Welfare Clause in the Local Government Code, which gives LGUs specific powers related to coastal governance: Under the General Welfare Clause, all local government units are granted the power to exercise express and implied powers, including inherent powers: On January 2, 2025, the OSG filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the Supreme Court, asking it to revisit and reverse its August 2024 decision, which had allowed the lower courts ruling to stand. A Motion for Reconsideration is a formal request asking the Court to take a second look at its decision, usually when new arguments or overlooked facts are presented. That same day, several groups also asked to formally join the case through whats called a Petition-in-Intervention. These were filed by Oceana, a municipality fisherfolk, and concerned citizens. A Petition-in-Intervention allows someone who wasnt originally part of a case to step in if they can show that the outcome directly affects them or that public interest is at stake. These petitioners argue that: As Atty. Osorio emphasized in her presentation: The Supreme Court has, in several instances, allowed petitions-in-intervention even after the trial court has rendered judgment to, inter alia, protect public interest, to facilitate the administration of justice. In simpler terms, its not too late for the Court to reopen the case if it believes doing so is necessary to serve justice and protect the rights of those most affected. What began as a single petition by a commercial fishing firm has now exposed deep cracks in the countrys environmental governance and access to justice for the marginalized. With municipal fishers left out of the courtroom, the burden now falls on the Supreme Court to determine whether a ruling made without them can stand. This case has become a test of how far the country is willing to go to uphold the constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology and to deliver on the promise of social justice for small fishing communities.

Rep. Bongalon: Surge of fake news undermines report of declining crimes,"MANILA, Philippines The decline in recorded crimes across the country is being undermined by a surge of fake news, spreading unwarranted fear, according to House Assistant Majority Leader Jil Bongalon of the Ako Bicol Party-list. In a press release on Sunday, Bongalon expressed concerns that the rampant spread of misleading information online is overshadowing the governments achievements in combating crime. Lets be clear: crime is going down. The data is there, he said, pointing out Philippine National Police data showing a 26.76 percent drop in focus crimesfrom 4,817 cases between January 1 and February 14, 2024, to 3,528 in the same period this year. READ: Palace backs NBI bid to combat fake news with Interpol help Focus crimes refer to incidents of carnapping of motorcycles and motor vehicles, homicide, murder, physical injury, rape, robbery, and theft. The PNP also reported that rape cases saw the steepest drop, decreasing by 50.6 percentfrom 1,261 cases between January 1 and February 14 last year to 623 cases during the same period in 2025. Ang daming nagbabahagi ng videos o kwento na walang buong konteksto. Nangyayari sa ibang bansa, ipapakalat na parang dito nangyari. Ito ang nagpapalaki sa takot ng mga tao, kahit hindi naman ito tugma sa totoong sitwasyon, Bongalon, a member of the House Young Guns bloc, also said. Bongalon said his sentiments echoed those of Police Chief Gen. Rommel Francisco Marbil, who urged media practitioners and online users to report crime with fairness and context. He also pointed out that fake news threatens not only public trust but also the morale of the police. Fake news is a crime in itselfit steals peace of mind and sows unnecessary fear, the House leader said. Ang epekto nito ay hindi lang takot kundi pagkawalang-tiwala sa mga institusyong araw-araw na nagtatrabaho para sa ating seguridad, he added. To further combat fake news, Bongalon urged stronger media literacy programs, especially for the youth. He also called on media practitioners to report news with context, accuracy, and balancenot just resort to sensationalism. Kapag mahina ang media literacy, mas madaling kumalat ang maling balita. We need to empower our citizens to verify first and share later, Bongalon said. As Gen. Marbil rightly pointed out, public safety is not just about statisticsits about how people feel. At kung gusto nating mapanatili ang tiwala at kapayapaan, kailangang sabay tayong kumilos laban sa takot at kasinungalingan, Bongalon said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048290/rep-bongalon-surge-of-fake-news-undermines-report-of-declining-crimes,others

Artes to punish MMDA officer who shamed cop as Ejercito hits incident,"MANILA, Philippines Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Don Artes will take disciplinary action against MMDA Special Operations Group Task Force head Gabriel Go. Artes decision was disclosed by Senator JV Ejercito on Monday in a Facebook post as he thanked Artes for his commitment to taking the initiative against Go. We need to discipline our officers and make sure they do not go overboard next time, the senator said. Artes confirmed his next move to Ejercito on Tuesday, saying that the MMDA is acknowledging the recent incident involving Go. The MMDA chairman said he is addressing the matter seriously and with full accountability. Mr. Gabriel Go is a good man and a dedicated MMDA enforcer. If he committed a mistake, we will accord him due process and penalize him as justified, Artes said in a statement. In an earlier post, Ejercito shared a Facebook video in which the MMDA ticketed a Quezon City cop for parking on a sidewalk. He then criticized Gos behavior towards the police officer, which he described as overbearing and disrespectful. Tinekitan naman na ang pulis, tama yon. No one is above the law. Pero ipahiya pa? Ano ito, for the views? Dapat nag Vlogger ka na lang, Boi! Ejercito expressed his disgust. READ: Napolcom after MMDA tickets cop on video: Dont shame cops for clicks National Police Commission Commissioner Ralph Calinisan, in a statement last Friday, also questioned Gos action. He said, Mutual respect between the MMDA and the PNP [Philippine National Police] would be most appreciated. Calinisan said police officers should not be shamed just for the clicks and views. Artes also said the MMDA has reached out to the top officials of the PNP headquarters, Quezon City Police District, and Napolcom. He said they agreed that this isolated incident will not, in any way, tarnish our good relationship and that we shall maintain coordination, mutual respect and cooperation between our organizations. Artes added that a proper apology must be issued to the shamed police officer for the harm the incident caused him and his family. Meanwhile, Ejercito also revealed that a former MMDA lady traffic enforcer previously filed a sexual harassment case against Go. In a complaint shared by Ejercito on Facebook on Monday, the former traffic enforcer revealed that Go had continued his sexual advances on her despite her refusal. READ: Tensions soar between MMDA, Manibela members in San Juan protest rally The female enforcer also said she was relieved from her post due to the sexual harassment charge.

Napakalakas naman ata ni Gabriel Go sa inyo, Chairman Artes, at pinalamig lang ang isyu ng sexual harassment para kunin muli siya sa MMDA? Ejercito wondered.

"1,000 Muslim community members in Bohol celebrate Eidl Fitr","TAGBILARAN CITY At least 1,000 members of the Muslim community celebrated Eidl Fitr on Monday at the President Carlos P. Garcia Sports Complex in this city. Wearing their best robes and dresses, Muslim men and women living in Tagbilaran City, Panglao, Dauis, and Tubigon gathered at the sports complex to celebrate the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of sacrifice. Taha Malabi, president of the Bohol Muslim Community Peace Movement, said Eidl Fitr is one of the most important occasions in Islam. The celebration started at 7 a.m. with a traditional Salat al-Eid or special prayers recited during the Eid holidays. Since Eid Al-Fitr is a day of joy and thanksgiving, Muslims were obliged to keep the lessons of Ramadan close to heart by performing their duty and making sacrifices for a noble objective. After the Salat al-Eid, meal packs were served to the attendees. Celebrations were also held in Batuan, Jagna, and Catigbian towns. Shahari, 31, said he found peace and contentment while celebrating Ramadan. I pray for peace because Allah is peace, he said. About 80 percent of the Muslims who came to Bohol many generations ago are Maranaos, while the rest are a mixture of Tausugs, Maguindanaos, and other tribes. They have all been into trading which placed them in peaceful coexistence with Boholanos, who are about 85 percent Christians. Already reaching over 6,000, the Muslims in Bohol have started putting up a census at the Office of Muslim Affairs, which is attached to the office of Gov. Erico Aristotle Aumentado.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048530/1000-muslim-community-members-in-bohol-celebrate-eidl-fitr,others
"5 ex-village chiefs file graft case vs Tarlac mayor, LGU execs","MABALACAT CITY, Pampanga Five former village chiefs have filed administrative and criminal charges for grave misconduct and graft against the mayor of Concepcion, Tarlac, and four other municipal officials over alleged irregular bidding and the awarding of contracts for furniture, air conditioners, and projects worth P81.8 million. In a complaint-affidavit filed at the Office of the Ombudsman on March 21, the complainants accused Mayor Noel Villanueva, municipal assessor Michael Bondoc, municipal accountant Reggie Bondoc, and municipal planning and development staff Brian Julius Lacsamana of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of public service, violation of the Government Procurement Reform Act, and graft and corruption. Villanueva is head of the municipal governments procuring entity, while the three other officials are members of the Bids and Awards Committee. READ: Suspended Marikina mayor says graft raps political persecution Complainants Edmond Alfonso, Mario Ysais, Nicolas Galang, Alejandro Valencia, and Eduardo Salas alleged in their affidavit that the bidding for the supply of tables, chairs, and air conditioning units for local government offices, as well as the landscaping of the new municipal government center and the landscaping, gate, and fencing of the shelter and reformation center Bale Lugud , was conducted without proper approval from the municipal council. They said the municipal council passed an ordinance on Feb. 12 this year appropriating a P81,840,650 supplemental budget to fund the purchase of the furniture and air conditioning units, as well as the landscaping, gate, and fencing projects. The complainants noted that the ordinance was signed by Villanueva on Feb. 20 and submitted to the provincial board for review on Feb. 21. The board, however, did not act on the ordinance. According to the complainants, the ordinance would become final and executory only after 30 days of inaction by the provincial board under the Local Government Code. Since the board received the ordinance on Feb. 21, it should have become valid only on March 31. The complainants argued that without waiting for the approval of the provincial board or the lapse of the 30-day reglementary period until March 31, the respondents immediately scheduled the pre-procurement conference on Feb. 21, the pre-bid conference on March 6, the opening of bids and bid evaluation on March 20, and the post qualification on March 21 for those projects, which are funded through the subject municipal ordinance. They alleged that as early as Feb. 25, several units of tables, chairs, and air conditioners had already been delivered to the Concepcion municipal government center; that the landscaping for the same building was completed on March 13; and that the fencing and gate installation of Bale Lugud was completed on March 19. The former village chiefs said the delivery of the furniture and air conditioners and the completion of the projects occurred before March 31, before the ordinance became final and executory. In a text message to the Inquirer on Thursday, Villanueva said he has yet to receive a copy of the complaints filed against him and the three other municipal officials. For now, Im waiting for a copy of the complaint and hope and pray that I will be given the opportunity to present my side and rebut the charges against me, the mayor said. Obviously, the alleged case is politically motivated. My conscience is clear. I did my best to complete the project as I had promised my townmatesthat the Concepcion Municipal Government Center would be blessed and inaugurated this March, Villanueva added. Villanueva is running for re-election under the Nationalist Peoples Coalition. His lone opponent is former three-term Mayor Andy Lacson of the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048871/5-ex-village-chiefs-file-graft-case-vs-tarlac-mayor-lgu-execs,others

Another petition to enact Anti-Political Dynasty law filed,"MANILA, Philippines In a 48-page petition filed Monday, 1Sambayan Coalition and several other cause-oriented groups and individuals sought the Supreme Courts help, stating: With all due respect, the Honorable Court should not tolerate the Congress continuing violation of the 1987 Constitution for almost four decades. Beyond doubt, Congress official inaction has rendered useless and effectively repealed Article II, Section 26 of the 1987 Constitution, petitioners said. The petitioners pointed out that Article II, Section 26 of the 1987 Constitution explicitly mandates the State to prohibit political dynasties. The provision states, The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law. If the petition is granted, they asked the SC to hold Congress in contempt should they fail to comply within one year if the petition is granted. Congress failure to enact an enabling law, since the Constitutions ratification in 1987 up to date, has not only rendered Article II, Section 26 of the Constitution inutile but also allowed political dynasties to concentrate power within a few families, undermined the democratic process, and ultimately exacerbated poverty and inequality among our people, it added. Petitioners said over 30 anti-political dynasty bills have been filed in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but none have come close to being passed into law. After nearly four decades and twelve different Congresses, it is also abundantly clear that the political dynasties [that] now dominate the Philippine Congress, left to their own devices, will never obey the Filipino people and the 1987 Constitutions mandate to pass an anti-dynasty law; of course, doing so would require them to act against their very own selfish interests, the petitioners pointed out. The individuals who hold the authority to enact this law are the same ones who undoubtedly would continue to benefit from its non-passage, they added. The petitioners pleaded to the Court to revisit and abandon their previous decisions rendered more than 10 years ago in the cases of Biraogo vs. Commission on Elections and Guingona vs. House of Congress and Senate of the Philippines. In the case of businessman Louis Barok Biraogo, the Court denied with finality his petition seeking to compel the Commission on Commission on Elections to ban members of political dynasties from running in the May elections. The SC said the constitutional provision against political dynasties must have an enabling law passed by Congress. Meanwhile, in the case of former Senator Teofisto Guingona, the SC said it cannot compel Congress to pass such a law because doing so would violate the principle of separation of powers. Since the time of the promulgation of these decisions, the political dynasties have continued to further proliferate, with their members entrenching themselves in power, escalating negatively through the years, the gross inequality in access to opportunities and public service, and the resulting exacerbating effect on poverty, the petitioners said. This has not only undermined democratic principles but also exacerbated social inequalities. Mounting evidence now shows a direct correlation between the dominance of political dynasties and the persistence of poverty in various regions, they added. Citing a 2022 study using data gathered from 2006 to 2018, based on business-government linkages collected from experts assessing the situation across three presidential termsGloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Benigno Aquino III, and Rodrigo Duterteshowed that political dynasties are prevalent, with 80 percent in Congress and 50 percent in local government.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048734/another-petition-to-enact-anti-political-dynasty-law-filed,others

A womans resolve: Lt. Col. Jannette Chavez-Arceo fights for the reserve force,"Lt. Col. Jannette Chavez-Arceo has long led as a woman breaking barriers, both as a social entrepreneur and an educator building resilience, commanding her battalion through volcanic ash, the deadly coronavirus, and devastating typhoons to save lives. Now, as the third nominee of the Laang Kawal partylist, she champions the rights of reservists and retirees whose service she has honored throughout her career. A graduate of the University of the Philippines, Chavez-Arceo earned a degree in Communications in the 1990s, sharpening her skills in clarity and connection during the nations post-EDSA revolt recovery. More than an academic pursuit, it was a deliberate step toward leadership. She later earned two masters degrees: one in National Security Administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines in 2016, and another in Public Management, specializing in Development and Security, from the Development Academy of the Philippines in 2019. These were not just academic milestones but tools to confront real-world challengesgovernance reform, national defense, and socio-economic development. Her education reflected a deeper commitment to understanding and strengthening the systems she would serve. That commitment found its clearest expression in her military service. In 2019, after completing the rigorous Command and General Staff Course, Chavez-Arceo became the first woman to command the 403rd Ready Reserve Infantry Battalion in Laguna. This unit, under the Philippine Army Reserve Command, supports regional stability in Southern Luzon. Her role was earned through merit in a field still dominated by men, and her leadership was defined by action, not ceremony. In January 2020, when Taal Volcano erupted and displaced over 300,000 people across Batangas and Laguna, Chavez-Arceo led her battalion into the field. They joined convoys to deliver rice, water, and masks to cut-off communities and manned evacuation centers. Months later, Super Typhoon Rolly 2020s most powerful stormstruck on November 1, followed by Typhoon Ulysses just eleven days later. Together, they claimed over 100 lives and flooded entire towns. Her unit responded swiftly, clearing debris and distributing aid in hard-hit areas like San Pablo City. When the COVID-19 pandemic brought the country to a standstill, Chavez-Arceo again mobilized her team. They helped enforce quarantine protocols, supported overwhelmed local governments, and ensured that food reached families. She even helped get hundreds of stranded UP Los Baos students go home to their families. A barangay captain from Los Baos described her as a calm force, always present when we needed her most. Even off the battlefield, her fight is undiminishedthis time, in the realm of justice. At the Department of Justice, Chavez-Arceo tackled one of the Philippines most persistent scourges: human trafficking. From 2011 to 2015, she served as a key member of the ASEAN Experts Working Group of the Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime, helping draft the ASEAN Convention Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, signed in 2015 and ratified in 2017. This landmark agreement established a regional framework to combat trafficking networks exploiting an estimated 100,000 victims annually across Southeast Asia. Her work focused on strengthening law enforcement coordination and victim support programs, including safe houses that have since sheltered hundreds of survivors. In 2013, she helped drive the Philippines entry into the Global Alliance to End Child Sexual Exploitation Online and the Asia Pacific Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography, targeting financial networks behind online abuse. Her efforts contributed to the Philippines Tier 1 ranking in the U.S. Trafficking in Persons Report in 2016 when the country was almost given blacklist level rating, thus marking the country as a global leader in anti-trafficking reforms. Her work in countering transnational crimes and security threats earned her the recognition of being one of ASEANS Top 10 Women in Security in 2022, an award announced at a Kuala Lumpur Cybersecurity Summit. She accepted it with humility, saying the real measure of success lies in the lives protected, not the honors received. Her resolve is not confined in her professionit is also deeply personal. A wife and mother, Chavez-Arceo has balanced family with public service, a dual role that drives her advocacy for womens and childrens rights. She has been a proponent of peace education since the early 2000s, and in 2019 launched a pilot program in Laguna schools and in Sulu province to teach students about online safety and countering online youth radicalizationan urgent response to extremist messaging spreading via social media. By 2023, the initiative had reached thousands nationwide, training teachers, parents, and youth alike through Impact Solutions Institute a social enterprise she founded in partnership with various stakeholders. Her work reflects a mothers instinct to protect, extended to a national scale. Her determination is to ensure her children, and all children, inherit a safer world. Now, as the third nominee for the Laang Kawal partylist in the 2025 elections, Chavez-Arceo is poised to elevate the reserve force she has long exemplified. Founded to represent reservists interests, the partylist seeks legislative support for the countrys 1.9 million-strong reserve community and other force multiplier civilian volunteer groups. Her platform includes calls for increased funding, adequate equipment, and legislative reformsincluding standardized health and accident insurance for reservists during training and legislating the Patriotic Leave. At a 2023 assembly, she pointed to the 403rds Taal response as proof of their role and value to their regular active personnel counterparts, declaring, Were not just a backup; were a backbone. Her nomination builds on decades of service, aligning with a lifelong mission to strengthen those who serve alongside her. Lt. Col. Jannette Chavez-Arceos story is one of steady, purposeful impactmarked by a quiet strength that speaks through deeds, not declarations. From her formative years at UP to her command during crises, from justice reform to family-driven advocacy, she has lived with intention. Her legacy lies not in the accolades she has earned, though they are many, but in the communities she has steadied, the policies she has shaped, and the lives she has touched. She moves forward with clarity and determination, proving that true service is not about being heard, but about being feltleaving a nation stronger, one resolute step at a time.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048639/a-womans-resolve-lt-col-jannette-chavez-arceo-fights-for-the-reserve-force,others

Romualdez calls for stronger monitoring of produce prices,"MANILA, Philippines A stronger monitoring of produce prices is needed as some traders were reported to be selling above the real market data from the Department of Agriculture , Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez said on Tuesday. He said this after some industry stakeholders raised concerns about food products such as large chicken eggs being sold at P9 to P12 per piece, when the DAs Bantay Presyo data pegs the price at P8 to P9 per piece. According to the House leader, a difference of a peso or two would go a long way. May price monitoring mechanisms ang ating mga ahensiya pero dapat siguruhin nating nakikita sa pamilihan ang nakasaad na presyo sa monitoring na ito. Sa ngayon kasi, mukhang hindi akma ang estimate sa price monitoring sa tunay na presyo sa mga pamilihan, Romualdez said in a statement. Nakikita natin na sa wet markets, ang ganitong mga itlog ay nabibili sa P9P11, at sa ilang supermarket, umaabot pa sa P12, he explained. Bakit may diperensya sa presyo, kahit piso lang? Romualdez said that he understands that DA is doing everything it can to monitor prices, but there might be a need to put extra mechanisms in place to ensure that consumers rights are protected. Every peso is important. We have to correct this so that we can rectify prices at the markets, he added. A press release from the DA, posted by the Philippine Information Agency on Tuesday, showed that the department, according to Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel, is closely monitoring egg prices to ensure they do not rise to unreasonable levels. According to Laurel, there are suggestions to implement a maximum suggested retail price on eggs, but as with goods like rice and pork, they would have to consult stakeholders first so as not to shock the industry. The DA revealed during a Jan. 15 hearing of the House Quinta committee, which probed the rising prices of basic goods, that the department intended to place a P58 per kilogram MSRP on premium grains. According to the DA, it intends to create a ripple effect, wherein the prices of well-milled rice and regular-milled rice do not differ much. This would, therefore, force sellers to lower the prices of cheaper variants. READ: DA aims lower rice prices by setting maximum SRP for premium grains On Monday, DA set the MSRP of imported rice at P45 per kilogram. Lawmakers, however, have raised concerns about the MSRP. ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro said that the DA is placing a cap that is higher than the price of rice sold at the market during that time. Iloilo 1st District Rep. Janette Garin called out the DA for seemingly pulling out the P58 per kilogram MSRP out of thin air. READ: DA sets MSRP of imported rice at P45 starting March 31 Synchronized approach Romualdez also noted that the DA and the Department of Trade and Industry have their own monitoring systems, which could be strengthened if both agencies synchronize their activities. May monitoring ang DA. May monitoring ang DTI. Dapat nagkakaisa ang mga ahensya para makuha natin ang tunay na larawan ng presyo sa pamilihan. Ito ang magiging susi para sa isang maayos at matatag na ekonomiya, he said. Alam natin na hindi lang itlog ang apektado. Ang presyo ng karne at poultry ay patuloy na tumataas dahil sa mga isyung tulad ng African swine fever, kakulangan sa storage facilities, at init ng summer. Hindi ito maaaring balewalain, he added. In February, the DA said there may be an egg supply shortage from April to May as many local producers suffered losses due to oversupply and lower prices in 2024. According to Romualdez, these issues must be addressed before the Holy Week, which is set from April 13 to April 20 this year. Hindi natin puwedeng palipasin pa ang Mahal na Araw bago natin solusyunan ang mga problemang ito. Kailangan agad nating gumawa ng hakbang para sa ating mga mamamayan, he said. Tayoy magtutulungan upang matiyak na abot-kaya ang bilihin ng bawat sambayanan, he declared. Hindi ito laban ng iisang ahensya o grupoito ay laban nating lahat para sa mas maliwanag na kinabukasan.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049006/fwd-stronger-price-monitor-needed-as-some-sell-eggs-above-da-data-romualdez,others

Sandiganbayan denies Estradas demurrer to evidence in pork barrel case,"MANILA, Philippines The Sandiganbayan has denied the demurrer to evidence filed by Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada, seeking to dismiss the graft charges lodged against him in connection with the pork barrel scam. According to Section 23 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, a demurrer to evidence is the power of the court to dismiss the case due to lack of sufficient evidence from the prosecution after they rest their case. In a resolution dated March 26 this year, the anti-graft courts Special Firth Division denied Estradas demurrer to evidence and motion to dismiss and supplement to demurrer to evidence, which he filed on February 22, 2024, and September 19, 2024, respectively. It also denied the demurrer to evidence filed by former Technology Resource Center Deputy Director-General Dennis Cunanan in February 2024. In his demurrer to evidence, Estrada alleged the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he violated Section 3 of Republic Act No. 3019 or that he conspired with the other accused to violate Section 3. Estrada likewise claimed that the complainant did not submit evidence of any communication and/or meeting between him, Janet Lim Napoles, and John Raymund De Asis, with respect to the subject SAROs , among others. The senator also said the daily disbursement reports of Benhur Luy the principal whistleblower in the pork barrel scam are unreliable as they are mere printouts and can nowadays be easily manufactured. However, the Sandiganbayan said it was not persuaded. On the other hand, the Sandiganbayan has granted the demurrer to evidence lodged by former Budget Undersecretary Mario Relampagos and three of his staff Marilou Dialino Bare, Rosario Salamida Nuez, and Lalaine Narag Paule dismissing the cases against them for insufficiency of evidence. The anti-graft court also lifted the hold departure orders issued against Relampagos, Bare, Nuez, and Paule. It also ordered the cancellation and return of cash bonds posted by Bare, Nuez, and Paule. However, the Sandiganbayan said Relampagos violated the conditions of his bonds he posted, totaling P247,500. These are forfeited in favor of the government, the court said. In November 2024, the anti-graft court upheld its decision to clear Estrada of one count of direct bribery and two counts of indirect bribery in connection with the pork barrel scam. On August 22, 2024, the Sandiganbayan reversed its decision convicting Estrada of one count of direct bribery and two counts of indirect bribery. To recall, Estrada and businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles were acquitted of plunder on January 19, 2024. The plunder case against them stemmed from transferring Estradas Priority Development Assistance Fund, or pork barrel, to alleged bogus non-government organizations owned by Napoles. Estrada was charged with plunder for allegedly receiving kickbacks worth P55.79 million from Napoles. The prosecution accused him of accumulating ill-gotten wealth after he allegedly gained P55.79 million from the scheme, aside from being an active participant in the conspiracy to commit plunder.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049736/sandiganbayan-denies-jinggoy-estradas-demurrer-to-evidence,others

During a forum organized by the Stratbase Institute in partnership with the Embassy of France in the Philippines, Environment Undersecretary Augusto Dela Pea said the DENR will set up an Ocean Environment Task Force by the second quarter of this year. READ: DENR eyes 8 new marine scientific stations Our goal is to drive organizational transformation within DENR for more effective ocean conservation. To achieve this vision, we have established the roadmap for the full organization of the Task Force in Q2 2025, Dela Pea was quoted by Stratbase as saying during the forum. According to Dela Pea, who also serves as OETF vice chair, the task force aims to enhance ocean governance, align national policies with international commitments, and incorporate scientific data into policy-making. Ultimately, he added, the DENR aims to institutionalize this task force as a permanent bureau. Meanwhile, other experts stressed during the forum the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach, involving policymakers, the private sector, communities, and international partners, particularly France, in the development of the countrys blue economy. French Ambassador to the Philippines Marie Fontanel, for her part, underscored the importance of the blue economy to the Philippines and France.

TUCP dares Marcos: Certify P200 minimum wage hike bill as urgent,"MANILA, Philippines Saying that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. must rise above political squabbles, the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines urged him to certify as urgent the bill granting a P200 minimum wage hike. TUCP one of the groups pushing for a legislated minimum wage hike said the dire conditions that have affected the labor force should prompt Marcos to certify as urgent the proposed P200 minimum wage hike. Elections are supposed to offer solutions on issues confronting marginalized sectors of our society, particularly poverty and ENDO work schemes that push workers to kapit sa patalim situation where they are left scraping the bottom of the barrel for subsistence survival, TUCP said in a statement. Hence, TUCP calls on President Ferdinand Bongbong R. Marcos, Jr., as the father of the nation, to rise above current political distractions and unfurl a Bagong Pilipinas policy of caring for its workers by certifying the P200 legislated wage hike as an urgent priority measure and ensure its swift passage into law before the closing of the 19th Congress, TUCP noted. Last January 30, the House committee on labor and employment approved a substitute bill that consolidates three wage hike proposals House Bill Nos. 514, 7568, and 7871. HB No. 7871 filed by TUCP party-list lawmaker and Deputy Speaker Raymond Mendoza asked for a P150 across-the-board wage hike for all workers in the private sector. The Makabayan bloc, on the other hand, filed HB No. 7568, which seeks a P750 wage increase. READ: House panel OKs substitute bill seeking P200 minimum wage hike When it was approved at the House plenary on second reading last February 3, most of the bill was retained except for a provision that would limit the P200 per day wage hike to minimum wage earners. READ: House OKs P200 minimum wage hike bill on 2nd reading The bill, however, was not approved on third reading as Congress adjourned its session last February 5. Under the current rules, bills approved on second reading can only be considered for third reading three days after the prior approval. According to TUCP, recent political tensions have resulted in a diverse landscape, but Filipino workers from either side still face a dire situation due to their low wages. Emotions fanned by social media are running high, but sadly, it has not been about the dire situation of Filipino workers and their families their desperation for a take-home pay that affords them three nutritious meals on the table, which addresses the increasing stunting of our children, and which can ensure that our future workforce will be competitive in the ASEAN, TUCP said. Has the political climate made our society too jaded to poverty and the daily sufferings of our people that all political players have diverted their attention to political wranglings? the group asked. TUCP who supported Marcos in the 2022 presidential race did not mention what the political squabble was all about. However, tensions between the Marcoses and the Dutertes appeared to have blown into a full-on feud, after the Duterte patriarch, former President Rodrigo Duterte, was taken into custody by the International Criminal Court . Duterte was arrested on March 11 upon his return from Hong Kong on the strength of an arrest warrant served by the International Criminal Police Organization . The arrest was related to the crimes against humanity charges against Duterte, for his role in his administrations drug war. Marcos, however, maintained that they did not cooperate with ICC and merely fulfilled the countrys obligations with Interpol.

Manila Water highlights benefits of summer desludging,"MANILA, Philippines As Manila Water announces its April desludging schedule for barangays in the East Zone of Metro Manila and Rizal, the water concessionaire emphasizes the advantages of having septic tanks siphoned during the hotter months. Servicing septic tanks during warmer weather enhances the efficiency of the siphoning process. The higher temperatures make sludge less viscous, facilitating easier pumping. Additionally, the improved conditions allow for better mobility for both customers and desludging personnel during the activities. Desludging also helps prevent overflows, which are more likely as water usage increases during the summer. This April, Manila Waters desludging trucks and services will be deployed in the following barangays: Santolan and Rosario in Pasig City; Tanyag and North Daang Hari in Taguig City; Burgos, San Isidro, San Jose, and San Rafael in Marikina City; Pasong Tamo and Alicia in Quezon City; Barangays 892 and 893 in the City of Manila; La Paz and Sta. Cruz in Makati City; Mayamot and San Jose in Antipolo City; Sto. Nino and San Pedro in Angono; and Balite in Montalban . We invite our customers to take advantage of this service at no extra cost. By doing so, we contribute to community health and safeguard our waterways, said Dittie Galang, Manila Water corporate communications department head. Manila Water ensures that sludge from homes undergoes meticulous processing at its septage treatment plants before being released into waterways. To expand its reach in desludging services, Manila Water has deployed two pilot portable desludgers. These agile desludgers can service homes on narrow streets where conventional desludging trucks cannot access. Recently, Manila Waters innovative portable desludger earned a patent from the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines. With this new equipment, the company enhances its sanitation efforts, particularly in hard-to-reach barangays, ensuring cleaner and healthier communities.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049031/manila-water-highlights-benefits-of-summer-desludging,others

PAF lifts grounding of FA-50 jets; crash probe on final stage,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine Air Force has lifted the grounding of the 11 remaining FA-50 fighter jets less than a month after the crash of one of its aircraft in Bukidnon province that killed two pilots. Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo, PAF spokesperson, told the Inquirer on Tuesday that the FA-50 fleet has been on full operational status since March 25.

Netizens angered over MMDA clearing ops involving old man,"MANILA, Philippines Netizens have expressed their anger and frustration over one of the clearing operations of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority involving an old man. Senator JV Ejercito on Tuesday shared a Facebook video with a caption: A touch of humanity and consideration in public service and enforcement will be understood and appreciated. In the video, MMDA Special Operations Group Task Force head Gabriel Go was seen explaining to an old man why his vehicle was issued a ticket and got towed. READ: MMDA issues show cause order to its exec who shamed cop Ang sasakyan kapag nakaillegal park, katulad po ng nangyaring yan, nakaharang, walang madaanan mga tao Iniwan yung sasakyan, nakapark, ang problema, naharangan ng bangketa, naharangan yung gutter ng kalsada, which is bawal po yon, Go said. Go added that the vehicle malfunctioned, causing it to be stalled on the sideways. While no commotion was formed between the two, the old man expressed defeat and asked for understanding. Ako po ay nagkasala pero ang akin lang po, kaunting konswelo dahil sa edad kong ito, hindi ko maitulak, the elderly expressed. Go then said while he understood the situation of the man, such an incident should not be ignored as it would be unfair to others. He added that the elderly should have asked for help from enforcers when he saw the clearing operations from the other side of the street. Many netizens in the comment section of the video pointed out the unfairness of the situation for the elderly. Yes, law applies to all and ignorance of the law excuses no one. But we should understand that we dont have the same privilege. Imagine magkano magtubos kung pambili ng pang araw araw na food wala . Not to be selective but maybe empathy, consideration, help from these authorities malaking help sa community . You cannot earn respect for being harsh and being so bully, another netizen wrote. Another comment said that while they agree that law violators must be punished, this one clearly needed help and our government se[r]vant failed to do so. Meanwhile, some said that no one is above the law, adding that it can be abused by many people. Touch of humanity and consideration Paano po yung iba na gagamitin lang ito para makalusot sa parusa?

House prosecution in VP Duterte impeachment tapped trial lawyers solon,"MANILA, Philippines Despite a continued refusal to name names, Iloilo 3rd District Rep. Lorenz Defensor has divulged that some of the private lawyers tapped by the House prosecution for Vice President Sara Dutertes impeachment trial have prior experience with similar proceedings. In an online interview on Wednesday, Defensor said the lawyers who have helped him and the rest of the House prosecution team are practicing lawyers who have experience in previous impeachments. They are practicing lawyers and litigators whove had experience in previous impeachments. Thats as far as I can go. So at least they have experience in impeachment trial, said Defensor, one of the lawmakers tapped to form part of the prosecution team. Some of them are returning to help and volunteer, he added. So far in the countrys history, there have been several successful impeachments of high-ranking officials, but there were only two cases that have made it to a Senate trial that of former President Joseph Estrada and the late Chief Justice Renato Corona. Estrada was accused of bribery, graft, and corruption in the impeachment complaint, while Corona was convicted for not disclosing his wealth in his Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth. Until now, both the House leadership and the prosecution team have been tight-lipped regarding the set of private lawyers helping build the case against Duterte. Last March 19, House Secretary General Reginald Velasco disputed reports that DivinaLaw, one of the more prominent law firms in the country, was tapped by the prosecution team to help them. READ: DivinaLaw not part of House prosecution team in VP trial Velasco Velasco clarified this after news reports came out that he supposedly confirmed the law firms engagement during an interview while visiting the Senate for an ocular inspection. The House official did not mention the news report, but the Philippine Daily Inquirer ran a story stating that Velasco and their sources indicated that DivinaLaw would be leading the group of private prosecutors. READ: Lawyers helping House impeach team experienced, angry According to Defensor, he respects the decision of the prosecution panel, but he does not understand why the identities of the volunteer lawyers have to be withheld. Furthermore, the lawmaker said it would be the lead prosecutor, House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan, who would reveal the names of the private prosecutors. For me, its okay for them to come out in the open so that the private sector, which includes the private prosecution team, can also have a voice in this impeachment process. Especially with the media, right? So you would also get a sense of how they feel as a private citizen, Defensor said. Ill leave it to the lead prosecutor when he decides on that. We have communications between the different teams, articles, but with respect to when the private prosecutors can come out openly, Ill leave that to the lead prosecutor, he added. Last February 5, Duterte was impeached by the House after 215 lawmakers filed and verified the fourth impeachment complaint hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a vice president. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. Under the Constitution, the Senate will act as an impeachment court, with sitting senators as judges. READ: House impeaches VP SaraDuterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the petition was not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5. It means Congress would have to reconvene first after the election or through a special session to discuss the matter. Defensor previously said that they hope the impeachment trial would start immediately as the Constitution states, but he also said that they would respect the Senates decision regarding the timeline of the proceedings. With the long wait for the trial, the prosecutors conceded that they would just use the available time to prepare and educate the public as to why Duterte was impeached.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049340/house-prosecution-in-vp-duterte-impeachment-tapped-trial-lawyers-solon,others
Romualdez calls out fake news on crime: PNP data tells otherwise,"MANILA, Philippines House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez has urged the public to be vigilant against fake news about heightened crime rates across the country, saying that data from the Philippine National Police show a different story. In a statement on Wednesday, Romualdezsaid that it is fake news and not crime that fuels fear, and Filipinos should stop spreading panic. Let us not be a spokesperson of lies. While real crime is going down, fabricated stories and scripted videos are spreading like wildfire online, he said. Fear is being peddled for clicks and views. Thats not just irresponsibleits dangerous, he added. On social media, netizens have shared posts from pages showing crimes allegedly perpetrated or implied to have happened in the Philippines. However, some netizens have questioned if the incidents really occurred in the country, including one video shared on Instagram where it seems like a right-hand drive car was used by suspects attempting to rob a house. The Philippines uses left-hand drive vehicles. According to Romualdez, PNP data showed that crime rates including for focus crimes of theft, robbery, rape, murder, homicide, physical injury, and carnapping have gone down. PNP said crime rates nationwide have dropped by 18.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the last quarter of 2024. Focus crimes, meanwhile, decreased by 26.7 percent from January 1 to February 14 in 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. READ: Nationwide crime rate drops by 26% from Jan 1 to Feb 14, says PNP These are not just numbers. Every crime prevented is a life protected, a family spared. But these real gains are being drowned out by false narratives designed to stoke fear and mistrust, Romualdez said. When people stage crimes just to go viral, theyre not just misleading the publictheyre mocking real victims and sabotaging police work, he added. Its an insult to every Filipino who wants genuine peace and order. On Tuesday, Romualdez said the quick arrest of a motorist who shot a motorcycle rider in Antipolo City shows how far the PNP has improved in terms of response time. Last Sunday, netizens caught on camera at least two motorcycle riders mauling a driver of a black sports utility vehicle along the westbound lane of the Marikina-Infanta Highway in Barangay San Jose, Antipolo City. After being ganged up, the driver of the black SUV, identified as a certain Kenneth, drew a pistol and fired upon the two riders while accidentally hitting his wife.The suspect was subsequently arrested by police officers at a checkpoint. READ: Road rage shooting suspect in Antipolo arrested Romualdez believes social media can be used to help the police track down suspects and criminals. Social media is a powerful tool. But when its used to manufacture lies and sow panic, it becomes a threat to national stability, he said. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to mislead and deceive. If we want a New Philippines, we all have to be part of the solution. Stay vigilant. Report suspicious activities, he said. Our streets are safer. Thats the truth. But when fake crime content dominates social media, people are made to feel otherwise. We must not let lies erase the progress weve made.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049373/romualdez-calls-out-fake-stories-on-crime-pnp-data-tells-otherwise,others

Businesses must release workers final pay on time,"MANILA, Philippines Businesses across the country should release on time the final pay of separated or terminated employees in compliance with labor payment rules, an aspiring party-list group said on Wednesday. In a statement, the Trabaho Party list said that businesses should comply with the law on the timely release of employees final pay, as stated under the Department of Labor and Employment advisory in 2020. According to the DOLE Labor Advisory No. 06, Series of 2020, the computation and payment of final pay should be released, as much as possible, within 30 days after the employee officially leaves the company. Under Philippine labor law, employers are mandated to release the final pay within 30 days after the employees last day of work. This pay should include all outstanding salaries, unused leave credits, 13th-month pay, and other benefits entitled to the worker, Trabaho party-list spokesperson and lawyer Mitchell-David Espiritu said. Failure to comply not only deprives workers of their hard-earned money but can also expose companies to legal repercussions, he added. It is important to give these final salaries on time, Espiritu said, as failure to do so would have a detrimental effect on the finances of a worker. Delayed final pay can lead to financial distress for employees, especially those who rely on their final paycheck to cover immediate expenses. Furthermore, it negatively impacts the broader workforce by creating a culture of non-compliance that undermines workers rights, he noted. In February 2020, the DOLE in Central Visayas already reminded companies to comply with the regulations regarding the release of final pay of terminated or separated workers. Then DOLE Central Visayas regional director Salome Siaton said thatseparated workers, regardless of the cause of their termination, should be given their final pay within 30 days from the date of separation or termination of employment. We repeatedly heard workers saying that their former companies would only release their last pay after two to three months. Some would even last longer than three months ever after workers have been already issued with company clearance, Siaton said in an emailed statement. Once and for all, we have now an advisory that will serve as a guide for all employers as well as for all workers insofar as their rights are concerned. Klaro na yan. Within 30 days from the date of the workers separation from employment, companies must also be able to release their last or final pay, she added. READ: DOLE urges employers to release final pay of separated, terminated workers in 30 days According to the Trabaho party-list, the group called for better enforcement of labor laws, aside from the imposition of stricter penalties for businesses that consistently fail to meet their obligations to workers. Employers should establish clear guidelines for the release of final pay, while employees should be proactive in seeking clarity about the settlement process and ensuring timely resolution, Espiritu said. With the growing awareness around workers rights and the importance of adhering to labor laws, TRABAHO Partylist remains committed to championing the cause of Filipino workers, urging the public to support the timely and fair treatment of all employees in the workplace, he added. Aside from protecting workers rights, the group also called on the government to create more job opportunities in the country, so that Filipinos would no longer resort to traveling abroad just to find work. The continued increase in remittances is a testament to the hard work and sacrifices of our fellow Filipinos working abroad. However, we must address the root causes of this migration trend. Our goal is to create more high-paying jobs here at home, ensuring that our workers will no longer need to leave their families to earn a living, Espiritu said. We need to move away from the notion that working abroad is the only way to ensure a good life. By improving wages and offering competitive benefits here in the Philippines, we can retain our talents and help reduce the countrys reliance on remittances, he added. According to the group, if it wins a seat during the 2025 midterm polls, they will push for reforms to generate more stable and higher-paying employment opportunities within the country. We value the contributions of OFWs to our economy, but we must not forget about those who choose to remain and build their futures here. By ensuring better local opportunities we are strengthening the foundation of our countrys economic growth and providing a more secure future for Filipino families, Espiritu noted.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049376/businesses-must-release-workers-final-pay-on-time,others
Gatchalian hits low number of cases filed vs tobacco smugglers,"MANILA, Philippines Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Wednesday questioned the low number of cases filed against tobacco smugglers in the country despite a high number of raids and seizures done by authorities. At the Senate panel on ways and means hearing, Gatchalian aired his frustration, specifically questioning why only less than one percent of cases filed had been decided upon by the courts. Data presented during the hearing showed that the Bureau of Internal Revenue had 1,636 seizures from 2023 to 2025. Of this number, only 194 cases were filed; 15 remain pending with the office of the prosecutor; 14 were filed before courts; and one was decided upon by the courts. READ: Gatchalian: Smuggled tobacco wreaking havoc by funding terrorists I remember the time when I was a mayor, the Philippine National Police liked to show off. But when I was reviewing the conviction rate of drug cases in our city in Valenzuela, I noticed that the conviction rate is also very low, Gatchalian said. The senator said the same problem was observed in Valenzuela City where a lot of our enforcement agencies, especially the rank and file are not very well-versed in evidence collecting, in procedures, as well as the law itself and there were a lot of lapses [and] a lot of issues in terms of procedures. I dont know if its done willfully or its purely ignorance, but nevertheless the low conviction rate is a cause of concern for us, especially in smuggling, he added. Gatchalian also emphasized that no matter what the government does in terms of law whether amending the law or coming up with stricter guidelines if convictions are not made against smugglers, then progress would not be made. According to Bureau of Internal Revenue Assistant Commissioner James Roldan, some of those whose tobacco shipments wereseized eventually paid, and thats why enforcement of cases was no longer necessary. This was echoed by Head Revenue Executive Assistant Dondanon Galera, who noted that many of those that they mapped in 2023, when they conducted a nationwide mapping, were small vape shops and sari-sari stores that have already paid their obligations.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049223/gatchalian-hits-low-number-of-cases-filed-vs-tobacco-smugglers,others

Palace: Cabinet officials shared enough info on Duterte arrest,"MANILA, Philippines Cabinet officials have provided sufficient information on the arrest of former president Rodrigo Duterte during a previous Senate hearing, the Palace maintained on Wednesday. This statement came in response to Sen. Imee Marcos objection to the absence of officials at the upcoming hearing of the Senate foreign relations committee, which she chairs, on the same issue, scheduled for Thursday. READ: Admin officials no-show in next Senate hearing on Duterte arrest Alam na po ng mga Cabinet officials natin na sapat na po, sa kanilang pananaw, ang kanilang mga nasabi, naibigay na facts, mga data sa naunang hearing, Palace press officer Claire Castro said during a briefing. She insisted that since Marcos had established her preliminary findings during the previous hearing, this made the attendance of government executives unnecessary. Hindi po natin masasabi na hindi naman po tinugunan ang mga katanungan kung ito po ay in aid of legislation, Castro said. The Palace official also emphasized that the administration is not withholding any information regarding Dutertes apprehension and surrender to the International Criminal Court. On Tuesday, the senators office released a copy of a letter from Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin informing her and Senate President Francis Escudero that Cabinet officials would no longer attend the hearing. Bersamin said in the letter that the officials had sincerely answered all the questions to the best of their knowledge and candidly provided all information elicited by the Senate committee members. He also reiterated his position on invoking the executive privilege of the officials in the proceedings, as stated in a letter he sent to Escudero on March 20. We believe that all matters not covered by executive privilege have already been extensively discussed, Bersamin said.

"DA eyes MSRP for garlic, eggs amid profiteering concerns","MANILA, Philippines The Department of Agriculture is considering the imposition of a maximum suggested retail price on garlic to prevent possible profiteering, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said. In a news release on Tuesday, Tiu Laurel said the proposal to impose an MSRP on garlic has been under discussion, but was placed on hold after the price per kilo dropped to around P100, down from a peak of P160. READ: DA sets aside P85M for small-scale egg production The higher price was double the estimated landed cost of P80 per kilo. Imported garlic accounts for 95 percent of the market supply, with significant volume being sourced from China. Since the price has fallen to around P100 a kilo, we had to hold back. I think the current price is reasonable given their cost of around HPP80, Tiu Laurel said. But if prices spike again, we will definitely implement an MSRP. The DA is also closely monitoring the prices of eggs to ensure they dont rise to unreasonable levels. Tiu Laurel noted that rising demand due to election spending and increasing chicken mortality from higher temperatures are contributing factors to the price fluctuations. He said DA monitoring places egg prices within the P6-P8 range, lower than the reported P10-P12. There are some who are suggesting we implement an MSRP on eggs but, as with other goods like rice and pork, we have to consult stakeholders first so as not to shock the industry, he said. Meanwhile, the DA on Monday further reduced the MSRP for imported rice to P45 per kilo from P49, reflecting the global decline in rice prices. For pork, the DA set an MSRP of P380 per kilo for liempo and P350 per kilo for kasim and pigue; and P300 per kg. for sabit-ulo following a series of stakeholders meetings across the hog industry. While compliance has improved, it is still not at the ideal level, the DA said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048997/da-eyes-msrp-for-garlic-eggs-amid-profiteering-concerns,others

DA revising minimum access volume rules for pork imports,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Agriculture is currently revising the minimum access volume for pork. We are reformulating the rules for MAV. The DAs Policy and Planning Office is already on the job, and they have to have an output by October this year, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said in a statement on Wednesday. Our MAV rules were written in 1996 and when I read it, I found a lot of room for improvement. So, we have to revise the MAV, he added. READ: Lower tariff for pork imports eyed to cut prices According to Tiu Laurel, pork imported under the MAV quota enjoys a lower tariff of 15 percent compared to the regular rate of 25 percentwith MAV allocation totaling 55,000 metric tons and 30,000 MT set aside for meat processors to ensure lower-priced processed meat. But in reviewing the MAV, Tiu Laurel said he discovered that 47 out of 130 quota holders account for 80 percent of the total allocation, while 22 of that 47 account for 70 percent of that volume. In reality, 22 MAV quota holders account for 55 percent of the total volume, he explained, adding that many of those MAV quota are then often reused, inflating total import volume. The sad part about this is that consumers dont benefit [from the] reduced tariff, he said. Hence, Tiu Laurel said he was looking to increase allocation to meat processors to 40,000 MT, with the balance to be set aside for Food Terminals Inc., which would allow it to have the resources to intervene in the market to stabilize pork prices. Meanwhile, the DA has implemented a maximum suggested retail price for pork P380 per kg of liempo and P350 a kilo of pigue and kasim but admitted that compliance has so far been low.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2049237/fwd-%e2%81%a0%e2%81%a0da-revising-mav-rules-for-pork,others

House prosecution team in Sara Duterte impeachment trial 80% ready,"MANILA, Philippines The House of Representatives prosecution panel is 80 percent ready for the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte. This is the view that the team member and Iloilo 3rd District Rep. Lorenz Defensor expressed on Wednesday during a virtual press briefing. Defensor confirmed that he and the other members of the prosecution panel have conducted mock trials to simulate what an impeachment proceeding feels like. This was also meant to prepare the House prosecutors responses in case members of the defense team would question their evidence and witnesses. At least on my side, we are 80 percent ready. We are just preparing and anticipating what the possible defenses would be [presented] by the defense counsel, Defensor told reporters covering the House. And well have time to meet this week with the other articles [to see] how far they have gone, he noted. We are preparing our testimonial and documentary evidence. And we have conducted a run-through of what an impeachment court would feel like [while] anticipating possible objections from the defense team, the lawmaker said. So right now, we are not only preparing the evidence for the prosecution, but we are also anticipating what the other camp may present to block it, he added in a mix of English and Filipino. Defensor admitted it was not easy to prepare for the impeachment trial while managing an election campaign. They are making the preparations shortly after the beginning of the campaign period for the local polls last March 28. It takes time away from our preparation because, not only do we have to campaign for ourselves, but as congressmen, we have local candidates in our district, he said. For myself, I have nine mayors. I want to ensure and help that all the nine mayors in my lineup win. It takes away time from the preparation, but its a good challenge also, he went on. Its not an easy balance between an election and preparation, but we are doing our best since this impeachment involves national interest. It involves the second-highest official of the country. So we will prepare very well, he added. On February 5, the House impeached Duterte after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The complaint was hinged on several issues, among them the alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices; threats to ranking officials, including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.; and conduct unbecoming of a vice president. The Articles of Impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate. The Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. Under the Constitution, the Senate will act as an impeachment court, with senators sitting as judges. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the Articles of Impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5. This means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session, to discuss the matter. Defensor previously said that they hoped the impeachment trial would start immediately, as the Constitution states. But he also said that they would respect the Senates decision regarding the timeline of the proceedings. READ: Lawmakers hope VP Sara Duterte impeachment trial will start soon With the long wait for the trial, the prosecutors conceded that they would just use the available time to prepare and educate the public as to why Duterte was impeached.

However, they submitted the motion after a Senate committee conducted a hearing to discuss the arrest of Dutertes father, former President Rodrigo Duterte.

"Duterte drug war: Thousands killed, menace stayed alive","MANILA, Philippines In 2024, then-President Rodrigo Duterte had this to say about his murderous campaign against drugs and crime that has killed thousands of mostly poor Filipinos: I did what I had to do. Government data acknowledged 6,000 people dead in the brutal campaign to rid the country of the drug menace. Human rights groups estimate the death toll to be as high as 30,000 while another government document, supposedly an accomplishment report, listed 20,000 dead. RELATED STORY: Kill, kill, kill: Dutertes words offer evidence in ICC What were all the killings for? That Duterte, in his own words, had to do what he had to do raises many questions about his bloody anti-drug campaign, mainly whether it succeeded or failed. READ: Diokno: Dutertes OP listed 20,322 drug-war deaths as accomplishments Government data showed that both index and non-index crimes decreased to as low as 261,565 in 2019 from 675,816 in 2015, a year before Duterte became president. But in 2020, crimes again increased to 394,468. There were 375,731 cases in 2021, and then 379,499 in 2022. Even with this, however, the war on drugs failed to significantly reduce the number of users in the Philippines. According to data from the Dangerous Drugs Board , there was already a decrease in the number of drug users even before Duterte became president. From 6.765 million in 2004, the 2015 National Household Survey on the Patterns and Trends of Drug Abuse showed a drop to 1.755 million. Duterte ended his six-year presidency with 1.479 million existing users according to government statistics. It was Duterte himself who pointed out in 2021 that the illegal drug trade remains to be a problem, saying that while thousands have already been arrested, they are still around. RELATED STORY: Duterte drug war has killed 2 per day, says UP study Back in 2016, he promised to end the drug menace in the Philippines in three to six months, which he eventually said would last until 2022. So what happened? Jorge Tigno, a professor of political science at the University of the Philippines Diliman, said a retributive and punitive approach is not viable. He stressed that, as pointed out by international experts, such an approach may be appealing at the beginning, but would not really end the problem. [It] would not really, effectively, and sustainably succeed in curbing illegal drug use and abuse, he said in a policy brief published by the Center for Integrative and Development Studies. He said the problem of illegal drugs cannot be seen simply and solely as a police and criminal matter, so punitive and retributive measures will not suffice. Rather than commit police forces to the campaign, he said the government should have engaged health professionals that would provide a more sustainable approach, as well as fewer lives lost. Based on DDB data, admissions to rehabilitation centers across the Philippines rose to 6,079 in 2016, but eventually fell to 2,708 in 2022. Over 6,200 people have been killed by the police in almost six years of Duterte in Malacaang, based on government data, but as contested by rights groups, the deaths in the controversial war on drugs could be as high as 30,000. The 30,000 include the individuals killed in vigilante-style street executions. Based on a 2017 document of the Office of the President, there were 20,000 drug-related deaths in the first 17 months of Dutertes presidency. They were listed as accomplishment. As stated in a Drug Archive Philippines report, while data indicated an occupation, or job, for only a small portion of the total number of victims, it is clear that most of the victims were poor. This, as in cases in which the victims employment status and occupation were indicated, or 15.8 percent, it was found that most were in low-paying or skilled work: Then out of the 5,021 drug-related deaths between May 10, 2016 and Sept. 29, 2017 that were compiled by the Ateneo Policy Center, only a few were known big time drug dealers. Some 47 percent were alleged by police to be small-time drug suspects, 23 percent were individuals on watchlists compiled by police and local officials, and eight percent were alleged by police to be drug users or addicts. The rest were those alleged to be drug couriers , alleged by police to be narco-politicians , alleged narco-cops , and alleged by police to be drug lords . As pointed out by Amnesty International, a lot of countries have tried a heavy-handed approach to drugs, but again and again, such tactics have proven unsuccessful. [It] devastated lives while failing to tackle the root causes of drug use and sale, it said while stressing that its various manifestations are a problem you treat, not shoot at. Back in 2017, Duterte said his order was if I have children who are into drugs, kill them so people will not have anything to say. Duterte said this in the middle of the controversy confronting his son, Davao Rep. Paolo Duterte, who was accused of involvement in smuggling $125 million worth of methamphetamine, or shabu.

Manases Carpio, and businessman Michael Yang to the illegal drugs shipment in 2018. Yang, a Chinese national, was appointed by Duterte as economic adviser, and as stressed by former police colonel Eduardo Acierto last year, Duterte protected Yang and Allan Lim, who are suspected of involvement in the illegal drug trade. RELATED STORY: Acierto: Duterte ordered my arrest for knowing Michael Yangs drug ties Acierto said at a hearing of the House Quad Committee, that he submitted an intelligence report in 2017 detailing Yang and Lims criminal activities.

Being the vice president, while you have a father to take care, you also have a nation to look after and a nation you have to see that you are accountable for your actions, said Iloilo Rep.

Fund misuse issue in Duterte impeachment gives peace of mind solon,"MANILA, Philippines The inclusion of the confidential fund misuse issue in the Articles of Impeachment against Vice President Sara Duterte gives some peace of mind that even if possibly fictitious names of recipients are discovered, answers will be revealed at the trial. This was the answer of La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V when asked to comment on another wave of weird names found on receipts used to justify the CF use of the Department of Education when it was under Duterte. What gives me a bit of peace of mind right now, as I said, is that this is part of the impeachment, it will be tackled during the trial. But its a pity if our worst fears are actually true, that the funds did not go to their intended beneficiaries, the correct recipients, and were instead used for a different purpose, Ortega said. I am confident, maybe not only me but maybe other people asking who are these names, where did these come from, why did they receive millions of money, because as Ive said, these will be tackled during the impeachment and there will be no reason why they cannot answer the questions, he added. On Sunday, Ortega announced that more questionable names were found on the acknowledgment receipts used to justify DepEds CF expenditures. According to Ortega, lawmakers found names such as Amoy Liu and Fernan Amuy. Amoy means odor in Filipino. They also found the name Joug De Asim. The Filipino word asim means sour in English. READ: Duterte-led DepEds secret fund receipts have odor names lawmaker Ortega also said these names have no records of birth, marriage, and death in the Philippine Statistics Authoritys registry. The issue of odd named on ARs started when the House of Representatives committee on good government and public accountability investigated the CF disbursements of DepEd and the Office of the Vice President . At one point in the hearings, Antipolo 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop took notice of the name Mary Grace Piattos as it bears a first name similar to a coffee shop and a surname of a famous potato chip brand. Later on, Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong showed two more ARs one for OVP and another for the DepEd which were both received by a certain Kokoy Villamin. However, the signatures and handwriting of Villamin differed. READ: House probe: OVP, DepEd CFs received by same man, different signatures Last March 6, Ortega bared that individuals who seem to be relatives of Piattos, and a name that sounds like a cellphone brand, Xiaome Ocho, also signed ARs for CF expenditures. First, there were names of snacks, cellphones, and fruits. Then came the Dodong Gang. Now, we have the Sour-Smelling Team. If the fake names on the list already give off a sour impression, what more about the transactions themselves? Ortega asked. READ: Piattos kin, Xiaome Ocho also got VP Sara Dutertes funds Ortega According to Ortega, these new bits of information would only strengthen Article II of the Articles of Impeachment which deals with the CF issue. He also expects more weird names to come out once lawmakers dig deeper into the ARs. Well it will strengthen article two, as we already had the hearings at the good government [committee], it will be better for the issues to be discussed continuously, and this has proven that our findings at the committee were not merely rumors, he said. We expect more names to come out, because theres over 1,000 [ARs], with DepEd alone theres 400 plus out of 700. So its a trend, so you can expect that more names would come out, and it is good that we have this impeachment because in there, they can finally address the questions that do not have reactions or answers until now, he added. The House impeached Duterte on February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint hinged on several issues like the alleged misuse of CFs, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a vice president. The petition was immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP SaraDuterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the petition was not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5. It means Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. Previously, Senate President Francis Escudero said the trial would start on July 30 with the new set of lawmakers after the 2025 midterm elections sitting as senator-judges. Several House lawmakers, including members of the prosecution team, previously said that while they respect the Senates stand on the matter, they are of the belief that the impeachment trial should start at the soonest possible time.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046432/fund-misuse-issue-in-duterte-impeachment-gives-peace-of-mind-solon,others

"DPWH exec urges women to assert their place in engineering, govt","Department of Public Works and Highways Undersecretary Maria Catalina Cabral has urged women to assert their rightful place in engineering and leadership roles in the government. During herkeynote address at the Asia Womens Forum, hosted by the Philippines largest business forum, the Asia CEO Forum, at the Manila Marriott Hotel on March 21, Cabral also shared her pioneering journey in the infrastructure sector. In her speech titled Breaking Barriers, Building Legacies, Cabral called for an end to gender stereotypes in the boardroom and on construction sites. Cabral stands as one of only two female civil engineers ever to receive the Professional Regulation Commissions Most Outstanding Civil Engineer Awarda prestigious honor that has been awarded since 1977, with only one other woman having received it a decade ago. Currently serving as DPWH Undersecretary for Planning and Public-Private Partnerships at DPWH, Cabral made history as the first woman to rise from the departments ranks to this high-ranking position. She also shattered new ground as the first female national president of the Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers. These achievements reflect her remarkable 30-year career in a field where female leadership remains rare. During the forum, Cabral reflected on the challenges of navigating a male-dominated industry, recounting how she often entered project meetings and was mistaken for an assistant rather than the lead engineer. Men are assumed to be capable until proven otherwise. Women are assumed to be incapable until we prove otherwise, she said, highlighting the bias she had to overcome. She emphasized that women like her have not only persisted but thrived. We dont just build roads. We build spaces where women belongwhere our ideas are heard, our skills are valued, and where we are not exceptions, but part of the norm, Cabral said, receiving strong applause from the audience. She stressed that competence is determined by skill and determination, not gender, and that she and other women stayed, worked, and proved them wrong over the years. Cabral also urged women professionals not to wait for permission to lead. Stop waiting. You are ready now, she said, urging women to step into leadership roles with confidence. She affirmed that women are not temporary participants in leadership but equal, permanent stakeholders. We are not guests in leadership. We are here to stay, she added.

"Duterte arrest glimmer of hope in quest for justice, bishop says","BACOLOD CITY Bishop Gerardo Alminaza of the Diocese of San Carlos in Negros Occidental welcomed the arrest of former president Rodrigo Duterte, saying it brings solace to the thousands of families who lost their loved ones during the controversial war-on-drugs initially in Davao and subsequently throughout the country. The prelate also expressed hopes that other perpetrators of this drug war will be brought to justice. From the harrowing era of state-sponsored killings that plagued our nation, a glimmer of hope has emerged with the arrest of Duterte, Alminaza said in a statement on Thursday, March 20. This development brings a measure of hope and solace to the thousands of families who lost their loved ones during the Duterte regimes war-on-drugs and war-on-rights, a period marked by impunity and reward-driven killings, he added. Alminaza pointed out that the Diocese of San Carlos has consistently called for an end to these killings as he personally borne witness to the devastating consequences of this violence. I presided over the heart-wrenching funeral masses of activists Zara Alvarez, Dr. Mary Rose Sancelan, and her husband, all murdered for their dedication to the poor and their tireless work for justice and peace in Negros Island, he said. Alminaza said he also offered prayers at the wake of Skyler Bladen Abatayo, a four-year-old boy tragically killed by a stray bullet during a flawed drug raid in Cebu City. It is deeply troubling that many remain unconvinced of the profound injustice perpetrated through these systematic killings, and that, tragically, former president Dutertes actions garnered admiration from some, he said. It pains me to acknowledge that some among us continue to support former president Dutertes campaign of violence, justifying the killings as a solution to the nations drug problem, Alminaza added. These people, the prelate said, remain blinded by the false narrative that criminality and drug addiction could be eradicated through death and execution. Holding Duterte accountable will be a warning to other leaders who want to unleash human rights violations in the future, he said. We must engage in a critical reevaluation of our values as believers, reaffirming our commitment to the sanctity of all life. The Church must remain a powerful voice against injustice and any form of tyrannical solution to social problems, he added. Alminaza said they remain vigilant against the continuing practice of impunity as military attacks and bombings continue to terrorize rural communities on Negros Island, Mindoro and Mindanao. Duterte, 79, was arrested last March 11 under an International Criminal Court warrant over allegations of crimes against humanity following the drug war he launched during his stint as president from 2016 to 2022.

Mining ban in Palawan: Triumph for nature,"PUERTO PRINCESA CITY, PALAWAN, Philippines A hard-fought environmental battle has finally paid off recently as the Palawan provincial government officially approved Ordinance No. 3646, declaring a 50-year extendable moratorium on the issuance of endorsements for all large and small-scale mining applications. This historic decision of the provincial board on March 5 is a major victory for environmental advocates who have long opposed destructive mining operations in the countrys last ecological frontier. Our forests can finally breathe, but we have to ensure that this policy is enforced. The next 50 years will be a time of recovery and continued monitoring, shared Save Palawan Movement coconvenor Cynthia Sumagaysay-Del Rosario. READ: Legarda pushes for action on triple planetary crisis as 2025 begins The moratorium, Sumagaysay-Del Rosario stressed, is just the beginning of a broader fight. The moratorium covers not just new mining ventures but also applications for exploration permits, mineral agreements, and financial or technical assistance agreements. For antimining advocates like Sumagaysay-Del Rosario, this ordinance is a hard-earned milestone in the continuing fight to preserve Palawans rich biodiversity and protect its communities from the damaging effects of extractive industries. The SPM and other nongovernment organizations , along with civil society organizations and religious leaders have been fighting against large-scale mining operations in Palawan. The province, composed of more than 1,700 islands, is a long and narrow stretch of around 434 kilometers with maximum width of 39 km. Its land area, including the capital Puerto Princesa City, comprises 1,440,496 hectares, 70 percent of which is covered with natural forests that boasts of coastal and marine ecosystem composed of mangrove swamps, coral reefs, pristine natural beauty and rich biodiversity, earning it the tag as the Philippines last ecological frontier. The Environmental Legal Assistance Center and other advocacy groups had already pushed for a 25-year small-scale mining moratorium in 2008, though it was not enacted as an ordinance. Despite setbacks, environmental defenders did not relent. For other Palawan environmental protection advocates, the actual battle started years before as NGOs have been pressing against the establishment of new mining operations in the province. Lawyer Grizelda Mayo-Anda, Elac executive director, said that back in 2008, the Palawan provincial board also passed a resolution for a 25-year moratorium on small-scale mining. Mayo-Anda, however, said that former Vice Gov. David Ponce de Leon, along with other lawyers, reiterated that an ordinance for the moratorium would not be possible. But we were happy [during that time] that at least they came out with a resolution, although we would have wanted an ordinance, Mayo-Anda told the Inquirer. She also said that Palawans environment scored another victory when the late former President Benigno Aquino III issued an executive order for a moratorium on new mining operations. It was short-lived though after former President Rodrigo Duterte, who succeeded Aquino in 2016, lifted it. But the proposed ordinance itself took dramatic turns as NGOs, CSOs and religious organizations had to exert extra effort to lobby for its immediate approval. The fight to achieve this moratorium began long before its passage. Nearly a year ago, the provincial government initiated the Provincial Stakeholders Congress on Mining and the Environment in April, gathering various groups to discuss the critical impacts of mining. What started as a forum to assess the provinces mining policies quickly became a strong demonstration of the peoples overwhelming opposition to mining expansion in Palawan. Gov. Victorino Dennis Socrates admitted that prior to the summit, he had no clear stance on a moratorium. However, after hearing testimonies from communities, scientists and environmentalists about the devastation caused by mining, his perspective changed. The voices of the people, he said, were impossible to ignore. In September 2024, Socrates, in his State of the Province Address, echoed the urgent call to enact a mining moratorium. However, legislative hurdles arose when the Provincial Legal Office initially argued that such an ordinance exceeded the powers of the provincial board. This legal challenge forced revisions, but instead of weakening the moratorium, it was strengthenedextending the initial 25-year proposal to a 50-year ban on new mining applications. With the ordinance seemingly stalled, advocates mobilized once more. NGOs launched a signature campaign, while the Catholic Church amplified the call for action. In a show of unity, Palawans three bishopsSocrates Mesiona of Puerto Princesa, Broderick Pabillo of Taytay and his predecessor, Edgardo Juanichissued a pastoral letter urging lawmakers to heed the publics call. The campaign gained further momentum as thousands of signatures poured in, alongside social media campaigns, rallies and petitions. Nature itself seemed to lend its voice to the cause. As debates continued, heavy flooding triggered by deforestation-related factors underscored the real dangers of environmental destruction. The widespread damage became a stark reminder of why mining must be halted to protect Palawans fragile ecosystems. In a recent press conference, lawyer Teodoro Jose Matta, executive director of the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development, said the council conducted a study back in 2022 on the causes of flooding in the municipality of Brookes Pointone of the areas severely affected by climate change and forest loss, the findings of which he said were also sent to the governors office with recommendations for measures to address and further prevent future flooding. Matta said one key feature of the study and research was that in Brookes Point alone, 4,000 ha of forest cover are lost every year to kaingin , human settlements and agricultural expansion. If you expand this to other municipalities, they have similar numbers, he noted. He cited poverty as one of the major causes of deforestation. He said there were enough socioeconomic programs lined up to uplift the grassroots communities yet these had not been implemented, leading people to fall back to the hinterlands because there was no viable income for them in urban centers. This is a far more bigger threat. Imagine 4,000 ha times 24 municipalities, even if you only count the mainland municipalities where most of our forests are, Matta explained. If we are not addressing the main cause of deforestation, the main cause of floods, we have grown blind and deaf to the clamor of Palaweos for a better life, he added. Governor Socrates signed Ordinance No. 3646 on March 13, making history in Palawans environmental movement. The signing took place at the old Governors Residence, using the very desk once occupied by his father, a staunch environmentalist, who had once declared that protecting Palawans environment was absolute, nonnegotiable, and without compromise. Board Member Arnel Abrina, an indigenous peoples leader and one of the ordinances main authors, acknowledged that it was an uphill battle. At first, we thought it was nearly impossible. But with the peoples supportand even nature helping usit finally happened, he said. Mayo-Anda, however, said that while they recognize other causes of deforestation such as illegal logging, kaingin farming and other agricultural activities, and encroachments, there was also a need for transparency. She said that compared to nickel mining, kaingin farming removes only the top soil and, therefore, the chances of the land reverting back to its original state is high. So we respect that, we agree that there are also other problems and not only mining that causes deforestation, Mayo-Anda said. But with mining, you remove the forests, and its wildlife habitat, and you remove the top soil. So there is a big world of difference, she added. Despite this victory, antimining advocates remained vigilant as they warned that mining companies would continue to push back. The Philippine Nickel Industry Association criticized Palawans 50-year mining moratorium, arguing that it exceeds the provinces mandate and undermines both the Constitution and the countrys global competitiveness. The PNIA, in a statement on March 7, said the ban lacked legal and regulatory basis, disrupted the balance between local autonomy and national oversight, and would discourage investment by creating uncertainty. By imposing such a blanket ban without sufficient legal foundation or consultation with national stakeholders, it undermines the balance between local autonomy and national oversight, which is an essential element for sustainable and equitable development, the group said. But the PNIA expressed willingness to work with the provincial government to develop balanced policies.

Paolo Ortega V said on Sunday. Ortega said lawmakers found odor names such as Amoy Liu and Fernan Amuy. They also found the name Joug De Asim. The Filipino word asim means sour in English. READ: Names of alleged OVP fund recipients get curiouser Sa patuloy na pagsusuri ng Kongreso sa listahan ng mga nakatanggap ng confidential funds sa DepEd, may bagong grupo na namanang tinatawag nating Team Amoy Asim, Ortega said in a statement. Ortega also saidAmoy Liu, Fernan Amuy, and Joug De Asim have no records of birth, marriage, and death in the registry of the Philippine Statistics Authority. These three names were submitted by the Office of the Vice President to the Commission on Audit , he added. In its probe, the House of Representatives found out that the OVP and DepEd submitted about 4,500 acknowledgment receipts to the COA to explain how they used the P612.5-million CF. Una, may chichirya, may cellphone, at may prutas. Sumunod ang Dodong Gang. Ngayon naman, nandito na ang Team Amoy Asim. Kung sa listahan pa lang ay maasim na ang dating ng pekeng mga pangalan, paano pa kaya sa mga transaksyon mismo? Ortega added. Last week, Ortega bared that more names seemingly derived from food were found as non-existent recipients of the OVPs CF. The list of names includes Jay Kamote and Miggy Mango.

Ortega said out of 1,992 supposed recipients of the CFs, 1,322 had no birth records, 1,456 had no marriage records, and 1,593 had no death records. He also slammed Dutertes response when asked in an interview about the growing number of questionable names on the acknowledgment receipts for her use of CFs. Duterte said she could not answer the allegations due to doubts about the chain of evidence.

Degamo widow decries Timor Leste ruling over Teves extradition,"DUMAGUETE CITY The widow of slain Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo has expressed dismay over the recent ruling of a Timorese court that rejected the Philippine governments bid to extradite expelled Rep. Arnolfo Arnie Teves, the alleged mastermind of the crime. In a statement posted on Facebook on Friday, Mayor Janice Degamo of Pamplona town, Negros Oriental, described the decision as peculiar and difficult to understand. She also raised the possibility that a Timorese court could also succumb to power and connections. Dili nato malikayan nga makahunahuna nga ang korte sa Timor Leste makamang sad diay. , said Janice, who did not mention names. The Inquirer tried to reach Mayor Degamo through her mobile phone but to no avail. In decision dated March 20 and written in Portuguese by Timor-Lestes Court of Appeals, an English translation of which was provided by Teves lawyer Ferdinand Topacio, the plenary of judges unanimously decided to grant Teves appeal and refuse the request for [his] extradition. The court cited Article 35 of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, which prohibits extradition if there is a well-founded risk of being subjected to torture, inhuman, degrading or cruel treatment. The Department of Justice , in a statement, said it was surprised and deeply disappointed by this development. The DOJ said Teves is facing serious charges, including multiple counts of murder, and must be brought back to the Philippines to face the full force of the law. Janice said she was confident that the Philippine government would do everything in its power to bring Teves back to the country. I believe in our governments capacity to bring Arnie Teves back so he would face the charges filed against him and his cohorts, she said. Next week, I will meet with Justice Secretary Boying Remulla so he could enlighten me on the recent developments and to know the plans our government has in mind , she added. Janices husband Roel was murdered by armed assailants while attending to the needs of his constituents inside his residential compound in Pamplona town, Negros Oriental on March 4, 2023. Nine other persons were also killed during the attack. Eleven suspects were arrested and earlier linked Teves to the massacre. Many suspects, however, recanted their confessions after they were provided with lawyers This, however, did not stop the prosecutors from filing charges against Teves in court. Teves, who repeatedly denied the accusations, was eventually removed from the House of Representatives and went into hiding after he became the subject of an arrest warrant issued by a Regional Trial Court in Manila. He was eventually arrested while playing golf in Timor Leste on March 21, 2024.

Tiktok told: Do more to combat spread of fake news,"MANILA, Philippines 1-Rider party-list Rep. Rodge Gutierrez has asked Tiktok to enforce more measures to combat disinformation as he sounded alarm about a viral post claiming that Palawan was part of China. During the House of Representatives Tri-Comm hearing last March 21, Friday, Gutierrez said the actions taken by Tiktok were only reactionary. It only removes the content when flagged, instead of taking preventive measures. Mr. Chair, most respectfully, while we laud the attempts at the measures being taken by TikTok in relation to this and we appreciate the numbers that are being put forward, one issue that we have really is that anecdotally, that doesnt seem to be the case, Gutierrez said. During the hearing, Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tariella raised false claims about Chinas ownership of Palawan circulating on Tiktok. He said that it was a new kind of propaganda. READ: Tarriela asks voters to avoid electing pro-China election candidates For example, when we talk about fake news in relation to China, when we see one video posted and it has been reported, we would see the same video posted by a different person, Gutierrez said. So thats why I wanted to ask if how do we ensure that a video that has been flagged for disinformation is not posted again? he added. Tiktoks Policy Manager Peachy Paderna, who was also present at the hearing, said that they do not allow misinformation to flourish on the platform. We do not allow misinformation that not just puts individuals at risk of harm but we also do not allow misinformation that may cause societal harm, she said. She added that videos undergo quick review by technology moderation which studies signals of misinformation before they are uploaded. She also said the platform relies on independent fact-checkers and community reports to flag false information. READ: One billion users but controversies mount up for TikTok We are happy to work with the honorable committee in securing links to these videos so we can endorse them to the appropriate teams with TikTok, she added. Paderna said Tiktok removed over 4 million videos for violating community guidelines between July to September 2024, but Gutierrez said the platform still has a long way to go in addressing disinformation. So I hope youd understand the frustration that this committee would have in relation to the social media postsand thats not even going into yet the issue of suppression that our journalists are facing in relation to the territorial dispute of the West Philippine Sea, Gutierrez added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046172/solon-asks-tiktok-do-more-to-combat-spread-of-fake-news,others

Manibela: Many commuters left stranded amid transport strike,"MANILA, PhilippinesMany commuters still found it hard to travel despite work-from-home setups and class suspensions amid the transport strike on Monday, transport group Manibela said. On its Facebook page, Manibela showed the situation at Metro Manila jeep and bus stops. Commuters were stranded after several jeepney drivers refused to make trips in protest of the Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Boards alleged falsification of the data of the Public Transport Modernization Program . Manibela also accused LTFRB of lying about providing free rides, as many commuters were without public transport. Nag-sinungaling na kayo sa consolidation, pati sa Libreng Sakay mga sinungaling pa rin kayo, Manibelas post reads. Walang pasok tapos may pronouncement ng libreng sakay pero stranded pa rin mga pasahero. Work-from-home, online classes, mga walang pasok pero madami pa [rin] ang stranded, it added. Commonwealth Avenue as of 8:30am. Wala pa [rin] masakyan at higit sa lahat walang libreng sakay. READ: Suspension of face-to-face classes due to March 24 transport strike Manibela also disputed the governments assurance that it is ready for the strikes, noting that some commuters just opted to return home as they cannot get free rides to their schools or workplaces. Anong nire-ready ready nyo dyan? Stranded na mga pasahero, nagsi-uwian na kasi kagigising lang ng gobyerno, the group said. Earlier, LTFRB spokesperson Ariel Inton said the transport situation in Metro Manila remains normal despite the ongoing strike, with most jeepney drivers opting to make trips. READ: Metro Manila public transport normal despite jeepney strikeLTFRB Malacaang also said the government would deploy additional buses and trains to help passengers affected by the strike. In a Viber message to reporters, Palace Press Officer Claire Castro said additional buses and trains would be deployed to the Edsa busway and Light Rail Transit Lines 1 and 2, respectively. Last March 19, Manibela President Mar Valbuena said the LTFRB had been telling them lies about the PTMP. Valbuena said they would also push for the resignation of LTFRB Chair Teofilo Guadiz III, as he claimed that 86 percent of the countrys passenger vehicles already consolidated to form cooperatives or corporations in accordance with the PTMP. According to Valbuena, no less than newly appointed Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon admitted that the 86 percent included drivers and operators groups whose consolidation applications have not been approved. Its because of their false data that we are suffering today, not just drivers and operators, but more so our commuters, he added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046366/manibela-many-commuters-left-stranded-amid-transport-strike,others
PH Army evolving to meet new security threats,"MANILA Philippine Army commander Lt. Gen. Roy Galido said Saturday the service is now evolving to meet and address new security challenges. In his message during the Armys 128th founding anniversary, Galido said the Army, which previously focused on internal security, has now shifted to territorial defense, noting the external threats the country is now facing. We come together to celebrate 128 years of bravery, sacrifice, and undaunted service of the PA. Throughout history, our Army has been the backbone of our nations security, evolving to meet new challenges, he said during the celebration held at Fort Bonifacio in Taguig City. Galido said the PA is focused on a game-changing mission that ensures a stronger, more capable, and future-ready force. For decades, the Army has significantly contributed to the decline of the communist and local terrorist groups, ensuring peace and stability within our borders. As threat evolves, so must we. Our focus now is on territorial defense, protecting our lands, coastline, and sovereignty, he said. Galido said this shift aligns with the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept , which ensures that the PA works seamlessly with the Navy and Air Force to defend the Philippines vast national territory. The PAs role in CADC, he said, is to protect the land domain while supporting coastal and littoral operations. To meet this challenge, we have reconfigured our forces in ways that make us more agile and effective. The creation of Combat Engineer Regiment ensures protection of key strategic locations, fortifying our bases and securing mobility corridors, he added. Galido also said that PA reserve forces have been beefed up by redefining their roles in internal and external security operations, emphasizing the new functions of the community defense centers and regional community defense groups. Recognizing the need for accuracy and real-time battlefield awareness, we have upgraded our reconnaissance capabilities, ensuring our troops are always prepared to respond with precision and efficiency.

"CHR: Free speech has limits, but govt must not infringe on it","MANILA, Philippines While there are limitations to free speech, the Commission on Human Rights has reminded law enforcement agencies to ensure that the right of content creators to exercise such freedom would not be infringed. In a statement on Monday, CHR said they understand the danger posed for society when content creators alter quote cards such as that of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to make it seem that he is in favor of legalizing illegal drugs. However, the commission noted that authorities are conducting surveillance of online content creators or vloggers whom they suspect of spreading disinformation or fake news. The CHR reminds our law enforcement officers and agencies to remain circumspect in enforcing criminal laws that have a direct impact on the enjoyment of the freedom of expression by every individual, CHR said. While there are limitations to freedom of expression, government-based sanctions that look into the truth or falsity of a statement are a form of content-based restraint that may be considered a prior restraint on free speech prohibited by Article III, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution, it added. According to CHR, probing content creators even before they commit violations might result in a chilling effect on other constitutionally protected forms of speech. The CHR voices serious concerns against enforcing content-based restraint enforced on pain of criminal or penal prosecution as it sends a chilling effect on other constitutionally protected forms of speech such as an individuals freedom to express oneself, ethical journalism, and well-meaning political advocacy, CHR noted. As held by our Supreme Court in Disini v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. 203335, 11 February 2014, any government threat of punishment regarding certain uses of the medium creates a chilling effect on the constitutionally-protected freedom of expression of the great masses that use it, it added. Last March 20, a 30-year-old female vlogger from Oslob town in southern Cebu was arrested by National Bureau of Investigation agents, for allegedly spreading fake news. According to NBI-Region 7 Director Renan Agustus Oliva, the vlogger edited Marcos quote card as published by media company TV5, to make it seem that the president was pushing for the legalization of illegal drugs. READ: Female vlogger from Oslob, Cebu nabbed by NBI for spreading fake news Eventually, NBI Director Jaime Santiago said last Saturday that they would be partnering with social media sites management to track down content creators waging misinformation and disinformation campaigns. READ: NBI lauded for raps vs Cebu vlogger The CHR said it will monitor the situation to avoid intimidation of other people who may restrain the exercise of free speech due to the NBIs surveillance. The CHR remains vigilant in monitoring possible infringements on the fundamental right to freedom of expression to avoid the overbearing application of in terrorem effect of criminal law on the well-meaning exercise of fundamental rights. Indeed, [a] blow too soon struck for freedom is preferred than a blow struck too late, CHR said, citing the Supreme Court. The spread of misinformation and disinformation has been a big problem for the Philippines, as Filipinos are one of the if not the most prevalent social media and internet users across the globe. Last May 2024, lawmakers urged the public to exercise discretion amid the spread of videos where Marcos voice was mimicked to announce that the Philippines was getting ready for war against China. Malacaang has since disowned the video. READ: Deepfake: PCO disowns clip of Marcos attack order vs China Just recently, House lawmakers called out misinformation and disinformation attempts spreading on social media after former President Rodrigo Duterte was taken into custody by the International Criminal Court. Some Duterte supporters have shared social media posts stating that the Supreme Court received a petition containing 16 million signatures, asking that Marcos step down from office. The Office of the SC spokesperson Camille Ting said the High Tribunal has not received any document bearing the title Supreme Court Receives Petition on 16 Million Signatures Calling for President Marcos Resignation, adding that their office has not issued such a document. Last Friday, the House of Representatives tri-committee resumed its probe into the spread of false information online. During the hearing, vloggers were scolded for claiming several things like the extrajudicial killings in the past administrations drug war being a hoax without having the necessary documents to prove it.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046351/chr-free-speech-has-limits-but-govt-must-not-infringe-on-it,others
"NBI has list of fake news peddlers, tracing financial backers","Updated @ 3:59 p.m., March 24, 2025 MANILA, Philippines The National Bureau of Investigation has a list of 20 vloggers and is tracking the funding sources for spreading fake news that target government officials, exacerbating political tensions, Director Jaime Santiago said Monday. A common theme runs through in the kind of disinformation being circulated, raising suspicions of coordinated efforts, Santiago told reporters after the graduation ceremony at the NBI Academy. We are looking at why they are increasing in number. Why does it seem that they have only one theme riding on the disturbances in our political atmosphere? This should not happen. Our country is in trouble. Citizens will be confused, Santiago said in Filipino. READ: Vloggers apologize in House under intensegrilling in fake news probe We have a list of these vloggers spreading fake news, Santiago said. Asked how many were on the list, he said 20. Santiago added that the investigation would extend beyond identifying individual spreaders, focusing on uncovering potential financial backers. We are looking into whether they have someone leading them, he said, indicating a probe into possible funding sources behind the coordinated disinformation campaigns. Recognizing the issues complexity, Santiago said the NBI would collaborate with other government agencies to combat the spread of fake news. Last week, we had a meeting with the DICT [Department of Information and Communications Technology] and the NTC [National Telecommunications Commission] to discuss how we can once and for all stop these fake news spreaders, bloggers, and content creators, he said in Filipino. READ: NBI lauded for raps vs Cebu vlogger One significant challenge that Santiago highlighted is the issue of jurisdiction, mainly when vloggers and content creators are based overseas. In the US, for example, libel is a civil case, not a criminal one. So, if a blogger is a US citizen, how can we enforce our laws on their citizens, especially when their laws differ from ours? he explained. But he said they were exploring all avenues. We are looking at all angles. For example, they could be inciting to sedition, which is a crime in the US and here. We are also looking into tax evasion, he added, citing the Al Capone case as an example of pursuing criminals through financial irregularities. Santiago added that extradition would also be viable, and the NBI could request assistance from Interpol. On question of suppressing freedom of speech, Santiago said: Ok lang yanfreedom of speech, freedom of expression pero pagka lumampas na sa hangganan, nakakakomit na sila ng inciting to sedition, libel, kailangan sawatahin natin yan. Freedom of speech, freedom of expression thats okay. However, when it crosses the line and becomes inciting to sedition or libel, we need to stop it, he said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046380/nbi-has-list-of-fake-news-peddlers-and-their-financial-backers,others

According to PEF, the eagles that were moved were Lakpue, Lyra Sinabadan and Kalatungan 1. The birds came from the National Bird Breeding Sanctuary and the Philippine Eagle Center in Davao. Their transfer is in line with the foundations Philippine Eagle Reintroduction Programs second year. They went through health checks before being placed in their acclimation enclosures in preparation for their eventual release into the wild, it said in a Facebook post on Saturday. PEFs Philippine Eagle Reintroduction Program was launched last year, along with the release of Philippine eagles Carlito and Uswag. However, PEF disclosed that only Carlito was able to adapt to the Mahagnao landscape. Uswag wandered too far from the site and drowned near the coast of Baybay in Leyte. To prevent another loss, the Philippine Eagle Foundation adopted the Philippine Eagle Bonding Experiment, the foundation said. The experiment is a strategy to foster social relationships and increase survival among released eagles by helping them to pair up and hunt together, and stay within their habitat, it noted. PEF also revealed that Lakpue a male eagle will be introduced as a potential mate for Carlito.

VP Sara Duterte told: Your dad allowed heros burial for Marcos Sr.,"MANILA, Philippines An activist has reminded Vice President Sara Duterte that her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, allowed a heros burial for the late President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. after she compared her dad to Marcos critic and democracy iconBenigno Ninoy Aquino Jr. In a message to reporters on Monday, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan President Renato Reyes Jr. said it seems the Dutertes are trying to use people involved in the Edsa People Power Revolution, like Aquino, to invoke an anti-Marcos narrative and criticize Marcos Sr.s son, incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. However, Reyes said this is outrageously ironicbecause former President Duterte was the one who allowed Marcos Sr. to be laid to rest at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. The Duterte camp has no own narrative, so they are trying to grab the narrative of democratic forces, he added. According to Reyes, it is also clear that former President Duterte is not the victim, unlike Aquino who suffered political attacks and incarceration before his self-exile to the United States. Let us be clear. Mr. Duterte is no victim, he is no martyr; rather, he is the main villain in the unfinished saga of drug war extrajudicial killings , he added. Ex-president Duterte, who is currently under the custody of the International Criminal Court in The Hague in The Netherlands, was discouraged by Vice President Duterte from returning to the Philippines as he may suffer the same fate as Aquino. READ: VP Sara warns dad: You could suffer Ninoy Aquinos fate if you return On August 21, 1983, Aquino was killed on the tarmac of then-Manila International Airport after attempting to return to the Philippines. Earlier, the Aquino family issued a statement saying that Aquinos return to the Philippines and Dutertes situation have no similarity. According to the family, a study of the countrys history would show that Aquino was treated far differently compared to what Duterte is experiencing now. READ: Duterte, democracy icon Ninoy lack similarity Aquino family Staunch Duterte critic and former Senator Leila de Lima also does not see any similarity in Aquino and Dutertes situation, saying that Duterte only wants to escape accountability for his cases before the ICC. Malacaang also defended Aquinos legacy, saying that the late senator did not have any record of alleged crimes against humanity. READ: Ninoy Aquino had no record of crimes against humanity Palace Duterte is facing crimes against humanity charges at the ICC for alleged EJKs under his administrations war against illegal drugs. This is not the first time that Vice President Duterte referenced Aquino in hitting back against the Marcoses. On November 25, 2024, after being criticized for her threats to President Marcos, First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, and House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, Vice President Duterte said she agrees with the Chief Executives views that ordinary citizens can be targets of assassinations since the Marcoses were behind Aquinos assassination. Oo, di ba pumalag nga ang buong bayan nang pinatay ng pamilya nila si Benigno Aquino? , Duterte told reporters on the sidelines of the House committee on good government and public accountability hearing. The Aquino family said the Marcoses have to be held accountable for what happened during their late patriarchs two-decade rule, but they noted that Ninoys advocacy has been through peaceful struggle, with the rejection of any threat of violence or assassination. On the Facebook page for the late former President Benigno Aquino III, son of the democracy icon, the Aquino family reiterated that Ninoy was a known believer in peaceful methods to criticize the government a belief that he carried until his death in 1983. The statement came after Vice President Duterte referred to the assassination of Ninoy at the tarmac of the Manila International Airport which is now known as the Ninoy Aquino International Airport to up her criticism of the current Marcos administration. In the 2022 elections, President Marcos and Vice President Duterte ran under a single ticket dubbed as the Uniteam, achieving a landslide victory against the Aquino-endorsed tandem of former Vice President Leni Robredo and former Senator Francis Pangilinan. In less than three years since its inception, the Uniteam suffered a complete collapse with the Marcos and Duterte camps engaging in a word war.

Marcos to troops on PH Armys 128th anniversary: Serve for greater good,"MANILA, Philippines Soldiers must not only display courage and skill but also the willingness to set aside their interests for the countrys greater good, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. said on Saturday as the Philippine Army marked its 128th anniversary. Sa panahon ngayon, hindi sapat ang tapang at husay ng isang sundalo. Kinakailangan ang [paninindigang] hindi natitinag sa harap ng pagsubok, ang prinsipyong hindi nababaluktot ng takot o pangamba, at ang pusong laging handa maglingkod nang tapat at walang hinihintay na kapalit, Marcos said. Sa anumang institusyon, hindi sapat ang ranggo o kapangyarihan. Ang tunay na sukatan ay ang kahandaan na isantabi ang sariling interes para [sa] mas mataas na layunin. Bagamat iba-iba tayo ng papel na ginagampanan, dapat mangibabaw ang ating adhikaing bumuo ng mas nagkakaisa, mas makatarungan, at tunay na mapayapang bansa, he added. As we mark the 128th founding anniversary, we are again reminded why we choose to serve. We do it not for ourselves, but also for the countless generations that will come after us, he added. The President also noted that the government must lead by example, strive to listen, and serve with integrity to rise above adversities and move forward as a people. When peace and order are in place, we can pursue knowledge, we can work towards prosperity, and we can contribute to our countrys progress, Marcos said. To achieve this, the government must lead by example. We strive for a government that listens, that acts and serves with integrity. That is the only way to rise above adversities and move forward as a people, he added.

Groups urge SC to nullify Taguigs order to increase councilor seats,"MANILA, Philippines Several non-government organizations joined retired Supreme Court Associate Justice Dante Tinga in urging the SC to nullify the September 2024ordinance passed by the Taguig City Council that increases the number of councilor seats in the city from eight to 12 per councilor district. In a Motion to Allow Joinder of New Party-Petitioners, the NGO leaders also called on the SC to immediately resolve Tingas petition filed in October 2024. READ: Tiga questions increase in Taguig council seats at SC The prospective petitioners have decided to join the petition particularly on account of their conviction that the increase of the number of councilors per district should be authorized by a valid law duly enacted by the Congress and approved by the President in accordance with the Constitution, similar to the present number of councilors per district, the motion read. The assailed increase of councilors per district from eight to twelve per councilor district was accomplished by an invalid city ordinance, sought to be validated bya hastily passed Concurrent Resolution, that does not have the force and effect of a law, and likewise sought to be implemented by an ill-advised Resolution of the Commission on Elections , they added. Petitioners include Salvacion Robianes, acting president of the Kababaihan ng Taguig Womens Association ; Patria U. Villalon, president of the Upper Bicutan Bayanihan Movement ; and Jennifer V. Corpin, president of the Tenement Homeowners Association in Western Bicutan. In September 2024, the Taguig City Council passed Ordinance No. 144following the SCs final ruling prohibiting Makati City from exercising jurisdiction over Embo barangays. These includeParcels 3 and 4, Psu 2031, comprising Fort Bonifacio, including the so-called Inner Fort which includes Barangays Pembo, Comembo, Cembo, South Cembo, West Rembo, East Rembo, Pitogo, Rizal, Post Proper Northside, and Post Proper Southside. READ: Taguig Citys jurisdiction over BGC complex sealed SC Petitioners argued that the current composition of councilors, which is eight per district is provided in Republic Act No. 6636 and Republic Act No. 7166 They added that R.A. 8487 reaffirmed the number of councilors in the city per district. In his petition, Tinga argued that increasing the number of city councilors requires a law and that such power exclusively belongs to Congress. Tinga named the Commission on Elections , the Senate, and the House of Representatives as respondents in the petition. The former SC associate justice noted that the concurrent resolution of both chambers does not have the force and effect of law since it did not undergo the prescribed three readings for a measure to become law under the Constitution. He added that it did not bear the required signature of the President, which the Constitution mandates. Tinga also said the legal issue could have been avoided had the registered voters of the 10 Embo barangays been fully franchised through an appropriate law making the said EMBO barangays the third legislative district of Taguig City. Tinga said that, as early as June 26, 2024, he had written to House Speaker Martin Romualdez to propose the creation of a new legislative district out of the 10 Embos, with a draft bill enclosed.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046429/groups-urge-sc-to-nullify-taguigs-order-to-increase-councilor-seats,others
VP Duterte can answer impeach raps in PH or via consulate reps,"MANILA, Philippines Vice President Sara Duterte can either go home or send her reply to the nearest consulate should the Senate ask her to respond to the articles of impeachment, House of Representatives prosecutors said on Tuesday. In a press briefing at the Batasang Pambansa complex, Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan and 1-Rider party-list Rep. Ramon Rodrigo Gutierrez said this could be the possible scenario for Duterte when asked about what would happen if the Senate issued a summons order against her. The two congressmen, both House prosecutors in the impeachment trial of the vice president, had earlier requested the Senate to order her to answer the impeachment charges. READ: Solons ask Senate to order VP Duterte to answer the impeachment raps We are of the opinion, that [] assuming first the summons would be delivered to the good Vice President.. that would be through personal summons or substitute, the Vice President, if she would still be abroad, can still file her answer and just approach the nearest consulate to have it apostilled, Gutierrez said. She would have to answer it.. it would be a formal filing with the court through the consulate. Thats one opinion that we have, although the ideal [thing] would still be that, personally, she would return to the Philippines to file her answer before the court, he added. Libanan who Gutierrez announced as the teams lead prosecutor agreed, saying that Duterte could respond to the order, if issued by the Senate, within 10 days of receipt. If the Senate listens to our request, our Vice President will be required to answer the articles of impeachment. This means the summons will be served to her. What does that mean? It means they will be informed formally of the cases, as while she may have heard of it through news and social media, it was unofficial. So the charges that she would face would be mentioned, and she will be asked to respond in a non-extendable period of 10 days, Libanan said in Filipino. So that can be submitted to her office or delivered to her residence. Now, once she receives that, of course they would call her. Her choices, as Congressman Gutierrez mentioned, is that she can respond by going home and answering in writing each allegation, or she can visit our consulate in the Netherlands, where she can execute her answer, he added. Duterte is currently in The Hague, Netherlands to assist her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who is under the custody of the International Criminal Court. The older Duterte is facing crimes against humanity charges for his administrations drug war that left thousands dead. According to Gutierrez, Vice President Dutertes potential situation can be likened to her familys ally, former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, who in December 2024 submitted a counter-affidavit for the qualified human trafficking complaints filed against him while he was in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The human trafficking complaints stemmed from Roques alleged involvement in Lucky South 99, the Philippine offshore gaming operator hub in Porac, Pampanga, that was raided last June 2024 for being a human trafficking den. In the same way, if to make it more common knowledge, yong pagsagot rin po ni attorney Harry Roque, ginawa niya rin po yon abroad po no, so in the same manner it could be done po, Gutierrez noted. Earlier, Gutierrez and Libanan submitted a motion asking the Senate to issue a summons against Duterte. According to Libanan, the entire prosecution team signed the motion as early as March 14, but they refrained from submitting it to the Senate as the session was in recess. They eventually submitted the motion as they took the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing on former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest as an indication that the chamber is still working despite Congress being on a break. In the motion, the prosecution panel cited Rule VII of the Rules of Procedure on Impeachment Trials dated March 23, 2011, which states that a writ of summons should be issued against the official impeached by the House. The prosecution team said the impeachment rules are still applicable since there was a provision stating that it will be in force until it is amended or repealed. Duterte wasimpeachedby the House last February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourthimpeachmentcomplaint, hinged on several issues like the alleged confidential fund misuse, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a Vice President. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP SaraDuterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5 which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. Senate President Francis Escudero has said that the trial would start by July 30 with the new set of lawmakers after the 2025 midterm elections sitting as senator-judges. Several members of the prosecution team previously said that while they respect the Senates stand on the matter, they believe that the impeachment trial should start at the soonest possible time to avoid dangers, like possible tampering of evidence and threatening of witnesses.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046744/vp-sara-can-answer-impeach-raps-by-going-home-or-via-the-consulate,others

"Ombudsman suspends Marikina City mayor, other city officials","MANILA, Philippines The Office of the Ombudsman has ordered a six-month preventive suspension against Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro and other city officials over the alleged misallocation of P130 million Philippine Health Insurance Corporation funds. In an order dated March 21 but only released to media on Tuesday, the Ombudsman likewise ordered the suspension of City Accountant Erlinda Gutierrez Gonzales, City Treasurer Nerissa Calvez San Miguel, and Assistant City Budget Officer Jason Rodriguez Nepomuceno, as well as Sangguniang Panlungsod Secretary Noralyn Tingcungco and the following Sangguniang Panlungsod members: Vice Mayor Marion S. Andres Angelito R. Nunez Joseph B. Banzon Donn Carlo B. Favis Loreto F. Tolentino, Jr. Serafin Y. Bernardino Carl Eli F. Africa Cloyd S. Casimiro Marife T. Dayao Levy D. De Guzman Romina Kate N. De Guzman Samuel S. Ferriol Hilario A. Punzalan Manuel E. Sarmiento Based on the document, the Ombudsman said it found sufficient grounds to issue a preventive suspension against Teodoro and others, considering there is a strong evidence showing their guilt. In August 2024, a copy of a complaint filed by Marikina resident Sofronio Dulay on May 15 of the same year, was released to the media. In the complaint, Dulay filed a criminal complaint for violation of Article 220 of the Revised Penal Code and an administrative case for grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service against Teodoro, Gonzales, San Miguel, and Nepomuceno. The four were accused of misusing PhilHealth payments meant for health system improvements under the Universal Health Care Act. Dulays complaint disclosed that Teodoro and the others passed City Ordinance No. 066, Series of 2023, and City Ordinance No. 002, Series of 2024, which allocates P130 million to various budgetary items in Marikina. The complainant claimed that the four reportedly allocated the money on IT equipment, repair and maintenance of infrastructure and/or donations, amounting to P35,250,000, while the remaining P94,750,000 were used for other supplies and materials expense. However, Dulay noted that the passage of the city ordinances mentioned above violated the provision of Republic Act 11223 or the Universal Health Care Act. In defense, the four submitted a joint counter-affidavit in July 2024 wherein they strongly deny all the allegations in the complaint as nothing but a mere product of misapprehension and misunderstanding of the facts concerning the P130 million PhilHealth reimbursement received by Marikina City. Teodoro and the others claimed that elements of technical malversation under Article 220 of the RPC are not present in the case. In response, the Ombudsman disclosed that Commission on Audit issued the Marikina City Special Health Fund Fraud Audit Report, which was only obtained by Dulay in February of this year. The key findings of the SHF Fraud Audit include: Confirmation of Diversion substantial amounts from the SHF were expended on items outside the intended scope of health programs with itemization of transactions funded by the PhilHealth reimbursements and matching them to the enabling Ordinance Nos. 066-2023 and 002-2024; Non-Compliance with Law the expenditures lacked legal basis and flagging them as irregular or unauthorized use of public funds; and Evidence of Misconduct clear audit trail linking the decisions and approvals made by respondents to the resulting improper disbursements, the order reads. Clearly, there is no legal justification for the diversion of the SHF. The diverted expenditures were not emergencies related to health, nor transfers to another health program. Said acts fall under the crime of Technical Malversation , it adds. Following the issuance of the preventive suspension against the mayor and others, Teodoro issued a statement, saying that he believes the order against him is politically motivated and part of a broader effort to derail [his] candidacy in the May 12, 2025, midterm election.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046769/marikina-mayor-other-city-officials-slapped-with-preventive-suspension,others

"Abante tells vloggers: After apology, stop spreading lies","MANILA, Philippines While some social media personalities have already apologized for spreading false information, Manila 6th District Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr. said this is not enough as they must stop spreading lies. Abante on Monday said the social media personalities who apologized before the House of Representatives tri-committee probing fake news should use their platforms to correct the misconceptions they promoted. At least three resource persons apologized during Fridays hearing: MJ Quiambao Reyes, Krizette Laureta Chu, and Mark Lopez. These apologies are a start, but they are not enough. If these vloggers are truly sincere, they must stop spreading lies and start presenting the truth not their so-called truth, but the real, honest-to-God truth, Abante said. If they are truly sorry, they should use their platforms now to correct the misconceptions they promoted. Say what is true. When you have a large platform, you also carry a huge responsibility. You cannot just post anything for likes or views and expect to walk away from the consequences, he added. They admitted they had no documentation, no solid evidence and that they were relying on posts online. These were red flags. This tells us that this wasnt journalism, it was propaganda. Last Friday, the tri-committee resumed its probe into misinformation and disinformation on social media. Reyes apologized to Abante for claiming that extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administrations drug war were a hoax, and that those who criticized former President Rodrigo Duterte were funded by drug cartels, terrorists, and corrupt politicians. Chu, a journalist who maintains a political blog, was asked by Abante if she was willing to apologize or clarify her claims that many police officers were about to resign after the International Criminal Court took custody of Duterte. Abantes question came after Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation Detection Group chief Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III clarified that there was no mass resignation among police officers, prompting lawmakers to ask Chu where she got her information. Chu promised to write about this clarification from the PNP. READ: Vloggers apologize to lawmakers for spreading false claims Lopez, meanwhile, apologized to Deputy Speaker David Suarez and Surigao del Sur 2nd District Rep. Johnny Pimentel for claiming that the Philippines also fired water cannonsagainstforeign ships in the West Philippine Sea, supposedly just like China does. READ: Blogger apologizes for claiming PH uses water cannons in WPS Abante also said claims regarding sensitive issues, like alleged human rights violations, must be based on evidence and facts, as making statements without bases is irresponsible. You cannot hide behind the phrase my truth when talking about human rights violations. Truth is not subjective. It must be based on facts and evidence, he said. Calling the EJKs a massive hoax is not just irresponsible, it is an insult to the victims, to the grieving families, and to the institutions, such as the House and the Commission on Human Rights, that investigated these crimes, he added. According to Reyes, her allegations that EJKs are not true were based on the claims of former President Rodrigo Dutertes supporters, that a woman lied about her son dying during the drug war. After Reyes cited newspaper reports, Abantes co-chairperson in the quad committee, Abang Lingkod party-list Rep. Joseph Stephen Paduano, asked the vlogger if she had actual copies of the documents instead of merely relying on articles. In the end, Reyes admitted that she does not have any document proving that EJKs were a hoax. READ: Vlogger says EJKs a hoax, but fails to present documentary evidence The tri-committee has been tasked to probe the spread of disinformation online after several resolutions were filed and privilege speeches about the matter were delivered. Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Robert Ace Barbers was one of the lawmakers who delivered a privilege speech following rumors about him and the other chairpersons of the Houses quad committee. During that time, the quad committee was probing illegal activities in Philippine offshore gaming operators, the illicit drug trade, and EJks in the Duterte administrations drug war. Studies have shown that Filipinos, one of the more prevalent social media and internet users across the globe, are susceptible to misinformation and disinformation. Just recently, House lawmakers called out fake news spreading on social media after the International Criminal Court took custody of Duterte. Some Duterte supporters have shared social media posts stating that the Supreme Court received a petition containing 16 million signatures, asking President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to step down from office. The Supreme Court said they have not received any document.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046393/abante-tells-vloggers-after-apology-stop-spreading-lies,others
Pagadian City LGU opens dialysis center,"PAGADIAN CITY Charles Rosal II, 69, a resident of Barangay Kagawasan in this city, has been undergoing dialysis three times a week for four years.

The procedure is being offered to patients who are city residents free of charge and with accompanying medicines. Rosal said the city government-owned facility had been a relief for patients like him. Before, he was able to afford the high cost of the dialysis procedure only because his children helped defray the cost. Now city residents can avail of the procedure for free. Dr. Debbylene Tan-Ildefonso, city health officer, said the local government initially procured two units of dialysis machines to service patients who live in the city. The facility could cater to at least six patients daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. We understand that dialysis is more than a treatment, it is an essential part of life for many individuals who need the procedure regularly, Tan said. Pagadian City Mayor Samuel Co said it took almost two years for the city government to procure the equipment and complete all the requirementsfor a license to operate a dialysis center. While they can only cater to six patients a day now, the city government plansto increase its personnel at the facility and adjust the working hours to cater to more patients daily. He explained thatpriorities would be given to city residents,who can avail of the sessions andmedicines for free. Basta sa Pagadian libre tanan ,Co said. The local government also expressed willingness to allocate additional budget if they felt the need for more machines, Co said.

Escudero on Marcos siblings misunderstanding: Not surprising,"MANILA, Philippines Its no longer surprising for Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero if political families have misunderstandings prior to elections.

He also emphasized that his administration did not cooperate with the ICC regarding Dutertes case. The president previously declared that his administration would not lift a finger to help the ICC.

"Borongan City market vendors, tricycle drivers go cashless","TACLOBAN CITY Borongan City in Eastern Samar has become the first in Eastern Visayas to implement cashless transactions among market vendors and tricycle drivers. The launch of the PalengQR PH Plus program on March 19, an initiative of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and the Department of the Interior and Local Government , makes payments faster, safer, and more convenient for both consumers and service providers. The program also aims to promote financial inclusion by providing small businesses and transport operators access to secure and efficient digital payment solutions. Mayor Jose Ivan Dayan Agda welcomed the program, emphasizing that it was provided to Borongan free of charge by the BSP. Its a game changer for our entrepreneurs. They can now track their sales and inventories more efficiently, while also eliminating pilferage. This could lead to better management and higher profits, Agda said in a phone interview on Friday, March 21. This system will benefit not just vendors and tricycle drivers but also everyday consumers, allowing them to enjoy the ease and security of cashless transactions, he added. Agda said the cashless system would also be extended to other small entrepreneurs in the city, including street food vendors such as those selling barbecue. As of now, about 200 market vendors in Borongan have signed up for the program, marking a significant step toward digital transformation in the city. The cashless transactions align with Borongan Citys goal of becoming a smart city where most financial transactions are conducted digitally or online. During the launch, Victorio Tingcang III, BSP Tacloban branch area director, highlighted the key benefits of PalengQR PH Plus. We no longer need to carry physical money because we can now pay the exact amount using QR PH. This helps prevent virus transmission from handling cash and protects people from counterfeit bills. QR PH is an efficient system that saves time and transportation costs since transactions can be completed remotely via mobile phones, Tingcang explained. The PalengQR PH Plus system enables small businesses, market vendors, and tricycle drivers to integrate digital payments into daily operations, reducing reliance on cash transactions and improving financial security. To encourage participation, financial service providers such as GCash, Maya, BanKo by BPI, Landbank, and Chinabank set up on-site booths during the program launch. These institutions assisted attendees in creating digital wallets, allowing them to take advantage of cashless payment options immediately. The PalengQR PH Plus program is part of BSPs broader initiative to promote financial inclusion and digitalization in the country. Launched in 2022 in partnership with the DILG, the system enables businesses, vendors, and transport operators to accept digital payments via QR codes, which customers can scan using mobile wallets and online banking apps. Among the key benefits of the program are enhanced security as it reduces risks of theft and counterfeit money; convenience as it speeds up transactions and eliminates the need for exact change; financial inclusion as it expands digital payment access to small businesses and informal workers; and business growth as it boosts economic activity by streamlining payments. BSP records show that there are 169 local governments across the Philippines implementing or preparing to roll out PalengQR PH Plus as of Feb. 22, 2025. Of the number, 30 localities are in the Visayas.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046705/borongan-city-market-vendors-tricycle-drivers-go-cashless,others

Bayan Muna seeks transparency on fuel costs anew as oil price hike looms,"MANILA, Philippines Bayan Muna partylist has urged the Department of Energy to implement the unbundling of fuel costs as another oil price hike looms. In a statement on Monday, former Bayan Muna lawmaker Carlos Zarate said the DOE should implement clear guidelines for oil price unbundling, or the publication of reasons for the price increases and their exact contribution to a fuels cost per liter. Its already March 2025, as oil companies announce another round of price increases, the unbundling of oil prices is yet to be seen, Zarate said. The price of fuel in gas stations consists of international price, local cost, and net profit. Oil companies do not unbundle and divulge the details of their local cost, making it difficult for the public to see their overcharges in price per liter here. Congress should fast track House Bill 3004 so that consumers would finally see the oil pricing processes, he added. Oil companies announced that they would increase per liter the prices of gasoline by P1.10, while diesel and kerosene would spike by P0.40. While a rollback was implemented last week, since the start of 2025, prices of gasoline have increased by P2.15 per liter, and diesel by P2.85 per liter. READ: Gasoline, diesel, kerosene prices up this week According to Zarate, other companies in the energy sector have already unbundled their prices, like Manila Electric Company , but oil firms have kept their pricing a secret. But for oil products, it has not been done; thats why its easy to overcharge once the international price increases, he said in Filipino. There have been several oil price increases but the governments action has been left behind. The DOE appears to be acting more like spokespersons of oil companies rather than regulators protecting public interest, he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Zarate also said that under Republic Act No. 8479 or the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998, the DOE can investigate oil industry practices. In July 2024, the Supreme Court rejected the petition of oil companies to block the DOE from implementing a 2019 directive that requires firms to unbundle or disclose detailed price adjustments. In the 24-page decision penned by Associate Justice Ramon Hernando, the high tribunal found it hard to believe that oil prices were arbitrarily set without any basis. Verily, there is a systematic calculation or process on how they set their prices, and it is such information that the DOE needs to collect in order for it to accomplish its mandate under Republic Act No. 8479, it said. READ: SC junks oil firms bid vs govt order to detail their pricing Zarate said it is puzzling why the government still does not move to know the actual cost of fuel products. For more than 20 years after the oil deregulation law, the government does not know the actual cost of fuel and is therefore not capable of determining predatory pricing or overpricing. This is the tragic folly of deregulation, he said. Nobody knows what PHP60.00 per liter consists of and how much profit is imposed. The oil companies must inform DOE and the public of their actual costs from refining, storage, transportation, to operating expenses. Transparency is crucial, especially now when every centavo counts in the shrinking budget of consumers, he added. This is not the first time that Zarate and Bayan Muna called for government intervention on price hikes. In 2019, Zarate called for the unbundling of data on oil prices as they feared that attacks on two major oil sites in Saudi Arabia may be used to justify high price hikes. READ: Bayan Muna wants oil price data unbundled amid Saudi oil sites attack Zarate reiterated this call in June 2021, as during that time, gasoline prices rose by P11.75 per liter since the year started, followed by diesel at P9.90 per liter, and kerosene at P8.41 per liter.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046425/bayan-muna-seeks-transparency-on-fuel-costs-anew-as-oil-price-hike-looms,others

"DILG recognizes Ombudsmans suspension order vs Marikina mayor, others","MANILA, Philippines The Department of the Interior and Local Government has recognized the suspension order issued by the Office of the Ombudsman against Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro and other city officials in connection with the alleged misallocation of P130 million in Philippine Health Insurance Corporation funds. In a letter addressed to the Marikina City local government on Wednesday, the DILG said it had already received a copy of the order from the Ombudsman dated March 21. The Department formally recognizes the order of preventive suspension issued by the Office of the Ombudsman. In compliance with the rule of law, we urge adherence to said order to uphold the integrity of administrative processes within your local government, the letter signed by Atty. Romeo Benitez, DILG legal and legislative affairs undersecretary, stated. In light of the situation, the Department also affirms its commitment to ensuring that the rules on succession in cases of temporary vacancies within local government positions are properly operationalized in accordance with Administrative Order No. 15 and DILG MC No. 2019-21, it adds. The AO authorizes the DILG chief to fill temporary vacancies in certain local elective offices to prevent hiatus in and paralysis of local government operations. Meanwhile, the DILG circular outlines operational guidelines and rules in the implementing Administrative Order No. 15, Series of 2018, regarding the process, requirements, and procedures for filling temporary vacancies in the Sangguniang barangay. We trust that all local officials, as well as city employees, will adhere to the prescribed procedures in the interest of maintaining good governance and stability in the local government, the letter further said.

Iloilo on alert against leptospirosis,"ILOILO CITY Despite a drop in reported leptospirosis cases this year, authorities in Iloilo remain vigilant against the disease which is mostly tied to farmers, laborers, and individuals working in flood-prone areas. With the rainy season approaching, health officials warned that without proper preventive measures, the numbers could increase once again. Last March 7, a 30-year-old farmer from Sara town, Iloilo became the provinces first fatality from the disease in 2025, raising fresh concerns over exposure risks for agricultural workers. READ: PhilHealth: Leptospirosis, dengue hospital bills covered The Iloilo Provincial Health Office confirmed that the farmer died from complications related to leptospirosis while being treated at a district hospital. Dr. Rodney Labis, head of the PHOs health service delivery division, said authorities were still investigating where and how the victim contracted the infection, given the high-risk nature of his occupation. Our disease surveillance officers are still conducting further investigations to determine the details surrounding the patients death and whether the exposure came from farming or other activities, Labis said in a statement on March 20. From January 1 to March 15, Iloilo recorded 25 leptospirosis cases across 16 municipalities, marking a 24-percent drop from last years 33 cases during the same period. Labis noted that based on the data, the most affected age group is 30 years and above, with the majority being farmers and laborers, who are primarily exposed to agriculture. Municipalities with the highest case counts are Dumangas , San Miguel , Pototan , Maasin , Badiangan , Alimodian , Estancia , and Passi City . Oton, Pavia, Leganes, Janiuay, Leon, Batad, Lambunao, and Sara each reported one case. Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection spread through water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected rodents. The bacteria enter the body through cuts, wounds, or mucous membranes, making floodwaters, rice paddies, irrigation canals, and stagnant water sources key transmission points. Symptoms usually appear two to 30 days after exposure, with early signs such as fever, chills, muscle pain, and headaches. Severe cases can lead to jaundice, kidney, and liver failure, and even death. Warning signs of advanced infection include yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark or reduced urine output, and difficulty urinating, which indicate potential organ damage. To reduce the risk of infection, the PHO advises residentsespecially farmers and those working in flood-prone areasto avoid wading through floodwaters, rice fields, and contaminated water sources; and wearing protective gear such as boots and gloves when working in high-risk areas. It also encouraged people to wash hands and exposed body parts thoroughly with soap and clean water after possible exposure and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms appear. The PHO also offers free prophylactic medication at local health centers. Residents who believe they may have been exposed are encouraged to consult Barangay Health Workers or Rural Health Units for guidance.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2046661/iloilo-on-alert-against-leptospirosis,others

Feeding the problem: Junk food ads target Filipino kids,"MANILA, PhilippinesEvery day, Filipino children are exposed to a constant stream of ads promoting donuts, soft drinks, fried chicken, instant noodles, and chocolate-covered treats. These arent just commercials theyre integrated into the videos they watch, the influencers they follow, and the digital playgrounds they inhabit for hours at a time. Innocent as it may seem, this exposure is fueling a growing public health crisis. A landmark study by Unicef reveals that children in the Philippines are being aggressively targeted by marketing for unhealthy food products many of which are high in sugar, salt, and fat disguised as fun, family-friendly, or even nutritious. What children see online is shaping what they crave, ask for, and eat and its happening long before they can tell the difference between an ad and entertainment. Eight-year-old Kevin, who enjoys donuts and soft drinks, puts it simply: I bought this food because I saw it on TV. In March 2021, Unicef released a study on unhealthy food marketing in Philippine digital media. Its findings are stark: 99 percent of social media marketing posts analyzed were not suitable for marketing to children, based on World Health Organization criteria. Of 1,035 ads assessed from top Filipino food brands on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, only eight met health standards. And yet, the same study found that 72 percent of posts appealed to children, and an even higher 84 percent to teenagers. The platforms where these ads appear Facebook, YouTube, Instagram are where Filipino children spend a huge part of their day. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, over 70 percent of surveyed children said they were online for 6 to 12 hours a day. Research shows that digital food marketing develops emotional associations with products to increase their appeal, ultimately shaping childrens food preferences, requests, and eating habits, according to the Unicef study co-authored by Dr. Emma Boyland and Dr. Mimi Tatlow-Golden. READ: Junk food promotion is a staple of kidfluencer videos on YouTubestudy Even Nadyn Evalles, a mother of five and a health teacher who makes a conscious effort to serve fruits and home-cooked meals, admits the advertising is nearly impossible to escape. Due to social media, my children crave this fast food. These are enticing in childrens eyes, so sometimes I give them what they want, Evalles told Unicef. Food brands dont just show food they tell stories. The ads analyzed in the study were saturated with themes that struck emotional chords: fun, taste, family bonding, celebrations, and even health and fitness. Even when the food was high in sugar, salt, or fat like instant noodles, sweetened yogurt drinks, or processed cheese ads presented them as wholesome family moments or energizing snacks for active kids. One milk drink brand featured a montage of kids doing home workouts during lockdown. A cheese product was paired with a sports-loving family. These techniques amount to what researchers call health-washing: using the imagery of physical activity to suggest health benefits from nutritionally poor food. Research shows that children form emotional bonds with food brands early on often before they even develop the ability to understand advertising. These associations, the Unicef study notes, develop through the childhood years and persist into adulthood. The study also exposed the significant role of influencers and celebrities many of them children or teens themselves in promoting unhealthy food products. One in five posts appealing to young audiences featured local stars: dancers, vloggers, and athletes. Among the most influential was 15-year-old YouTube star Niana Guerrero, whose videos often include food content and rack up millions of views. Influencers dont just advertise food they make it feel like part of everyday life. The Unicef study found that children often form close, friendship-like bonds with these online personalities, viewing them as more authentic than traditional celebrities. When influencers eat fast food or take on food challenges with siblings or friends, the content doesnt register as advertising for many young viewers. One child from Cebu shared how persuasive this content can be: I ask mama to buy the Nissin noodles I saw [on] the internet next time we go to the grocery, said a six-year-old participant. These personalities attract millions of views and with them, millions of marketing impressions that feel more like fun than persuasion. Beyond brand exposure, Filipino children are absorbing what experts call an advertised diet a media-shaped idea of what food is supposed to be: indulgent, exciting, and emotionally rewarding. [A]lmost entirely unhealthy advertised diet is promoted to children and families, creating emotional associations of fun, love, sharing and health with these foods, and draws on the star power of local sporting and media celebrities, the study noted. This dynamic is most visible on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, where popular Filipino influencers many of them teens or younger routinely feature food in their content. The most engaging videos often revolve around mukbangs, food hacks, and playful food challenges, showcasing products like gummy candies, chocolate spreads, instant noodles, and cookie-flavored cereals. These seemingly harmless clips are, in fact, a central part of how the advertised diet takes root. They present unhealthy food as a source of fun, laughter, and bonding whether between siblings, friends, or idols and fans. Over time, repeated exposure to this kind of content does more than entertain. It rewires childrens food preferences, nudging them to associate pleasure and belonging with foods that are, in reality, detrimental to their health. The latest national data shows a worrisome trend: obesity among Filipino adolescents rose from 11.6 percent in 2018 to 13 percent in 2021 about 1 in every 8 teens. Among younger children aged 5-10, the obesity rate has doubled since 2003. READ: Childhood obesity Experts are clear: the explosion of digital food marketing is part of a larger obesogenic system an environment that promotes unhealthy eating and sedentary behavior. READ: Obesitys heavy toll: Millions of Filipinos now at greater health risks Currently, the responsibility of regulating food marketing to children in the Philippines still falls largely on the food industry itself, with companies setting and following their own standards. While families are often blamed, Unicef Philippines stresses that its the food environment not parenting that needs to change. The food industry plays a critical role in ensuring that children grow up with healthier food preferences, said Unicef Philippines acting representative Behzad Noubary. We must work hand-in-hand in rethinking how food is produced, marketed, and made available to create an environment where nutritious options are within reach for every child, everywhere, he added. Unicef is calling for urgent, multi-sectoral action. Among their recommendations: For now, the responsibility often falls on families to push back against a system stacked against them. Parents and other caregivers are the first line of defense against an unhealthy diet. Getting the proper vitamins and minerals begins even before childbirth. A mother who eats right can start to influence a babys preferences, as well as the nutritional status upon birth, Unicef explained. Later on, with young children and teens, parents and caregivers should instill a healthy and active lifestyle, which doesnt have to be expensive. Encouraging outdoor activity, eating fruits , and becoming more selective when choosing snacks could be some simple ways to switch from junk food and build healthier eating habits, it added. When purchasing food, Evalles, despite occasional requests from her children, told Unicef: I base it on the nutritional facts, if it will help the development of my child. The cost of inaction will be steep not just in long-term healthcare spending, but in the everyday well-being of an entire generation. If no action is taken, overall rates of overweight and obesity will continue to rise. It is projected that more than 30 [percent] of Filipino adolescents will be overweight and obese by 2030, said Unicef. Whats at stake isnt just what Filipino children eat today its what they grow up believing food is for. Graphics by Ed Lustan/Inquirer.net.

SC affirms graft conviction of former Pagsanjan Mayor ER Ejercito,"MANILA, Philippines The Supreme Court has upheld the graft conviction of former Pagsanjan Mayor Emilio Ramon ER Ejercito amid the illegal insurance deal he approved as mayor in 2008. In a 16-page decision, the SC First Decision affirmed that Ejercito and Marilyn Brue, owner of First Rapids Care Ventures , guilty of violating Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Both were sentenced to up to eight years in prison and permanently banned from holding public office. The case stemmed from a complaint filed by the United Boatmen Association of Pagsanjan , accusing Ejercito and other local officials of awarding a contract to FRCV without public bidding. Charges were filed against them by the Office of the Ombudsman before the Sandiganbayan, where Ejercito, Bruel, and several council membersexcluding the vice mayorwere convicted. Ejercito then elevated the case to the SC, arguing that the FRCV was just a qualified service provider that public bidding was unnecessary; while Bruel, claimed that the contract was for special services, not insurance. READ: No anomaly in insurance deal, says ex-governor But the SC in its decision disagreed, ruling that the contract was for insurance and therefore classified as goods requiring public bidding under the Government Procurement Reform Act. The SC found that Ejercito knowingly gave FRCV an unfair advantage, bypassing legal procedures and ignoring clear red flags. FRCV lacked a Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission, and was registered with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bureau of Internal Revenue just five days before it offered its services to Ejercito. These suggest that FRCV was created solely to provide specialized services to the Municipality of Pagsanjan despite having no prior experience. By purposely sparing FRCV from the rigors of the processes under the procurement law and consciously turning a blind eye to irregularities, [Ejercito] gave it unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference, the decision read. Under Republic Act 3019 public officers are prohibited from unfairly favoring private parties by granting them special benefits, advantages, or preferences through bias, bad faith, or serious negligence. Due to this, Bruel was found guilty of misrepresenting FRCVs qualifications and conspiring with Ejercito to secure the contract, falsely claiming that FRCV could provide the required services, even though its BIR registration listed it as a computer Business. Meanwhile, the SC acquitted the Sangguniang Bayan members due to a lack of evidence that they showed favoritism toward FRCV.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2047286/sc-affirms-graft-conviction-of-former-pagsanjan-mayor-er-ejercito,others

"Rice tariff cut to blame for drop in palay prices, says farmers group","MANILA, Philippines A farmers group on Wednesday said that the low import tariffs should be blamed for the decline in palay prices during the dry season harvest. The Federation of Free Farmers pointed out the drop in international prices by the first quarter of March. Palay traders are probably anticipating that the prices of imported rice will continue to fall, so they are playing safe by buying low from farmers, said FFF Board Chairman and MAGSASAKA Party-list first nominee Leonardo Montemayor in a statement. READ: Philippines seen to reduce rice imports this year The Department of Agriculture recorded 641,000 metric tons of rice imports from January to mid-March 2025, significantly lower than the 1.2 MT recorded in the first quarter of 2024. President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. signed Executive Order No. 62 in June 2024, implementing a tariff cut from 35% to 15% on rice and other agricultural products. The FFF also urged the DA to address the decline in palay prices, emphasizing that the it should not deny reports of low palay prices and suicide committed by some farmers. The DA on Monday said that they have to validate reports from the group that three farmers took their own lives due to low palay farmgate prices and over-importation of rice. It is sad that the DA, instead of commiserating with the plight of farmers, has blamed them for allegedly spreading fake news, Montemayor added.

Escudero confident SolGen can justify legality of 2025 budget,"MANILA, Philippines The Senate, through Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, will be able to justify the legality of the 2025 national budget before the Supreme Court. Speaking at a Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum on Wednesday, Senate President Francis Escudero said he was confident of this. To explain the reason behind his stand, he said in a mix of English and Filipino: The bicam report is clear. We authorized the finance committee and appropriations committee to fill in any gaps, to make any corrections given that the budget bill consists of over 200,000 lines. And not because there are blanks we will return to the bicam. READ: SolGen seeks dismissal of SC petition vs 2025 budget So that authority was given within the parameters of the delegated authority given by the bicam to the respective House and Senate committee, he added. According to Escudero, the Supreme Courts goal is not to infringe upon the power of Congress to settle the national funding but to ensure that the process was done right. Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo earlier confirmed that there were blank items in the bicameral conference committee report on the 2025 national budget, but she clarified these were only for the final computation of the amendments made. In relation to this, Davao Rep. Isidro Ungab and former Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez filed a petition before the Supreme Court questioning the alleged blank items in the 2025 budget plan. For his part, Escudero said oral arguments on the legality of the 2025 national funding were scheduled for April 1.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2047040/escudero-confident-solgen-can-justify-legality-of-2025-budget,others

DILG names Rommel Acua as acting Marikina City mayor,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of the Interior and Local Government has appointed Sangguniang Panlungsod member Rommel Acuna to assume the post of acting mayor of Marikina City after the Office of the Ombudsman ordered the p reventive suspension of Mayor Marcelino Teodoro and other city officials. In a directive on Wednesday, DILG chief Jonvic Remulla enjoined Acua to perform his duties as acting mayor to prevent paralysis in government operations. You are hereby directed to assume as Acting Mayor of Marikina City, as the highest ranking Sangguniang Panlungsod Member, to fill the temporary vacancy in the said position caused by the six-month preventive suspension imposed by the Office of the Ombudsman against the appointive and elective officials of Marikina City, the document reads. Among the officials preventively suspended are the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and 13 Sangguniang Panlungsod Members. You are therefore enjoined to immediately perform the duties and functions of the Mayor in order to prevent paralysis in government operations, it adds. The DILG earlier recognized the suspension order issued to Teodoro and other city officials in connection with the alleged misallocation of P130 million in Philippine Health Insurance Corporation funds. In response, Teodoro branded the order issued against him as a broader effort to derail his candidacy in the upcoming elections and a desperate attempt to besmirch his name. I strongly believe that the preventive suspension issued against me is politically motivated and part of a broader effort to derail my candidacy in the May 12, 2025, midterm election. I am a casualty of political persecution, plain and simple, the mayor said in a statement on Tuesday. In a desperate attempt to besmirch my name, theyve filed numerous trumped-up charges against me before the Ombudsman, COA , Comelec (Commission on Elections, Civil Service, and other government agencies, he added.

Not illegal for DOH chief to pose with tobacco execs Palace,"MANILA, Philippines Undersecretary Claire Castro of the Presidential Communications Office PCO) defended on Wednesday Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa for posing for a photo with tobacco industry executives during a turnover ceremony for mobile laboratory clinics and a water station in Malacaang. At a press briefing on Wednesday, Castro said that merely posing for photos was not illegal. If the DOH [Department of Health] did not accept a donation from the tobacco company, we do not see any violation of any law, Castro said in Filipino. Even if he participated in a photo opportunity, it does not necessarily mean that hes violating any law, she added. READ: Anti-smoking advocates hit Herbosa for accepting mobile laboratory clinics Herbosa faced criticism from the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance for posing for photographs with some executives of Philip Morris Fortune Tobacco Co. The company donated mobile laboratory clinics and a water station to the Department of Social Welfare and Development on March 20, and Herbosa was present at the event. SEATCA Executive Director Dr. Ulysses Dorotheo slammed Herbosas action, saying it undermined his credibility. Worse than the hypocrisy of the tobacco industry is the lack of integrity of the Secretary of Health attending this event and posing happily for a group photo, trading public health principles and ethics for political convenience, violating CSC-DOH JMC 2010-01, Dorotheo said in a Facebook post last March 23. I consider Sec. Ted Herbosa a colleague and mentor, but I do not mince my words when I say he has lost all credibility. The Philippines, under this government, does NOT deserve to lead the World Health Assembly. This 3rd Sunday of Lent, let us pray for credible, ethical leadership, he added. CSC-DOH JMC 2010-01 prohibits government officials from unnecessary interactions or accepting donations from the tobacco industry. During Wednesdays briefing, Castro maintained that government agencies could accept donations as long as it would not violate any law. Kung may pagkakataon po na nagbibgay ng donasyon ang sino man po at itoy ikabubuti ng pamahalaan, basta walang violation ng ano mang rule o batas, hindi naman tayo tatanggi sa ano mang tulong, she said. If theres a donation being given and this is for the good of government, as long as theres no violation of the law or rules, we will not decline any form of help, she said. Aside from Dorotheo, health advocate Dr. Anthony Leachon condemned Herbosas action and called it a lapse in judgment. Health Secretary Ted Herbosa, the very person entrusted to defend our nations health, stood smiling beside executives of a tobacco company, an industry that has claimed the lives of millions. This is not just a lapse in judgment. This is a deliberate act that spits in the face of every Filipino who has lost a father, a mother, a brother, or a sister to tobacco-related illnesses, he said in a Facebook post last March 25. It is an insult to every doctor, nurse, and healthcare worker fighting daily against lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory failure caused by cigarette smoking, he added.

DepEd recovers funds from schools with voucher program issues,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Education has already begun recovering funds from private schools involved in the irregularities found in the Senior High School Voucher Program from 2021 to 2023.

Escudero wont summon Duterte on impeach raps: It cant legally be done,"MANILA, Philippines Requiring Vice President Sara Duterte to answer the impeachment case against her cannot be done legally while Congress is on break, Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero said on Wednesday. Escudero made the statement at the weekly Kapihan sa Manila Bay. His remark is in response to the position of House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan, who is leading the 11-man prosecution team in the impeachment trial of Duterte. Libanan and 1-Rider Party-list Rep. Ramon Rodrigo Gutierrez personally filed an Entry with Motion to Issue Summons at the Senate on Tuesday. They are asking Escudero to require Duterte to answer the verified complaint against her. But the Senate leader said in a mix of English and Filipino, It cant legally be done. Its not allowed because the Senate is not in session. The House of Representatives transmitted to the Senate the Articles of Impeachment against Duterte on February 5, 2025, the last day of session of Congress. It will resume its sessions on June 2. That can only be done when Congress is in session. This cannot be done during recess and the difference between the two is clear when it comes to the conduct of Senate hearings, Escudero said. Theres no need to memorize that, so to speak, and he should also know that already, he added. It was an apparent reference to Libanans observation that the Senate was still able to conduct a hearing last week during the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte even if the chamber was on a break. But the Senate chief said he does not need to teach Libanan the difference between having a session and recess as they both served together in the House of Representatives. In fact, Escudero recalled that he was one of the lawmakers who wrote the rules of the House then. The Senate chief also noted that even in their motion, the impeachment prosecutors acknowledged that the writ of summon can only be issued after the presentation of Articles of Impeachment and the convening of the impeachment court. So my question is, have they already presented the Articles of Impeachment in the plenary? Has the court been convened yet? But it hasnt, right? So the writ of summons is not yet applicable, Escudero pointed out.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2047034/escudero-wont-summon-duterte-on-impeach-raps-it-cant-legally-be-done,others

"Alternative smoking methods may reduce carcinogen exposure, expert says","MANILA, Philippines A leading French oncologist said alternative smoking methods could reduce the bodys exposure to carcinogens as he pushed for harm reduction strategies in tobacco control. Professor David Khayat told the Cypriot newspaper Phileleftheros that traditional anti-smoking policies have been ineffective, citing the steady 1 billion global smokers that existed between 1990 and 2019. He argued that transitioning smokers to smoke-free alternatives could lower cancer risk. If we look closely at the statistics, we will find that in the coming years, we will have 60 million deaths worldwide due to lung cancer. Lets do something to prevent that, Khayat said. Anton Israel, president of the Nicotine Consumers Union of the Philippines, echoed this, saying that smoking, not nicotine, is the primary issue. We have achieved new smoke-free technologies that remove the harm from nicotine consumption. Products such as e-cigarettes, heated tobacco, and nicotine pouches reduce consumers exposure to carcinogens substantially, Israel said. Khayat clarified that nicotine does not cause cancer, with carcinogens stemming from the burning of tobacco. The burning of tobacco, which occurs in conventional cigarettes, produces thousands of substances. A percentage of these are carcinogenic. He said heated tobacco delivers nicotine with significantly reduced harmful substances compared to traditional cigarettes. Khayat said smoke-free technologies give the user the satisfaction that a smoker feels, but the percentage of harmful and carcinogenic substances that reach their body is reduced. He cited many scientific studies showing that the number and concentration of substances produced from smoking have to do with the high temperatures that occur during combustion. Khayat also criticized the World Health Organizations stance against harm reduction, suggesting a shift toward pragmatic solutions and warning that obesity may soon surpass smoking as a leading cancer risk factor. Khayat emphasized that harm reduction, as seen in the United Kingdom, acknowledges the difficulty of eliminating risky behaviors and aims to mitigate their effects. More than 64 percent of people who smoke and develop cancer do not quit and continue, he said. Thats why what I do and recommend now for those who dont quit smoking is to try to reduce the harm it causes. This could potentially be achieved through alternative smoking products, Khayat said. Khayat stressed the potential for alternative products to transition smokers away from cigarettes, urging for regulatory frameworks that balance access for smokers with preventing youth uptake. The goal remains smoking cessation. But because there will always be some who do not quit, we must include harm reduction in our efforts. The fewer carcinogens that enter the human body, the smaller the harm, Khayat said. He said if all smokers who do not quit smoking realize that there are better alternative options than cigarettes, and more people make the change, then we will gradually see the effects on public health. As global discussions on tobacco control intensify, tobacco harm reduction is expected to be a key topic at the upcoming WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Conference of the Parties in Geneva in November. Advocates hope that policymakers will consider real-world evidence on the benefits of reduced-risk products rather than imposing broad restrictions that could hinder smokers from accessing safer alternatives.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2047583/alternative-smoking-methods-may-reduce-carcinogen-exposure-expert-says,others

I look forward to more beneficial legislation that would highlight our unique culture without sacrificing our diversity, he added. Both passed on the final reading in 2024. SB 2797 and HB 10634 sought to bestow Pampanga such an official title and tasked mainly the Department of Tourism with promoting the provinces native dishes and delicacies. Both bills included prominent Kapampangan lawmakers as authorsSen. Lito Lapid for SB 2797 and former President and Pampanga second district Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, House Senior Deputy Speaker and Pampanga third district Rep. Aurelio Gonzales Jr., Pampanga fourth district Rep. Anna York Bondoc, and Pampanga first district Rep. Carmelo Lazatin II for HB 10634. In March 2024, the provincial government approved an ordinance that already conferred the title to Pampanga. The ordinance noted the province had a long uninterrupted reputation for being home to culinary talentsfrom the chefs who cooked for the Malolos Congress in Barasoain in 1898 to the chefs who prepared meals for the athletes of the 30th Southeast Asian Games in 2019. That month, the province also hosted an unprecedented two-day international conference on Kapampangan cuisine, complete with demos, an art exhibit, a food bazaar, and a bookfair. As to the measure approved by the House and the Senate, the enrolled copy was sent to Malacaang for the Presidents signature on Feb. 11. Under the Constitution, the President may veto a bill within 30 days upon receipt. In his two-page veto message, Mr. Marcos said he sincerely appreciated the lawmakers efforts to recognize Pampangas contributions to the countrys rich culinary history. It cannot be denied that Pampanga is celebrated for its diverse and flavorful dishes, traditional cooking methods, and a strong culture of food innovation, he said. This is consistent with the policy of the government to conserve, promote, and popularize the nations historical and cultural heritage and resources, as well as artistic creations. However, while I recognize the noble intention of the authors, I cannot ignore the concerns regarding the declarations lack of historical basis, the absence of a thorough study that shows key performance indicators for such designation, and the possibility that the bill may offend sensibilities in other provinces that are equally proud of their culinary contributions, the President said. In a press briefing, Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary and Malacaang press officer Claire Castro further explained Mr. Marcos veto. The bill is well intentioned, but it might create discrimination, Castro said. Our regions have their own cultures and excel in their own way. If one region is picked and labeled as having the most delicious dishes, some people, especially foreigners, might think that it is the only region worth visiting in the Philippines because it has the best and most mouth-watering local food, she added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045490/marcos-vetoes-bill-naming-pampanga-culinary-capital,others

DivinaLaw not part of House prosecution team in VP trial Velasco,"MANILA, Philippines House Secretary General Reginald Velasco disputed on Wednesday reports that DivinaLaw, one of the more prominent law firms in the country, was tapped by the prosecution team to help them in the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte in July. Velasco clarified this in a statement after news reports came out that the House had engaged the law firm after he visited the Senate for an ocular inspection. On private lawyers assisting the public prosecutors: Contrary to some reports, DivinaLaw is not among the private lawyers engaged by the House, Velasco said, adding: The legal team assisting our impeachment prosecutors is composed of seasoned professionals committed to ensuring that due process is followed. Velasco did not mention the news report, but the Philippine Daily Inquirer ran a story on Wednesday stating that their sources indicated that DivinaLaw would be leading the group of private prosecutors. The report said that Velasco, during his visit to the Senate as part of inspections for the trial, confirmed that the law office founded by lawyer Nilo Divina would be part of the House impeachment team, along with other private law firms. He also said the House was expected to incur minimal expenses for the private legal team since the lawyers themselves had offered their services. I dont think they will charge us their usual fees per hour because they are volunteers, he added. READ: Lawyers helping House impeach team experienced, angry Velasco also noted that the lawyers assisting the House are not angry in reaction to the Inquirer report quoting him as saying that many of the private lawyers who offered to help the House team were volunteers who are angry with the Vice President. The volunteer lawyers assisting the House impeachment team are not merely driven by anger, as some have suggested. Rather, they are dedicated to the cause of justice and public service. Many of them have extensive experience working with public prosecutors and have a deep understanding of the law, he said. Their involvement is a testament to their commitment to upholding accountability and the rule of law, he added. Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint, hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a vice president.

"Study more about VP impeachment trial, Escudero tells Ortega","MANILA, Philippines House Deputy Majority Leader Paolo Ortega should study more about the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte, especially during the session break,Senate President Francis Chiz Escudero said on Wednesday Escudero made his remark after Ortega criticized the upper chamber, saying that if it could hold hearings during recess, it should also be prepared to uphold its constitutional duty and act on the impeachment case against Duterte. According to Ortega, justice delayed is justice denied, noting that if the government wanted to maintain public trust, they need not treat anyone higher than the law. READ: Senate break not reason to defer VP impeachment trial Monsod If theres time for other issues during recess, why cant we dwell on issues that have a deeper effect on our country? The Senate has a mandate as an impeachment court, and we are expecting them to do their job without hesitation, Ortega said in Filipino. This did not sit well with Escudero, who reiterated that impeachment proceedings could not start while the Congress was not in session. I think Cong. Ortega should study pa more regarding the difference between motu propio hearings that can be done when Congress is not in session and impeachment proceedings that cannot be commenced during recess, Escudero said in a statement. Again, may I advise him and his other co-prosecutors to instead make the most out of this period and study/build their case because when we start, we will not allow any delays whatsoever, he added. Escudero said this should be the case unless Ortega would want to sabotage the impeachment case by adding yet another ground for the opposing party to question the proceedings. Perhaps he may also want to get clearer signals from the speaker who is quite satisfied and has never questioned the Senates actions, preparations, and preparedness, Escudero said. In a historic move on Feb. 5, the House impeached Duterte, garnering over 200 signatures from lawmakers. On the same day, it transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, but the upper chamber adjourned its session without tackling the document. To date, the document remains pending before the upper chamber, with Escudero saying that the actual trial would only start after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had delivered his fourth State of the Nation Address in July.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045069/study-more-about-vp-impeachment-trial-escudero-tells-ortega,others
Vloggers may face contempt if they skip House hearing anew House reps,"MANILA, Philippines Vloggers and social media personalities may be cited for contempt if they continue to skip the House of Representatives tri-committees next hearing, ranking lawmakers said on Wednesday. In a statement, Santa Rosa City Rep. Dan Fernandez said the tri-committee, like all other committees, was allowed by Congress to summon individuals to testify during inquiries in aid of legislation, and any violation of subpoenas would result in possible contempt orders. Disinformation is a national security issue. It erodes public trust, destabilizes institutions, and manipulates democratic discourse. We cannot allow social media to become a free-for-all platform for deception and propaganda, Fernandez, chairperson of the House committee on public order and safety and lead presiding officer of the tri-committee, said. Congress has the authority to summon individuals to testify on matters of public interest. Ignoring lawful orders is a direct challenge to our institution and the democratic principles we protect, he added. According to the tri-committee, the following may face contempt orders having skipped past hearings already: Aside from Fernandezs panel, the tri-committee is composed of the House committee on public information and the committee on information and communication technology. The three panels have been tasked to probe the spread of disinformation online after several resolutions were filed and different privilege speeches about the matter were delivered. READ: 40 socmed users, platform reps invited to House fake news probe Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Robert Ace Barbers was one of the lawmakers who delivered a privilege speech after fake news spread about him and the other chairpersons of the House quad committee, which was then probing illegal activities in Philippine offshore gaming operators, the illicit drug trade, and extrajudicial killings in the past administrations drug war. READ: Fighting drugs since 1995: Barbers laughs off drug lord rumors According to Barbers, a regulatory framework for social media use may need to be established, just like how mainstream media organizations and legitimate news outlets adhere to a set of ethical standards. The lawmaker reiterated, however, that the hearing was not meant to stifle free speech, but to just keep in check possible abuse of freedom of expression. I just would like to reiterate that the objective of the hearings the Tri-comm is conducting is not to suppress the freedom of expression or the freedom of speech, he said. In fact, we are all aware that this is provided for in our Constitution, and wed like to respect the right of everyone to his own opinion or to his own expression. Contrary to what others may be thinking, this is not in any way a tool to suppress their expressions or opinions on certain issues, whether they may be political or economic or even other points of views, he added. Filipinos have long been considered to be one of the if not the most prevalent social media and internet users across the globe. In a Digital 2022 report of social media management firm Hootsuite and creative agency We Are Social, Filipinos were found to have ranked second on the list of countries whose citizens spend the most time on the internet and social media an average of 6 hours and 58 minutes per day. However, heavy social media use also means that Filipinos are susceptible to misinformation and disinformation. Last May 2024, lawmakers urged the public to exercise discretion amid the spread of videos where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s voice is being mimicked to announce that the Philippines was getting ready for war against China. READ: Deepfake: PCO disowns clip of Marcos attack order vs China The PCO has already disowned the video, saying the voice there was made to sound like the president stressing that Marcos has not made such an order to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

Ombudsman suspends 8 Antique board members anew,"SAN JOSE DE BUENAVISTA, Antique The Office of the Ombudsman suspended anew eight board members of Antique, this time for one year without pay. The suspension orders were served Monday to the offices of Egidio Elio, Rony Molina, Victor Condez, Alfie Jay Niquia, Mayella Mae Plameras-Ladislao, Plaridel Sanchez IV, Kenneth Dave Gasalao and Julius Cezar Tajanlangit. The orders dated March 7 cited as reasons grave abuse of authority, grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of public officers. Ombudsman Samuel Martires approved the 18-page decision suspending the respondents for their acts of deleting the budget for three solar projects included in the proposed P1.075-billion supplemental budget in 2024. The approval is based upon the recommendation of Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer III Leilani Tagulao-Marquez and Assistant Ombudsman-Proper Pilarita Lapitan The act of respondents in giving zero funding for the three solar projects undermined the power of the LCE to exercise her or his veto power, which unquestionably amounts to grave abuse of authority and grave misconduct, read part of the decision. The Ombudsman said appropriating zero amounts to solar projects cannot be justified as a faithful performance of their sworn duty. The Department of Budget and Management states that the appropriation for an item with zero amount is not a valid appropriation because a valid appropriation must necessarily authorize the expenditure of public funds, be it P1 or more, the Ombudsman ruled. The provincial board failed to hold its regular session on Monday due to a lack of quorum. Of the eight respondents, only Elio was present but he left upon knowing of the suspension order, while four were in a convention in Manila. In August 2024, the same board members were meted out a six-month preventive suspension by the Office of the Ombudsman over their deliberate action to delay the P1.07 billion supplemental budget of the province. They were reinstated following a writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of Appeals Fourth Division on November 7 last year.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2044719/ombudsman-suspends-8-antique-board-members-anew,others
MILF central committee rejects Macacuas BARMM appointment,"MANILA, Philippines The central committee of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front has rejected the appointment of Abdulraof Macacua as the new interim chief minister of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao . The committee issued the statement on Sunday following its Consultative Assembly attended by MILF key officials, political and military leaders, religious sectors, and other Bangsamoro stakeholders. It stressed that this violates Section 2, Article XVI of the Bangsamoro Organic Law , stating that The MILF shall lead the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, without prejudice to the participation of the Moro National Liberation Front in its membership, as well as the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro. READ: Cerilles, Macacua takes oath as new leaders in Mindanao Guided by the Consultative Assemblys inputs and recommendations, the MILF Central Committee learned the agony, growing frustrations, and concerns of the attendees over the recent presidential appointments in the Bangsamoro Transition Authority , which failed to adhere strictly to the officially endorsed list of 41 nominees submitted by the MILF, the statement reads. As it stands now, only 35 out of the 41 names formally endorsed by the MILF were appointed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Clearly, this nonconformity with the list of nominees is an act [that] can be categorized as meddling into the internal affairs of MILF and directly erodes the principle of autonomy enunciated in the BOL, it added. The MILF central committee said the appointment of only 35 MILF nominees raised serious concerns about the integrity of the transition period and the commitment of the parties to the peace agreement. It is for the best interest of all that the leadership of the MILF is consulted and its decision be respected on matters of paramount importance to the Bangsamoro, the MILF stressed. It does not help that the National Government unilaterally decided to appoint a new interim Chief Minister despite the repeated sentiments of the MILF Central Committee, issued through various resolutions, to retain the then-sitting ICM, it added. Although they recognized the Presidents discretion in appointing Macacua, the committee said the stakeholders hold the view that such a decision should have taken into careful consideration the position of the MILF. The implementation of the peace agreement lies in the symbiotic partnership between the MILF and the National Government -a relationship built on trust, mutual respect, and strict adherence, to both the spirit and the letters of the signed agreements, it said. Having learned the legitimate sentiments and valid observations expressed by the attendees and various stakeholders in the said Consultative Assembly, the MILF Central Committee emphasized that it is important for the Bangsamoro people to remain united. Further, everyone was reminded to reject any attempt to sow division and pit a brother against another, it added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2044436/milf-central-committee-rejects-macacuas-barmm-appointment,others

"Local rice floods Cotabato city market, brings prices down","KIDAPAWAN CITY Rice from the recent harvest in neighboring rice-producing provinces is now flooding the mega market in this city, bringing prices down to the delight of consumers. Carmelito Bacus, president of the Grains Retailer Confederation, said local rice was already selling at P930 per 50-kilogram sack, down from the P1150 prevailing in the market barely two weeks ago. Prices of rice sold per kilo also went down to P45 and P49 here from P52 per kilo in the previous weeks. READ: Pangasinan town rolls out rice subsidy program The abundant supply of local rice is the result of the mass harvest not only in the province of Cotabato but also in neighboring provinces of Davao del Sur and South Cotabato, Bacus said. Rice farmers in these provinces harvested their crops in the last week of February and in the early weeks of March. Bacus said the rice being sold in public markets of Cotabato also came from Bukidnon and South Cotabato; and in the towns of Mlang, Tulunan, and Kabacan in this province, which also harvested their palay recently. He said the supply of lower-priced rice in the market would continue until the next harvest in June. Cheaper rice can now be easily accessed by our consumers since they can buy it anywhere in Cotabato, Bacus said. Suppliers have also assured the rice retailers association in Cotabato that there would still be a lot of buffer stocks to sustain the needs of consumers before the next harvest. Bacus also said his store had been enjoying brisk sales; disposing at least 20 sacks of local rice per day, which doubled the 10 sacks per day or even less he sold during lean times. He noted that in the past months, consumers preferred to buy rice per kilogram to buy it in bulk. Imported rice, however, continued to sell at a high price of P1250 per sack and P55 to P57 per kilo at the city mega market, Bacus said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2044783/local-rice-floods-cotabato-city-market-brings-prices-down,others

Harry Roques request for asylum wont affect his cases in PH Palace,"MANILA, Philippines Former presidential spokesperson Harry Roques plans to seek asylum in The Netherlands wont affect his cases in the country, a Palace official said Tuesday. Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary Claire Castro made the pronouncement after Roque recently announced that he will submit an asylum application in the Netherlands which would grant him the right to non-departation. Hindi naman ito makakaapekto. Unang-una po, magpa-file pa lang po yata siya ng petition at hindi pa po ito naga-grant, said Castro in a Palace press conference. According to Castro, Roque cannot prove political persecution based on the evidence gathered by the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force against him, specifically, on his alleged involvement in the operations of suspected illegal Philippine offshore gaming operator Lucky South 99 in Porac, Pampanga. Roque is facing human trafficking complaints before the Department of Justice over his alleged active participation in the operations of the Pogo hub. So, how could there be a political persecution if all the pieces of evidence are overwhelming? Castro said. Asked if the country aims to work with the International Criminal Police Organization in bringing Roque home, Castro responded in the negative, but explained that this may change once a warrant of arrest is issued by a Philippine court.

Makabayan bloc to ask House quad comm to counter Roques asylum bid,"MANILA, Philippines The Makabayan bloc will urge the House of Representatives quad committee to counter former presidential spokesperson Harry Roques asylum application in the Netherlands, ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro said on Tuesday. Castro, in a press briefing said that one of their primary concerns is having the quad committee block Roques asylum bid, as he has to answer first pending issues related to the four panels investigation of his alleged link to Philippine offshore gaming operators . Soon yata magkakaroon din ng meeting ulit, hearing ulit ng quad comm. At yon nga, maaaring pag-usapan din yong pabibigay siguro doon sa bansa na hinihingan niya ng asylum ng advice kung sakali, o recommendation not to give Harry Roque the asylum, Castro said. Pangunahin natin yong pagharang, through the quad comm, na harangan itong pag-seek ni Harry Roque ng asylum doon sa Netherlands kasi doon sa mga batayan na dapat niya munang sagutin yong mga issues na naka-pending sa quad comm, she added. According to Castro, the stand of the quad committee may be coursed through the Department of Foreign Affairs, as it may be a government-to-government discussion. Roque, spokesperson of former President Rodrigo Duterte, was cited for contempt by the quad committee last September 2024 after he refused to comply with documents that were deemed essential to the investigation of his alleged link to Pogos. L ast March 14, however, Roque was spotted with Vice President Sara Duterte and Senator Robinhood Padilla at the Hague , in the Netherlands, where former President Duterte was scheduled to stand trial before the International Criminal Court . Aside from lawyering for Duterte, Roque revealed that he will file a formal application to seek asylum in the Netherlands. Earlier, Castro also said that Roque does not have the moral ground to file for asylum, as he was one of the people who cheered on Duterte while the latter allegedly tolerated human rights violations during the drug war. Castro hopes Filipinos in the Netherlands or whatever country Roque would seek asylum in would also consult the Philippine government about the former Malacaang officials case. Well I hope the country that he seeks asylum in would also get advice from the Philippine government. Like I said, I hope Filipinos in the country where he would apply for asylum, including the entire Europe, would speak against this application. Two companies where Roque is being linked Biancham Holdings and PH2 Corporation, were scrutinized by the quad committee for alleged links to Lucky South 99, the Pogo hub in Porac, Pampanga which was raided last June 4 for human trafficking issues. Quad committee lead presiding officer and Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Robert Ace Barbers also noted that two illegal aliens working for Pogos were arrested in a Tuba, Benguet residence a house that Roque admitted to partly-owning.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2044819/well-urge-quad-comm-to-counter-roques-asylum-application,others
Dutertes ICC arrest: Separating fact from lies,"MANILA, Philippines The International Criminal Court s arrest warrant against former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has sparked a firestorm of reactions, with supporters calling it a political attack and critics hailing it as a long-overdue step toward justice. As misinformation spreads across social media, it is essential to separate fact from speculation. On March 11, 2025, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila upon his return from Hong Kong. The arrest was carried out based on a warrant issued by the ICC, which accused him of crimes against humanity related to extrajudicial killings during his war on drugs and his time as mayor of Davao City and later as the president between 2016 and 2022. After the arrest, Duterte was immediately transferred to ICC custody. By March 12, 2025, the ICC confirmed that he was detained at The Hague, where he will undergo trial READ: EXPLAINER: Whats next after arrest of Rodrigo Duterte? Despite the arrest being carried out under proper legal procedures, various narratives have surfaced online, questioning the legitimacy of the warrant and the ICCs authority. This article examines the major claims surrounding Dutertes arrest and how they hold up against verified sources, ICC documents, and international law. Many argue that 43 deaths are too few to justify a charge of crimes against humanity, with some pointing out that more people die from accidents every day. Others compare this to incidents like the Ampatuan Massacre, which involved 58 deaths but was tried in Philippine courts. The ICCs warrant cites 43 specific cases as representative examples of a much broader pattern of extrajudicial killings. These include 19 individuals alleged drug pushers or thieves killed by members of the DDS in various locations in and around Davao City. Additionally, at least 24 alleged criminals, including drug pushers, thieves, and drug users, were killed by or under the supervision of Philippine law enforcement, sometimes with the assistance of non-police personnel, across different locations in the country. However, the investigation extends far beyond these cases, covering thousands of deaths, with human rights organizations and the ICC estimating the toll of Dutertes drug war at between 6,000 and 30,000 victims. A pre-trial document dated September 2021 stated that the ICC prosecutor estimates the total number of civilians killed in connection with the so-called war on drugs campaign between July 2016 and March 2019 appears to be between 12,000 and 30,000. The document further stated that the estimates of the number of killed persons range from 12,000 to 30,000. [T]he Philippine authorities themselves reported that at least 5,281 persons were killed during police anti-drug operations between July 2016 and March 2019. Focusing on select cases is a common practice in international trials to establish patterns of state-sponsored violence while keeping legal proceedings manageable. READ: EXPLAINER: Brutal attacks on civilians hauled Rodrigo Duterte to The Hague What Dutertes supporters say: Some claim the ICC deliberately ignored higher death tolls because it could not prove them in court, suggesting that the case is weak. They argue that if thousands were really killed, the ICC would have cited all of them. The ICC does not dismiss higher death toll figures but rather strategically selects cases with clear evidence, credible witnesses, and traceable command responsibility. This is standard practice in international cases and ensures prosecutors can prove a consistent pattern of violence rather than overwhelming the court with thousands of separate cases. Several ICC documents, including the most recent ones such as the warrant of arrest repeatedly and explicitly noted that the larger body count still supports the ICCs case and that the killings were both widespread and systematic two key elements of crimes against humanity. The attack was widespread. It was carried out on a large scale and frequent basis, victimising a significant number of civilians over a broad geographic area and a prolonged period of time, the ICC stated. [T]here are reasonable grounds to believe that this attack was both widespread and systematic: the attack took place over a period of several years, and thousands people appear to have been killed, it added. Supporters claim that being labeled an indirect co-perpetrator proves that Duterte is not directly responsible and is being unfairly prosecuted. Some argue that this makes the case against him weaker, as he is not accused of personally killing anyone. The term indirect co-perpetrator is a legal classification under Article 25 of the Rome Statute, which still attributes significant responsibility to the accused. 3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person: Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person, regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible. This designation means that while Duterte may not have personally committed the killings, he enabled, facilitated, and contributed to the widespread and systematic nature of the crimes. The ICCs pre-trial documents explicitly state: 109. DUTERTE is the person most responsible for the crimes referenced in this Application. He was the mastermind of the formulation and dissemination of the Common Plan to target alleged criminals. He first conceived of the plan and oversaw its implementation in Davao City, and then nationwide, the ICC warrant of arrest document noted. As Mayor, and later as head of state, head of government, and leader of the countrys police forces, DUTERTE had authority over the perpetrators of relevant crimes. Indeed, as President, he was the only individual in the Philippines with ultimate authority over all State actors involved in implementing the Common Plan. He alone could approve or prevent the implementation of the Common Plan in its entirety, it added. Additionally, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber provided further details on Dutertes direct role in orchestrating these crimes: These crimes were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines, pursuant to a State policy to attack alleged criminals in the Philippines. DUTERTE and his co-perpetrators knew that their conduct was part of, or intended their conduct to be part of, that attack. The publicly stated aims of the attack were to reduce criminality, including drug use, sale and production, in Davao City and, later, in the whole of the Philippines . During the Presidential period, many of the acts were committed as part of a formal anti-illegal drugs campaign implemented by law enforcement personnel, which was frequently described in public reporting as DUTERTEs War on Drugs. However, such acts were only one component of the attack, which from its origins, targeted individuals suspected of various crimesand not only alleged drug users, dealers and producers. The ICC cites Dutertes repeated public statements encouraging extrajudicial killings, which established an environment of impunity. It also noted that these killings were not isolated incidents but part of a deliberate and coordinated effort linked to Dutertes leadership. In 2021, it explained that based on available information, Duterte has publicly encouraged extrajudicial killings in a way that is incompatible with a genuine law enforcement operation. What Dutertes supporters say: They argue that the Philippines has its own courts and that foreign institutions should not interfere in domestic matters. Some claim the ICCs case disrespects Philippine sovereignty. Fact check: Legally invalid The ICC operates under the complementarity principle, which means it only intervenes if a country is unwilling or unable to prosecute crimes domestically. READ: EJK victims mom: Duterte arrest not enough as Dela Rosa, Albayalde still free Some claim that Duterte was kidnapped because there was no valid warrant issued by the Philippines, making his arrest illegal. The ICC legally issued a warrant for Dutertes arrest after a thorough investigation. The Philippine government followed proper legal protocols. Claims that he was kidnapped lack any factual basis. READ: ICC EXPLAINER: Fine points in the arrest of Rodrigo Duterte What Dutertes supporters say: Dutertes supporters claim that his arrest is a political move orchestrated by his enemies rather than a legitimate legal process. Many argue that the ICC is being used as a weapon by Western powers to interfere in Philippine affairs, targeting Duterte while ignoring worse human rights violations in other countries. Others claim that the case is being pushed by his political opponents who have long sought to bring him down. Some supporters also argue that Dutertes strong stance against the U.S. and Western influence, along with his closer ties with China and Russia, made him a target of international institutions like the ICC. They point out that the ICC has not arrested leaders from powerful nations like the U.S., despite their involvement in wars that led to mass civilian casualties. Another claim making the rounds online is that the timing of Dutertes arrest after his allies lost influence in government suggests that political maneuvering was involved rather than an impartial legal process. There is no credible evidence that Dutertes arrest is politically motivated. The ICC is an independent judicial body, and its judges and prosecutors operate under strict legal guidelines to ensure impartiality. The decision to issue an arrest warrant followed a years-long investigation based on witness testimonies, forensic evidence, and reports from human rights organizations. READ: Timeline: ICC investigation of Duterte As the case unfolds, it is important to separate facts from misinformation. The ICC has followed proper legal processes, and Duterte will now have the chance to defend himself in court. His supporters claim the case is weak, but the legal process is clear: The charges are serious, the evidence is strong, and international law is being upheld. Dutertes fate will now be decided in a court of law, not on social media. Graphics by Ed Lustan/Inquirer.net.

DepEd set to reduce public school teachers paperwork by 57%,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Education on Monday announced that it is set to reduce school paperwork by 57 percent to ease the administrative burden on public school teachers. According to the DepEds statement, public school teachers will soon be required to regularly complete only five school forms from the previous 174. Additional forms will be filled out only based on specific teacher designations, following DepEd Order No. 005, s. 2024, Teachers have repeatedly raised this issue, and were addressing it. Reducing their bureaucratic workload will improve their well-being and allow them to focus on delivering quality education, Education Secretary Sonny Angara said. Angara said the initiative is part of the Marcos administrations broader education reform agenda, which seeks to make the public school system more efficient while at the same time improving the working conditions of teachers. It was also based on a study by the DepEds Technical Working Group which found that teachers spend excessive hours on non-teaching tasks. Another study from IDsight also showed that 42 percent of teachers work over 50 hours per week, with 17.8 hours dedicated to ancillary duties and 8.1 hours to program-related tasksmost of which is spent filling out forms instead of engaging with students or preparing lessons. To support the transition, DepEd will issue a formal department order outlining the new guidelines. Nationwide orientation sessions will be conducted to ensure a smooth rollout, the DepEd said. The agency will also develop a Data Management Framework to standardize school data collection to eliminate redundant and outdated reporting requirements. Furthermore, advocacy campaigns will also be launched to inform stakeholders about the reforms and promote teacher-friendly policies.

Iloilo vlogger regrets setting himself on fire,"ILOILO CITY, Philippines A content creator from Calinog town, Iloilo has expressed remorse after he intentionally tried to burn himself for content and entertainment purposes on March 9.

The 38-year-old tricycle driver shared in an interview on March 11 that he had been vlogging for only a month, and he was inspired to do so because he saw the monetary profit it brings.

Palace to MILF: Give new BARMM interim chief a chance,"MANILA, Philippines The Palace on Monday called on the Moro Islamic Liberation Front to give the new interim chief of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao a chance.

READ: MILF central committee rejects Macacuas BARMM appointment The people who attended the MILF Consultative Assembly said that the President has the prerogative to appoint an interim chief minister, she said in Filipino. As of now, this is still very new. Our request to the leadership of the MILF is to give the newly appointed ICM a chance.

"Tolentino: Courage, faith of Leyte, Samar residents an inspiration","Tacloban City Reelectionist Senator Francis Tol Tolentino has commended the people of Eastern Visayas for their courage and faith in rising from the devastation caused by Super Typhoon Yolanda in November 2013.

Transport stakeholders: Motorcycle riders need training to avoid mishaps,"MANILA, Philippines The government should provide free training and education for motorcycle riders to help reduce motorcycle-related accidents, transport leaders and local officials said Tuesday. This comes after data from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority showed that motorcycles were involved in most road accidents in Metro Manila. According to an MMDA report, 36,486 motorcycles were involved in road crashes in 2023, accounting for 22.03 percent of all vehicular accidents that year. The report also recorded 271 fatal injuries from motorcycle-related incidents. In a press conference, Angkas Chief Executive Officer George Royeca said the rising number of motorcycle accidents stems from a lack of proper training before riders obtain their licenses. READ: Still no law on motorcycle taxis; 60,000 jobs at stake We have to dig deep into the problem. I think the issue here is not necessarily the requirements of the dealers [in buying and owning motorcycles]. Ang issue dito is natuturuan ba natin yung mga rider na mag-motorsiklo? Natuturuan ba natin nang tama bago sila kumuha ng lisensya? Royeca said. He further emphasized that training should be free, as many riders cannot afford it. Kaya nga po bumibili ng motorsiklo kasi hindi pa kaya bumili ng sasakyan, at ginagamit ang motorsiklo para maiangat sila sa kahirapan. So dapat magbigay ang gobyerno ng free training, the Angkas CEO added. Quezon City Councilor and Ways and Means Committee Chairperson Wency Lagumbay supported the call for training but noted that regulating motorcycle use in Quezon City is challenging because most of the citys roads are under national jurisdiction. Sa lungsod Quezon, hindi mo talaga mareregulate dahil unang-una, karamihan po ng mga kalsada sa lungsod ay governed by the national government. Kung tutuusin, if you notice if we will come up with a measure to regulate lets say the traversing of motorcycles, medyo magiging mahirap kasi marami po tayong tatamaang national roads, Lagumbay explained. He added that while regulations on smaller roads are feasible, enforcement is more difficult in major thoroughfares, leaving the Land Transportation Office in charge of implementing rules. Kung local roads lang po tayo, kung maliliit na kalsada, walang problema. Pero being one of the progressive cities in the country, its harder for us to regulate. And well leave it to the Land Transportation Office to actually do the regulations, the Quezon City councilor said. And the only thing that we can actually mandate is to continue to propagate programs that would help, like what George said, to educate our riders of how to use their motorcycles to begin with, Lagumbay added. Meanwhile, Motorcycle Dealers Association of the Philippines President Edwin Go said that dealers uphold strict requirements for purchasing motorcycles. Basic requirement is you must have a drivers license pagdating sa requirements, mahigpit kami number one sa license dahil bawal talaga mag-maneho ng kahit anong sasakyan sa kalsada pag wala kang lisensya, Go said. Lagumbay also urged the Department of Transportation to lead efforts in ensuring that motorcycle riders are both law-compliant and properly trained. In order for us to implement these programs and plans that we want to, we also have to have additional enforcers to actually implement them properly. And thats why the government, especially the DOTr, should always step up as well in implementing those rules, he said. Kasi if you noticed it, when youre at a specific road, lets just say Commonwealth, Quezon Avenue kaya nagkakaroon minsan ng aksidente ang mga motor is because one, either the person driving the motorcycle is not knowledgeable of the law; and two, if nobody is actually implementing it, he added. Royeca reiterated that free, high-quality training is crucial since motorcycles have become a livelihood tool for many Filipinos. Kailangan natin ng dekalidad at libreng training para doon sa mga gustong gumamit ng motorsiklo. Kasi whether we like it or not, tumataas yung bilang ng mga bumibili ng motorsiklo kasi tinitignan nila ito hindi lang parang isang sasakyan, pero isang parte o magiging kabuhayan nila, the Angkas CEO said. So maraming Pilipino, tinitignan ang motorsiklo at gustong gamitin ito para sa hanapbuhay at kailangan na nga natin sila i-train, he added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2044829/transport-stakeholders-motorcycle-riders-need-training-to-avoid-mishaps,others

"Remain loyal to PH despite calls for partisan activity, AFP, PNP told","TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte The Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police must to remain loyal to the country despite calls from different sectors to engage in partisan activity, former senator Panfilo Ping Lacson said on Saturday. Lacson, in a radio interview with DZRH, said that it is important for people especially those from the uniformed services to verify information spreading on social media, as they may be swayed by misinformation and disinformation. The former senator, who also served as PNP chief, said this after some of former President Rodrigo Dutertes supporters on social media urged police and military personnel to leave the service and back the ex-leader. They should remain professional and loyal to their duty. That is the best message, Lacson said in Filipino during the interview, transcripts of which were sent to reporters. In this day and age of information technology, fake news spreads fast. And we know that is in their training to conduct fact-checking first. If there are reports of partisan activity, they should not get involved, he added. According to Lacson, the issue of misinformation and disinformation may be one of the issues that he will look into should he be reelected. We must focus on penalizing the spread of fake news. This threatens our culture, and contributes to the destruction of our good manners and right conduct, he added. On social media, there have been posts allegedly made by police and military officers who resigned from office as they cannot accept that Duterte was arrested and handed over to the International Criminal Court . However, there were netizens who also fact-checked these posts. For example, a post from a male police officer claimed that he left the service after finding it hard to still be part of the PNP after it assisted the International Criminal Police Organization in enforcing the ICC arrest order. The police officer was criticized by his alleged ex-girlfriend who claimed that the resignation of the officer happened months before Duterte was arrested.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2044138/afp-pnp-must-remain-loyal-to-ph-despite-calls-for-partisan-activity-lacson,others

In line with the celebration of International Womens Month, the tribute was posted by Harvard Law School on its Instagram page , citing an article in Harvard Law Bulletin in 2007. The knights were always defending the defenseless, and I thought, How could I do that? Espiritu said in the article. READ: #HerStory: Women Transforming Society Espiritu also acknowledged the limited opportunities women had to deal with, many decades ago.

READ: SC lauds womens growing presence in judiciary She studied at the Manuel L. Quezon School of Law in Manila before obtaining her Master of Law degree at HLS in 1951. Women were supposed to stay at home, and even if they were studying, they were studying to teach, she added. Espiritu bared that her father wanted her to study abroad, but she requested it should be at HLS, despite knowing that it would only accept male students. The Harvard Corporation would later reverse its policy of denying law school applications from women. She said that she was at a loss at Harvard, but she attributed her HLS experience to good professors and teaching her how to think. She worked as corporate legal counsel for one of the biggest land developers in the country shortly after her husband died. Handling her first criminal case in 1959, she represented a prisoner sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow inmate. Despite an initial court ruling upholding the death sentence for her client, she challenged the order before the board of pardons, and her clients sentence was reduced just before his scheduled execution. She was the president of a family-owned rural bank for 32 years and did pro-bono legal work until May 2006. In October 2007, Espiritu returned to HLS as a guest of honor at a dinner, in which she thanked Harvard for the opportunity to learn well, not only in the matters of law but in improving the lives of our fellow men.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2044985/erlinda-ignacio-espiritu-first-woman-to-receive-a-degree-from-harvard-law-school,others

These zones are expected to attract substantial pharma, medical, and healthcare-related investments, advance technology, and increase local production and research, creating numerous jobs and enhancing the countrys export potential, and positioning the Philippines as a competitive player in the global pharmaceutical market, Peza Director General Tereso Panga said in a statement Sunday. Under the newly approved guidelines, pharmazones located in the National Capital Region and other metropolitan areas must cover at least 10,000 square meters, while those in non-metropolitan regions must have a minimum land area of 50,000 square meters. Developers and operators of these ecozones will be entitled to fiscal incentives provided under Title XII of the amended Tax Code. Additionally, enterprises involved in supporting export activities, including ecozone developers, utilities, and facility operators dedicating at least 70 percent of their leasable or saleable areas to exporters, will be classified as Activities in Support to Exporters. These entities will enjoy the same incentives as Export Enterprises, in line with Peza Memorandum Circular No. 2023-033. As investors come in using the Philippines as a manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia for dependable medicines and bring in their cutting-edge technologies, I am sure that higher quality of medicines and medical supplies will be developed for the whole region and ultimately increase the availability and lower the price of medicines for the Filipino people, Panga said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2044342/peza-issues-guidelines-on-pharmazones-to-lower-drug-prices,others

It will also finance the upgrade of PNPAs Crime Scene Plaza which will serve as a training ground for forensic and investigative procedures, as well as the purchase of firearms training simulators. Likewise, the state gaming firm will help the police academy acquire crime mapping and predictive policing software to support cadets training in crime analysis, visualization and prevention, and cybercrime investigations. An ambulance, equipped with a GPS navigation system, ambulance stretcher, medical oxygen, wheelchair, and a first aid kit, will be turned over to the PNPA next week. Technology is now a crucial aspect of law enforcement and our cadets must have access to modern facilities and training innovations that will allow them to combat crime more effectively, Tengco said. The Pagcor chief also turned over a check worth P2.2 million to the PNPA Alumni Association Inc. for the purchase of a new service vehicle and 100 computer tablets.

89 seconds to midnight: World moves closer to catastrophe,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Doomsday Clocks hands inch forward, now frozen at 89 seconds to midnight the closest they have ever been to global catastrophe. A mere second separates us from last years record, yet that sliver of time speaks volumes. It is a warning, not a prediction. A reflection, not a prophecy. And still, the world hesitates. For nearly eight decades, the Doomsday Clock has served as a symbol of humanitys self-inflicted dangers, measuring how close we are to irreversible disaster. Created in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, its hands have shifted back and forth over the years, responding to wars, diplomatic breakthroughs, climate crises, and technological shifts. In recent years, the Clock has crept dangerously close to midnight. In 2020, the Bulletin set the Clock at 100 seconds to midnight, the closest it had ever been at the time a stark reflection of growing nuclear risks, climate inaction, and the spread of disinformation. It remained at 100 seconds through 2021 and 2022 before moving forward to 90 seconds to midnight in 2023, citing mounting nuclear threats, climate disasters, and the rapid rise of artificial intelligence in global security. READ: At dooms doorstep: Doomsday Clock set at 100 seconds to world destruction The Clocks farthest point from midnight came in 1991 when the Cold Wars end and arms reduction treaties allowed scientists to push the hands back to 17 minutes to midnight the most optimistic position in its history. But never before has it been this close to midnight. Now, with the Clock set at 89 seconds to midnight, the Bulletins latest statement warns that humanity faces unprecedented danger. This year, the scientists and security experts behind the Clock have issued their starkest warning yet. Nuclear tensions are rising, the climate crisis is accelerating, and artificial intelligence is reshaping warfare. At the same time, biological risks are growing, and misinformation is eroding trust in science and global institutions. The world is on edge. And time is running out. It takes only one miscalculation. One wrong move. One moment of escalation. For the third year, the war in Ukraine rages on, its nuclear undertones more dangerous than ever. Russias nuclear rhetoric has grown bolder, and Western allies continue to provide advanced weaponry to Kyiv. READ: Ukrainian forces fighting in Russia almost surrounded According to the 2025 Doomsday Clock Statement by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, experts warn that a single mistake an errant missile, a misunderstanding, or a desperate political maneuver could trigger a larger conflict. Meanwhile, the Middle East is a powder keg. The Bulletin highlights that rising tensions between Israel, Iran, and regional militias pose a growing risk of escalation. If conflict spreads, global powers could be drawn in, heightening the danger of broader war. At the same time, nuclear-armed nations arent slowing down. The U.S., Russia, China, and others continue to modernize their arsenals, investing billions in increasingly destructive weapons. The Bulletin warns that diplomatic efforts to control nuclear proliferation are weakening, and alarmingly, some nations without nuclear weapons are considering developing thema shift that could further destabilize global security. The world has not faced nuclear risks like this since the Cold War, the Bulletin cautions. The difference? Back then, leaders talked. Today, those channels are breaking down. Step outside, and the evidence is everywhere. Oceans are rising. Forests are burning. Cities are drowning. The year 2024 was the hottest year on record. Not by a fraction of a degree, but by a significant margin. Across the world, extreme weather events heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, storms, floods have become routine. READ: 2024 hottest recorded year, crossed global warming limit In the United States, record-breaking wildfires in California and the Pacific Northwest sent smoke drifting as far as Europe. In Asia, intensified typhoons displaced millions. In Africa, prolonged droughts pushed entire regions toward famine. Meanwhile, the Antarctic experienced its lowest sea ice levels ever recorded, signaling that polar ice melt is accelerating faster than predicted. READ:https://globalnation.inquirer.net/249273/disappeared-completely-melting-glaciers-worry-central-asia Despite the growing urgency, global efforts to curb climate change remain insufficient, the Bulletin warned. While renewable energy capacity has expanded, some governments have backtracked on climate pledges and even increased investments in fossil fuels. Without significant action, experts say future climate disasters will be even more severe. The world learned a painful lesson in 2020: A microscopic threat can bring nations to a standstill. Yet, despite that, new biological dangers continue to emerge. The Bulletin stressed that the threat of pandemics remains high, noting concerns about highly pathogenic avian influenza , which has spread beyond seasonal patterns, infecting farm animals and even humans. With the right mutation, experts warn, it could trigger another pandemic. READ: US records its first human death from bird flu Meanwhile, high-risk biological research is expanding, yet oversight remains weak, increasing the risk of pathogens escaping from laboratories. The Bulletin stressed that accidental leaks or intentional misuse could have devastating global consequences. The Bulletin also warned of the increasing role of artificial intelligence in warfare. AI-powered targeting systems have already been deployed in conflicts like those in Ukraine and the Middle East, raising serious concerns about decision-making in battle. As nations rush to integrate AI into military strategies, experts warn that machines, not human judgment, could accelerate future conflicts. Rising tensions in space are another concern. According to the Bulletin, Russia and China have ramped up efforts to develop anti-satellite capabilities, while the U.S. has accused Russia of testing a nuclear-capable satellite a move that could significantly increase the risk of militarization in space. Misinformation, amplified by AI, is also undermining public trust. The Bulletin highlighted growing concerns about AI-generated propaganda and election interference, warning that these tactics could erode democracy and make it increasingly difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. The Doomsday Clock is not a death sentence its a call to action. It moves forward when global risks grow and can move back if real efforts are made to reduce those dangers. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists urges nations to restore diplomacy, strengthen nuclear agreements, accelerate climate action, and regulate AI and biological research. The question is no longer whether the threats are real. They are. The real question is: What will the world do about them? As the world stares at 89 seconds to midnight, the question remains: Will we change course, or will we let time run out? Graphics by Ed Lustan/Inquirer.net.

Isabela bridge collapse probe ongoing Palace,"MANILA, Philippines Malacaang on Wednesday said an investigation is still underway into the collapse of the Cabagan Santa Maria bridge in Isabela, weeks after President Ferdinand Bongbong R. Marcos Jr. said that heads will roll following the incident. At a briefing, Palace Press Officer Claire Castro also said the Department of Public Works and Highways has already formed a special committee to investigate the matter. The committee will submit its findings by April 25. Asked why no one has been preventively suspended from the DPWH following the Presidents heads will roll statement, Castro said that the bridge collapse needs a thorough investigation. This question arose after Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, chairperson of a Senate Blue Ribbon subcommittee, warned that he would subpoena Public Works Secretary Manuel Bonoan after the latter skipped the panels investigation into the collapsed bridge. Sa ngayon po ay nagkakaroon tayo ng pag-iimbestiga; mahirap naman pong pabigla-bigla tayo magkaroon ng preventive suspension kung ang mga tao na involve ay wala naman na sa gobyerno, she said. Casto also confirmed that Bonoan is still in office. Kung hindi pa po natin nakikita na siya po yung pinaka-involved, hindi po natin siya mapapatawan ng preventive suspension, she said. In his visit to Isabela on March 5, Marcos said the portion of the CabaganSanta Maria bridge may have collapsed due to underdesign.

Northern Samars investment policies get Malacaang citation,"TACLOBAN CITY Northern Samar has solidified its reputation as a prime investment hub after receiving a presidential recognition for its pioneering One-Stop Action Center for Strategic Investmentsthe first local government green lane for strategic investments in the country. This recognition, conferred at the Gawad Bayanihan sa Pamumuhunan awarding ceremony in Malacaang Palace on March 13, underscores Northern Samars growing prominence as an investor-friendly province.

Our policies are in place, and the provincial government is fully committed to supporting investors, he said on Tuesday. With this latest national recognition, Northern Samar strengthens its appeal as a top-tier investment destination, paving the way for greater economic opportunities, job creation, and sustainable development, he added. Gov. Edwin Ongchuan credited the provinces investment success to the strategic collaboration between provincial government departments and local governments which has created a seamless investment ecosystem.

It is our unity and interdependence that give Northern Samar its unique advantage as a premier investment destination, particularly in renewable energy, Ongchuan said in a statement. The provinces efforts in investment promotion have already yielded impressive results.

SHS voucher programs beneficiary legitimacy issues reported to DepEd PEAC,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Education was informed as early as 2016 that there were cases of students having several learning reference numbers who were enrolled in different schools, a private committee said during a congressional hearing on issues related to the Senior High School voucher program. At the hearing of the House Committee on Basic Education and Culture on Wednesday, committee chairperson and Pasig City Rep. Roman Romulo asked the Private Education Assistance Committee why they did not immediately utilize the Learner Information System in validating whether beneficiaries of the voucher system are legitimate students. DepEd rolled out the voucher program in 2015 in a bid to make senior high school education more accessible to students in low-income families and minimize overcrowding in public schools as grantees may enroll in private institutions using the vouchers. The value of voucher ranges from P14,000 to P22,500, depending on the students location. PEAC was scrutinized after it was revealed last March 6 that DepEd terminated the participation of 55 schools in the SHS voucher program for various reasons, including the alleged cases of of ghost students. In response, PEAC Monitoring and Processing Unit Head Rod Malonzo said they refused to tap the LIS because there were several issues before like multiple LRNs and enrolled schools for a single student. Ang tagal na nong LIS system, so my question is, bakit hindi tayo nag-LIS system dati pa? Romulo asked. Actually, we already are connected with the LIS since the start of the voucher program in 2016 to 2017. However, there are issues with the LIS before, like for example, in 2016, some students had several learner reference numbers, even if iisa lang yong bata, isang bata but several learner reference numbers, Malonzo replied. And there are also issues with the billing. Kasi sometimes we see in the LIS that the student is enrolled in multiple schools, one or two schools. So yon yong mga issues during the first years of implementation of the program, Malonzo added. Romulo then asked if that would have been a red flag already because the different LRNs and enrolled schools could have been used to claim several vouchers. Malonzo then said that these issues were reported to the DepEd. Yes, but would that not have been a red flag already on your part? Kasi kung nakita ninyo na merong isang studyante na maraming learner reference numbers or naka-enroll siya in various schools, hindi ba red flag na yon? Romulo asked. Actually, yes. This was reported also to DepEd, yong mga LRNs or learners that were billed in multiple schools and also the learners with multiple LRNs. This was actually reported to DepEd since 2016. I cant recall the exact year, Malonzo replied. When Romulo turned to DepEd Government Assistance and Subsidies Service Director III Tara Rama, she declined to comment as the incident happened when a previous DepEd administration was still in office. DepEd Bureau of Learning Resources Director III Jayson Lacbayan meanwhile explained that schools really can create multiple LRNs for their students, but these are being currently checked to avoid double entries. Actually, a school can create multiple numbers of LIS numbers as they enroll, but as we go on with the LIS, they are now already checked and blocked kaya pwedeng magkaroon ng doble-doble, pero ngayon nache-check na rin, Lacbayan said. DepEd found itself on the hot seat again after it was revealed that it terminated the participation of 55 schools due to the alleged presence of ghost students in the voucher program or a supposed practice of allocating assistance for students who are not enrolled in schools or are not availing of the program. During the previous hearing, Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel Manuel asked Director Rama about the number of vouchers released to these schools, to which the DepEd official said that the agency withheld P200 million worth of vouchers after spotting discrepancies from the schools. We cannot say that they were ghost students because it might be that they went to a private school for the first few months, and then later they left and went back to a public school because of a problem. We cannot say for sure that they were all ghost students, she explained in Filipino. Regarding the 12 private schools currently under investigation due to SHS students found to be nonexistent, the DepEd earlier said it stopped the release of vouchers and saved over P50 million in taxpayers money. Last February, Education Secretary Sonny Angara said the potential defraudment under the program amounted to P52,571,500, covering the School Year 2023 to 2024. Angara, however, did not identify the schools and only revealed that they are located in Metro Manila, Davao, Ilocos, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Eastern Visayas and the Bangsamoro region.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045124/fwd-peac-deped-told-about-students-with-several-reference-numbers-schools,others

"Enrile posts cryptic remark on pathetic irony, gasping for justice","MANILA, Philippines Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile on Tuesday said he finds it ironic that those who reportedly committed injustices are now drowning and gasping for justice. Enrile did not mention or specifically refer to anyone in his online post but has commented previously on the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte and his legal woes before the International Criminal Court. What a pathetic irony! Those who allegedly committed acts of injustice are drowning and gasping for justice. In their desperate distress, they called for widespread national prayer rallies to a God they called STUPID!!! Enrile wrote on Facebook on Tuesday evening. Dutertes supporters and allies organized a Bring PRRD Home event over the weekend, praying for the former leaders health and safe return in the Philippines.

Days later he even said that he would not in a million years apologize for calling God stupid.

If you are difficult to go to, chances are visitors will not consider visiting your place. So, it is important for us to have connectivity by air, sea and by land, she emphasized. Tiopes mentioned that the region has Daniel Z.

Zia Alonto Adiong said on Tuesday. Adiong in a statement said that the law must be implemented against people who are making these statements online, as it is a reckless attempt at diverting public attention. The lawmaker was referring to claims spreading on social media claiming that the SC had already received a petition containing 16 million signatures, asking that Marcos step down from office. READ: SC denies receiving Marcos resignation petition This is a blatant act of deception, meant to sow confusion and disrupt our nation. We will not allow malicious actors to use the Supreme Court as a tool for political sabotage, Adiong said. The law must come down hard on those spreading these lies, he added.

The public must be vigilant and verify sources before believing or spreading unverified claims. The truth must always prevail over deception, he added. Aside from Adiong, other lawmakers have called out misinformation and disinformation going around social media networks. Earlier, La Union Rep. Paolo Ortega V said that the massive spread of misinformation and disinformation after former President Rodrigo Duterte was taken into custody by the International Criminal Court only brings shame to the country. Ortega was referring to the huge amount of social media posts containing fake information and even hate speech against foreign institutions like the ICCas Duterte supporters harassed ICC Presiding Judge Lulia Motoc and made degrading comments about her. There were also posts falsely claiming that Motoc shared a photo with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s wife, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos. Also, Ortega noted that there have been different false narratives on social media, including those from former executive secretary Salvador Medialdea, who claimed that Duterte was missing and was not given the proper medical care. The attacks on Judge Motoc show how far disinformation networks will go to distort reality and discredit legal proceedings. Theyre fabricating stories, questioning credibility, and spreading outright lies just to muddy the waters, Ortega said. Last Friday, Iloilo Rep. Janette Garin said that Medialdea is only spreading misinformation, noting that her prior experience in working with the Dutch people showed that they are very meticulous and considerate when it comes to the health and welfare of people. Garin was a former Health secretary during the time of former President Benigno Aquino III. According to lawyer Kristina Conti, these posts may be bad for Dutertes legal standing as they may backfirethrough a provision in the Rome Statute, it may be invoked against such actions.

Cayetano wants Masungis revoked housing deal investigated,"MANILA, Philippines Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano is calling for a Senate investigation into the Department of Environment and Natural Resources decision to revoke a housing deal within the Masungi Georeserve in Rizal, a move that has sparked a dispute over land use, conservation, and governance. In his Senate resolution No. 1323, Cayetano particularly urged the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee to examine why the DENR revoked its Supplemental Joint Venture Agreement with Blue Star Construction Development Corporation . The developer had been authorized to build housing units for government employees within the protected area. READ: DENR to evict developer of Masungi Georeserve The protection and conservation of the environment and our natural resources for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations of Filipinos is a sacred duty entrusted to our leaders, Cayetano stated in the resolution. The DENR first granted BSDC permission in 1996 to build 5,00 units, later expanding the deal in 2002. The agency, however, canceled the agreement this March due to the lack of presidential approval, missing compliance documents, and BSDCs alleged failure to meet its obligations. This dispute has since escalated, with the DENR accusing Masungi Georeserve Foundation, Inc. , a group linked to BSDC, of prioritizing tourism over housing. MGFI, in turn, claimed that the DENR was neglecting its duty to remove illegal settlers and weakening environmental protection. It is imperative that the government, the private sector, and other stakeholders squarely confront this legal quandary in which the Masungi Georeserve finds itself, Cayetano said. The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee has yet to schedule a hearing on the matter.

Water distributor scrambles for short-term fix as Iloilo water woes rise,"ILOILO CITY The water crisis in this city is far from over. Water distribution company Metro Pacific Iloilo Water is rushing to install a modular water treatment plant within the next eight months as a temporary fix to the worsening shortage. MPIW chief operating officer Angelo David Berba admitted that the current supply falls short of the citys needs. To address the matter, the company is looking for a site to install a P400-million modular treatment plant with a capacity of 5 million liters per day . Aside from this, MPIW is also launching four total pipe replacement projects to cut down non-revenue water losses. Permits for this purpose are being secured from the Department of Public Works and Highways and the city government. While these short-term efforts are in place, MPIWs bigger investmenta 66.5 MLD desalination plantis still in progress. However, even this wont be enough, as Berba acknowledged it will only cover 60 percent of Iloilos water demand. MPIW says the Jalaur River Multipurpose Project II is the citys long-term solution. Once completed, the project can supply up to 80 MLD, solving Iloilos chronic water shortage, the water distributor said. Thats why we are highlighting that the long-term solution is the Jalaur . We have to secure the Jalaur because its a big volume, 80 MLD, Berba noted. Mayor Jerry Treas made it clear that Iloilo City isnt satisfied with MPIWs performance. In over five years of operation, the company has only met 27 percent of the citys water needs, a figure the mayor called unacceptable. I called a meeting with Metro Pacific Iloilo Water because I want them to fully understand that we are not happy with the current state of the water supply in Iloilo City, Treas said in a statement on March 17. While we acknowledge their investments, it is clear that they are not enough to fully address the problem, he explained. The mayor also compared MPIW to MORE Power, the citys electricity distributor, pointing out that the water distributor has not shown the same urgency in solving problems to cope with Iloilos rapid growth. According to Treas, MORE Power reported a 13 percent compounded annual growth rate in the past five years, a trend that MPIW should match to keep up with the citys expansion programs. An investment of almost a billion pesos is not enough. MPIW must be serious about addressing this issue, he said. Treas also demanded not just new water sources but also better infrastructure. He said MPIW must take responsibility for rehabilitating its pipelines and improving distribution efficiency. MPIW currently supplies around 40 to 50 MLD to Iloilo City. As the demand continues to rise, the modular treatment plant and pipe replacement projects may only serve as stopgap measures.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045640/water-distributor-scrambles-for-short-term-fix-as-iloilo-water-woes-rise,others

Joseph Stephen Paduano asked the vlogger if she has actual copies of the documents, instead of merely relying on articles. Your honor, if Im not mistaken, nasa newspaper na rin po yan, Quiambao said. Its in the newspaper, but what I am asking you is what is the source of that newspaper? Is it an official document or findings of the Human Rights Commission? Madam, absolutely not, because during our hearing in the quad comm, all those victims, the families present were confirmed by the Human Rights Commission, in fact we have all the list, Paduano countered. Abante noted that aside from the Commission on Human Rights, his own panel the House committee on human rights also verified the existence of drug war victims and possible EJKs. My goodness if you would like to be a resource person in this committee, you need to bring a basis. You have to have a true basis, documents to back your claims because look, the Commission on Human Rights for example, they investigated the alleged EJKs and they saw many incidents, we in our committee on human rights, we also saw several issues, Abante said. But you are saying its a massive hoax. Dont do this, I want to believe your statement earlier, but what you are saying is not good, he added. In the end, Quiambao admitted that she does not have any document proving that EJKs were a hoax. What I am asking you is if you have the document or not? Yes or no, do you have the document, under oath? Yes or no? And remember, I am just asking you if you have the document or not, under oath, Paduano warned. None sir, like I said its in the , Quiambao replied. next time before we write these issues, we need to get legitimate documents first. Quiambao did not mention it, but recently, Duterte supporters criticized a certain Aling Shiela as they believed that one of her sons, Ryan, was not a victim of EJKs in the drug war. Sheila supposedly raised a photo of her son Ryan during a picture-taking at a press conference on the alleged EJKs committed by the Duterte administration. Later on, it was discovered that Ryan actually died in 2024, or two years after Duterte had already stepped down from his presidential post. But Rubliyn Litao, coordinator of Rise Up for Life and for Rights, said it was Rico, another son of Aling Sheila, and not Ryan, who was killed during the time of the previous administration. The tri-committee has been tasked to probe the spread of disinformation online after several resolutions were filed and different privilege speeches about the matter were delivered. Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Robert Ace Barbers was one of the lawmakers who delivered a privilege speech, after different fake rumors spread about him and the other chairpersons of the House quad committee, which was then probing illegal activities in Philippine offshore gaming operators, the illicit drug trade, and extrajudicial killings in the past administrations drug war. According to Barbers, there may be a need to establish a regulatory framework for social media use, just like how mainstream media organizations and legitimate news outlets adhere to a set of ethical standards.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045696/fwd-ejks-a-hoax-vlogger-says-its-true-but-fails-to-give-documentary-evidence,others
Suarez to Pinoy vloggers trained by China: Use skills for PH betterment,"MANILA, Philippines Filipino vloggers who were trained under a Chinese governments program should use the skills they learned for the betterment of the Philippines, Deputy Speaker David Suarez said on Friday. At the hearing of the House of Representatives tri-committee, Suarez asked former Presidential Communications Office Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles if she knew individuals in a photo taken at Tiananmen Square during a training conducted by Chinas National Radio and Television Administration in 2023. According to Cruz-Angeles, she no longer remembers all the individuals in the photo but knows some of them like journalist Pia Morato, bloggers Tio Moreno and Mark Lopez, and lawyer Ahmed Paglinawan. Cruz-Angeles said the training was quite technical, as it revolved around how to better utilize short-form social media use. At least our resource persons admitted that they benefitted from the state-sponsored seminar, that they understood how to use reels, threads, and short videos. My appeal only is this: I hope you can use this additional knowledge and skills for the benefit of the Philippines, Suarez said in Filipino. During his time to question the resource persons, Suarez also inquired about the specific training regimen given to journalists and vloggers, and who shouldered the expenditures. According to Cruz-Angeles, the Chinese government shouldered the expenses for the training that ran from May 23 to June 5, 2023. And this seminar, was it sponsored or did you have to pay for your seminar fees? Suarez asked. So the one that paid the expenses is the government of China? This was sponsoredYes, sir, Cruz-Angeles replied. How did you get invited to take part in the seminar? Suarez asked. Through the Chinese Embassy They conduct these regularly, I understand. There are others who are also invited from the mainstream media, but we did not go together during that time. So I understand that this is conducted regularly, Cruz-Angeles said. The former PCO head also told lawmakers that the discussions centered on new techniques in using social media. They introduced new techniques in social media such as short-form social media, how to take them. A lot of them were technical, emerging issues, but they also gave a background on China. And thats, Im sorry, thats all that I can recall, she explained. Would you think that the seminar you attended affected your perspective or the work that you do? Because thats the goal of seminars, right? To improve your appreciation of things, to increase your skills so you can do your jobs better. So do you think the seminars were of any help with your jobs? Suarez asked. It includes a history of China, which also includes an understanding of the area. I have studied that already a long time ago, so many of these were just a repeat. What was new is the short form, the seminar on the usage of short form type of video, which is technical, like a technical seminar where we are taught to use this on different platforms, she explained. Several vloggers faced scrutiny at the House tri-committee hearing, which was probing the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation on social media. Prior to Suarez questions for Cruz-Angeles, Abang Lingkod party-list Rep. Joseph Stephen Paduano warned Lopez that he would cite him for contempt if the blogger lies again. This was after Lopez wrongly claimed that Philippine forces also do water cannon attacks like what Chinas vessels did in the West Philippine Sea. READ: Blogger apologizes for claiming PH uses water cannons in WPS Filipinos have long been considered to be one of the prevalent social media and internet users across the globe.

Solon says VP Sara should be in PH for her impeachment trial,"MANILA, Philippines Vice President Sara Duterte should be in the Philippines once her impeachment trial starts, Lanao del Sur 1st District Representative Zia Alonto Adiong said on Thursday. During a press briefing at the Batasang Pambansa complex, Adiong and La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V were asked if they think Philippine officials currently in the Hague, the Netherlands, should return to the Philippines once the impeachment trial starts. Duterte, along with Senator Robinhood Padilla, are currently in the Netherlands to support the Vice Presidents father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, after he was taken into custody by the International Criminal Court . I think so. I think she needs to be here, I think she needs to be in the country while the impeachment is ongoing, Adiong said. Meanwhile, Ortega said that lawmakers now in the Netherlands would have to come back to the Philippines eventually, as Congress would soon be busy for the 2026 budget season. Well, siguro yong mga tao na nandon, na legislators, uuwi yon, budget season eh, kailangan maghanda saka mag-prepare para sa 2026 na budget. Kailangan na siguraduhin natin na yong mga kailangan po ng mga agencies, saka kailangan na programa, saka proyekto eh mai-ensure natin na may proper po na funding, Ortega said. Saka alam naman po natin na exercise po yan, highlight po yan ng lower House saka ng Senate. Other than that kasi yong iba naman personal relationship, family, so magse-stay po talaga siguro sila don, he added. , so they would likely stay.)

Bienvenido Abante Jr. on Friday lashed out at some vloggers who insinuated that lawmakers are dimwits, firing back by saying that these social media personalities are stupid because they write without thinking. At the House of Representatives tri-committees hearing, Abante grilled vlogger MJ Quiambao-Reyes due to her claim that there were no extrajudicial killings that happened during the Duterte administrations drug war. Abante also quizzed Reyes due to her claim that many in the government are part of criminal forces and are stupid. Thank you very much for saying that the post has nothing to do with me, but the criminal forces that you are referring to, they claim that we are part of it. Please think deeply, this is so hard Mr. Chair, some of these bloggers are really stupid, Abante said in Filipino. Its the government who is stupid? Think better, dont just write whatever you want to write. Youre telling us that we are criminal forces, I want to say now publicly, you are stupid, he added. Abang Lingkod party-list Rep. Joseph Stephen Paduano then moved that the Manila lawmakers words be stricken from the record Mr. Chairman, just a matter of protocol, may I move to strike out the statement of Chairman Abante, addressed to MJ [Reyes], Paduano said in his motion, which was approved by presiding officer and Surigao del Sur 2nd District Rep. Johnny Pimentel after it was seconded. Abante explained that his outburst stemmed from Reyes not being able to explain where she got the claims that lawmakers were part of a criminal group. At this point, Reyes was already crying. I rest Mr. Chair and thank you so much, Im not angry at you MJ, were just ferreting the truth here, he said. Okay your Honor but again, I dont understand where you are getting the idea that you are part of the criminal forces, Reyes said. But youre the one who wrote it. My goodness, Abante fired back. Prior to this exchange, Abante and Paduano already called out Reyes for her claims on EJKs being a hoax as the vlogger was unable to present documentary evidence to back up her claims. Abante said that aside from the Commission on Human Rights, his panel, the House committee on human rights, also verified the existence of drug war victims and possible EJKs.

Vloggers apologize to lawmakers for spreading false claims,"MANILA, Philippines Two vloggers apologized to House lawmakers after they were confronted with evidence that ran contrary to their claims. At one point during the House tri-committee hearing on Friday, MJ Quiambao-Reyes apologized to Manila 6th District Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr. for claiming that extrajudicial killings in the Duterte administrations drug war were a hoax, and that those who criticized former President Rodrigo Duterte were funded by drug cartels, terrorists, and corrupt politicians. READ: Vlogger says EJKs a hoax, but fails to present documentary evidence Abante warned Reyes that if she would not apologize for her misleading claims, he would move to cite the vlogger for contempt. Miss MJ, you are accountable to the victims, and you are accountable to us in the quad committee. You made us, the victims, appear like liars, so if you do not apologize right now you listen if you do not apologize, I am going to make a motion to hold you in contempt, Abante said. I apologize sir and as I said earlier, next time I would look for proof first and we would not rely on news reports only, Reyes replied. Mr. Chair, this is the second time that Miss MJ has apologized. I hope that next time, you vloggers, do not hastily give opinions based on your impressions. Give out the truth. If you have documents, use it because we have documents to show, Abante said. Before throwing questions to Reyes, Abante asked Krizette Laureta Chu, a journalist who also maintains a political blog, if she would be willing to apologize or clarify her claim that many police officers were about to resign after the International Criminal Court took custody of former President Rodrigo Duterte. During Tingog party-list Rep. Jude Acidres time to ask questions, Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation Detection Group chief Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III clarified that there was no mass resignation among police officers. This prompted Acidre to ask Chu where she got her information. Do you believe that Ms. Krizette? Do you believe the statement of General Torre? Abante asked. Yes sir, because he has the insider information, I believe him, sir, Chu replied. Would you now please write something about that? Even if you do not apologize, would you now please write that you believe the statement of GeneralTorre? Would you please write that? Abante asked. Yes, sir, I will write to you that according to the PNP, there were no mass resignations due to the Duterte arrest, Chu promised. Abante then pointed out that this also indicated that Chu was wrong. Antipolo 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop also scolded Chu for questioning lawmakers who can send their children to study abroad. According to Acop, none of his children studied abroad. When Chu reasoned out that she was not referring to Acop, the Antipolo-based lawmaker said the vloggers statements were general and could be intended for anyone. Now, the lesson I would like to give to you is that whenever you come up with your post, you should not generalize because when you say congressmen, you are referring to all. That was not my intention sir, Chu said. Why did you write it? Thats why I said the lesson you should have learned today is do not generalize in your posts, Acop explained.

P3.3 million equipment to cut Apayao farmers production costs,"BAGUIO CITY The provincial government of Apayao on Friday said the assistance recently provided by the Department of Agrarian Reform to farmers will help cut the cost of crop production and ensure higher gains. Malaki ang maitutulong nga mga ganyang supply galing sa gobyerno para sa mga magsasaka dahil mapapabilis ang pagtatanim at pag-harvest nila ng pananim, at magiging cost effective din dahil mas liliit ang mga bayarin sa pagtatrabaho sa taniman, Apayao Governor Elias Bulut Jr. said in a message to the Philippine News Agency. The DAR said in a media release on Friday that it recently turned over a total of P3.3 million worth of farm machinery and equipment to six agrarian reform beneficiary organizations in Apayao.

Iyong pag prepare na lang ng lupa bago magtanim kapag na-mechanize malaking bagay para sa farmers natin, he said. Bulut said the assistance has proven that a cut in the cost of production helps farmers increase their monetary yield, which their families can use for childrens education, and for medical and other basic needs. The DAR distributed heavy-duty hand tractors, tractors with rotavators, tractor-mounted corn seeders with trailers, stand-alone corn seeders, water pumps, knapsack sprayers, rotary tillers and brush tillers.

Remulla made the pronouncement when asked about Roques role in The Hague or whether a case has also been filed against him before the ICC The Department of Justice is more than sufficient to defend the government over former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest by the International Criminal Court , Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla on Wednesday said. He made this statement after noting that Solicitor General Menardo Guevarras decision to recuse himself from the consolidated habeas corpus cases filed by Dutertes children before the Supreme Court was not on his clearance. Malacaang on Wednesday said the government is considering regulating social media posts, amid the spread of misinformation and disinformation in the wake of former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest and surrender to the International Criminal Court .

"1Pacman lauded for budget hike, more assistance from Pantawid Pamilya","MANILA, Philippines Bohol townsfolk sought the continued provision of assistance to the needy under the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program and thanked the 1Pacman Party-list for the recent increase in budget to reach more needy families for 2025. In a recent multi-sectoral outreach activity in Tagbilaran City, 1Pacman Party-list first nominee Milka Romero said she continued to receive grateful messages from groups which had benefited from the cash assistance program. At the same time, she said, they sought out support for the continued funding of the program in the coming budget season. Romero is chairman of 1Pacman Party-list in charge of its socio-civic and outreach programs carried out by her father, Rep. Mikee Romero, who was entrusted with three consecutive terms. Rep. Romero was one of the principal authors of Republic Act 11310, the 4Ps Law, a landmark law that has immediate impact on poverty reduction. Last year, as chairman of the House Committee on Poverty Alleviation, he successfully worked for the increase in 4Ps budget by P7.8 billion, widening its reach to needy families and enabling them to get out of the poverty cycle. Over nine years, 1Pacman authored and co-sponsored some 144 laws including the high profile Eddie Garcia Law which protects workers in the entertainment and film industries, and the law forming the state-of-the-art Philippine Sports Training Center, now referred to as the National Academy of Sports. The younger Romero is an active, multi-awarded socio-civic, business and sports leader, who has two professional sports teams under her care. She co-owns with her sister Mandy the Capital1 Solar Spikers which plays in the Premier Volleyball League, and the newly-formed Capital1 Solar Strikers which is in the roster of womens teams playing football under the PFF. Bundled with education, health and nutrition, as well as jobs generation is 1Pacmans solid advocacy for sports and youth development. On the sidelines, she cheerily urged townsfolk attending 1Pacman gatherings in Tagbilaran City to remember who were among their first support groups as young people. Ang mga kalaro, kasama na rin ang mga ka-eskwela! , Romero said as she continued to narrate that team members for neighborhood games and barangay leagues usually become lifetime friends. Romero, also a former womens football national team player as well as co-captain for the Ateneo womens football team, pointed out the value of having positive social interaction among the youth through sports, especially in these times when the young people spend so much time using their cellphones and computers. The proper development of sports programs all over the country is a big step toward having active citizens who are not just physically fit but also socially capable and mentally alert, said Romero. In Tagbilaran City, the younger Romer addressed multiple sectors fishing communities and their families, senior citizens, women leaders, young professionals, as well as prison inmates and mapped out the lines intersecting nutrition and food security, education, and job opportunities, with those leading to sports growth and development. All these sectors have their particular needs, but the essentials of education, health including food and nutrition, access to livelihood cannot be overlooked, said the young Romero. She said these needs have to be addressed to bring the country closer to 1-Pacmans target of enlivening the conduct of sports nationwide. Thus, we are also exerting more effort to reach more women to enable them to have a stronger voice for themselves and families benefit, she said. At the Tagbilaran City Jail, wedding ceremonies were conducted for women who are Persons Deprived of Liberty and their chosen spouses in a Kasalan ng Bayan program by Mayor Jane Yap. Romero took up the role of ninang or godparent to the couples who decided to legalize their union. Romero was also a special guest during rites and celebration of the Saulog Festival in honor of Tagbilaran Citys patron saint, St. Joseph the Worker, and in the 460th Blood Compact commemoration last March 16. She visited Batasan Island in Tubigon town, accompanied by former Tagbilaran Mayor Baba Yap and former Tubigon Mayor Marlon Amita, and listened to the concerns of residents.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045381/1pacman-lauded-for-budget-hike-more-assistance-from-4ps,others

Imee insists govt had prior talks with ICC about Dutertes arrest,"MANILA, Philippines - Contrary to the administrations claims, there had already been discussions between the Marcos administration and the International Criminal Court about the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte. This was according to Sen. Imee Marcos, who on Thursday based this on a copy of the diffusion notice from the International Criminal Police Organization . READ: Duterte arrest: Marcos Cabinet members deny assisting ICC So maliwanag tama po na dumating ng 3:04 ng umaga. Ang liwanag. Ang request dito [ay] after prior consultation with the government of the Philippines. So hindi totoo na March 11 [ng] 3 am niyo lang nalaman. Kasi nakasabi rito sa page 1 [ay] after prior consultation with the Philippines who have agreed to comply with this request, said Marcos. Ibig sabihin ang pamahalaan ay nakausap na una. Ikalawa sumang ayon na, so ibig sabihin ito formal transmittal lang. Walang sinasabi dito na biglaan ito. Kaya nga March 10 pa lang pitong libong pulis na ang mino-mobilize, she added. Marcos disclosure came after members of the administrations Cabinet insisted that there was zero communication between the government and the international tribunal. Later into the hearing, Marcos presented copies of an Interpol diffusion and red notice. She said these two are entirely different things. Ibang iba po yun. Ni walang red notice at yung diffusion ay parang tinimbre lang sa Interpol na mga miyembro at hindi dinaan mismong review, said Marcos. Philippine Center on Transnational Crime Executive Director Anthony Alcantara explained that a diffusion is a standardized request to arrest, detain, or restrict movement of the accused. Pero hindi po ibig sabihin non na wala siyang value, said Alcantara. Whether it is a red notice or wanted person diffusion, obligado po tayong mag comply, he added. Alcantara, for his part, confirmed that there was no red notice issued prior to Dutertes arrest. Gaya po ng sinabi ko kanina, ang diffusion po at looking for wanted persons [ay] pareho lang po ng red notice, said Alcantara. Marcos, however, argued that these two are different things, proceeding to question if the Philippine government has an obligation to the Interpol, noting that it was only a diffusion notice and yet the government immediately acted on it. Katulad din po yan ng ibang red notices na hindi natin nakukuha. Hindi ko po masasagot ang gagawin ng Interpol sa atin, pero ang masasabi ko ay we have to comply with both diffusion and the red notice. We need to, said Alcantara. Duterte was served an arrest warrant from the ICC upon arriving at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Hong Kong on March 11.

Ortega agrees with Escudero to study more about VP impeachment case,"MANILA, Philippines La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V said Senate President Francis Escudero gave him good advice when the latter told him to study the impeachment proceedings further as he agreed that lawmakers should learn more about the merits and processes of the complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte. Ortega, during a press briefing on Thursday, said that he sees Escuderos statements as an elder brothers advice as the Senate leader is already a tenured member of Congress. Escudero on Wednesday said that Ortega should study more the rules of Congress and laws surrounding impeachment proceedings after the House lawmaker questioned why the Senate can conduct hearings but cannot start the trial of Duterte. READ: Study more about VP impeachment trial, Escudero tells Ortega Maganda po yong advice niya sa akin, maganda rin po yong payong kuya ang tawag don kasi dapat po talaga mag-study pa more tayong lahat lalong-lalong na po dito sa magyayaring impeachment na trial kasi nga po hindi pa rin humihinto yong mga legal opinions, kaliwa kanan po ang mga naririnig nating legal opinions, tuloy-tuloy po yong public discourse, Ortega said.

Ortega also clarified that he is not a member of the prosecution team and that he is only voicing out his opinions on Dutertes impending trial. Yong sakin naman, hindi po ako prosecutor, para klaro po sa lahat. So siguro naman po yung opinion ko hindi mag-jeopardize ng case. Siguro ang point lang ni SP Chiz , kasi nga po diba pag nili-limit po na yong mga prosecutors eh magbigay po ng komentaryo at magdagdag po outside of the hindi pa po nangyayaring impeachment, Ortega noted. , is that they want to limit prosecutors and senator-judges from making commentaries and go outside of the still impending impeachment trial.) Pero sa side ko lang naman po, ang pagboboses naman po ng opinion is maganda para we are keeping alive yong practice po at saka itong kahalagaan ng free speech,saka buhay po yong topic ng impeachment sa ating lahat, he added. Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5, after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint, hinged on several issues such as the alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a Vice President. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate, as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5 which means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. Previously, Escudero said that the trial would start by July 30 with the new set of lawmakers after the 2025 midterm elections sitting as senator-judges.

Municipal fishing crisis deepens,"MANILA, Philippines The waves off the Philippine coast have always provided a lifeline for millions of small-scale fishers. But in recent months, a legal storm has threatened that lifeline. A controversial Supreme Court First Division ruling issued in August 2024 overturned long-standing protections for municipal waters, allowing commercial fishing vessels to operate within the 15-kilometer zone previously reserved for small-scale fishers. The decision stemmed from a legal challenge filed by Mercidar Fishing Corp. on October 25, 2023, against fishing restrictions in municipal waters. Less than two months later, the Malabon Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of Mercidar, nullifying municipal control over commercial fishing in the 15-km zone and lifting the ban on commercial fishing in waters shallower than 12.8 meters. The Supreme Court upheld this decision on August 19, 2024, citing the Office of the Solicitor Generals late appeal. READ: Petition filed vs SC ruling on big-scale fishing in town waters Studies indicate that if the ruling stands, municipal fishers could be left with just 2 percent of their traditional fishing grounds, while 98 percent of the countrys waters would be open to commercial fishing vessels. With fisheries production at its lowest in two decades, many fear this ruling will accelerate the decline of marine resources and threaten the livelihoods of coastal communities. For generations, municipal waters those extending 15 kilometers from the shoreline have been the exclusive domain of small-scale fishers. This preferential access, enshrined in the Fisheries Code of 1998, was designed to ensure the sustainability of marine ecosystems and protect the livelihood of artisanal fishers. But with the Supreme Courts ruling nullifying key provisions of the law, commercial fishing fleets now have legal footing to encroach on these once-protected waters. Local officials are raising alarm over the rulings environmental and economic impact. Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson warned that allowing commercial vessels into municipal waters could destroy crab habitats in the Guimaras Strait and Visayan Sea, both vital to the regions fishing industry. In Iloilo, municipal leaders including those from Carles, Ajuy, and Estancia fear that artisanal fishers, who rely on sustainable fishing practices, will struggle to compete with large commercial fleets. The decline in fish stocks is already evident. In 2024, fisheries production dropped to 4.05 million metric tons, a 5 percent decrease from 2023 and the lowest in two decades, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority . The biggest decline was in marine municipal fisheries, which saw an 8.8 percent drop from 879,960 metric tons in 2023 to 802,770 metric tons in 2024. Meanwhile, commercial fisheries output grew by 4.2 percent to 857,330 metric tons, emphasizing the widening gap between small-scale and large-scale fishers. READ: Fish harvest drops to lowest amid legal fight over municipal waters Experts warn that the continued encroachment of commercial fishing vessels into municipal waters will accelerate fish stock depletion, particularly for species such as sardines and anchovies, which are critical to food security and the fishing economy. Overfishing, habitat destruction, and bycatch could further destabilize marine ecosystems, making it harder for municipal fishers to earn a living. READ: Scientists urge SC: Protect fisherfolks rights, municipal waters Fearing economic and environmental fallout, LGUs have launched legal and political challenges to the ruling. All 19 mayors from the League of Municipalities of the Philippines Surigao del Sur and the 13 mayors from the Alliance of LGUs along Samar Bays and Channels have signed resolutions supporting the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources , and the OSG in their bid to reverse the SC decision. READ: BFAR appeals SC ruling allowing commercial fishing in municipal waters In Iloilo, the provincial government filed a motion on February 21 to intervene in BFARs appeal for reconsideration. Other municipalitiesincluding Carles, Oton, Ajuy, Anilao, Barotac Nuevo, Barotac Viejo, Batad, Concepcion, Dumangas, San Dionisio, San Joaquin, Guimbal, Miagao, Tigbauan, and Estanciahave also urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to take action to protect small-scale fishers. Similarly, the municipality of Santa Fe has joined international marine protection group Oceana and civil society groups in a petition filed on January 2 to remand the case to the lower court so affected communities can be recognized as indispensable parties. The municipality of Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro, led by Mayor Walter Marquez, filed another motion for intervention on January 24, alongside civil society groups and peoples organizations. Oceana Acting Vice President Rose-Liza Eisma-Osorio emphasized the significance of LGUs uniting to fight the ruling. Rather than compete with each others resources, the local governments opted to collaborate, ultimately benefiting their communities, she said, adding that their collective effort underscores the importance of municipal waters to the food and livelihood security of coastal communities. Antique Vice Governor Edgar Denosta has urged the Supreme Court to reconsider, warning that allowing commercial vessels in municipal waters will deplete fish stocks. In Libertad, Antique, Mayor Mary Jean Te, who also leads the Libertad, Pandan, Sebaste, and Culasi Bay-Wide Management Council, emphasized the challenges that small fishers will face if they must compete with large-scale operators. Meanwhile, Del Carmen officials in Surigao del Norte have echoed the sentiments of municipal fisherfolk, urging the Supreme Court and the President to uphold the preferential rights of small-scale fishers and regulate commercial fishing operations. The legal dispute over commercial fishing in municipal waters continues as LGUs, fisherfolk, and advocacy groups oppose the controversial ruling and seek answers about the statutory authority given to local governments and preferential rights of municipal fisherfolk, said Osorio. With motions pending before the Supreme Court, the fate of municipal fisheries remains uncertain. If the ruling stands, commercial fleets will gain unprecedented access to coastal fishing grounds, further pushing thousands of small-scale fishers to the margins. If overturned, it would restore protections that have long been in place to balance economic survival with ecological sustainability. For now, coastal communities remain resolute. The fishers who have relied on the sea for generations refuse to surrender without a fight. As the Supreme Court deliberates, the future of the countrys marine resources and the communities that depend on them hangs in the balance. Graphics by Ed Lustan/Inquirer.net.

Duterte supporters used other rally photos to deceive solons,"MANILA, Philippines Two ranking House lawmakers have expressed doubts about social media posts regarding recent rallies staged to protest the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte, saying there were instances when photos of other gatherings were used. During a press briefing on Thursday, La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V and Lanao del Sur 1st District Rep. Zia Alonto Adiong said there seemed to be an attempt to deceive people into thinking that massive rallies were staged to call out Dutertes arrest. The rallies were supposedly held to protest the implementation of the International Criminal Courts arrest order against Duterte last March 11. According to Ortega, people need to be discerning about the spread of misinformation and disinformation about pro-Duterte rallies. I saw videos of the demonstration and rally. The lights used were colored pink. I have not seen any rally theres only one group that staged big demonstrations and rallies that used pink as a background light, he said in Filipino. So at that moment, I said it appears questionable already. As I have said, this information should be verified, he added. When pressed if he believed the images posted by Duterte supporters belonged to the rallies of former Vice President Leni Robredo who famously used pink as her motif in the 2022 presidential race Ortega said he was not saying that it came from this political side. However, Ortega said that further investigation might be needed to ascertain if the Robredo campaigns videos and photos along with other rallies were used to make it seem that a lot of people were calling out Dutertes arrest. I am not saying that it came from them, I am just saying that the light used was pink. But I think journalists can check on this, as to where the photos were sourced because its up there, he explained in Filipino. So if you Google any rally, you can collage these photos, post these spliced images, and thats it, he added. Adiong, meanwhile, said there seemed to be an intention to deceive people into thinking that massive civil unrest was ongoing. The lawmaker, who hails from Mindanao, acknowledged that there were people protesting Dutertes arrest near his area, especially since the former president hails from Davao City. However, the protest movements were an exercise of free speech and not meant to spread unrest. Theres already the deceit eh, the intention to deceive. So thats what we need to counter, there is an intention to deceive to divert discussions and reach a point where you would no longer agree because in the first place, the information is not correct and accurate, he said. Like in Mindanao, there are rallies staged there, we have seen it. But these are all gatherings to share their opinion. But as to a widespread [unrest], there is none. So we really have to counter the fake news because other people even foreigners might believe that there is really civil unrest, he added. There has been a deluge of misinformation and disinformation since Duterte was arrested on the order of the ICC. On its social media pages, GMA News fact-checked a post using its footage, which made it seem that thousands of people attended a prayer rally for Duterte in Cebu City. GMA News clarified that the footage was taken during the Sinulog Festival in January 2025. Other lawmakers also called out misinformation and disinformation on social media networks. Ortega previously said the massive spread of misinformation and disinformation after Duterte was taken into custody by the International Criminal Court only brings shame to the Philippines. He was referring to the many social media posts containing fake information and even hate speech against foreign institutions like the ICC. Duterte supporters also harassed ICC Judge Lulia Motoc and made degrading comments about her. There were also posts falsely claiming that Motoc shared a photo with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s wife, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos. Also, Ortega said there have been false narratives on social media, including those from former Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, who claimed that Duterte was missing and was not given the proper medical care. READ: Spread offakenewsafter Duterte arrest brings shame to PH Ortega Last week, Iloilo 1st District Rep. Janette Garin said Medialdea was spreading misinformation, noting that her prior experience working with the Dutch people showed that they are very meticulous and considerate regarding the health and welfare of people.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045528/duterte-supporters-used-other-rally-photos-to-deceive-solons,others

"Bato dela Rosa, et. al: Cast of characters in Duterte drug war","MANILA, PhilippinesThe application for a warrant of arrest against former president Rodrigo Duterte is clearthe killings alleged to have been committed from Nov. 1, 2011 to March 16, 2019 were not carried out by just one man. Based on a document released by the International Criminal Court on its website, there are nine individuals tagged as co-perpetrators of Duterte in committing a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population. Duterte and his co-perpetrators shared a common plan or agreement to target alleged criminals in the Philippines , the document read. But while the names have been redacted in the document shared by the ICC on March 13, lawyer Neri Colmenares, counsel for the victims, told INQUIRER.net that these could be generals who implemented Dutertes war on drugs. READ: Dela Rosa, 4 others now suspects in ICC drug war case Trillanes Last year, former Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV posted a document from the ICC that identified Sen. Ronald Bato dela Rosa, retired police chief Oscar Albayalde, and three other former police officials as suspects in the case against Duterte. Dela Rosa, who was chief of the Philippine National Police from 2016 to 2018, is considered as the architect of the war on drugs, which has killed 6,000 to 30,000 Filipinos. Albayalde succeeded him until 2019. As lawyer and ICC assistant to counsel Kristina Conti said, Dela Rosa and Albayalde could be the next to receive arrest warrants from the ICC for crimes against humanity allegedly committed when Duterte was mayor of Davao City and president of the Philippines. READ: Bato dela Rosa, Oscar Albayalde next on ICC arrest list? Colmenares, however, said generals who were regional and provincial directors could be next, as well, pointing out that in the preliminary examination by the Office of the Prosecutor in 2019, the names of Dela Rosa and other high-ranking police officials had already been mentioned. Lawyer Rodel Taton told INQUIRER.net that Dela Rosa, having played the role as PNP chief in the first years of the war on drugs may really become a subject of the situation under the ICC jurisdiction, similarly with Duterte, who was arrested on March 11. READ: Duterte arrest petition cites dela Rosas role in drug war It was Dela Rosa who signed on July 1, 2016 Command Memorandum Circular No. 16-216, the document that operationalized Oplan Tokhang and ordered the police to neutralize and negate drug suspects. He served as director of the Davao City Police Office, too, from 2012 to 2013. Dela Rosa is one of the few individuals identified by the OTP in its application for a warrant of arrest against Duterte, saying that he developed and implemented a style of police operation called Tokhang. RELATED STORY: Dutertes ICC arrest: Separating fact from lies He was later succeeded as police chief of Davao City by Vicente Danao, who was eventually designated as director of the Manila Police District from 2018 to 2019 and the National Capital Region Police Office from 2020 to 2022. Danao, who was likewise identified in the document for his role in the Davao City Police Office from 2013 to 2016, became the officer-in-charge of the PNP in the last months of Duterte as president until Aug. 1, 2022. Now, who could be the rest of the co-perpetrators identified in the document? No ones certain yet, but for a lookback, here are some of the individuals who had a key role in Dutertes war on drugs, at least based on the document shared by Trillanes last year: Albayalde was the one who led the PNP after Dela Rosa, who had to retire in 2018. He recalibrated Oplan Tokhang, but was later implicated in the issue of police officers recycling drugs seized in a police operation to be sold. Caramat was the police chief of Bulacan when the single bloodiest night in Dutertes war on drugs took place, with 32 individuals killed in 67 police operations conducted all over the province. RELATED STORY: PNP generals pressured to testify vs Duterte? Thats gossip, solon says He served as police director from 2016 to 2018 before becoming head of the PNP Counter-Intelligence Task Force and PNP Intelligence Group from 2018 to 2019 and chief of the PNP Drug Enforcement Group from 2019 to 2020. Last year, Caramat, who likewise headed the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, allegedly offered to expose everything he knew about Dutertes war on drugs in exchange for the top post at the PNP. Leonardo is a retired police colonel, who was allegedly endorsed by former PCSO general manager Royina Garma to Duterte to implement his drug war in 2016, which is said to have been characterized by a reward system. READ: Leonardo confirms drug war rewards Before this, Leonardo has been identified by confessed Davao Death Squad hitman Arturo Lascaas as an alleged member of the DSS, which the ICC said is a part of police and non-police hitmen. While he previously denied Garmas statement, he eventually confirmed the existence of a cash reward system that fueled Dutertes war on drugs. Leonardo served as commissioner for the National Police Commission after his retirement. Mata served as chief intelligence officer, as identified by the ICC, and was designated last year as chief of the PNP DEG. As stated in the application for a warrant of arrest against Duterte, the OTP said Duterte and his co-perpetrators knew that their conduct was part of, or intended their conduct to be part of, an attack against civilians in the Philippines. Later in the warrant issued by the Pre-Trial Chamber I, the ICC said there was indeed an attack on civilians based on an organizational policy while Duterte was the head of the Davao Death Squad, and to a State policy while he was president of the Philippines. RELATED STORY: Trillanes: ICC requests Interpol blue notice for PNP execs linked to drug war Sheerah Escudero, the sister of Ephraim Escudero, who was last seen in Laguna and was found dead in Pampanga after five days, said Dela Rosa and those responsible for the killings in the drug war are soaked in blood of the Filipino people. They should be held accountable together with Duterte, she told INQUIRER.net, pointing out that we can never move on from how the government disrespected peoples lives and human rights. She said they killed my brother in September 2017, at the height of the drug war. He disappeared in Laguna and was found in Pampanga with his head wrapped in packaging tape, and his hands and feet tied. He was killed vigilante style, Escudero said as she pointed out that her brother had three gunshot wounds in the head.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045297/bato-dela-rosa-et-al-cast-of-characters-in-duterte-drug-war,others
Zapped gecko in power grid blamed for blackout at Duterte Bohol rally,"TAGBILARAN CITY A prayer rally for former President Rodrigo Duterte in Trinidad town, Bohol, on Monday was interrupted by a power outage for about an hour. The electrical failure outraged the supporters of former President Rodrigo Duterte holding the gathering. But according to the Bohol Electric Cooperative II, the power interruption was not intentional, contrary to what Dutertes supporters claimed. The culprit: an electrocuted tuko or gecko. Boheco II, in a post on Facebook on Wednesday, showed a photo of the dead gecko stuck in its electric system. Around 2,000 people in Trinidad joined the event for Duterte at the Motropoll Ground when the electricity tripped twice. Attendees used candles as prayers by pastors and speeches by leading fraternities and brotherhood groups continued. The rally ended peacefully but some attendees expressed disappointment over the power outage. Some particularly blamed Bohol Gov. Erico Aristotle Aumentado for it. But Boheco II said the power outage that struck at 8:31 p.m. last Monday had nothing to do with the local government. Aside from Trinidad, the blackout also affected the towns of Bien Unido and some areas in Ubay. Electricity was restored at 9:29 p.m. The provincial government of Bohol released a statement on March 19, saying Aumentado had nothing to do with the power outage. We categorically deny the allegation. Such incident never happened, it noted. The Bohol local government denounced in the strongest possible terms the nature of the insinuation that is meant to sow division among our people. It said it supports the peoples right to assembly and expression. We attach great importance to the aforementioned rights in driving clean governance as championed by Governor Aumentado, it said. Duterte, 79, was arrested last March 11 under an ICC warrant over allegations of crimes against humanity. This stemmed from the war on illegal drugs he waged during his term as president from 2016 to 2022.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2045633/zapped-gecko-in-power-grid-blamed-for-blackout-at-duterte-bohol-rally,others

"DDS hit men Matobato, Lascaas as ICC witnesses vs Duterte: Who are they?","MANILA, PhilippinesEdgar Matobato and Arturo Lascaas were once hit men of the Davao Death Squad , and now that Rodrigo Duterte is already at the International Criminal Court for alleged murder as a crime against humanity, a lawyer said their testimony would really be significant. Kristina Conti, ICC assistant to counsel, told INQUIRER.net, that they could be [witnesses] because they are insiders who can talk about the planning, implementation, and even the participants in the whole DDS operations. RELATED STORY: ICC confirms appointment of Nicholas Kaufman as Duterte lead counsel Yes, she said when asked if the testimonies of Matobato and Lascaas would carry significant weight against Duterte, who was arrested on the basis of a warrant from the ICC on March 11. READ: EXPLAINER: Brutal attacks on civilians hauled Rodrigo Duterte to The Hague Matobato, a confessed hit man, said in a Senate committee investigation in 2016 that it was Duterte who created the DDS, a group of police and non-police hit men tasked with killing criminals and crime suspects, when Duterte was still mayor of Davao City. Back in 1982 to 1988, Matobato was a member of the Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Unit in Davao, but Duterte recruited him into the Lambada Boys, which later became DDS. A document from the ICC stated that Duterte personally instructed DDS groups that their mission was to kill criminals. As a hit man, Matobato said he had killed at least 50 people until he withdrew in 2013. However, he was tortured for a week until he escaped and hid in the provinces of Cebu, Samar, and Leyte. He surrendered to a regional office of the Commission on Human Rights in 2014, but he was told it could not protect him. READ: Visiting priest: Dont forget EJK whistleblowers Matobato and Lascaas Because of this, he and his wife went to Manila to seek witness protection from the Department of Justice, but as Duterte won as president in 2016, he said he went into hiding in some provinces in Luzon until he volunteered to be at the Senate investigation in 2016. A year later, however, a warrant of arrest was issued against him for a non-bailable charge of kidnapping over an incident in 2002. Since then, he again went into hiding until he left the Philippines with his wife and two stepchildren in the second quarter of 2024. RELATED STORY: Bato dela Rosa, et. al: Cast of characters in Duterte drug war Former Sen. Leila De Lima, in a previous radio interview, said Matobato left because the ICCs Office of the Prosecutor had to access him for its investigation of Dutertes war on drugs, stating that he is under protective custody now of the ICC in an undisclosed location. It was Matobatos lawyer, Jude Sabio, who filed one of the first complaints against Duterte at the ICC. However, it was later withdrawn for political reasons. A police officer when Duterte became mayor, Lascaas was assigned to the Anti-Crime Unit of the Davao City Police Office, which is said to be the birthplace of the DDS. He was l part of the core group and his main job was to plan the operations. He stated in an interview in 2017 that he received an allowance of P100,000 every month, but signed a receipt for only half of the amount. He used the rest at his own disposal, giving some of it to almost 12 other people who helped him in his work. Lascaas said he killed 200 people in his 20 years as a hit man. READ: EJK victims mom: Duterte arrest not enough as Dela Rosa, Albayalde still free But in 2015, he suffered from kidney disease that required dialysis. This marked his breakaway with the DDS, and as he said, he prayed and promised God that if you extend my life, I will tell the whole truth, I would not take it with me to the grave. RELATED STORY: Interview with confessed hit man Arturo Lascaas It was in 2016 when he started writing, in longhand, a no-holds-barred confession regarding the DDS, but in a Senate investigation in the same year, he dismissed as lies the allegations made by Matobato, who linked him to the EJKs allegedly committed by the DDS. It took a few months for him to say that it was him who lied, explaining in a 12-page affidavit that it was because of fear. I was forced to deny what Matobato said even if most of it was true, because I was afraid for the safety and security of my loved ones in Davao City, he said. READ: Dutertes ICC arrest: Separating fact from lies Last year, he said he had already given his testimony before investigators from the ICC when it conducted its pre-trial investigation in 2022.

Wasted catch: The hidden crisis of fish loss in Samar Sea,"MANILA, PhilippinesFor generations, the Samar Sea has been a lifeline for coastal communities in Northern Samar and Samar provinces. Fishing is not just an occupation; it is a way of life, a means of survival, and a cultural heritage passed down through generations. But beneath the waves, a silent crisis is unfolding one that threatens both food security and livelihood. A recent study commissioned by Oceana has revealed that up to 40 percent of fish caught in these waters never make it to consumers plates, lost to spoilage, improper handling, and market inefficiencies. This staggering waste known as postharvest fish loss represents more than just spoiled seafood. It is a blow to small-scale fishers struggling with declining incomes, a threat to nutrition in some of the countrys poorest regions, and a symptom of a larger systemic failure in the Philippines fisheries sector. Postharvest fish loss occurs when fish deteriorates in quality, loses market value, or is discarded entirely before it can be sold. In the Samar Sea, the Oceana study found that the average postharvest fish loss is 38.39 percent in municipalities along the San Bernardino Strait and 40.34 percent in those along Samar Bays and Channels. The species most wasted are sardines, anchovies, and slipmouth staples in the diets of low-income households. For communities where 75.1 percent of Northern Samars population and 60.5 percent of Samars population have experienced food insecurity, these losses are devastating. This is not an isolated problem. Across the Philippines, postharvest fish losses have long plagued the industry. A study published in 2022 found that the country loses up to 40% of its total fisheries output due to spoilage, handling issues, and lack of storage infrastructure. The situation in Samar mirrors a national crisis that has yet to see meaningful intervention. READ: PH post-harvest fish losses need more than band-aid solutions, govt told Its alarming that almost half of the fish catch is lost before they are landed or rots before they are sold, Oceana Philippines Vice President lawyer Gloria Estenzo Ramos said previously. When we address this, imagine how much of a positive difference this will make for coastal communities and the lives of poor families, she added. Oceana pointed to multiple causes of postharvest fish loss in the Samar Sea: Despite government initiatives like the Community Fish Landing Centers , meant to improve fish storage and marketing, these facilities remain underutilized. Many lack proper cold storage and processing equipment, rendering them ineffective in solving the problem. The irony is hard to ignore: while fish is lost at alarming rates, the very communities catching them suffer from malnutrition. According to the National Nutrition Council, high rates of stunting, wasting, and iodine deficiency in Northern Samar and Samar indicate insufficient protein and fish intake. If even half of the lost fish was salvaged through better handling and infrastructure, it could significantly improve food availability and nutrition in these provinces. Fish species like anchovies, sardines, and rabbitfish are rich in protein, Vitamin A, and iron nutrients that could help combat undernutrition in the region. Oceana previously noted that in addition to suffering from malnourishment, municipal and artisanal fishers across the country who produce nutritious food face food insecurity and continue to be among the poorest of the poor. [D]espite the availability of locally caught fish, food security and fish consumption is decreasing over time, particularly in low-income and rural households, because of the increasing price of food, a growing population, unsustainable development, and impacts from natural disasters , and lingering effects of the pandemic, the group said. Hence, it strongly recommends to prioritize the sustainable management of our fisheries and the wellbeing of artisanal fisherfolks for food and nutritional security and livelihoods to reduce hunger and poverty incidence in the Philippines. According to the study, addressing postharvest fish loss requires a comprehensive approach rooted in effective policies and infrastructure development. Establishing robust fish catch monitoring and reporting systems is crucial to ensure accurate data collection and inform sustainable management strategies. Training women and mobile peddlers in postharvest handling and processing could help minimize quality loss and improve income opportunities within fishing communities. Additionally, implementing organized marketing systems would strengthen market linkages between fishers, aquafarmers, and buyers, reducing inefficiencies in the supply chain. Investment in cold storage and processing facilities is another key solution suggested by Oceana, providing year-round access to fresh seafood while minimizing spoilage. Meanwhile, refurbishing non-operational CFLCs into multi-purpose storage and processing hubs could help address infrastructure gaps. Introducing area- and species-specific price regulations would also stabilize fish prices and protect fisherfolk from market force losses. On a broader scale, the group recommended integrating the fisheries sector into KADIWA stores to enhance market access for small-scale fishers, making nutrient-rich fish more available to underserved communities. Moreover, utilizing readily available fish species in nutritional programs, particularly for addressing wasting, stunting, and micronutrient deficiencies, could also help combat malnutrition in coastal regions: A promising model for reducing postharvest fish loss can be found in Daram, Samar, where a P249.8 million investment has been set in motion to support coastal communities and minimize fish wastage. Daram, which has the longest coastline and largest municipal waters in the Samar Sea, heavily depends on fishing. However, its fisherfolk have long faced issues such as a lack of storage facilities, market instability, and climate change impacts on fish supply and livelihoods. Based on Oceanas study findings, the fish trading system in Daram, where many catches are sold at sea, is a major contributor to the postharvest fish losses in Samar. This leads to unrecorded landings and price fluctuations. To counter these challenges, the local government and fisherfolk, with assistance from Oceana and national agencies, have developed a five-year plan to cut postharvest losses from 40 percent to 10 percent. This initiative includes: The local plan in Daram supports President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s Philippine Development Plan to manage harvest waste, said Oceana Philippines campaign and research director Rhea Yray-Frossard. The project aims to prevent loss of essential fish nutrients and wastage of fish catch during peak seasons by establishing facilities that support proper handling, processing, and storage, she noted. Vice Mayor Lucia Astorg acknowledged that while Daram has vast marine resources, a lack of cold storage, drying facilities, and organized market access has led to fish wastage. Additionally, the seasonality of sardines results in drastic price fluctuations, forcing fisherfolk to discard excess fish during peak seasons due to a lack of buyers. By improving handling, processing, and storage facilities, the initiative aims to prevent fish nutrient loss, stabilize prices, and minimize waste. The campaign will directly benefit 9,293 residents across 10 coastal villages in Daram. Postharvest fish loss is a crisis hiding in plain sight one that affects not just fishers but entire communities dependent on the sea for sustenance. In the Samar Sea, where the effects of this loss are most pronounced, tackling this issue could mean the difference between a thriving coastal economy and deepening poverty. For too long, solutions have been patchwork band-aid fixes on a systemic problem. If the government and stakeholders fail to act decisively, the losses will continue, robbing both fishers and consumers of a vital resource. With the Supreme Courts controversial ruling allowing commercial fishing vessels into municipal waters, the pressure on small-scale fishers has never been greater. Addressing postharvest loss is not just about economic gain; it is about securing food, livelihoods, and the future of Philippine fisheries.

Marcoleta rebuffed: News agencies not invited for not being quizzed,"MANILA, Philippines Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Johnny Pimentel has rebuffed Sagip party-list Rep. Rodante Marcoleta after the latter questioned why news outlets were no longer invited by the tri-committee, noting that they were present during the previous hearing but were not questioned. During Fridays hearing of the House of Representatives tri-committee, Marcoleta asked why representatives from the Philippine Daily Inquirer and the Philippine Star were not present. When Pimentel said that they were not invited, Marcoleta asked why the committee secretariat decided on their own to refrain from asking the two national broadsheets to show up. Mr. Chair I remember also, the committee committed during the last hearing that I attended that we will also invite representatives of Philippine Inquirer and Philippine Star because of the issue that I raised. I raised then the issue that we are not only concerned with the fake news and the false narratives and false information being peddled in our society, but we are concerned as well with the truth that is being suppressed, Marcoleta said. Rep. Marcoleta, according to the CommSec, the representatives from Philippine Daily Inquirer and Philippine Star were present during the last hearing, however, accordingly, there were no members who asked questions to them [] so then maybe we can invite them next time, Pimentel said. We did not include them anymore today because they were already present during the last hearing, Pimentel added. Marcoleta then asked why the lack of lawmakers who asked the two newspapers was used as a basis to stop inviting their representatives. In response, Pimentel said another set of resource persons were invited for Fridays discussions. We required them to attend the last hearing, and now we have invited other resource persons [] According to CommSec, the Philippine Daily Inquirer and the Philippine Star were not invited, Pimentel said. May we know the reason why they were not invited today? The CommSec has the liberty to decide on this? Or the chairpersons are the one authorized to decide on whether to invite people or not? Marcoleta asked. Cong. Marcoleta, you know the process, for every hearing, we have a set of resource persons to be invited. It is already very clear that they were not invited today because to be fair with them they were present during the last hearing and nobody asked questions, kaya nga hindi na sila inimbita because we are focusing on other resource persons, Pimentel fired back. During the tri-committees hearing last February 4, Marcoleta, through Abang Lingkod party-list Rep.

Advocates of EJK victims clarify details on ordeal of Aling Shiela,"MANILA, Philippines Advocates of extrajudicial killing victims and their loved ones on Friday clarified facts surrounding the ordeal of Aling Shiela, who became a subject of vicious attacks online. Supporters of former President Rodrigo Duterte criticized Aling Shiela as they believed that one of her sons, Ryan, was not a victim of EJK. READ: Sen. Imee Marcos: Since when has PH become a province of The Hague? Photos of the bereaved Caloocan City resident holding the picture of one of her sons circulated online. She had raised a photo of her son Ryan during a picture-taking at a press conference on the alleged extrajudicial killings committed by the Duterte administration. Later on, it was found out that Ryan actually died in 2024, or a few years after the former president had stepped down from his presidential post. Rubliyn Litao, coordinator of Rise Up for Life and for Rights, said it was Rico, another son of Aling Sheila, and not Ryan, who was killed during the time of the previous administration. Nevertheless, two of her sons were killed, Litao told INQUIRER.net over the phone. The group is withholding the full name of Aling Sheila due to safety concerns. Rico was killed during the time of Duterte in 2020, and the other one in 2024, she made the correction. The two men were in their 20s when they died. Litao clarified that Aling Shiela was with one of her children during the event when the photo was shot at a press conference on March 12. She was holding Ricos picture at first, and then, she had also raised the photo of her other son Ryan, who also got killed in a separate incident.

Leyte town facility seeks to cut high rate of teen pregnancies,"TACLOBAN CITY A teen center in Carigara, Leyte is being run to help address cases of teenage pregnancies in the municipality and nearby towns. Located within the municipal hall compound, the facility gathers a steady number of teenagers who, not only avail of its amenities, but also receive counseling and guidance. These initiatives are meant to prevent risky behaviors that can lead to early pregnancy. According to John Lester Reamillo, the centers officer-in-charge, at least 20 teenagers visit the facility daily since its opening in November 2024. We provide counseling to help them avoid behaviors that may lead to pregnancy, Reamillo said in a phone interview on March 10. Beyond reproductive health education, the teen center also aims to ease the gap in education crisis by offering reading comprehension programs and mental health support. Reamillo shared that their youngest recorded case of pregnancy involved a 14-year-old girl, an age when she should still be in school. Getting pregnant at such a young age is not ideal as it affects a girls future and poses serious health risks, he said. Teenage pregnancies in the town have been linked to peer pressure, family problems and easy online access to inappropriate content, among other factors. As of March 19, Carigara has recorded 64 teenage pregnancies. The establishment of teen centers is part of a GlobalCare Philippines program in partnership with the Korea International Cooperation Agency . In 2023, with KOICAs funding, GlobalCare Philippines launched the Adolescent Reproductive Health Promotion Project in three municipalities in Leyte.

Blogger apologizes for claiming PH uses water cannons in WPS,"MANILA, Philippines Lawmakers threatened on Friday a blogger with contempt after he claimed during a House hearing that Philippine forces conduct water cannon attacks like what Chinas vessels did in the West Philippine Sea . In the end, blogger Mark Lopez apologized to the House tri-committee holding an inquiry into fake news in social media for making that statement. This all started after Deputy Speaker David Suarez asked Philippine Coast Guard Commodore Jay Tarriela at the hearing if he had been on the receiving end of social media attacks due to his ardent defense of the countrys territories. When Tarriela said one of the bloggers who attacked him was present Lopez Suarez asked the latter several questions related to the territorial dispute over the WPS, such as the incident when PCG vessels were being water-cannoned by Chinese Coast Guard ships. Kunyari, nong tinitira ng water cannons masakit sa akin yon. Pag binabangga yong mga Coast Guard vesselsnatin ng mga dambuhalang Chinese vesselsmasakit sa akin yon, Suarez told Lopez. Masakit po yon pag ginagawa ng Malaysia, pero yon po ang nature ng base sa South China Sea eh. Tayo rin po sir, tayo rin po nagwo-water cannon Mr. Chair, Lopez replied. Lopezs statements prompted Suarez, committee presiding officer and Surigao del Sur 2nd District Rep. Johnny Pimentel, and Abang Lingkod party-list Rep. Joseph Stephen Paduano to demand that the blogger clarify his statements. Mr. Lopez may I ask, where did you get that information, because from what I know, I havent heard of any news that the Philippines water cannoned China, Pimentel said. Thats fake news Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman thats fake news, Suarez said. Yes, that is why, just a point of clarification, you mentioned earlier that the Pilipinas water cannoned China. May we know where did you get that information, was it in the news? Pimentel asked. Mr. Chair, I did not know anything about water cannon attacks against China, Lopez replied. Paduano said that while it is true that Lopez did not mention anything about water cannon attacks against China, the blogger said something about the Philippines doing water cannon attacks which the lawmaker said were spoken in the context of WPS discussions. He talked about water cannons only, but Mr. Lopez listened closely because the issue as of now is the West Philippines Sea, the problem with China. Now when DS Suarez mentioned the water cannons, you replied by saying that we were also doing water cannon attacks. Where did that come from? Because we are talking about the West Philippines Sea, Paduano said. Now, you are correct that you did not say anything about water cannon attacks against Chinabut we are talking about the West Philippines Sea. Now, what is that water cannon attack you are speaking of? he asked. Mr. ChairI premised my statement because I have been saying that the South China Sea issueis a complex issue, Lopez replied. But Paduano warned Lopez not to evade his question or he will be cited for contempt for lying. Wait please answer my question, what do you meanthat the Philippines is usingwater cannons [] Do not be evasive, I warn you, youre under oath, answer me as to where you refer to that water cannon , Paduano said. Mr. Chair, I did not say anything about the Philippines doing water cannons against an opposing state, Lopez said. Waitbut were talking about the West Philippines Sea, this will be your last warningor else I will cite you in contempt. This is your last warning,youre under oath,eh what do you meanthat the Philippines is using water cannons, Paduano noted. Mr. Chair, what I said is that the Philippines can do water cannon attacks also, Lopez reiterated. Suarez said since the meeting is on record, House stenographers can be asked to check the transcript of the meeting to confirm if Lopez really meant that the Philippines had done water cannon attacks. In the end, Lopez admitted to spreading fake news. Suarez on the other hand said such statements are absolutely reckless. Mr. Chair I will apologize, I am wrong, I am spreading fake news. What I am saying is that we can do the water cannon regarding the South China Sea issue. I am spreading fake news, Lopez said. What you saidnag-water cannon,Mr. Chair,if you wantwe can ask thesecretariat torefer to our stenographers in the backto the statements issuedby Mr. Lopez regarding that issue. Sowe have never taken,I dont think, thats reckless,absolutely reckless, Suarez countered. Lopez is one of the bloggers invited by the tri-committee to the hearing, which seeks to look into the spread of disinformation online after several resolutions were filed and different privileged speeches about the issue were delivered. The tri-committee is composed of the House committee on public order and safety, the committee on public information, and the committee on information and communication technology.

Manila Water Philippine Ventures champions partnerships beyond NCR,"MANILA, Philippines Manila Water Philippine Ventures , the Non-East Zone subsidiary of Manila Water Company, emphasizes the significant impact of public-private partnerships in enhancing access to water and sanitation services across various provinces in the Philippines. Speaking at the plenary session of the 7th edition of the WaterPhilippines Conference and Exposition, held at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City, Melvin John Tan, Manila Water Chief Operating Officer for Non-East Zone, highlighted the crucial role of these partnerships with the government in improving the water situation in regions beyond Metro Manila. In 2009, MWPV partnered with the Provincial Government of Laguna to improve water and wastewater services through the establishment of Laguna Water. Starting with just 14% of the population having access to piped water supply, Laguna Water has expanded its coverage to 60%, providing 24/7 water supply and increasing water pressure from 7 psi to 25 psi. The operating unit has also successfully reduced non-revenue water in the province from 48% to 24%. In April 2024, Manila Water further expanded its footprint in Laguna with the acquisition of Laguna Aquatech Resources Corporation , in partnership with the Laguna Water District. In just a few months, water service coverage improved from 45% to 55%, pressure was increased to 5 psi from 2 psi, with 19 hours of water availability versus 15 hours before takeover. In the Clark Freeport Zone, in partnership with Clark Development Corporation, MWPVs operating unit Clark Water has lowered its NRW level to an impressive 6% and nearly doubled the water supply from 27 MLD to 49 MLD to meet the growing demand of the zone. In Boracay Island, Boracay Water has been providing 24/7 potable water to 2.3-M tourists and 30,000 locals through sustainable operations, in partnership with the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority . Manila Water has also expanded its partnerships with water districts, collaborating closely to rehabilitate infrastructure and enhance the delivery of water and sanitation services. In Pangasinan, the Calasiao Water District partnered with MWPV to create Calasiao Water, addressing the long-standing issue of unsafe and unreliable water sources in the municipality. By 2024, water availability is now 24/7 with water pressure of 15 psi and an NRW level of 8%. Similarly, in Calbayog City, Samar Province, Calbayog Water, a joint venture between Calbayog Water District and Manila Water, has improved water service and quality to 23 hours of water availability with 8 psi water pressure and 100% compliance with government standards on drinking water. NRW has been reduced from 36% to 25%. The company has also forged strong partnerships with local governments and water districts to establish bulk water supply systems. In Luzon, the construction of a new water treatment plant in Ilagan City, Isabela, is nearing completion. This project is part of MWPVs latest bulk water initiative, developed in partnership with the City of Ilagan Water District. In Mindanao, the Tagum Bulk Water Supply Project, in collaboration with the Tagum City Water District, is set to secure the citys water needs for the long term. This initiative will eventually deliver 38 MLD of treated water. Furthermore, Tagum Water has been recognized with an Energy Efficiency Award by the Department of Energy , highlighting its dedication to sustainable bulk water supply. Our collaboration with local government units and water districts has been pivotal in ensuring a clean, reliable, and sustainable water supply to meet the growing demand. By leveraging the strengths of both public and private entities, we aim to enhance access, improve quality, and drive innovation, ultimately contributing to better health, economic development, and sustainability, says Tan.

EXPLAINER: Whats next after arrest of Rodrigo Duterte?,"MANILA, Philippines A warrant of arrest was served on former President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday, March 11, for crimes against humanity in relation to his bloody war on drugs. But whats next? Duterte arrived in the Philippines from Hong Kong at 9:20 a.m. It was Prosecutor General Richard Anthony Fadullon who served the notification for a warrant of arrest from the International Criminal Court . READ: LIVE UPDATES: Duterte arrested by PNP after ICC issues warrant Past 11 a.m., Malacaang confirmed that the International Criminal Police Organization -Manila received the official copy of the arrest warrant against Duterte, who was president from 2016 to 2022, at daybreak. READ: Palace confirms arrest warrant from ICC for Rodrigo Duterte He is now in the custody of authorities. As stated in the website of the ICC, arrest operations are carried out on the basis of a request for arrest and surrender transmitted by the Registry, in consultation and coordination with the Office of the Prosecutor to the State on whose territory a suspect might be present. Last Sunday, March 9, Malacaang said it is prepared to cooperate with the Interpol once the ICC issues a warrant of arrest, pointing out that if assistance from the government is needed, it is obliged to follow. READ: Govt obliged to follow Interpol on Rodrigo Duterte arrest The ICC said, The Registry makes certain that the request for arrest and surrender is accompanied by a translation of the arrest warrant and the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute in a language that the suspect fully understands and speaks. It stressed that it has jurisdiction over individuals who bear criminal responsibility for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression. After an arrest, the person is brought before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State, which determines whether the warrant is indeed for the arrested person, and if his or rights have been respected, said the ICC.

It consists of the transfer of a suspect by a State to the ICC and relies on the national courts to determine that: State authorities are required to inform the Registry when they are ready to commence the surrender procedure. Surrender can take place in the country of arrest or in the Netherlands, where the Courts Detention Centre is located. When the person is surrendered to the ICC, the Pre-Trial Chamber will hold a hearing in the presence of the person to satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the crimes, which he is alleged to have committed, and of his rights under the Rome Statute. This includes the right to apply for interim release pending trial. RELATED STORY: Rejoining ICC: Letting light shine on darkness of Dutertes anti-drug killings Within a reasonable time after the persons surrender or voluntary appearance, the Pre-Trial Chamber will hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial.

Joel Chua is confident that prosecutors can secure a conviction in Vice President Sara Dutertes impeachment case because the evidence against her is strong. In a press briefing on Monday, Chua one of the prosecutors tapped by the House of Representatives said recent revelations of other questionable names on the acknowledgment receipts for confidential fund expenditures of Dutertes offices bolster their case.

According to Chua, more meetings including one on Tuesday would be held by the prosecution panel to discuss the division of tasks and possible additional evidence and testimonies. We continue, just like the last time, we are dividing duties, regarding who should handle what particular article so that everyone gets an assignment. And at the same time, we study the substance of each article and what are the possible legal issues that we will face, he said. If you will ask me, the strongest cases are found in Article I to III. But with what we have filed, with the articles of impeachment, there are only seven. And these were studied right from the start, and we checked what issues are really backed with evidence, he added. During one of the hearings conducted by the House committee on good government and public accountability, it was revealed that some of the ARs for CF disbursements were signed by a certain Mary Grace Piattos, a first name similar to a coffee shop and a last name of a famous potato chip brand, according to lawmakers.

"Dutertes arrest shows no one is above the law, solons say","MANILA, Philippines Former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest for alleged human rights abuses shows that no one is above the law, several House of Representatives lawmakers said on Tuesday. In a statement, Surigao del Norte 2nd District Rep. Robert Ace Barbers said that Dutertes arrest, based on an arrest order issued by the International Criminal Court , is also a step towards justice and healing for the relatives of extrajudicial killing victims. Duterte was held earlier at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, after the Philippine National Police assisted in implementing the International Criminal Police Organization red notice for the ICC arrest order. This is for the crimes against humanity of mass murder charges filed against the ex-president. This is proof that, in this country, no one is above the law. The former presidents arrest is a step towards justice for families who have lost loved ones because of EJKs, Barbers said in Filipino. Its time for the country to heal. The first step to healing is to recognize the mistakes of the past and [obtain] justice for the victims, he added. According to Barbers, Duterte allowed a culture of impunity within the police force instead of stopping ita claim that was also uncovered during the investigation conducted by the House quad committee. Instead of promoting justice, it encouraged the culture of impunity among law enforcers who overlooked the law and promoted violence, which resulted in the death[s] of innocent citizens, Barbers, [the] lead presiding officer of the quad committee, noted. The arrest is not just about one person. This is about regaining public trust in justice and ensuring that abuses in the past and present will not be repeated, he added. Several official and independent investigations of the drug war have shown that there were many instances where innocent individuals were dragged into the anti-drug operations. In August 2017, 17-year-old Kian delos Santos was summarily executed in Caloocan City, even though he was not the original target of the operation. The three police officers involved in the killing of delos Santos were convicted of murder. In August 2024, the quad committee started an extensive probe into the drug war and other issues. The four panels eventually recommended the filing of crimes against humanity complaints against Duterte and his key allies for allegedly committing EJKs in the anti-drug campaign. In one of the hearings, it was revealed by former Police Col. Royina Garma that Duterte called him in May 2016 about setting up a reward system for police officers who would kill drug suspects. Antipolo 2nd District Rep. Romeo Acop, senior vice chairperson of the quad committee, said that hearings have uncovered tracks to a grand criminal enterprise with Duterte at the center of it. In a separate press briefing earlier, Bataan 1st District Rep. Geraldine Roman said that the quad committee was significant in unearthing more evidence against Duterte. Now, whats the participation of the quad comm? Since the quad comm started in 2024, we have discovered a lot things that are saddening. The victims of this drug war, EJKs, found a voice, she said. And I would say that actually strengthened the case against the former president, and during those hearings, by his own admission, the former president also mentioned that he did have a role, that he did order many of the killings, in fact I couldnt believe it when I heard and I saw it on television that he really had people killed, she added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2042790/fwd-barbers-solons-dutertes-arrest-shows-no-one-is-above-the-law,others

"DOTr must extend train, bus hours during Edsa rehab Akbayan","MANILA, Philippines The Department of Transportation must extend train and busway operating hours while the Epifanio delos Santos Avenue is being rehabilitated, Akbayan party-list Rep. Percival Cendaa said on Monday. In a statement, Cendaa warned that commuters may get stranded once Edsa one of Metro Manilas major thoroughfares undergoes a rehab due to a higher traffic volume. Previously, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority said the Edsa rehab would start in March, with the southbound lanes getting the improvements first. It is necessary now to extend the operating hours of MRT, LRT, and now, even the Edsa Bus Carousel because the Edsa rehabilitation would really cause heavy traffic, Cendaa said in Filipino. Private vehicle owners have an option, but the commuters do not have one. They should be assured that public transportation is sufficient, he added. According to Cendaa, they understand that the rehabilitation of Edsa is a significant project, but the welfare of commuters is also important. Last February 5, MMDA Chairman Don Artes said the Department of Public Works and Highways is finalizing the projects timetable and traffic management plan. The goal, Artes said, is to complete the Edsa rehabilitation in time for the Philippines hosting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in 2026. The target is still to start in March so that it will be finished in time for the Asean. The southbound lanes will be prioritized, Artes said. READ: Edsa rehab to begin in March, says MMDA chief Newly appointed Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon has promised that by the first quarter of 2026, Edsa busway users will have a better commuting experience as DOTr is also looking at a rehabilitation project by the second half of 2025. READ: Better Edsa Busway awaits commuters by Q1 2026 Aside from extending train hours, Cendaa also hopes that bus and train workers who will be affected by the longer working hours will be properly compensated. They are at the frontline of our transport system, thats why they should be protected and given correct wages and benefits, he said. Commuters cannot afford to wait. The DOTr, MMDA, and LGUs must work together to ensure smooth, efficient, and worker-friendly transport solutions before the EDSA rehab begins, he added. Edsa has been notoriously known for traffic jams during rush hours, as it connects six cities across Metro Manila Caloocan, Quezon City, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Pasay City. In 2018, a recent report from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency showed that the Philippines lost P3.5 billion per day because of traffic congestion in Metro Manila. According to the Management Association of the Philippines, the government should already consider declaring a state of calamity in the National Capital Region due to traffic woes.

Senior Fire Officer Alejo Ramirez, officer-in-charge of the San Antonio Fire Station, said the fire was reported to their office around noon on Monday and quickly spread due to strong winds.

"Ombudsman denies motion to suspend Romualdez, others over budget mess","MANILA, Philippines The Office of the Ombudsman has denied the motion seeking to suspend House Speaker Martin Romualdez and other lawmakers over the alleged P241-billion insertions in the 2025 national budget. In a 10-page resolution dated March 7, but was released to the media on Tuesday, March 11, the Ombudsman said it dismissed the motion filed by Davao del Norte 1st District Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez, lawyer Ferdinand Topacio, and PDP-Laban senatorial candidate and lawyer Jimmy Bondoc, among others, against Romualdez and the following lawmakers for utter paucity of merit or lack of merit: The Ombudsman also ordered the complaint be suspended and held in abeyance until such time that the Supreme Court has resolved with finality the petition certiorari and prohibition filed by Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab, lawyer Victor Rodriguez, and others. READ: Duterte allies seek suspension of 4 House leaders before Ombudsman The petition lodged by Ungab and others asked the SC to declare Republic Act No. 12116, or the General Appropriations Act of 2025, as unconstitutional. After a careful reading of the complaint, I am convinced that the issues raised herein are closely intertwined, if not, intimately related to a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition that was earlier filed before the Supreme Court, the Ombudsman stated in the resolution. The Supreme Court must first resolve the issue of constitutionality before the criminal action pending before the Ombudsman will proceed.

"Balikbayan boxes from Canada yield P29-M worth of marijuana leaves, oil","MANILA, PhilippinesDried marijuana leaves and oil with an estimated value of P29 million concealed inside balikbayan boxes were seized at the Manila International Container Port , the Bureau of Customs-Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service said on Monday. Reports from the BOC-CIIS said that the operation was conducted last Friday, after receiving a derogatory report that balikbayan boxes from Canada, declared to be containing household goods, had contraband items instead. The boxes were consigned to a residence in General Trias City, Cavite. READ: BOC seizes P29.5 M marijuana concealed in balikbayan boxes CIIS Director Verne Enciso said in a statement that the balikbayan boxes went through a physical examination at the Designated Examination Area of the MICP. We received derogatory information about these two balikbayan boxes and immediately processed the proper documents to have them inspected. The examination found a total of 20,990 grams of kush and one liter of liquid substance we suspect to be kush oil, he said. According to the BOC-CIIS report, the first box contained 20 vacuum-sealed plastic pouches, totaling 9.809 kilograms of kush and one liter of a liquid substance. On the other hand, the second box had 23 vacuum-sealed plastic pouches, with the kush weighing 11.181 grams. The estimated street value of the illegal substance was P29.38 million. BOC Commissioner Bien Rubio said that this manner of importing illegal drugs into the countryaside from being outright illegaldegrades the Filipino culture where overseas workers send gifts to their loved ones in the Philippines through balikbayan boxes. You know, balikbayan boxes are very Filipino. This is ingrained into our culture and our tradition that wherever we are, we send balikbayan boxes back to our loved ones here in the Philippines because it shows we care, Rubio said. Using them for something illegal is an insult to our hardworking OFWs and their families who look forward to receiving even the simplest gifts contained in these boxes, he added. Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence Group Juvymax Uy said that this operation is still part of BOCs mandate to secure the Philippines borders and prevent the proliferation of illegal substances on the countrys streets. We must always remember that our mandate is not only to protect the country from dangerous narcotics but to also prevent these illegal substances from reaching our communities. Operations like this also take drug traffickers out of the streets, hurt drug trafficking organizations, and take profits away from them, he noted. This is not the first time that illegal items were concealed in balikbayan boxes. Last April 2024, the BOC seized around P29.5 million worth of marijuana, also at the MICP. This batch of boxes, meanwhile, came from Thailand. The examination of the balikbayan boxes was witnessed by representatives from the CIIS, Enforcement and Security Service , Customs Anti-Illegal Drug Task Force , Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency , Philippine Coast Guard , X-ray Inspection Project , and Office of the District Collector . Samples from the seized items were taken and turned over to the PDEA for confirmatory testing.

PNP says it only assisted in serving Interpol notice vs Duterte,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine National Police said that it was only assisting the Philippine Center for Transnational Crime in implementing the International Criminal Police Organization notice against former President Rodrigo Duterte. This statement came amid outcry from Duterte who cried illegal detention. The Philippine National Police assisted the Philippine Center on Transnational Crime this morning in implementing an Interpol Notice for former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte upon his arrival at Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Hong Kong on March 11, 2025, the PNP said in a statement.

In an interview before a Thanksgiving mass held at the Sacred Heart Parish in Quezon City, Villanueva said that many people doubted if Duterte would ever be held accountable for his administrations bloody war on drugs, given his wide influence.

"Duterte playing victim, but he allowed drug cartel to flourish Ortega","MANILA, Philippines La Union Rep. Paolo Ortega V believes former President Rodrigo Duterte was just playing victim when he spoke before overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong, claiming that the reality is that the past administration allowed a state-sponsored drug cartel. Ortega in a statement on Monday said that Duterte seems to be ignoring the reason why his family has been the subject of different investigations and casesbecause issues have not been addressed, like claims that the drug war was meant to eliminate competition of his close allies allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade. READ: Acop: Quad comm uncovers Dutertes link to grand criminal enterprise Nabudol tayo ng Budolterte! For years, he made us believe he was waging a war against drugs, but the House Quad Comms investigation has revealed the shocking truth: It was a war that protected and enriched his most trusted men, including his right-hand operator, Michael Yang, Ortega said. READ: Palace on Dutertes arrest warrant from ICC: Marcos govt ready Hes playing the victim while ignoring the real issuehis administration ran a state-sponsored drug cartel. The former president was never fighting a war on drugs. He was running a drug empire, he added. Ortega also took notice of Dutertes statements over the weekend, during a program in Hong Kong, where the former president told supporters to pitch in so that they can create a monument of him next to national icon Dr. Jose Rizal. Habang nagpapatawa siya tungkol sa monumento, hindi niya sinagot ang tunay na tanongbakit ang pinaka-pinagkakatiwalaan niyang si Michael Yang ang sentro ng drug trade sa Pilipinas? Ortega asked, referring to Dutertes former presidential economic adviser. Budolterte has deceived the nation for too long. But the truth is outand the law will catch up with him, he added. Duterte flew to Hong Kong over the weekend, just before rumors spread on social media that the International Criminal Court will soon issue an arrest order for him. The former president is facing cases for crimes against humanity of mass murder, due to his involvement in the bloody drug war. Several official and independent investigations of the drug war have shown that there were several instances where innocent individuals were dragged into the anti-drug operations, like in the case of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos who was summarily executed even if he was not the original target of the operation in Caloocan City last August 2017. The three police officers involved in the Delos Santos killing were convicted of murder. Rumors of an arrest order were then compounded after Presidential Communications Office Secretary Jay Ruiz said that they heard talks about the ICCs supposed arrest order, adding that the government is prepared for any eventuality. As of now, the Philippine National Police still has no verifiable information that the ICC had issued an arrest order for ex-President Duterte. In Hong Kong, Duterte addressed talks on the arrest order, saying that his actions during the war on illegal drugs were for the Philippines benefit. According to Duterte, he never wanted to kill anyone, adding that they were just forced to counter evil forces. Last August 2024, the House of Representatives quad committee started an extensive probe on the past administrations drug war and other issues. The four panels eventually recommended the filing of crimes against humanity complaints against Duterte and his key allies for allegedly committing extrajudicial killings in the anti-drug campaign. Last December 13, Antipolo Rep. Romeo Acop read a summary from the quad committee stating that they have uncovered tracks to a grand criminal enterprise, with Duterte at the center of it. According to Acop, testimonies from individuals invited by the quad committeelike dismissed Police colonel Eduardo Acierto, former Customs intelligence officer Jimmy Guban, ex-customs broker Mark Taguba, and self-confessed Duterte hitman Arturo Lascaashave pinpointed to a select group of individuals all with links to Duterte. However, the Antipolo lawmaker pointed out that despite the drug war, individuals linked to the illegal drug trade who were deemed close to Dutertelike Yangwere not investigated thoroughly. Acop said that instead of looking into Aciertos report implicating Yang, Duterte chose to turn a blind eye to it and threatened Acierto. Yang, despite not attending the hearings, was mentioned several times during the quad committee hearings. Pressed for answers about his ties to Yang, Duterte told quad committee members last November 13 that he will personally kill Yang if there is evidence linking him to the drug trade.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2042626/duterte-playing-victim-but-he-allowed-drug-cartel-to-flourish-ortega,others

"After Dutertes arrest, next step for PH is to rejoin ICC Roman","MANILA, Philippines The next logical step that the Philippines should take after former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest is to rejoin the International Criminal Court , Bataan 1st District Rep. Geraldine Roman said on Tuesday. In a press briefing at the Batasang Pambansa complex, Roman said it is her view that the Philippines rejoins the ICC to show that the country respects human rights and obeys international laws. Roman said this hours after Duterte was not allowed to leave the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3 as local authorities assisted the International Criminal Police Organization in implementing the arrest order from ICC. We left the ICC unilaterally, I think its about time that we return to the ICC and show the whole world that this country respects our law and international law, she said in Filipino. There is nothing wrong with that my fellow Filipinos. The law is the only protection that people have against abuses, even us in positions of power need it. This is the only assurance that our courts have bases to give us justice if we are aggrieved by anyone, she added. According to Roman, rejoining ICC will be consistent with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s goal to uphold the rule of law. So, my call is for us to return to the ICC. If this is a position that recognizes a rule-based order around the world, then lets walk the talk. Lets go back to the folds of the ICC because I believe that we have nothing to be afraid of. I also believe that our President is intent on upholding the rule of law, and he has nothing to hide, she added. In March 2018, Duterte declared that the Philippines withdrew from the ICC, claiming that there seemed to be a concerted effort between the United Nations special rapporteurs and the ICC special prosecutor to paint him as a ruthless and heartless violator of human rights who allegedly caused thousands of extrajudicial killings. The ICC was already in the middle of investigating Duterte, who was charged with the crime against humanity of mass murder for his role in the war against illegal drugs, which rights defenders deemed as bloody. READ: Duterte does the inevitable, declares PH withdrawal from ICC However, several legal minds and even former ICC prosecutors Fatou Bensouda and Karim Khan maintained that the international body still had jurisdiction over the cases filed against Duterte, as the cases were filed during and covered a period that the Rome Statute was still in effect.

During this time, the former president, his relatives, and key allies flew to Hong Kong to meet overseas Filipino workers.

This arrest order is related to the crimes against humanity raps faced by Duterte when he initiated the drug war during his administration. Its very simple, its a request to the Philippine government from Interpol to enforce the arrest warrant. And of course, we comply with our commitments to Interpol. We did not do this because it was derived from or it came from ICC, we did this because Interpol asked us to do it, and we have commitments to them, and we live up to those commitments, Marcos said. When asked if Dutertes arrest equates to ceding sovereigntyas a Filipino citizen was turned over to a foreign bodyMarcos disagreed, saying that he was consistent in not helping the ICC. No, bakit naman ? Dahil consistent naman tayo, hindi tayo tumutulong sa imbestigasyon ng ICC [] meron tayong contact sa kanila natural, pero, no, not on an official level, we did not help them in any way, the Chief Executive said. The arrest that we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol. It just so happened that that came from ICC. But its not because it came from ICC, its because it came from Interpol, he explained. Marcos in the past, when political relations between his family and the Dutertes were still good, had been adamant that the government would not help the ICC in its investigation of former President Duterte. Last February 2024even when Duterte had already issued some choice words for Marcos and his alliesthe incumbent president said his views that the government would not assist the ICC probe had not changed. READ: Marcos adamant: No ICC probe into PH war on drugs Previously, Marcos also assured Dutertes co-accused, former police chief and currently Sen. Ronald dela Rosa, that his administration would no longer engage with the ICC after the international body rejected the Philippine governments appeal to stop the investigation of crimes against humanity complaints. READ: Bongbong Marcos: Thats it; were done talking with ICC However, there have been several rumors over the past months that ICC investigators have been coming in and out of the country to conduct its probe on Dutertes drug war. Then, over the weekend, talks about the ICC possibly releasing an arrest order against Duterte mounted. During this time, the former president, his relatives, and key allies flew to Hong Kong to meet overseas Filipino workers. In Hong Kong, the older Duterte addressed talks on the arrest order, saying that his actions during the war on illegal drugs were for the Philippines benefit. Several official and independent investigations of the drug war, however, showed that there were many instances where innocent individuals were dragged into the anti-drug operations. In August 2017, 17-year-old Kian delos Santos was summarily executed in Caloocan City, even though he was not the original target of the operation. The three police officers involved in the killing of Delos Santos were convicted of murder. Earlier, Marcos clarified that the Philippines has to comply with its commitments to Interpol regarding former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest, or else the government would not get any help for its future operations.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2043087/govt-assisted-in-arresting-duterte-because-of-interpol-not-icc,others
CBCP to Duterte on arrest: Be ready to face consequences of your actions,"MANILA, Philippines Former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest marks a crucial step toward accountability, and it sets an important precedent for addressing past and future human rights violations in the Philippines. This is the statement made by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines on Wednesday. The bishops expressed their belief that Dutertes arrest is long overdue. They also said it was a move toward justice for the thousands killed in his administrations war on illegal drugs. For years, former President Duterte has claimed that he is ready to face the consequences of his actions. Now is the time for him to prove it, Kidapawan Bishop Jose Colin Bagaforo said. True justice is about accountability, transparency, and the protection of human dignity, he noted. Meanwhile, San Carlos Bishop Gerardo Alminaza stressed that justice must be served for the victims and their families. These killings were not random; they were part of a policy that violated the fundamental right to life, Alminaza said. The families of the victims deserve truth, reparations, and justice. As a nation, we must ensure that such crimes never happen again, the San Carlos bishop added. READ: The fall of The Punisher: Rodrigo Dutertes path to the ICC While Dutertes arrest does not mean he is guilty, Taytay Bishop Broderick Pabillo said it is an opportunity to determine whether or not the former president should be held accountable for the abuses under his administration that were reportedly committed. This is where we will see whether his actions were right or wrong and whether he should be held responsible if they were wrong, Pabillo explained. That is what democracy should beno one is above the law, and everyone must answer for their actions, he stressed.

Manila Water boosts sanitation services with patented portable desludger,"MANILA, Philippines Manila Water has been granted a patent by the International Property Office of the Philippines for its groundbreaking portable desludger. This innovative device is set to enhance the companys sanitation efforts, particularly in hard-to-reach barangays, ensuring cleaner and healthier communities. The portable desludger features a straightforward design, adapting the conventional vacuum tanker into a compact 1m capacity tank. This smaller tank can be mounted on a smaller vehicle and connected in series with a larger 10m desludging truck. This setup allows the 10m truck to remain on standby, while the more agile portable desludger navigates narrow roads to efficiently meet customers desludging needs. Currently, the portable desludger is being deployed in various barangays where accessibility challenges hinder Manila Waters ability to perform desludging services. These barangays are primarily located in areas with narrow streets and elevated terrains, making them inaccessible to conventional desludging trucks. The development of Manila Waters newly patented portable desludger exemplifies the companys ongoing commitment to enhancing sanitation services, particularly in underserved communities, Manila Water Corporate Affairs Group Director Jeric Sevilla said. With this innovation, Manila Water aims to boost customer participation in their desludging services, thereby safeguarding cleanliness and community health. In its efforts to promote a cleaner and healthier environment, the company successfully emptied 129,420 septic tanks, surpassing the 117,075 tanks serviced in 2023.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2043356/manila-water-boosts-sanitation-services-with-patented-portable-desludger,others

"Marikina Mayor Teodoro, 5 others face criminal, admin raps","Updated @ 7:35 p.m., March 10, 2025 MANILA, Philippines Marikina Mayor Marcelino Marcy Teodoro and five others are facing criminal and administrative complaints before the Office of the Ombudsman over alleged irregularities in the procurement of various materials for the local government from 2018 to 2021. The complaint was filed by Rico Mariano, the sole proprietor of Masie Enterprise, which deals in office and school supplies. Mariano also lodged criminal and administrative complaints against the mayors wife, Marikina 1st District Rep. Marjorie Ann Teodoro, Barangay Santa Elena officer Marie Joy San Juan, city accountant Erlinda Gonzales, and acting city treasurers Miguel Rebanal and Florencia Gamad. The six public officials are facing complaints for alleged violation of Section 3, paragraph and of the Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code for intentionally and willfully diverting LGU Marikinas funds earmarked for material procurement into their own pockets. In the complaint filed last January 23 but released to the media only on Monday, Mariano also claimed that the six committed grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. According to the complainant, he was tapped as an exclusive supplier for Mayor Teodoros camp for goods and supplies needed in his city in 2017. READ: Marikina mayor, three others face technical malversation rap However, far from what I imagined my dealings would be with LGU Marikina where I would supply good, it turned out to be an arrangement where I or Maisie would be a mere front for respondent Joy and everyone else involved, Mariano said in his complaint. I was used by respondents Joy and Marcy as a mere conduit for them to siphon funds out of the coffers of LGU Marikina and deliver these funds directly into their hands. I was used by respondents Joy and Marcy to perpetuate their grand scheme, he further narrated. Based on the complaint, Mariano said he mainly coordinated with San Juan regarding the procurement process. They mainly transacted via text message or online as presented in the document. Mariano claimed, however, that he was never given a list of materials or asked to bring any documents or an ID, adding that the Marikina General Services Office only instructed him to sign a purchase order. At other times, I would be completely excluded from the signing of the purchase order itself. I would just learn about the transaction when I get advice from responded Joy that the check is ready for pick up, he said. This led me to believe that either the GSO or any actor instructed by the respondents was forging my signature on the purchase order, he added. In 2020, Mariano disclosed that he was instructed by San Juan to issue managers checks in favor of Rep. Teodoro instead of encashing the entire proceeds of the checks he received from the local government. On going through his bank statements, Mariano said he found that six managers checks were issued to Rep. Teodoro amounting to P9.583 million from May 8, 2020, to January 22, 2021 alone. On this point, it bears emphasizing that a perusal of the records would show that through the positions of respondents Marcy and Joy as Mayor and City Councilor, respectively, respondents Joy, Marcy and Maan were able to benefit from the transactions of the LGU Marikina, with respondent Maan directly named as payee for the managers checks that I requested upon instructions of respondent Joy, the complainant claimed. In response, Mayor Teodoro said he had not yet received a copy of the complaint. Anyone can file a complaint, but it is our duty to address any allegations with transparency and in accordance with due process, he said in a statement sent to INQUIRER.net. Once we receive the official copy of the complaint filed before the Ombudsman, we will respond to all the accusations made against us. Rest assured, we will fully cooperate with the probe of the Ombudsman, he added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2042535/marikina-mayor-teodoro-5-others-face-criminal-admin-raps,others

Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner for the Intelligence Group Juvymax Uy spoke about the correlation between buying counterfeit products and larger crimes. While buying fake goods may seem like a bargain, we want to remind the public that it only fuels the criminals more. These are the same enterprises that get involved in money laundering, forced labor, and some even in organized crime. Smuggling is only the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more that goes underneath this crime, so we need to stop where the money is coming from, Uy said.

Ombudsman: 90% of cases filed are politically motivated,"MANILA, Philippines Ninety percent of complaints filed before the Office of the Ombudsman during the election period are politically motivated, according to its chief, Samuel Martires. Martires made the pronouncement when asked if his office still entertains cases that are obviously related to politics. We give importance to all cases filed with the Ombudsman.

They think that all cases that can be filed with the Ombudsman can be subject to preventive suspension, he said. No, we dont do that. The law we follow has a standard for when we will issue a preventive suspension. The case filed with us should constitute grave misconduct, and the evidence is strong, Martires explained.

INQToday: Duterte says he is responsible as ICC takes him into custody,"Heres a quick roundup of todays top stories: Former President Rodrigo Duterte said he was responsible as the International Criminal Court took him into custody Wednesday to face charges of crimes against humanity over his war on drugs.

UP scientists find eco-friendly ways to create gold nanocorals,"MANILA, Philippines Scientists from the University of the Philippines Diliman have developed ways to create gold nanocorals through innovative and more environmentally-friendly methods. Christian Paul Ende, Rufus Mart Caesar Ramos, Phil Justin Pangilinan, Rogie Bautista, and Dr. Michelle Regulacio of the UPD-College of Science Institute of Chemistry, along with John Rae Louis Escosio of the UPD-CS Natural Sciences Research Institute and the UPD-CS Materials Science and Engineering Program introduced methods using natural, low-cost acids in water at room temperature. The UPD-CS Science Communications, in a statement, said the production of gold nanocorals involves complex, costly, and environmentally harmful processes. In science, gold nanocorals, branched-shape structures that resemble tiny corals, are valuable in fluorescence imaging and catalysis. The key ingredients involved are biogenic acids that are commonly found in plants. Using the right combination of low-cost biogenic acids, we were able to produce hyperbranched gold nanocorals in water under ambient conditions, with the entire procedure completed in less than an hour, Regulacio said in the same statement. Regulacio, however, pointed out that the procedure indicated in the study did not produce nanocorals from other metals. Further, the researchers believe that the research development can spark interest in hyperbranched nanomaterials and can pave the way for potential applications in various fields. This work demonstrates that the creation of morphological designs does not necessarily require complicated and expensive fabrication processes, Regulacio added. The researchers findings were included in their study named A systematic study on the use of biogenic acids in directing the hyperbranched growth of Au nanocorals published in CrystEngComm journal.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2043637/up-scientists-find-ways-to-create-gold-nanocorals-through-innovative-eco-friendly-ways,others

EXPLAINER: Brutal attacks on civilians hauled Rodrigo Duterte to The Hague,"MANILA, Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, Philippine president from 2016 to 2022 who waged a murderous anti-drug campaign that has killed 6,000 to 30,000 mostly poor Filipinos, is now in the custody of the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Last Tuesday, March 11, Duterte, who arrived from Hong Kong, was arrested on the basis of a warrant from the ICC, which found reasonable grounds to believe that Duterte is individually responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator. READ: How ICC chamber decided that Duterte must face trial The next day, Wednesday, March 12, the ICC confirmed in a statement that Duterte, who withdrew the Philippines from the Rome Statute that created the ICC in 2019, has been surrendered for the pre-trial, where Judges decide if there is enough evidence for the case to be tried. READ: LIVE UPDATES: Rodrigo Duterte at The Hague Duterte, who once dared the ICC to investigate him over his war on drugs, is charged with murder as a crime against humanity that is said to have been committed in the Philippines between Nov. 1, 2011 and March 16, 2019. Article 7 of the Rome Statute provides that crimes against humanity are serious violations committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population. READ: Duterte says he is responsible as ICC takes him into custody The 15 forms of crimes against humanity listed in the Rome Statute include offenses such as murder, rape, imprisonment, enforced disappearances, enslavement specifically of women and children, sexual slavery, torture, apartheid and deportation. Murder as a crime against humanity has three elements: The ICC explained that attack directed against a civilian population is understood to mean a course of conduct involving the commission of acts against any civilian population, based on a State or organizational policy to commit such an attack. Assessing the material given by the Prosecution, the ICC found that there was an attack on civilians pursuant to an organizational policy while Duterte was the head of the Davao Death Squad, and to a State policy while he was president of the Philippines. READ: ICC EXPLAINER: Fine points in the arrest of Rodrigo Duterte Moreover, there are reasonable grounds to believe that this attack was both widespread and systematic: the alleged attack took place over a period of several years and resulted in thousands of deaths, the ICC said. As Duterte waged in 2016 a war against drugs, thousands of Filipinos, some of them children as young as three years old, were killed by the police or vigilantes, but only three cases have resulted in convictions. RELATED STORY: The fall of The Punisher: Rodrigo Dutertes path to the ICC The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency listed 6,252 dead in anti-drug police operations from 2016 to 2022. But a 2017 year end report attributed to the Office of the President listed over 20,000 dead in the first 17 months of Dutertes presidency. Based on data shared by lawyer Jose Chel Diokno with the House Committee on Human Rights last year, out of the 20,322 deaths listed as accomplishment by the OP report, 3,967 were killed in police operations and 16,355 in vigilante-style killings. But while Duterte, who has repeatedly threatened to kill individuals involved in drugs, is now in the custody of ICC, and could be the first Asian former head of State to be tried by the ICC, the process is still long and winding. READ: EXPLAINER: Whats next after arrest of Rodrigo Duterte? Should the ICC decide to confirm the charges, which is the most critical part of the pre-trial, against Duterte, the Prosecution, before three trial Judges, has to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused. ICC trials, however, usually take eight years, with some extending to 10 years or more. READ: Marcos: Arrest of Duterte not political persecution Based on data from the ICC, there are 22 cases of crimes against humanity filed before it, including the cases of Sudans former President Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir and Minister of State for the Interior Ahmad Muhammad Harun. Out of the 22, only four have been convicted, while five are still at large, like Al Bashir and Harun, who are charged not only with crimes against humanity but with war crimes that are said to have been committed between 2003 and 2008 in Darfur, Sudan. RELATED STORY: Day of reckoning comes for Duterte Two cases are now awaiting a decision, while most have been terminated at pre-trial. There are three acquittals, the ICC said. These are the cases of Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui of Congo, and Charles Bl Goud of Cte dIvoire. A warrant of arrest was likewise issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes in relation to the invasion of Ukraine, but no arrest has been made yet.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2043608/explainer-brutal-attacks-on-civilians-hauled-rodrigo-duterte-to-the-hague,others
Alan Cayetano blasts DPWH execs: Seems youre not serious about probe,"MANILA, Philippines It seems like youre not serious about this investigation. These were the words used by Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano when he grilled on Friday Public Works and Highways officials over their supposedly disappointing actions to address the recent collapse of the Cabagan-Sta. Maria Bridge in Isabela. At a Senate subpanel on blue ribbons public hearing, Cayetano expressed his dismay. Pasensya na. Youre the one here, but I should tell this [to the] secretary parang hindi kayo seryoso sa investigation na ito. Right now, theres no point person in the investigation. Right now, no one was preventively suspended, Cayetano pointed out. At the center of Cayetanos dismay was DPWH Undersecretary Eugenio Pipo Jr. Cayetano lashed out his frustration after he was informed by Pipo that they have yet to preventively suspend DPWH officials. Two weeks na wala pa kayong preventive suspension. So kung merong kalokohan dyan, sa design [o] sa testing napalitan na by now. Kasi the purpose of preventive suspension whoever is there is not to say youre guilty. Di ba? said Cayetano. What kind of investigation are you doing? Thats why I want your secretary here. Parang hindi kayo seryoso sa sabi ni Sen. Revilla heads have to roll. How will they roll if you allow them to talk to people [and] do everything? If I was the guilty person, what will I do? Ill cover up di ba? he added. In a separate ambush interview shortly after the hearing, Cayetano told the media that he is very disappointed on how the DPWH is taking the matter. Parang hindi wholehearted. I-eexcuse ko na na wala si secretary dito, pero two weeks na wala ka pang point person kung sino ang nag iimbestiga. Wala pa yung committee and I dont think its good practice. Binanggit ko na to kay secretary noong budget hearing na hindi good practice na mag MFP ka Memo For the President nang hindi pulido at wala pang conclusion diba, he said. He then proceeded to point out that the only thing that the DPWH did was to gather all documents, but officials still cant answer why prices have doubled up from the first contract, as well as why the retrofitting was charged to the government. Im hoping that the DPWH will shape up and now we know why kailangan talaga yung blue ribbon committee di ba. So hindi pa pa pala tayo mag hearing hindi pa pala ito priority sa DPWH, said Cayetano. For the DPWHs part, Pipo maintained that they are conducting an active investigation. In a separate ambush interview also on Friday, he said a panel will be conducted to specifically investigate the cause of the failure of the bridge. On February 27, the Cabagan-Sta Maria Bridge collapsed when a dump truck carrying quarried stones exceeding the 45-ton weight limit attempted to cross.

Solon dismisses martial law fears amid protests over Dutertes arrest,"MANILA, Philippines Claims that martial law may be declared to quell protests against former President Rodrigo Dutertes arrest are farthest from the truth because the administrations actions lean towards maintaining democracy, Iloilo 1st District Rep. Janette Garin said on Friday. In an online press briefing, Garin explained that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been campaigning for the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas senatorial slate which indicates that the Chief Executive believes in having free elections. Napakalayo sa katotohanan nong fake news na magkaka-martial law, unang-una, yes talaga namang may pockets of demonstration, natural yan kasi emotional ang tao. However ang problema kasi, hindi yan ang solusyon eh, Garin told reporters covering the House of Representatives. So napakalaking fake news nito at saka isa pa, eh bakit nakikita mo naman todo yong ikot ng pangulo para mangampanya sa eleksyon? Kasi kung magde-declare yan ng martial law, wala nang mag-election. So its really untenable parang malayong-malayo, he added. According to Garin, declaring martial law would also contradict the aspirations of the government to bring down prices of basic goods and counter inflation. Now kung magma-martial law, napaka-baliktad, napaka-taliwas nyan don sa ginagawa ng administrasyon ngayon kasi nakikita naman na todo yong galaw para pabagsakin yong presyo ng pagkain, todo yong galaw para pababain yong ating inflation, todo ang galaw para gumalaw, matulugan yong mga maliit na negosyante, he said. And that is actually, all these directions are geared towards pushing for a better and a more robust economy, so kapag mag-martial law ka, parang lahat ng pinaghirapan ng Pangulong Bongbong Marcos, kaakibat na yong mga nakarang administrasyon ay itatapon lamang, he added. Instead of making claims about a martial law scenario, Garin urged Dutertes supporters to identify ways the former president can be assisted. Ang kailangan ngayon is matulungang sagutin, matulugan si former president na sagutin yong mga akusasyon at lumabas yong mga testigo to counter the allegations against him. Sino ba dyan yong mga pwede yung mag-testify na hindi totoo ang mga paratang sa kanya? Garin asked. Over social media, there have been claims from Dutertes supporters that Marcos may declare martial law as there have been different protest movements after the local authorities assisted the International Criminal Police Organization in enforcing the arrest order from the International Criminal Court . Last Tuesday, after arriving from Hong Kong, Duterte was arrested at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3. After questioning the arrest, Duterte eventually boarded a chartered plane from Villamor Air Base, which left Manila for the Netherlands. After a layover in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the plane carrying Duterte landed in the Hague just minutes after Thursday midnight, Manila time.

Marcos orders DPWH to implement updated Bicol River Basin Master Plan,"MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Bongbong R. Marcos Jr. has ordered the Department of Public Works and Highways to implement the updated Bicol River Basin Master Plan , according to the Presidential Communications Office . Marcos made this pronouncement during the Regional Development Council meeting in Pili, Camarines Sur on Friday. I already instructed the Public Works to come up with a master plan which is appropriate for now. There is no other way to address the flooding problem except to manage the water flowing into the Bicol Region River Basin, Marcos said. Marcos said that the old master plan will no longer be suitable for the country as the weather will become more severe due to climate change. At least we have a plan now. We have to implement it properly because the old master plan was not rigorously implemented so we have the same problem, Marcos pointed out. Marcos also noted that the plan should be made available to all stakeholders for them to understand how the project works and how government agencies implement it. During his visit in Camarines Sur after the onslaught of Severe Tropical Storm Kristine in November 2024, Marcos directed various government agencies to collaborate on developing the Bicol River Basin.

Legarda urges stronger collective climate action as UN marks 80th anniversary,"MANILA, Philippines As the world commemorates the 80th anniversary of the United Nations , Senator Loren Legarda, a lifelong advocate for climate resilience and environmental sustainability, stands in firm commitment to working with the UN in addressing the pressing challenges of our time. For 80 years, the UN has been the anchor of global solidarity, a platform where humanitys collective voice gains strength. As we celebrate this milestone, the global community must continue to work together in building a world that is just, resilient, and sustainable, Legarda emphasized. Legardas commitment to global sustainability is reflected in decades of collaboration with the UN and its agencies, positioning the Philippines as a leader in climate action and disaster risk reduction. Through her legislative work, she has helped align the nations policies with UN environmental goals, championing key laws such as the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, the Climate Change Act of 2009, the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, and the Peoples Survival Fund Act of 2012, a pioneering climate financing mechanism to support vulnerable communities. The Philippines is among the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world, and we have no choice but to lead. Our survival depends on our ability to innovate, legislate, and work with the global community, she said, Beyond legislation, Legarda has played a key role in shaping international climate policies. She spearheaded the first consultative meeting with parliamentarians on disaster risk reduction and helped pave the way for global frameworks like the Hyogo Framework for Action , and its successor, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Her leadership has earned international recognition, including being named a UN Environment Programme Global 500 Laureate, Regional Champion for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation for Asia-Pacific in 2008, and Global Champion for Resilience in 2015 by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction . In 2017, she was designated a National Adaptation Plan Champion by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , further amplifying her role in bridging policy and action. Climate action is not a solitary mission. As the UN marks its 80th anniversary, we are reminded that global cooperation is our greatest strength in confronting the climate crisis. Every policy and initiative we champion must be driven by shared responsibility, Legarda stated. Legarda has also advanced climate diplomacy, bringing the Philippines to the forefront of international discussions. In 2015, she delivered the Manila Call to Action on Climate Change alongside French actress Marion Cotillard during the visit of French President Franois Hollande to the Philippines, an appeal that contributed to the successful adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP21 in Paris later that year. Under the 2024 General Appropriations Act, the four-term senator secured funding for the Climate Change Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs to support activities leading to the 2025 UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France. The conference, co-hosted by France and Costa Rica, is a high-level global platform dedicated to advancing ocean sustainability and implementing Sustainable Development Goal 14 . Recognizing the intersection of climate and cultural resilience, Legarda has collaborated with UNESCO to preserve heritage amid climate threats. Speaking at UNESCOs 37th General Conference in Paris, she underscored the Philippines dedication to cultural preservation, education, and disaster preparedness, leading to the establishment of the Southeast Asian Center for Lifelong Learning for Sustainable Development , a regional hub for knowledge-sharing and sustainability education. As the UN marks eight decades of fostering global unity, Legarda calls on the international community to reinforce its commitment to multilateralism, emphasizing that climate action, disaster resilience, and sustainability must remain at the heart of global cooperation. The UN has provided the platform, but the responsibility to act is ours. For the sake of our survival and the generations yet to come, we must rise to the challenge by legislating with courage and governing with vision, she said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041902/legarda-urges-stronger-collective-climate-action-as-un-marks-80th-anniversary,others

DENR orders developer to vacate Masungi Georeserve property,"MANILA, Philippines The Department of Environment and Natural Resources ordered the developer of Masungi Georeserve in Rizal to vacate the 300-hectare property. The DENR said this was due to irregularities, but the Blue Star Construction Development Corporation, an affiliate of a foundation that manages the property, blamed the agency for project delays. After several investigations that started in 2014, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources today cancelled its 2002 Supplemental Agreement with government housing contractor Blue Star Construction Development Corporation due to illegality, failure to go through a bidding process, and failure to execute, the DENR said in a statement. The DENR said it canceled the agreement due to the following: lack of the required Presidential Proclamation declaring the subject matter of the contract for housing purposes, lack of documents proving that the proposed construction went through regular procurement or bidding process; and failure to deliver the 5,000-unit Garden Cottages housing project within five years from signing on November 15, 2002. DENR assistant secretary for legal affairs Norlito Eneran said that Blue Star initially signed a joint venture agreement with the DENR in 1997 for the survey, design construction, development and marketing of a project called Garden Cottages on a 130-hectare government property in Tanay, Rizal Province. Despite this, Eneran said Blue Star was then still able to secure a supplemental agreement in 2002 that even increased their project area to an additional 300 hectares, despite no substantial housing units built on the original 130 hectares awarded. Eneran further noted that since the original joint venture agreement for the housing project was never executed, and no bidding process occurred despite the five-year timeline, making the 2002 Supplemental Agreement without basis. However, the Masungi Georeserve Foundation Inc. asserted that the project was competitively bidded out by the DENR and won by Blue Star. Let us be clear it is the DENR who is at fault here. It has stubbornly refused to carry out its contractual obligation to clear the area of large-scale illegal occupants, liens, and encumbrances, causing delays to the project and significant injury to its private sector partner, the MGFI said in a statement. This is not just an assault on Masungi Georeserveit is an attack on every Filipino striving to protect our natural heritage in the face of worsening floods, landslides, and droughts that threaten our communities, it added. The MGFI said it has yet to receive the 15-day notice to vacate the area. TheMasungiGeoreserve, is within the rainforests of Rizal, in the Sierra Madre Mountain Range. In April 2024, two forest rangers were injured after they were attacked by alleged residents of Baras, Rizal. READ: Malacaang: Probe Masungi resorts The MGFI noted that this move endangers the safety not only of the public but more recklessly, of the rangers and environment defenders who fight a risky battle to defend this threatened landscape. It is apparent that this case is part of a larger, more insidious effort to weaken environmental protection, silence advocates, and clear the path for selfish commercial interests to exploit our natural resources. We will fight not just in defense of Masungi but in defense of environmental justice for all, MGFI said. We call on the Filipino people to see through this deception and stand with us in protecting the last remaining forests of our generation.

Youll be torn between laughing and getting furious when you see Xiaome Ocho on the list, Ortega pointed out, he added. The lawmaker cited these findings as one of the reasons why Duterte must answer where the funds go.

These purple hydrants source water from the wastewater system lessening the strain on our water supply. To address the usual increase in demand for water during the summer months, Manila Water continues its aggressive leak detection and quick response across its water network spanning over 5,500 kilometers to ensure treated water goes directly to its 7.7-million customers. Manila Waters non-revenue water, or water lost due to leaks and illegal connections, remains one of the lowest in Asia averaging only 13.51% in 2024. For supply management, operations for the East Bay Water Supply System Phase 1 have commenced, adding up to 50-million liter per day . The Binangonan Pumping Station, completed in 2024, supports East Bay Phase 1 with a 7-million-liter reservoir. Final testing is also underway for the Calawis Water Treatment Plant, an 80 MLD facility set to bolster water availability. The Cardona Water Treatment Plants capacity is also expected to be maximized up to 110 MLD to meet rising demand especially in drier months. Furthermore, a backwash recovery system is being implemented at its Balara Treatment Plant 1 and 2, recovering 30 MLD of water. As we work to ensure our water network distribution operates efficiently, we seek the cooperation of our customers to always practice responsible water use to further extend the limited supply, especially in Metro Manila, Manila Water Corporate Communications Director Jeric Sevilla said. Year in and year out, the company has been advocating for the responsible use of water to its customers. Called #WaterWais, the campaign is incorporated into all customer engagement activities and digital channels. With all these measures in place, Manila Water is optimistic that water supply will be sufficient throughout the summer months. Angat Dams water level is currently at a healthier level compared to 204.5 meters last year.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041246/manila-water-enhances-preparedness-for-summer-fire-prevention-month,others

Silent no more: How children with disabilities fight online sexual abuse in PH,"MANILA, Philippines One in every hundred Filipino children has been abused to create new child sexual exploitation material. If this can happen to children in general, how much more to those with disabilities isolated, overlooked, and at even greater risk? With the Philippines long considered the global epicenter of Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children , the numbers paint a horrifying picture. Over 400,000 children have fallen victim, yet fewer than 2,000 have been rescued since 2014. The vast majority suffer in silence. For many children with disabilities, social media serves as a lifeline one of the few ways for them to connect with others. However, for traffickers, it acts as a hunting ground. They spend so much time online, more than you would imagine, Gamilla Avena, NORFIL Foundations program manager, toldINQUIRER.net. Children with disabilities, especially those who feel isolated in their own communities, seek friendship online. That makes them more vulnerable because they dont always know whos behind the keyboard, she added. The harsh reality is that children with disabilities are easy targets. Despite the increasing prevalence of OSAEC, research specifically focusing on children and adolescents with disabilities remains limited. However, the few existing studies indicate that children with severe physical disabilities, autism, Williams syndrome, or intellectual disabilities face the highest risk of online victimization. Many do not realize theyre being exploited until its too late. But something is changing. In a historic moment, children and youth with disabilities took the stage to demand action against OSAEC, standing firm in their fight for change. Held in Quezon City and Palawan, the conference,Break the Prevalence, End the Violence: Protecting Children, Creating a Safe Philippines,was not just another forum for adults to speak on behalf of children. This time, the children spoke for themselves. The event will next be held in Bicol to reach even more children with disabilities. Over two days in each location, children and youth with disabilities from across the country shared their experiences, concerns, and ideas. Many were hearing about OSAEC for the first time a stark reminder of how little awareness exists in vulnerable communities. In Palawan, they are not aware of OSAEC. It was their first time to hear [and] learn about it, said Avena. Ive been telling our partner organizations in Palawan [that] Im surprised they werent aware of OSAEC, [especially considering] that Palawan is a very touristy [area], she continued. Through workshops, role-playing, and photovoice activities, participants explored how online abuse happens, why children with disabilities are at risk, and, most importantly, how they can protect themselves and each other. One of the most crucial moments unfolded when the children drafted their own manifesto a document outlining their demands for better education, stronger protections, and improved accessibility in health and safety services. In a decisive call for change, children and youth with disabilities demanded stronger protections and equal rights. Their manifesto outlined four key priorities: 1. Access to education: The children emphasized that education should be more inclusive and tailored to their needs. Parents, in partnership with teachers, should provide guidance to make learning easier, especially for those who require personalized approaches. To support their education, they called for the provision of Accessible Learning Materials resources designed to accommodate their disabilities. Financial constraints are also a major barrier. Many children with disabilities struggle to stay in school because of costly assistive devices, therapy sessions, and transportation challenges. To address this, the children demanded scholarships and government support for assistive devices, ensuring that no child is left behind due to financial difficulties. 2. Access to health: Children with disabilities often face significant obstacles in accessing medical care. Many hospitals and clinics lack the proper facilities, and medical personnel are not trained to communicate with patients who have disabilities. The manifesto called for free medical services, better-equipped health centers, and faster, more efficient processes for children needing medical attention. One specific request was for health workers to be trained in sign language. Deaf children and youth often struggle to communicate their health concerns, which can lead to misdiagnosis, neglect, or poor treatment outcomes. The children also urged the government to provide free medicines, particularly for chronic conditions that require continuous treatment. 3. Access to information: Many children with disabilities are left in the dark about their rights, their daily needs, and how to protect themselves from abuse and exploitation. The lack of accessible information puts them at greater risk of OSAEC, human trafficking, and other forms of violence. The manifesto stressed that all children and youth with disabilities should have access to age-appropriate, disability-friendly materials that teach them about personal safety, online dangers, and their legal rights. They also called for community-based programs that will help spread awareness, equipping children with the knowledge and confidence to seek help when needed. 4. Access to protection: Children with disabilities are among the most vulnerable to violence not just online but in their everyday environments. They called for local governments and barangays to strengthen safety measures to ensure that they can live free from harm. Among their specific demands were: These concrete, immediate measures could greatly reduce risks for children and youth with disabilities, enhancing their safety both online and offline. The conferences may have ended, but the fight for change continues. NORFIL Foundation a non-profit dedicated to protecting the rights of neglected, abused, and disabled children along with the Netherlands-based Liliane Fonds and local partner organizations, plan to expand its program to reach more children, particularly in underserved areas like Bicol. Beyond expansion, they are committed to turning the manifestos demands into concrete action. To make sure these demands reach decision-makers, NORFIL will submit the consolidated manifesto to local government units in the areas where the participating children live. According to Avena, the manifesto is also set to reach the national level. We will also submit the manifesto to the Council for the Welfare of Children, where NORFIL chairs the Committee on Children with Disabilities, she explained. The goal? To push for policy adjustments and stronger government action. Beyond policies, NORFIL is counting on its local partner organizations to push for the manifestos integration into government programs. Some of them are already part of local councils for the protection of children, Avena said, adding that local partner organizations will advocate for the recommendations of children and youth with disabilities to be included in community planning, budgeting, and service delivery. NORFIL said it is committed to making sure that the voices of children with disabilities extend beyond the conference, influencing policymaking and driving real change in communities. * * * Graphics by Ed Lustan/Inquirer.net.

"Govt, private sector urged to do more vs online child abuse","MANILA, Philippines An advocacy group on Wednesday raised concerns over the increasing prevalence of Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children and Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials in the country, calling on the government and private sector to take stronger action against it. CitizenWatch made the pronouncement after the International Justice Mission recently revealed that at least 500,000 minors in the country have fallen victim to OSAEC and CSAEM. READ: Boosting child online protection These figures, said CitizenWatch Philippines co-convenor Kit Belmonte, may even be higher due to underreporting and lack of awareness. We cannot allow the internet to be weaponized against our children. We need tighter regulation of digital platforms, stronger international cooperation to dismantle syndicates, and intensified efforts to educate parents and children alike, Belmonte said in a statement. The group also stressed the need for full enforcement of existing laws, such as Republic Act 11930, the Cybercrime Prevention Act, and the Anti-Child Pornography Act. However, Belmonte stressed that legal frameworks would not be enough and that efforts from telecommunications companies and internet providerslike blocking websites with child abuse materials and educating consumers in responsible internet use, scams and cybercrimeswould be vital in addressing the rise of OSAEC and CSAEM cases. This fight is not just for lawmakers, enforcers, or tech giantsit is a fight for our youth, the future of our nation. Parents must be the first line of defense.

CAPHRA expresses worries over corruption allegations against WHO,"MANILA, Philippines The Coalition of Asia Pacific Tobacco Harm Reduction Advocates expressed concern over corruption allegations against the World Health Organization , citing the United States withdrawal of support. CAPHRA said it had deep concerns about recent events involving the WHO. The group raised questions about the effectiveness of the organizations global public health policies, pointing to accusations of corruption and mismanagement in the Asia-Pacific region. Its time to hold the WHO to its mandate and core mission of protecting global health based on science, not ideology; that is inclusive of all stakeholders, without judgment or prejudice, said Nancy Loucas, CAPHRA executive coordinator. CAPHRA cited evidence of inappropriate influence, primarily by Bloomberg Philanthropies, in domestic policymaking in the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam. In the Philippines, a 2021 House of Representatives public hearing revealed that the local Food and Drug Administration received grants to fund the drafting of local regulations for cigarette alternatives from foreign private organizations funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies. In Bangladesh, the appointment of Saima Wazed as WHO regional director for South East Asia is under scrutiny. Wazed, the daughter of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was elected in November 2023 amid allegations that her mother improperly influenced the election. The director of Bangladeshs Anti-Corruption Commission was quoted in a newspaper saying corruption was suspected in Wazeds appointment. In Pakistan, the government suspended the activities of Tobacco-Free Kids and Vital Strategies, two international non-governmental organizations funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, citing several violations. The Interior Ministry also asked the State Bank of Pakistan to freeze the organizations bank accounts. In Indonesia, the Ministry of Health faces allegations of incorporating the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control agenda into a draft regulation on plain packaging for cigarettes. This sparked concerns about potential foreign intervention in Indonesias tobacco policy. Hikmahanto Juwana, a professor of international law at the University of Indonesia , said that Indonesia should protect its national sovereignty from foreign intervention and that all government policies should be based on domestic conditions. In India, New Delhi stopped a small nonprofit funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies from conducting tobacco-control work after it failed to disclose its funding, according to a Reuters report. An official said other foreign-funded organizations will need prior approval for anti-tobacco activities in the capital. In Vietnam, the Consumer Choice Center said Bloombergs harmful interference threatens smoking reduction. A Facebook post showed WHO officials in Vietnam thanking Bloombergs organizations for their support in providing technical assistance to the government on smoking and nicotine products. The push from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the WHO represents a form of regulatory colonialism, where foreign entities dictate policies without considering the unique challenges of individual countries, the Consumer Choice Center said. CAPHRA said it finds the allegations concerning, particularly as the WHO prepares to convene the 11th Conference of the Parties to the FCTC despite funding constraints from the US withdrawal. COP11, scheduled for Nov. 17 to 22, 2025, at the Geneva International Conference Centre in Switzerland, is expected to cost the WHO millions of dollars. The US withdrew its WHO membership, citing concerns over the organizations handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its response to global health crises, and its ability to implement reforms and maintain independence from inappropriate political influence. This decision has prompted other countries, including Argentina, Hungary, Italy, and potentially Russia and the UK, to reassess their affiliations, raising broader discussions about the WHOs impartiality and political influence. CAPHRA also urged Asia-Pacific countries, including the Philippines, to assert independent policies and reject influence from foreign funders. At this years COP, it is crucial that the Philippines assert its sovereignty against Bloombergs influence over the FCTC and advocate for its own policies. This ensures that smokers who do not quit will have access to less harmful alternatives, CAPHRA said. CAPHRA promotes tobacco harm reduction a public health approach that provides smokers with less harmful alternatives to cigarettes. Scientific studies show that tobacco harm reduction and smoke-free products such as vapes, heated tobacco, and nicotine pouches are far less harmful than cigarettes, which produce toxic smoke.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041169/caphra-expresses-worries-over-corruption-allegations-against-who,others
"55 schools out of voucher program due to ghost students, other issues","MANILA, Philippines The Department of Education has terminated the participation of 55 schools in the senior high school voucher program for various reasons, including the alleged presence of ghost students. This figure was divulged by Tara Rama, Project Manager III of the DepEd, when asked by Kabataan Party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel about the exact number of alleged ghost or nonexistent students under the said initiative. READ: DepEd: P52M almost went to ghost students in 12 private schools Instead, she gave out the number of schools they terminated from the program starting 2023 covering School Years 2021 to 2022, 2022 to 2023, and 2023 to 2024. We started terminating. We had 22 schools for the School Year 2021 to 2022. Thats 22 [terminated] in February 2023. And we terminated another 32 schools for the School Year 2022 to 2023. For 2023 to 2024, we already have one terminated and under investigation another 12, Rama revealed during the committee on basic education and cultures hearing on Thursday. Manuel then asked about the number of vouchers released to these schools. But Rama could not give the exact figure and instead said that DepEd did not release P200 million worth of vouchers after spotting discrepancies from the schools. We cannot say that they were ghost students because it might be that they went to a private school for the first few months, and then later they left and went back to a public school because of a problem. We cannot say for sure that they were all ghost students, she explained in Filipino. To give an estimate, Rama said beneficiaries per school range from a hundred to a thousand, while teaching personnel per school is around 30. Regarding the 12 private schools currently under investigation due to SHS students found to be nonexistent, the DepEd earlier said it stopped the release of vouchers and saved over P50 million in taxpayer money. DepEd chief Sonny Angara said the potential defraudment under the program amounted to P52,571,500, covering the School Year 2023 to 2024. However, he did not identify the schools and only revealed that they are located in Metro Manila, Davao, Ilocos, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Eastern Visayas and the Bangsamoro. The DepEd rolled out the program in 2015 in a bid to make SHS education more accessible to students in low-income families and minimize overcrowding in public schools as grantees may enroll in private institutions using the vouchers. The amount of each voucher ranges from P14,000 to P22,500, depending on the students location.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041095/55-schools-shs-participation-terminated-due-to-ghost-students-others,others

She received first aid and was brought to a hospital where she got intubated. Later, however, Kierra died due to anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. Kierras death was discussed during the hearing of the Senate panel on women and children on the Senate Bill No. 2971 or the Child Tourism Safety Act. The bill seeks to prevent, mitigate and respond to risks affecting children and other visitors to Philippine tourist destinations by providing immediate and sufficient medical and emergency responses. The proposed measure was authored by Senator Risa Hontiveros, During the hearing, Tulfo asked Tourism Undersecretary Maria Rica Bueno why the resort has not been shut down nearly a year after the tragedy. Bueno replied that the resort is not accredited by the Department of Tourism . Nevertheless, the DOT had supposedly referred the case to the local government unit . She said the LGU is the one that has jurisdiction on the resort. I want it shut down kasi insulto pag may namatay na bata We didnt do so much! Tulfo lamented. Bueno mentioned that the DOT, the LGU and the Department of Interior and Local Government are working on the case. But for the lawmaker, this response did not amount to anything. Never siya nasuspinde eh! Kanino ba siya malakas? Gusto ko, mas matutuwa siguro yung marami, kung siya ay napasara, Tulfo stressed. Senator Risa Hontiveros and Tulfo then asked the DOT officials about their initial findings and the status of the resorts operation. READ: PH Ground Zero for lethal jellyfish stings, says expert DOT Office of Tourism Standards and Regulations Director Virgilio Maguigad said their regional director recommended to Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority and the LGU the closure of the particular resort. But as mentioned by Usec. Rica, it is not accredited by the DOT currently. But since it is still within the tourism industry, we try our best to get a hold of the establishment, Maguigad claimed. Tulfo remained firm with his order to shut the resort down. He told Maguidad: Show them that nobody is above the law. Kung sino man ang kuneskyon niya, hindi pwedeng umubra dito! Atty. Angelo Gonzalo Lavarias, representing the Department of Interior Local and Government , said his agencys regional office has not given any update on the case. He said the DILG find out with the LGU if the resorts business permit has been revoked. READ: Child dies after jellyfish sting at Subic beach resort In a letter read before the committee, Kierras mother Jahaziel expressed her full support of the passage of the bill. She also stated that her childs death is a result of the resorts negligence. Her statement comes amid reports of previous similar incidents. She pointed out the lack of warning signs, life guards, emergency protocols and trained medical authorities in the resort. She also criticized the kind of medical service provided to them at the hospital. To this day, my family and I continue to seek justice for my daughter, Jahaziel said in the letter. No parent should have to experience the pain and trauma of losing a child due to neglect and incompetence, Kieras mother said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041109/tulfo-hits-non-closure-of-subic-resort-where-child-died-i-want-it-shut-down,others

DOTr urged to stop or defer NLEX toll hike,"MANILA, Philippines Bayan Muna party-list on Thursday urged Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon to stop or at least suspend the toll increase on the North Luzon Expressway . The party-list called it an anti-people measure that will worsen the financial burden of Filipinos already struggling with high inflation. This toll hike is blatantly inflationary and will inevitably lead to higher prices of basic goods and services, former Bayan Muna representative Ferdinand Gaite said in a statement. The substantial increases, especially for trucks and delivery vehicles, will definitely be passed on to consumers who are already struggling to make ends meet, he added. Gaite also criticized the governments contrasting treatment of workers wage demands and corporate interests. When workers ask for significant wage increases like the P750 wage hike or even the P200 wage increase already passed in Congress, the Marcos administration has many reasons to block it, he said in Filipino. But when big capitalists demand fee increases, they almost certainly grant them, he added. The additional P142 for buses and small trucks and P171 for large trucks for end-to-end travel will significantly impact the cost of transporting goods and people, Gaite went on. Basic commodities from Central and Northern Luzon will become more expensive in Metro Manila, while products from Manila will cost more in the provinces, he added. Gaite further warned that this toll hike is just the first of many increases that will further burden the public. This is not just a matter of convenience for private vehicle owners. It is a direct blow to the livelihood of ordinary citizens, who will suffer from rising prices. Thats why the DOTr must stop this, he said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041131/fwd-bayan-muna-to-dotr-chief-dizon-stop-or-suspend-nlex-toll-hike,others

Maria-Cabagan bridge in Isabela province. House Deputy Minority leader and ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro led the filing of House Resolution No. 2249 on Wednesday afternoon.

"Govt urged to prioritize, address commuters safety","MANILA, Philippines For Rommel San Pascual, a person with disability , walking through a sidewalk to reach an EDSA bus station is not just challenging, but also poses safety risks for commuters. In an interview with INQUIRER.net, San Pascual narrated his experience after conducting a walkthrough at the footbridge of the Nepa Q-mart. He shared that when he attempted to ascend the footbridge in a wheelchair, he had a hard time doing so due to the steep climb.

"Cat dies after being kicked by man in Makati, sparking outrage","MANILA, Philippines A community cat at the Ayala Triangle Gardens in Makati City died after reportedly being kicked by a person who is most probably a foreigner. The cat was resting in the park when a Chinese kicked it, according to nonprofit animal organization CARA Welfare Philippines said. Citing a closed-circuit television footage taken on January 4, the group said the kick appeared to have killed the animal. When confronted and brought to the barangay, the man was arrogant and refused to provide his address, the group said in a Facebook post on Thursday. He told us to write to the Chinese Embassy. Because of this, he remains free to roam the streets, to roam the gardens, the organization reported. We seek your help to know the mans identity and whereabouts in order to proceed with the filing of a case against him, CARA Welfare Philippines pleaded. The group pointed out that the incident was a blatant violation of Republic Act No. 8485. Under RA 8485, also known as the Animal Welfare Act of 1998, any acts of cruelty, abuse and killing of animals are punishable by law. READ: Ignoring animal cruelty, neglect will lead to more severe abuses, says Poe Meanwhile, in a statement on Friday, Sen. Grace Poe condemned the incident and urged authorities to hold the cat killer accountable. That community should be a safe haven for pet cats and dogs. No animal should be subject to cruel and unwarranted abuse, Poe said in Filipino. Poe then pushed for the passage of her bill that would impose a heftier fine on animal abusers. The bill also seeks to empower local government units, particularly barangays, to handle cases of cruelty and neglect of animals. A stronger and more responsive Animal Welfare Law in place would have immediately caught the perpetrator and made him answerable to his crime, she said. The measure is up for approval on third reading in the Senate.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041520/cat-dies-after-being-kicked-by-foreigner-in-makati,others
"SC to land buyers: Verify titles, Registry of Deeds records","MANILA, Philippines The Supreme Court has ruled that clean land titles alone are not enough protection for buyers, ruling that they must thoroughly inspect Registry of Deeds records to avoid falling victim to fraudulent transactions. This was based on the decision written by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa when the SC upheld a ruling that voided the land titles of spouses Orencio and Eloise Manalese. The land titles of the Manalese spouses were voided after the SC found that they failed to conduct due diligence when buying land from a certain Carina Pinpin, who acquired the title through fraud. Relying solely on a certificate of title is insufficient, especially if there are signs of fraud or irregularity, the SC Public Information Office said, citing the decision. Buyers who ignore suspicious facts cannot claim to be in good faith, it added. The case involved properties from the Ferreras family, which Carine Pinpin sold to the Manaleses using duplicate titles obtained through false affidavits of loss and a forged deed of sale from the deceased owners. Despite these red flags, including an unusually low purchase price of P250,000 and notarized documents dated after the original owners had died, the Manaleses proceeded with the sale and registered the titles under their names. Since these transactions were all documented in the Registry of Deeds, Spouses Manalese are deemed to have presumptive knowledge of the defects in Pinpins title and cannot claim ignorance, the SC ruled. The Regional Trial Court and Court of Appeals found the couple to be buyers in bad faith for failing to investigate the propertys history despite the clear warning signs made public in the Registry of Deeds which the SC upheld. Meanwhile, Associate Justice Henri Inting agreed in a concurring opinion that the buyers were not innocent. However, he warned that requiring ordinary buyers to probe beyond a clean title places an undue burden on ordinary buyers and undermines the reliability of certificates of title.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041534/fwd-sc-clean-land-titles-not-enough-buyer-must-check-registry-records-to-avoid-fraud,others
Monsod: Disclose names of senators who refuse to act on VP impeachment,"MANILA, Philippines Former Commission on Elections Chairman Christian Monsod on Friday said that the names of the senators who refused to start the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte immediately must be disclosed to the public. I was asking, who are the senators who refused to act immediately? Please name them for the sake of public information, so they will know what they feel, Monsod said at the sidelines of a forum in San Juan City. He also said that the refusal of the senators to act on the impeachment proceedings may implicate the voters perceptions towards them. I feel that they wanted to postpone the trial because theyre afraid that the true self will be revealed in the deliberations of this impeachment trial. They might say something there that may turn off voters, Monsod added. Further, when asked if the delay of the trial is political, he answered: Maybe. READ: Senate break not reason to defer VP impeachment trial Monsod Monsod, one of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, also said that the Senate session break is not an excuse to delay the impeachment trial. Monsod cited Article XI, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution which states that the trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed once it receives the verified impeachment complaints. He also said that the impeachment trial should not be treated as a legislative task, but as a special task. This is an important part of the Constitution on impeachment for the protection of the people. And sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them. This is a constitutional mandate of the Constitution is certainly superior to a recess, he noted. Meanwhile, Senator Risa Hontiveros previously said that it would be great neglect of duty if the senators of the 19th Congress would fail to act on the impeachment complaint. She added that they would not be able to enforce the rules because it will be the 20th Congress that will implement it. READ: Hontiveros warns of neglect if Senate delays Sara Duterte impeachment Senate President Francis Escudero earlier revealed that no impeachment trial will be conducted during the Congress break because the impeachment court was not convened.

Expanded tertiary education equivalency law a game changer Escudero,"MANILA, Philippines Senate President Francis Escudero on Friday regarded the passage of the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program into law as a game changer, emphasizing its contribution to accessibility of higher education. Escudero said the law will create more educational opportunities for Filipinos, particularly working professionals. This law addresses a pressing need for flexibility and inclusivity in our educational system. By recognizing the value of prior learning and work experience, we are creating a pathway for individuals to achieve their academic aspirations without having to sacrifice their careers or personal responsibilities, Escudero said in a statement. The Presidential Communications Office confirmed that President Ferdinand Marcos signed the ETEEAP Act or the Republic Act No. 12124 on Monday. I extend my gratitude to President Marcos for signing this transformative legislation into law. The ETEEAP Act is a game-changer, making higher education more accessible, especially to Filipinos who have gained significant skills and knowledge outside traditional classrooms, Escudero added. The ETEEAP will identify, assess, validate, and assign equivalent undergraduate-level and special graduate programs of prior learning from formal, non-formal, and informal learning systems and relevant work experiences to qualified individuals for the grant of appropriate academic degrees. He also commended the Commission on Higher Education, which will serve as the lead agency in implementing the program.

"You dont buy the senators, Cynthia Villar quips on impeachment duty","MANILA, PhilippinesEven Sen. Cynthia Villar doubts her colleagues would stop campaigning toprioritize the impeachmentof Vice President Sara Duterte. On Wednesday, Villar was asked about Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Koko Pimentels reminder to fellow senators that they have a constitutional duty that should come first before anything else. Trabaho muna, bago boto, Pimentel said in a message to reporters on Tuesday. READ: Pimentel to draft impeachment rules; set stage for VP Duterte trial He has been urging the Senate leadership to act immediately on the impeachment case against Duterte. Sought for comment at the weekly Kapihan sa Manila Bay, Villar asked: Can you tell that to the senators? Can the Senate President tell that to the senators? Baka sa House kaya kasi meron silang pakinabang . But the Senate, you dont buy the senators. They have their own money, she added. Villar believes the impeachment trial at this point is already out of schedule as Congress is already on break since February 5. Seven of the 23 incumbent senators are seeking reelection Francis Tolentino, Imee Marcos, Christopher Bong Go, Ronald Bato Dela Rosa, Ramon Bong Revilla, Lito Lapid and Pia Cayetano. Meanwhile, Villar and Pimentel are running for a seat in the House of Representatives while Sen. Nancy Binay is seeking a mayoral post in Makati City. Ako ang tingin ko, this is out of schedule na. If you have to be practical Villar said. Pero I agree na its too much to ask the senators to come back and do impeachment while they are campaigning, yung seven na yun, she said. Villar also defended the Senate from criticisms over its alleged failure to immediately act on the impeachment case of Duterte when the 1987 Constitution explicitly states that it shall forthwith proceed with the trial. She pointed out that the articles of impeachment was only transmitted to the Senate on February 5, the last day of session before Congress went on break.

SolGen seeks dismissal of SC petition vs 2025 budget,"MANILA, Philippines- Citing fatal procedural defects and utter lack of merit, government lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the petition questioning the constitutionality of the General Appropriations Act for 2025 signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. last December. The petition before this Honorable Court does not represent a genuine concern for constitutional integrity but appears to be an attempt to merely impede the implementation of a law that is vital to the nations progress and the well-being of its people, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said in his offices 89-page comment dated February 27 but only made public Friday. The petition, filed by Davao Representative Isidro Ungab and former Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, raised several violations of the 1987 Constitution with the approval of the 2025 budget, including the supposed blank items in the bicameral conference committee report of the spending plan. READ: Solon, other petitioners ask Supreme Court to nullify 2025 GAA Petitioners said the Bicameral Conference Committee Report showed several blanks, particularly the budget allocations for theNational Irrigation Administration , Department of Agriculture, and the Philippine Coconut Authority. Here, the Bicameral Conference Committee not only made several amendments to the 2025 General Appropriations Bill but left blanks in their reportwhich is very dubious and dangerous as the budgets for the said offices and programs remain to be undetermined, read the petition. But Guevarra said the claim of a blatant violation of the Constitution is without legal basis and, in fact, is a bare assertion without citation. He said the petitioners failed to point out specific provisions of the Constitution that were violated. Petitioners cannot do so because, in fact, there exists no prohibition, Guevarra said. He added: Whatever doubt petitioners have against the contents of the GAB, whether they were duly deliberated and agreed upon by both houses, and any claim that anything anomalous occurred within the BCC, falls in the face of the enrolled bill. The enrolled bill, he said, has been transmitted to the President, was complete in itself, contained no blanks, and was duly approved by both Houses of Congress. Petitioners have given this Honorable Court no reason to eschew the courtesy owed to a co-equal branch of government and look beyond the enrolled bill to the Congress internal proceedings, said Guevarra.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041600/solgen-seeks-dismissal-of-sc-petition-vs2025-budget,others

The FA-50s were acquired from Korea Aerospace Industries for P18.9 billion during the administration of then-President Benigno Noynoy Aquino Jr. On Tuesday, Castillo reported that an FA-50 fighter jet went missing shortly after midnight while en route to Mactan Airbase in Cebu.

Hontiveros rebukes elusive Roque,"MANILA, Philippines Kung talagang travel lang yan, bakit iligal ang pag-alis mo sa bansa at bakit ayaw mo nang bumalik dito, Harry Roque? Sen. Risa Hontiveros couldnt help but blurt this question on Wednesday after former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque clarified that he is not fleeing from Philippine authorities because he is not a fugitive and he has a right to travel. In a post on Facebook, Roque argued that there was no warrant of arrest issued against him. Citing Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, Roque said he is only being pursued not as a criminal but as a resource person. This, however, did not sit well with Hontiveros. Travel lang ba talaga yang ginagawa ni Atty. Harry Roque, o paglabag na sa batas ng Pilipinas? Hindi ba pagtakas iyan? said Hontiveros in a statement on Wednesday. In his own words, he explains his extended disappearance as flight from a congressional contempt. That is a clear admission of his liability for the crime of disobedience to summons by Congress under Article 150 of the Revised Penal Code, she emphasized. According to the opposition lawmaker, it is extremely ironic that Roque is talking about his right to travel, when the Bureau of Immigration has declared that it is studying the filing of cases against him for leaving the country via illegal means. Ayon nga sa BI, malamang ay gumamit si Roque ng falsified immigration clearances para makapasok sa ibat-ibang bansa, o di kaya ay tinutulungan ng masasamang indibidwal, said Hontiveros. That is on top of the qualified human trafficking complaint he is already facing in connection to his ties to the massive, crime-ridden POGO complex in Porac, Pampanga, she added. During the Senate subcommittee on justice and human rights hearing on Tuesday, Hontiveros questioned Roques whereabouts. The Bureau of Immigration, during the inquiry, said Roque attempted to go to the United States, but failed to do so after being held in Japan. Apart from this, BI Intelligence Division chief Fortunato Manahan Jr. said they have no other information at present as to where Roque and his wife Mylah are.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2040769/fwd-risa-hontiveros-on-harry-roque,others

"Abalos expresses deep gratitude to HK OFWs, stokes Filipino pride","HONG KONG Former Interior Secretary and senatorial candidate Benhur Abalos Jr. received overwhelming support from overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong and vowed to champion legislations that will uplift the lives of Filipinos both overseas and in the Philippines. Speaking before a packed gathering of OFWs, Abalos expressed his deep gratitude to the Filipino community in Hong Kong for their unwavering trust and support. Hong Kong is home to over 140,000 Filipino migrant workers, most of whom are household service workers. While they provide for their families back home, many face challenges such as labor exploitation, lack of legal protection, and high placement fees. Mga kababayan ko dito sa Hong Kong, tandaan ninyo, iisang pamilya tayo. Inaalay ko ang sarili ko sa inyo, Abalos said. Abalos reminded the OFWs that despite lifes challenges, there is always hope and a way forward. Mga kasama, tandaan ninyo ito. Walang taong walang problema at walang problemang walang solusyon. Whether we like it or not, iisang bangka tayo. Matanda, bata, lalaki, babaehenerasyon natin ito. Tandaan niyo yan, walang imposible, he said. Abalos assured OFWs that he understands their struggles and will work towards policies that protect and empower OFWs. Abalos also highlighted the importance of preserving Filipino values, no matter where they are in the world. Ang katangian na dadalhin mo bilang Pilipino, maski saan sa mundo, dadalhin mo talaga dahil proud ka to be a Filipino dahil gusto mong lumaki ang anak mo na makatao, maka-Diyos. At lalo-lalo na, alam niya sagrado ang buhay ng tao, he emphasized. One of the priority pieces of legislation Abalos will push through, if elected, is lowering electricity costs by scrapping value-added tax on electricity, which he believes will open doors for more investments and job opportunities in the country. Uunahin ko ang pagpapababa ng kuryente sa bayan. Tayo ang pangalawa sa pinakamahal na kuryente. Kapag natanggal ang buwis diyan, bababa ang kuryente at dadami ang negosyo, dadami ang trabaho, at marami pang ibang benepisyo, he explained. Abalos has been consistent in his stand against VAT on electricity. During the 13th Congress, Abalos, who was then a congressman, opposed the imposition of VAT on electricity and petroleum products, arguing that it would have severe inflationary impact and only add to the financial burden of Filipino consumers. After the e-VATs passage, Abalos immediately filed a joint resolution declaring a two-year moratorium period on the lifting of exemptions of petroleum products and generation companies from the coverage of VAT. With over 30 years in public service, Abalos underscored the importance of making bold decisions, even when unpopular, if they serve the greater good. May mga pagkakataong dapat gumawa ka ng mga matatapang na desisyon. Kahit alam mong hindi popular, pero alam mong mas tama ang gagawin mo, he said. May mga pagkakataong tatayo ka, maski mag-isa ka na lang. Pero kailangang tindigan mo para protektahan ang mga inaapi.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2040784/abalos-expresses-deep-gratitude-to-hk-ofws-stokes-filipino-pride,others

Castro further added that while the construction of the bridge began in 2014 and the retrofitting was finished just last February 1, all those involved in the incident will be held accountable. Isa sa mga sinsabi po ni Secretary Bonoan, ay maari po, hindi pa po ito conclusion, maaari lamang po na mapanagot din yung may-ari o corporation na may-ari ng dump trucks, she said. She added that further investigation will be conducted to determine whether it was indeed under design that caused the collapse.

He was arrested early this week in Camp Crame by operatives of the Anonas police station following an arrest warrant issued by the Quezon City Metropolitan Trial Court Branch 135.

The police officials arrest came after the Quezon City Prosecutors Office filed a criminal case against him based on a complaint filed by his alleged victim, a non-uniformed personnel of the Philippine National Police . INQUIRER.net opted to withhold the name of the police official due to the sensitive nature of the case and because it is currently undergoing trial.

Said acts exhibit the sexual desire of respondent and he committed the same when they were alone in his personal vehicle. Glaringly, said acts were done against the will and without the consent of complainant, the resolution read.

"Report warns of alarming trend in PH, world obesity","MANILA, PhilippinesAround 38 percent of Filipino adults live with a high Body Mass Index ; by 2030, this number is projected to rise to 34.12 million. Yet, the Philippines along with most countries worldwide remains unprepared to tackle the growing obesity crisis. Findings from the latest World Obesity Atlas, released by the World Obesity Federation on March 4 for World Obesity Day, paints a worrying picture. The report warns that only seven percent of countries have adequate health system plans in place to address obesity, while two-thirds of nations lack even the most basic policies needed to curb its rise. According to the American Heart Association, BMI is a measure of body fat based on a persons weight and height. It is widely used as a screening tool to assess whether someone is underweight, has a normal weight, or is at risk of obesity-related health conditions. The BMI categories include: A high BMI is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. The higher the BMI, the greater the risk of developing these conditions. On the other hand, being underweight also comes with health risks, including weakened immunity, nutritional deficiencies, and increased vulnerability to infections and illnesses. The impact of high BMI is already being felt in the country. In 2021 alone, obesity-related diseases were responsible for 30,329 premature deaths, which means tens of thousands of Filipinos lost their lives too soon due to conditions linked to excess weight. READ: Obesitys heavy toll: Millions of Filipinos now at greater health risks Meanwhile, the burden of illness due to obesity was significant, with affected individuals collectively losing over 308,000 years to diseases like diabetes and heart disease. The situation is expected to worsen. Over the past two decades, obesity rates have surged, and projections show they will keep rising, with at least one in ten Filipinos living with obesity by 2025. READ: Obesity trend among Filipinos to continue in next 20 yrs expert In 2010, less than a million Filipino men were classified as obese, but by 2030, that number is expected to triple, reaching over 3 million. A similar pattern is seen among women, with obesity rates expected to more than double, increasing from 1.5 million to over 4 million in the same period. Several factors contribute to the increasing number of Filipinos struggling with high BMI. According to the Department of Health , the risk of being overweight and obese among Filipinos can be attributed to both individual lifestyle choices and the lack of supportive environments to make healthy choices such as moving more and eating right. Hence, interventions that address the social determinants of health, highlighting the need to integrate health in all public policies, to enable behavior change and create supportive environments must be put in place, said Assistant Health Secretary Beverly Lorraine C. Ho. We need to make healthier food options in communities, schools, and workplaces more available, affordable, and accessible to all Filipinos, and we must make our public infrastructure such as parks, roads and pathways be more conducive to physical activity and active mobility, she added. READ: Govt, private sector urged to reverse obesity trend Studies also found a growing consumption of unhealthy, processed foods. The easy availability of sugary drinks, fast food, and calorie-dense snacks has fueled rapid weight gain across all age groups. While the government has introduced a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, Filipinos still consume a significant amount, averaging between 500ml to 1 liter per person per week. To put that into perspective, thats one to two regular 500ml soda bottles every week, translating to about 20 to 40 tablespoons of sugar just from beverages alone. Over a year, this adds up to 52 to 104 liters of sugary drinks enough to fill a large cooler or even a small drum. This far exceeds the WHO and DOH recommended sugar intake of 6 to 12 teaspoons per day . Many Filipinos already surpass this limit through sugary drinks alone, even before factoring in sugar from other foods. The obesity crisis is not limited to the Philippines. Worldwide, obesity rates have been increasing at an alarming pace. By 2030, an estimated 1.13 billion people will be living with obesity more than double the number recorded in 2010. READ: More than one billion now afflicted by obesity: Lancet This surge comes with devastating health consequences, as excess weight is now responsible for around 1.6 million deaths annually. To put that into perspective, more people die from obesity-related diseases than from road accidents each year. Obesity is also driving a rise in non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. In 2021 alone, nearly 27 percent of the global burden of avoidable ill-health from NCDs was linked to high BMI. The impact is even more severe for type 2 diabetes, with over half of the global disease burden attributed to obesity and overweight. The Atlas likewise noted that, across the globe, severe obesity or Class II obesity is becoming increasingly common. The number of adults with a BMI over 35 kg/m, a level where medical treatment is often required, is expected to more than double globally from 157 million in 2010 to 385 million in 2030. The trend is particularly alarming in developing regions, where health systems are often unprepared to handle the surge in obesity-related illnesses. In Africa, the number of adults with severe obesity is projected to increase by more than 200 percent, from 11.8 million in 2010 to 37.2 million in 2030. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, the number is expected to more than triple, rising from 21.6 million to 68 millionan increase of over 214 percent. Meanwhile, the Americas will see a rise of more than 100 percent, with cases growing from 63 million to 136 million. Europe is also experiencing a significant increase, with the number of adults with severe obesity expected to rise by over 50 percent, from 41.3 million to 63 million. However, the sharpest increases are projected in Southeast Asia, where cases are expected to surge by over 300 percent, from 9.3 million to 37.3 million. In the Western Pacific region, which includes the Philippines, the number of adults with severe obesity is set to grow by nearly 400 percent, from 9.3 million to 43 million. Despite these alarming figures, most countries including the Philippines lack sufficient policies to curb obesity. The World Obesity Federations analysis of national policies shows that two-thirds of countries have implemented only one or none of the five key strategies recommended to address obesity. These include taxes on sugary drinks, regulations on unhealthy food marketing, and incentives for healthier eating and active lifestyles While the Philippines has introduced some national policies to address obesity, significant gaps remain. There are national guidelines for managing high BMI and physical inactivity, and recent surveys have been conducted on obesity, diet, and exercise. However, the country lacks a national strategy for managing NCDs in primary healthcare, which means many Filipinos struggling with obesity-related illnesses do not have proper medical support Experts stress that addressing obesity requires more than just individual lifestyle changes it demands strong government intervention. The World Obesity Federation is urging governments worldwide to adopt a whole-of-society approach that includes strengthening health systems, expanding food regulations, and creating environments that promote physical activity. The global organization stressed that a well-prepared health system should integrate obesity prevention and management into primary healthcare services, ensuring that every individual receives medical guidance and support before their weight-related conditions worsen. At the same time, stricter food regulations such as improved food labeling, tighter restrictions on unhealthy product marketing, and stronger nutrition education programs are needed to help consumers make healthier choices. Beyond healthcare and food policies, reshaping the built environment is essential to promoting active lifestyles. Investing in parks, safe pedestrian walkways, and bike-friendly infrastructure can encourage physical activity not just in the Philippines but worldwide. The organization also recommended that workplaces implement wellness programs to support employees in staying active and making healthier choices. The Philippines is at a crossroads. If no urgent action is taken, obesity will continue to drive up healthcare costs, reduce workforce productivity, and lead to a surge in preventable diseases. The World Obesity Federation warns that obesity is not just a personal issue it is a national health crisis that requires immediate and coordinated action. With the right policies, public awareness, and collective effort, the country can slow down the rising obesity trend and prevent a future healthcare disaster. The time to act is now, before the weight of this crisis becomes too heavy to bear. Graphics by Ed Lustan/Inquirer.net.

"SC: Youth, immaturity boost victims testimony in molestation cases","MANILA, Philippines The Supreme Court has ruled that being a minor and immaturity are significant factors in proving the truthfulness and sincerity of a victims testimony regarding unlawful acts committed against them, especially in acts of lascivious conduct or cases of molestation. This is based on a decision penned by Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul Inting, in which the SC Third Division affirmed the conviction of a certain Resty Laconsay for Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act after molesting a 14-year-old girl. The case stems from an incident in 2011 wherein the victim, a 14-year-old female, accused Laconsay of pulling down her blanket, touching her foot, and caressing her leg up to her groin. The victim said she cried for help, prompting the suspect to flee. During the trial the victim testified that the light from a cellphone allowed her catch a glimpse of the suspects face. Her sister, who also witnessed the incident, also identified the assailant as Laconsay, their neighbor. Laconsay, however, denied the allegations, asserting that he was in a different place at that time and argued that the victims testimony was inconsistent. Both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals found him guilty of Acts of Lasciviousness under the Revised Penal Code in relation to RA No. 7610. Laconsay elevated the case to the High Court, but the SC affirmed his conviction, stating that the victims testimony was clear, credible, and supported by her sisters statement. According to the SC the offense of Lascivious Conduct is committed when an assailant performs lascivious acts against a person aged 12 to below 18. Such acts include intentional touchingdirectly or through clothingof the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks; insertion of any object into the genitalia, anus, or mouth; bestiality; masturbation; or lascivious exhibition of genitals, all done with intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse sexual desire The SC found [the victims] testimony credible in describing the lascivious acts committed against her and positively identifying Laconsay as her assailant. The SC also emphasized that her youth and immaturity are badges of truth and sincerity, because of her relative vulnerability and the shame and embarrassment that would arise if the matter about which she testified was not true. Laconsay was sentenced to imprisonment of eight years and one day to 17 years, four months and one day. He was also ordered to pay a total of P165,000 as civil indemnity, damages, and fine.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2040822/sc-rules-youth-immaturity-boost-victims-testimony-in-cases-of-molestation,others

Village head slain in Ilagan City; persons of interest identified,"CITY OF ILAGAN, Isabela A 63-year-old village head of Cabiseria 27 in this city was shot and killed on Tuesday by two men on a motorcycle, the police said. Police Captain Noralyn Andal, Ilagan police spokesperson, told the Inquirer that they have identified persons of interest in the killing of Avelino Quitola, 63, who died from bullet wounds to the head and body.

"Sandiganbayan junks Maslogs motion for reconsideration, affirms conviction","MANILA, Philippines The Sandiganbayan has junked the motion for reconsideration filed by Mary Ann Maslog , affirming its decision to convict her in the graft case related to the controversial textbook scam in 1998. In a six-page resolution dated March 5, the anti-graft courts Second Division denied the motion for reconsideration filed by Maslog last February 12 for lack of merit. The Court finds that her motion is mainly a mere rehash of arguments already resolved in the Decision dated January 28, 2025, the document reads. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit. The Decision dated January 28, 2025, finding accused Mary Ann T. Maslog guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3 of R.A. 3019, stands, it adds. Maslog filed her appeal before the Sandiganbayan, seeking to reverse her conviction for graft, which resulted in her 10-year prison sentence. In her motion, Maslog argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish all the elements of the offense under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and the prosecution failed to prove the existence of a conspiracy between her and her co-accused Emilia Aranas and Ernesto Guiang of the then Department of Education. But based on the resolution, the prosecution maintained that there is proof beyond reasonable doubt convicting Maslog of graft and that her assumption of multiple aliases and attempt to fake her death constitute consciousness of guilt. These acts demonstrate a calculated effort to escape legal accountability, contradicting her claim of innocence, the Sandiganbayan pointed out. The prosecution likewise mentioned the direct and circumstantial evidence establishing her active role in facilitating the fraudulent disbursement of government funds and proof of her collusion with Aranas and Guiang through her submission of falsified sub-allotment release orders to facilitate disbursements; active coordination in ensuring the unlawful release of public funds; and receipt of proceeds from the fraudulent transactions. The accused was a private individual who conspired with public officers. While Maslog was not a public officer, her collaboration with Aranas and Guiang-who had control over the disbursement of public funds-makes her equally liable under Section 3 of RA 3019, the anti-graft court said. The accused, with evident bad faith, caused undue injury to the government. The fraudulent transactions resulted in the illegal disbursement of millions of pesos, causing grave injury to the government and unwarranted benefits to Esteem Enterprises, it added. Maslog, along with Aranas and Guiang was implicated in a P24-million graft case in 1998. They were accused of allegedly faking records to secure payments from the Department of Budget and Management. In 2020, Aranas and Guiang were both convicted and sentenced to a maximum of prison term of 10 years by the Sandiganbayan. Meanwhile, Maslogs case was archived as she was reported to have died in 2019. The anti-graft court was only informed about her purported death in November 2020.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2040808/sandiganbayan-junks-motion-for-reco-of-maslog-affirms-her-graft-conviction,others

Jo-join kami doon sa one million signature campaign, Castro told reporters in an interview on Wednesday. Well, actually, nag-violate na sila sa Constitution eh. Diba? Dapat forthwith na nga eh. Yung forthwith na yung sinasabi. Immediately, kahit yung ating mga Constitutionalists, yung mga law experts, dapat talaga hinarap na ng Senado itong impeachment, Castro said. Earlier Wednesday, Senate President Francis Escudero stood firm against rushing the impeachment trial of the vice president. He even said that no amount of signatures will amend the law nor convince me to violate it.

Senate Secretary Renato Bantug received the document at 5:49 p.m., but it was not reported to the plenary before it adjourned shortly before 7 p.m. Escudero explained that holding an impeachment trial legally cannot be done, as the complaint was not referred to the plenary to establish a basis for convening the impeachment court by the Senate, which had been serving as a legislative body. He said that for an impeachment court to be convened, there has to be an ongoing session in the chamber. He noted that this would allow impeachment judges to take oaths. Escudero stressed that this will happen on June 2 once the session resumes after this years midterm elections.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2040775/makabayan-bloc-to-join-1m-signature-drive-to-start-vps-impeachment-trial,others

Lacson: Excessive giving of aid may contribute to unemployment in PH,"CAMARINES SUR, Philippines Does providing too much financial aid make Filipinos lazy? Former Sen. Panfilo Ping Lacson, who is aiming for a Senate comeback, wants to reassess the various forms of the ayuda system in the country if he is reelected. Lacson raised concerns over whether excessive aid provision discourages people from working. He made this remark during a press conference with the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas Senate slate in Camarines Sur on Friday when asked if the distribution of aid contributes to the rising unemployment rates in the country. The Philippine Statistics Authority had earlier reported that the number of jobless Filipinos rose to 2.16 million in January, up from 1.63 million in December. Maybe, with the overwhelming amount of aid, our fellow Filipinos have become lazy and dont want to work. So, I think this is my personal opinion we should revisit the many forms of aid we are giving, Lacson said partly in Filipino. He proposed enhancing the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program instead, noting that this national poverty reduction strategy is institutionalized. READ: Philippine unemployment rate rises to 4.3% in January If we keep giving aid without basing it on data provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority or the national government, the money might just go to waste. On the other hand, if we enhance 4Ps, it is time-bound. After seven years, a family graduates, and another family takes their place. It addresses nutrition and education, provides jobs, and offers opportunities for livelihood, Lacson explained in Filipino. Lacson expressed hope that his fellow Alyansa candidates would support his position and advocate for focusing on 4Ps. Meanwhile, other forms of aid may be contributing to the rising unemployment rate, from 3.1% to 4.3%. People may become lazy, thinking there will always be aid coming to them just because they are related to a leader or patron, he added. Senatorial hopeful Camille Villar, meanwhile, supported Lacsons remarks, emphasizing the need to identify the root causes of the rising unemployment rate. This is also what I advocate for: we need to help our micro, small, and medium enterprises because 67 to 70% of jobs in the Philippines come from MSMEs, Villar said, mostly in Filipino. In addition to aid, we should support these small businesses and entrepreneurs through policies that are friendly to doing business. We should make it easier for them to operate and succeed, she added in Filipino.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041545/lacson-excessive-giving-of-aid-may-contribute-to-unemployment-in-ph,others

"Ilocos Norte college nurtures heirloom, native seeds for future","SEED LIBRARY LAOAG CITY A collection of heirloom, native and resistant vegetable seed varieties currently grown at the Ilocos Norte Agricultural College in Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte will soon be available for sharing with other schools and other plant enthusiasts in the province. This initiative is aimed at preserving the seed varieties from generation to generation. The heirloom and native seeds, which include red beans, bitter gourd, squash, winged beans and tomatoes, among others, will be made available at the INAC seed library. The library was formally inaugurated on Tuesday in partnership with the Energy Development Corporation and the Ilocos Norte Research and Experiment Center. In an interview with the Philippine News Agency on Friday, Joel Calidro, project leader of the first school-based seed library in the province, said about 11 varieties of heirloom and open-pollinated varieties are under their care. We initiated this project because of a growing concern for expensive seedlings and the inaccessibility of native seeds at home, he said. Together with our parents and students engaged in agriculture, we started the sowing and growing of these varieties to benefit the future generation, he noted. Calidro pointed out that the plant varieties need to be conserved and made available to the community as they are tolerant to the impacts of climate change, and to promote food biodiversity, self-sufficiency and sustainability. He said the growing dependence on commercial or hybrid seeds, which usually produce smaller yields than native varieties, is contributing to the scarcity of heirloom vegetable varieties in the market. By preserving heirloom and native seeds, as well as resilient varieties, this initiative empowers agriculture students, gardeners and farmers to protect ecosystems and cultivate a greener future through seed sowing, saving and sharing practices, he said. Meanwhile, Crisner Lagazo, owner of the Crisner Integrated Farm in Sulbec, Pasuquin town, said having an accessible seed library for high-quality seeds is a big blessing to the community. This will help empower local communities one seed at a time.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041732/ilocos-norte-college-nurtures-heirloom-native-seeds-for-future,others

Romualdez vows to help challenge ruling on commercial fishing in municipal waters,"MANILA, Philippines House of Representatives Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez on Friday vowed to exhaust efforts to challenge a Supreme Court decision that allows commercial fishing in municipal waters. Romualdez gave this assurance to Iloilo fisherfolk during their dialogue at the Ayala Estate on Sicogon Island in Carles, Iloilo. They aired their concern that commercial fishing may lead to loss of their livelihood. Naiintindihan natin po ang kalagayan ng ating mga fisherfolk. Tama po ang posisyon ninyo, wala akong nakikitang mali. Kaya mataas ang kumpyansa ko na mapapagbigyan tayo. Lahat ng kakayahan ko gagamitin ko dito sa kaso ninyo, asahan nyo po, Romualdez said in a statement. In August 2024, the SC ruling upheld the decision of the Malabon Regional Trial Court allowing Mercidar Fishing Corp. to fish within municipal waters and nullifying some provisions of the Fisheries code. Kakausapin din natin yung abogado natin, yung OSG [Office of the Solicitor General], kaya siguradong aabot ito sa kinaaukulan. Meritorious naman, at siguro kailangan lang ipaabot natin sa mga mahistrado na ito talaga ang hinaing ng mga mangingisda, Romualdez added. Prior to this, several fisherfolk and groups also expressed their dissent against the ruling, citing harmful impacts to marine ecosystems and livelihood. Oceana Philippines, Philippine Movement for Climate Justice, and other groups previously filed a petition to the SC to challenge its decision. ACT Teachers party-list Rep.

Legarda champions womens leadership in marine sustainability,"Senator Loren Legarda has reaffirmed her commitment to marine conservation, sustainable development, and womens empowerment during the Blue Horizons Accelerating the UK-Philippines Partnership for a Sustainable Blue Economy panel discussion at The Conservatory, Manila Peninsula Hotel, Makati City. Hosted by the British Embassy in Manila in honor of the visit of UK Foreign Secretary Rt. Hon. David Lammy, the panel discussion focused on advancing biodiversity and ocean protection. As a principal author and sponsor of the Blue Economy Bill, Legarda underscored the need to ensure proper ocean accounting and environmental valuation, stressing that economic sustainability and ecological conservation must go hand in hand. How can a Filipino, born in an archipelago where 64 out of 82 provinces are coastal and where more than 32,000 kilometers of shoreline define our nation, not see the ocean as central to our identity and survival? Legarda said. The four-term senator emphasized that the Blue Economy Bill was designed to complement the Philippine Environment and Natural Capital Accounting System , another law she championed. The Blue Economy Bill, complemented by the PENCAS Law, ensures that we track, measure, and assign value to our coral reefs, mangroves, and coastal resources. Only by doing so can we fully understand what we own and what we must protect, she said. However, Legarda warned against attempts to dilute the Blue Economy Bill. I will not allow its core principles be mangled, destroying the natural habitat of fish and abandoning our fisherfolk, she said. The event also marked International Womens Day, highlighting the vital role of women in ocean conservation and sustainable fisheries. When asked how womens voices can be better heard in these discussions, Legarda emphasized the need for greater economic access, financial support, and the integration of Indigenous Knowledge Systems . As the author and sponsor of the Peoples Survival Fund , I want to ensure that more women in local communities, particularly in coastal areas, gain access to funding without excessive bureaucracy, Legarda said. She called for concrete solutions, including providing women with greater financial access through agencies like the DTI, DENR, and DA, ensuring that micro, small, and medium enterprises in coastal areas receive support. She also stressed the importance of documenting IKS to preserve and pass down traditional marine conservation practices. Additionally, she highlighted the need to equip women with better tools by using resources from the PSF, Biodiversity Fund, and Shared Services Facilities program to provide fishing boats, nets, cold storage, and tuna processing facilitiesparticularly in tuna-rich areas such as the Tuna Highway in her home region. Legarda further emphasized the need to invest in education, technology, and innovation to empower women in marine-based industries, citing her authorship of the Philippine Innovation Act as a key mechanism to support womens entrepreneurship and skills development. Theres so much to be done, but the first step is breaking barriers to access, Legarda said. Only by equipping women with education, capital, and innovation can we truly build a resilient and inclusive Blue Economy. The panel discussion precedes the 5th UK-PH Climate and Environment Dialogue on March 12 and the UN Ocean Conference in June, where both the Philippines and the UK are expected to deepen their commitments to ocean conservation, blue carbon ecosystems, and sustainable fisheries management.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2042233/legarda-champions-womens-leadership-in-marine-sustainability,others

Responding to lifes great calling Teaching students with special needs,"MANILA, Philippines Elsa Pabustan has dedicated more than half of her life to teaching. For her, it is not just a profession. It is a life-long devotion. She believes she is being used by God as an instrument to change the lives of many children, especially those who need special attention and care. Teacher Elsa, like what her students call her, has been practicing her profession for almost 30 years. From years of teaching basic education curriculum to elementary students, she answered one of her lifes biggest callings to teach under the Special Needs Education program. In an interview with INQUIRER.net, she recalled how she became the pioneer teacher of the SNED program in Lawa Elementary School in Meycauayan City, Bulacan. She said the school principal told her that she has the heart, patience and dedication as a teacher. I accepted the challenge kasi kung aayaw ako, if I would reject yung request sa akin, sino ang kukuha and paano yung mga batang nangangailangan ng tulong ko? she recalled her her questions to herself. READ: #HerStory: Women Transforming Society The 55-year-old teacher said she may not be not have been equipped with adequate preparation at first, but she wanted to touch the childrens lives. She finished her Masters Degree specializing in special education in December 2022. She also attended seminars and training for the special education program. READ: Teachers give kids with special needs special attention [Ang mga magulang], hindi rin nila tanggap, unang-una, yung mga anak nila na ganun. So, ang hirap ding magpaliwanag sa kanila kung paano ma-a-accept yung ganung klaseng behavior ng anak nila, Pabustan said. Kasi nasa in denial stage lagi ang mga magulang natin noon. Ngayon, at least, may awareness na yung mga magulang about doon sa mga batang may special needs, she recalled. Further, through the years, she said teaching under the SNED program has become rewarding and fulfilling. Its not the material things but yung inside talaga [ng puso mo], yung joy na hindi ko nako-contain when I see my students or learners grow and learn, teacher Elsa beamed. Even in small things lang, it is a big win for me. Maliliit na bagay pero sa mga batang tinuturuan ko, big na yun, she said with pride. Those moments are considered as a victory that should be celebrated, she emphasized. Teacher Elsa admits there were times she wanted to quit teaching the program in the beginning. Noong first day of class, talagang windang. Hindi ko alam [kung] paano iha-handle sila kasi first time ko. Wala pa akong gaanong seminar na na-attend-an, she remembered. Pero sabi ko, by the grace of God, talagang niyakap ko kung anong mayroon na dapat kong maranasan sa paghawak, pag-handle ng mga batang kagaya nila, she said. For her, treating the children with special needs like any other children is important, not just in teaching, but in everyday living. I-embrace mo talaga kung anung mayroon ang mga batang ito and i-treat mo sila na they are just normal children or learner na mayroon ka rin, she said. We should not concentrate sa mga disability nila, but on their abilities, she pointed out. For starters, Teacher Elsa thinks that the childrens behavior must first be modified and so are their fine motor skills. Self-help and gross motor skills must be enhanced before introducing academics to them, according to her. Teacher Elsa observed that the children are equipped with their own talents and skills; and unleashing their full potential is crucial for their growth. She also bared the struggles of the parents in accepting and adjusting to the difficult and complex conditions of their children. READ: Teachers, parents share burden of educating special needs students She said that her silent victories include witnessing moments when the children improve, learn how to follow instructions, and start interacting with other kids. Teachers are regarded as the students second parents. Since the school is an extension of a home to nourish and teach the kids valuable lessons in life, Teacher Elsa finds herself learning from her profession as well. READ: Col. Maria Christina Basco: Mother and pilot She shared that teaching children with special needs highly increases her level of empathy. Teacher Elsa herself is a mother of two. She said her kids are already grown up but she is looking forward to more things to learn from the special kids. These pieces of education will prepare her for the role of a grandmother someday. Mas lalo mong maiintindihan, magagamit as a mother on how to handle yung mga bata, yung apo, yung anak mo sa pagpapalaki sa kanila, she said. Kasi sa pagiging teacher ng special education, kung mayroon kang patience, kailangang ipo-prolong nang mas mahaba yung patience, pang-unawa at pagmamahal sa kanila, she explained. Looking back at her journey as a teacher, she said that her fulfillment with her profession has come a long way. Actually, habang minamahal mo sila, at the same time, you pray for them, she shared. Teacher Elsa shared that she has become an advocate of special education. She said she conducts outreach programs for advocacy campaigns on raising awareness for her learners with special needs.

Bong Go urges public to stay safe as danger level heat index looms,"At least three areas in Luzon are forecast to experience heat indices within the danger range on Monday, March 3, prompting Senator Christopher Bong Go, Chairperson of the Senate Health Committee, to call for heightened public awareness and proactive measures to prevent heat-related illnesses. According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration , the heat indexor the apparent temperature felt by the human body when factoring in humidity. Pagasa classifies temperatures between 42C and 51C as danger level, where heat cramps and heat exhaustion are likely, and heat stroke is probable with continued exposure. During a motorcade in Quezon City on Monday, March 3, Senator Go took a moment to address the crowd, emphasizing the importance of staying safe amid the extreme temperatures. Ingat kayo. Mainit ang panahon. Ang importante sa akin, health at safety nyo. Ingat po kayo. Inom kayo ng tubig at sundin ang health protocols. Unahin natin ang ating kalusugan dahil katumbas ito ng buhay ng bawat Pilipino, he told residents. Given these conditions, several local government units and institutions have already taken precautions. Senator Go emphasized the importance of public vigilance and preparedness, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Kapag ganito kainit, hindi ito biro. Sa sobrang taas ng heat index, may posibilidad ng heat stroke, lalo na sa mga nagtatrabaho sa labas at sa mga estudyanteng pumapasok sa eskwela, Senator Go said. Ang simpleng pag-inom ng tubig, pagsuot ng magaang damit, at pag-iwas sa direktang sikat ng araw sa tanghaling tapat ay malaking bagay na para maiwasan ang anumang komplikasyon. The senator also reiterated the importance of hydration and avoiding strenuous activities during peak hours of heat. He urged workplaces and schools to make adjustments where necessary to prioritize the health and safety of individuals. While addressing immediate heat-related risks, Senator Go also underscored the significance of strengthening the countrys healthcare system to ensure that people suffering from heat-related illnesses can receive prompt medical attention. He pointed to the Malasakit Centers, which serve as one-stop shops for medical assistance, particularly for indigent patients. As the principal author and sponsor of Republic Act No. 11463 or the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019, Senator Go has spearheaded the institutionalization of this program, with 167 centers now operating across the country. To date, the Department of Health reports that over 17 million Filipinos have benefited from the initiative. Additionally, the senator highlighted the role of Super Health Centers, which provide essential primary care services, consultations, and early disease detection in grassroots communities. These centers, funded through the collaboration of lawmakers, DOH, and local government units, are integral in ensuring accessible healthcare, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Through his legislative efforts, Senator Go also principally sponsored and is one of the authors of Republic Act No. 11959, also known as the Regional Specialty Centers Act. The law mandates the establishment of regional specialty centers within existing DOH regional hospitals. Ang init ng panahon ay isang seryosong usapin na may direktang epekto sa ating kalusugan. Kailangan nating tiyakin na may agarang access sa serbisyong medikal ang sinumang mangangailangan, Senator Go stressed. As the country braces for intensifying temperatures in the coming months, the senator urged Filipinos to stay informed, prioritize their well-being, and take advantage of government programs designed to safeguard their health.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041956/bong-go-urges-public-to-stay-safe-as-danger-level-heat-index-looms,others
Orion Perez blasts economic restrictions: Filipino first is hurting PH,"The Filipino First policy is quickly becoming Philippines lastand we have no one to blame but ourselves because we locked the restrictions into our own Constitution, says political commentator Orion Perez Dumdum. The constitutional reform advocate launched into a scathing critique of the Philippines economic policies in his latest episode on Peanut Gallery Media Networks Youtube channel. He argued that the countrys self-imposed economic restrictions have crippled job creation, suppressed wages, and forced millions of Filipinos to seek work abroad. According to Perez, the very policies meant to protect Filipino businesses have instead weakened the countrys ability to compete globally. Perez painted a grim picture of the economy, emphasizing its reliance on overseas remittances. We are a hopelessly impoverished, hopelessly pathetic country, he said. We rely on exporting our people abroad as OFWs seafarers, nurses, engineers, IT professionals, architects, cooks, waiters, domestic helpers, bar girls, prostitutes, and even DRUG MULES. He argued that the countrys failure to create enough jobs has left its workforce with no choice but to leave in search of better opportunities. According to Perez, massive unemployment is at the root of the countrys economic struggles. He dismissed official figures placing the unemployment rate at 3.2 percent, claiming the real number is closer to 40 percent. If we were to be really honest about it, I think the real unemployment rate in the Philippines is around 40 percent. OR PROBABLY EVEN MORE! He pointed to rural areas where many families survive solely on OFW remittances, with jobless household members appearing active simply because they manage small sari-sari stores or engage in informal work. These cases, he argued, mask the true scale of joblessness in the country. He blamed this economic stagnation on restrictive policies that discourage foreign investment. It is this policy, nay, mindset that is the basis for numerous anti-Foreign Direct Investment Restrictions, he said, criticizing the Filipino First Policy for driving potential investors away. He stressed that no other Southeast Asian nation has similar economic restrictions embedded in its Constitution. We are the only country in the region that has all those anti-Foreign Investment Restrictions in the Constitution. He argued that this effectively eliminates the Philippines from consideration when multinational companies look to expand in the region, depriving the country of much-needed capital and employment opportunities. Perez contrasted the Philippines situation with that of other nations, particularly Singapore. Job openings far outnumber the number of local citizens looking for jobs, he said, pointing out how foreign investment has contributed to a thriving labor market and higher wages. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, job scarcity allows employers to suppress wages and impose excessive hiring criteria. When there are way too many job-seekers and too few jobs available, we end up with extremely low wages, he explained. Because so many people compete for limited positions, employers can afford to set unrealistic qualificationscollege degrees, extensive work experience, age limits, and even a pleasing personalityfor jobs that pay the minimum wage. Beyond unemployment, Perez warned that economic stagnation has created deeper social problems. Massive unemployment causes so many other problems and symptoms, he said, linking joblessness to corruption, crime, and the continued rise of political dynasties. He argued that a desperate job market fuels vote-buying and patronage politics, as many Filipinos rely on government handouts and political connections to survive. Without stable employment, people become more vulnerable to exploitation by corrupt politicians, illegal recruiters, and even human traffickers. For Perez, the solution is clear: constitutional reform to remove foreign investment restrictions. If you dont want the Philippines to remain a pathetic and hopeless country, let us all please correct the Constitution and get rid of all anti-Foreign Investment Restrictions in it, he urged. He insisted that opening the economy to global businesses would create millions of new jobs and offer Filipinos real economic opportunities at home instead of forcing them to leave.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2042029/orion-perez-blasts-economic-restrictions-filipino-first-is-hurting-ph,others

DOTr to prioritize Iloilo airport in govt privatization efforts,"ILOILO CITY The Department of Transportation will prioritize the Iloilo International Airport in Cabatuan town in the governments privatization efforts. DOTr Secretary Vivencio Dizon, joined by other officials of the department, provided Iloilo Gov. Arthur Defensor Jr., City Mayor Jerry Treas, and Uswag Ilonggo party-list Rep. James Ang Jr. an update on the unsolicited proposal from the Villar Group. We assured the mayor and the governor that DOTr will fast-track the current PPP proposal from the Villar Group to ensure the sustainable development and growth of the airport to support the growth of the city, Dizon said in an interview when he visited the airport on Saturday. He said they were at the very advanced stage of the proposal and hoped to complete it within the year. In the meantime, he said, P190 million in funds from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines would be used for the repair and rehabilitation of the present airport terminal. The funds will be used to fix the equipment and escalator and add more seats and elevators, among others. Dizon said the government would invest about P200 million this year. The private proponent would invest about P15 billion as a mandatory investment, but as soon as they come in, the initial investment would be P3.5 billion. Treas, who chairs the Infrastructure Development Committee of the Regional Development Council, said Iloilo was the second busiest airport in Western Visayas, so there was a need to improve it. Privatization is necessary because we are getting more flights every day. We will be getting more flights. I have read that last year, we had two million passengers and the second busiest airport in Western Visayas, second only to Caticlan, he said in a separate interview. Meanwhile, Defensor is mulling the idea of a terminal mall, perfect for Filipinos who come in droves when sending or welcoming relatives. Ive been suggesting that a mall. That is possible because I understand the proponent for the expansion of the airport is a mall operator. It is a terminal blended with mall, he said. He added that the terminal mall could accommodate the culture and how we behave, how we do things here in Iloilo and the whole country. That is only an idea. But I think, its a good direction moving forward, especially, again, that the proponent is also a mall operator. Hopefully, we can have a dialogue with the proponent and the DOTr to have something like that, and we want that to be the first in the whole country, the governor added. Dizon said they were open to the idea but needed to work with the private operator in charge of the master plan until 2035. The objective is to grow the airport up to 10.5 million passengers, he added. Dizon said apart from Iloilo, they were also eyeing the privatization of airports in Davao and other major tourist destinations, such as Siargao, Kalibo, Bacolod, and Dumaguete. The instruction of our President is we really need to privatize because that is the way forward, he said.

"Binay, Castro raise concerns over DENR order on Masungi Georeserve","MANILA, Philippines Sen. Nancy Binay and ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro raised concerns over the Department of Environment and Natural Resources order for the developer of Masungi Georeserve in Rizal to vacate the 300-hectare property. In its order on Friday, the DENR alleged irregularities on the part of Blue Star Construction Development Corporation, an affiliate of the Masungi Georeserve Foundation Inc. which manages the property. Masungi is for our children and our childrens children. Ngayong pinaba-vacate nila ang Masungi Georeserve in 15 days, ano ang vision at plano ng DENR para mapangalagaan at maprotektahan ang Masungi? Binay said in a statement on Saturday. [N]ababahala tayo sa magiging resulta ng kanselasyon ng kontrata ng Blue Star. Alam nating walang kakayanan ang DENR na saluhin ang anumang kasalukuyang aksyon na ginagawa ng foundation, the senator added. Binay is the current chairperson of the Senate Committee on Sustainable Development Goals, Innovations and Futures Thinking. For its part, the MGFI pinned the blame on the DENR, claiming the agency did not clear the area of large-scale illegal occupants, liens and encumbrances which they said caused significant injury to Blue Star. Ang pagpapaalis sa Masungi Georeserve Foundation ay malinaw na hakbang tungo sa pagbukas ng protektadong lugar para sa komersyal na interes, Castro said in a statement also on Saturday. Ano ba talaga ang plano ng DENR? Iligtas ang kalikasan o ibenta ito sa mga mayayamang developer? the ACT Teachers party-list representative added. Castro echoed the MGFIs sentiment that the move was part of a larger, more insidious effort to weaken environmental protection. The timing of this eviction notice is highly suspicious, coming at a time when Masungi has received international recognition for its conservation efforts, she said. This is not about legal technicalities. This is about silencing environmental advocates who have been effective in protecting our natural resources, Castro added.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2041917/binay-castro-raise-concerns-over-denr-order-for-developer-to-vacate-masungi,others

Study says body image concerns affect wellbeing of young adults in PH,"A nationwide survey conducted by Arkipelago Analytics in February 2025 has found that body image continues to have a significant impact on the wellbeing of Filipinos, with younger adults particularly affected. The study, which utilized both online and offline data collection methods, highlights that 52 percent of Filipinos aged 1824 report experiencing negative effects due to body image6 percent higher than the global average for this age group. The impact remains substantial across other age brackets, with 41 percent of those aged 2534, 35 percent of those 3544, and 22 percent of respondents aged 4554 and 5564 reporting negative consequences. The lowest recorded impact was among those aged 65 and above at 18 percent. The most commonly reported consequences of negative body image include low self-esteem, heightened stress and anxiety, and depression or persistent low mood. Other frequently cited effects include social withdrawal, relationship difficulties, and disordered eating habits. Notably, a majority of those who reported negative effects on wellbeing due to body image said their perception of their own body had worsened compared to 2024, suggesting a growing concern over time.

READ: Passenger claims being victimized by tanim-bala In a Facebook post on Saturday, Adel said she and her family were already at the boarding gate when OTS personnel approached her, claiming they found an anting-anting in her bag. When Adel asked what an amulet was, a security officer, while laughing, told her that an X-ray scanner had detected a bullet shell in her baggage. According to Adel, she thought she was being pranked because the security officer made the allegation very casually. She denied the claim and asked for an on-the-spot inspection of her luggage, but security personnel insisted she accompany them. Adel and her family refused as their flight was already boarding. The OTS personnel then called a supervisor, who later claimed the bullet shell was in her handbag, not in her luggage. They also showed her an X-ray image, supposedly proving their claim.

Eastern Samar town building shifts to solar power,"TACLOBAN CITY, Philippines A coastal municipality in Eastern Samar has shifted to solar power as a cost-effective electricity source and to promote renewable energy. Guiuan town has partnered with the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities , an international non-government organization advocating fair climate policy and low-carbon, climate-resilient development, for the installation of a 60-kilowatt-peak rooftop solar photovoltaic system on its municipal building. Mylene Capongcol, assistant secretary of the Department of Energy, said the 60-kWp hybrid solar system could help the municipality save on energy costs and allow the local government to use its savings for other programs and investments. Through this installation, we will see the proof of having the power to choose our electricity supply, she said. Guiuan, located at the southernmost end of Samar Island, has regularly experienced power outages that could be solved through the solar power project, according to Mayor Analiza Gonzales-Kwan. Guiuan is the largest municipality in Eastern Samar, and this project will inspire many others to see that it is possible. This collaboration between ICSC and the municipality of Guiuan demonstrates the power of partnership built on a shared vision, mutual trust, and a deep understanding of the communitys needs. Its a game changer, the mayor said. Kwan vouched for the durability of the solar panel system. These panels cannot be destroyed easily even amid typhoons as they were mounted on concrete roofs unless the weather disturbance is as strong as Super Typhoon Yolanda, she said, referring to the strongest typhoon to hit the inland in 2013. The memorandum of agreement for the hybrid solar PV installation project was signed between ICSC and the local government of Guiuan in October 2024. At least 100 solar panels were installed at the rooftop of the municipal hall building before the ceremonial switch-on and turnover ceremony held last Feb. 27. Following the turnover ceremony, the hybrid PV system will undergo a one-month testing period before full operational use. The project represents the largest PV system installation by ICSC in Eastern Visayas and will provide power to the municipal hall and its facilities. The goal is to extend the solar power program to commercial, industrial, and residential buildings. Kwan said the municipal government pays around P200,000 for its monthly power consumption an amount that could be used for other services now that they already have a solar power system. This is cost-efficient and resilient and savings can be redirected toward essential programs for our people, she said in an interview on March 5. Renewable energy can also be an economic driver since we need to foster a new workforce and enhance local technical expertise which can position Guiuan as a leader in sustainable development, Kwan added. She hoped their move would inspire other government offices and even private houses in Guiuan to use solar power as their source of electricity. Kwan said she also initiated the solarization of street lights in the islands of Homonhon, Manicani, Victory, Suluan, and Tubabao. READ: E. Samar gov to DILG: Help address high power rates ICSC Executive Director Angelo Kairos Dela Cruz said the initiative serves as a model for climate-resilient development. Our partnership with Guiuan goes beyond the solarization of the municipal hall rooftop. This milestone signals systemic changes that will serve as an example of how climate-resilient development can be achieved through strong local leadership and collective action, he said. Rectito Melquiades, Guiuan town council secretary, said powering up the solar PV system takes another significant step toward self-reliance, embracing renewable energy solutions for the communities, the economy, and the environment. We are not just switching on a new energy source for the municipal hall building. We are igniting a transformative journey for our beloved townone that prioritizes sustainability, resilience, and progress, he said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2042421/eastern-samar-town-building-shifts-to-solar-power,others
Family visited by Pope Francis in Tacloban prays for his fast recovery,"TACLOBAN CITY A family, who unexpectedly met Pope Francis in this city 10 years ago, has been praying for his recovery. We learned about the Popes condition through social media, and since then, we have been praying daily for him, said 54-year-old Jenita Aguilar in an interview on March 4 at their home in Pope Francis-SM Cares Village, a resettlement site in Barangay New Kawayan forsurvivors of Super Typhoon Yolanda . Aguilar expressed confidence that their prayers would help the Pope regain his strength. During his historic visit on Jan. 17, 2015, Pope Francis made an unexpected stop at the home of Aguilar in the San Jose district, the area worst hit by the strongest typhoon to hit inland. The visit took place on his way to the cathedral in Palo town, Leyte. I still remember the moment we met him. His hands were so soft, and his voice was gentle. He placed his hands on our heads as he blessed us, Aguilar recalled. The visit, she said, was a complete surprise. We were just outside our house in Barangay 86, San Jose, waiting for the Popes convoy to pass by when suddenly, he stopped at our home. No one had informed us that he would be visiting, she said. The encounter lasted only a few minutes but left an indelible mark on them. Aguilar said one of the Popes security personnel handed to them a rosary which they placed on their altar as a cherished souvenir. Aside from Aguilar, Pope Francis also blessed her husband, Ruby, 48, their daughter Elizabeth, and the families of her three siblings. The Aguilar familys joy was bittersweet as they had suffered a devastating loss during Yolanda. Their son, Rodgen, who was seven years old then, was swept away by the storm surge. We were taking shelter at the house of a relative when the storm surge hit us, and I lost my grip on him. We searched for his body, but we never found him, Aguilar said. Some of their relatives also perished in the typhoon. Since May 2015, the Aguilars have been living in Pope Francis-SM Cares Village, one of the resettlement communities established for the typhoons survivors. In February, Archbishop John Du of Palo called on the faithful to pray for the immediate recovery of Pope Francis, the only Pontiff to have ever visited Eastern Visayas. Our continued prayers and Masses offered for his health and well-being are our powerful way of showing our love for the Holy Father, he said. The archbishop said Pope Francis visit to Leyte brought a profound sense of hope and solidarity to communities affected by Yolanda, which devastated the region on Nov. 8, 2013. His presence as the vicar of Christ served as a powerful symbol of Gods mercy and compassion, reminding us that we are not alone in our collective efforts of healing and rebuilding, he added. During his visit, the Pope presided over a Mass in Tacloban attended by more than 200,000 people despite a typhoon that hit the province then. He also visited the Palo Cathedral and met with families affected by Yolanda. According to the Vatican, Pope Francis, 88, is being treated for double pneumonia and early kidney failure, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy. Despite his serious health issues, he has remained alert and communicative, attending Mass and expressing gratitude for the global outpouring of prayers and support.

The EDCOM will work with the Commission on Higher Education, the Department of Interior and Local Government, and the Early Childhood Care and Development Council to increase the number of early childhood education graduates in regions identified to be lacking.

Dutertes diverting attention away from OVP fund misuse issue Ortega,"MANILA, Philippines La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega has accused the Dutertes of diverting public attention away from fund misuse allegations hounding the office of Vice President Sara Duterte. In a press briefing on Monday, Ortega said Davao City Mayor Sebastian Dutertes recent statements on the 2025 national budget are just a distraction. Ortega and Bataan 1st District Rep. Geraldine Roman were asked about Mayor Dutertes statements on his podcast where he also claimed that the impeachment trial of his sister, Vice President Duterte, was a distraction from the budget controversy and the Marcos administrations decreasing support. According to Ortega, Vice President Duterte has yet to answer questions related to the identity of Mary Grace Piattos the name that appeared on the acknowledgment receipts of the Office of the Vice Presidents confidential fund disbursements. Likewise, what theyre doing is just a distraction because they still have not answered who Mary Grace is, so what they are doing is to look for distraction, look for diversion so that the issue would not be discussed publicly. Thats their strategy, he said in Filipino. Roman, meanwhile, said that the allegations that the General Appropriations Bill submitted to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for his signature had blank allocations for some items have been addressed already by the House committee on appropriations. She also noted that the grounds for the impeachment of the Vice President came first before the budget issue, which is now being tackled by the Supreme Court. I think it is clear, our committee on appropriations has talked about it and everything, theres a perfect explanation to how the GAA was crafted, how it was signed into law, she added. Ortega also said that the issues raised by lawmakers against Vice President Duterte were publicly available and on record. We saw that we had the quad comm hearing, the committee on good government and public accountability had a hearing,so these are all inquiries, there were witnesses presented, there was concrete evidence submitted, compared to the theatrics and distractions that they are doing, he said in Filipino. Theres a big difference. The people can see that because everything is on record, we were live, we were open to the public as compared to people who do not talk but are now suddenly talking. So thats just theatrics, diversion, he added. Mayor Duterte, in his podcast Basta Dabawenyo, repeatedly questioned the timing of the impeachment of Vice President Duterte. He also insisted that Congress, particularly the House of Representatives, must explain why there were blank items in the 2025 budget bill. The issue stemmed from Davao City 3rd District Rep. Isidro Ungab and former President Rodrigo Dutertes allegation that the GAB had blank provisions. Ungab said this was based on the copy of the bicameral conference committee report that was sent to House lawmakers before it was ratified. READ: Duterte ally: Will raise budget blanks issue before SC However, acting appropriations chairperson and Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo clarified last January 27 that the blanks in the bicam report on the 2025 budget were only just for the final computation of the amendments made by lawmakers. Quimboreiterated that the 2025 General Appropriations Act is legal, as the allocations on the then-proposed budget were already decided by the bicam members before both the House and the Senate ratified the report. READ: Quimbo: Blanks in 2025 budget only for final computation Vice President Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of CF lodged within her offices, threats to government officials including President Marcos, and conduct unbecoming of a high-ranking official. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate Despite her previous pronouncements that she would show up to the impeachment trial, the Vice President said last February 7 that she is not keen on attending the trial.

Roman hopes House will OK changes to pro-men Family Code provisions,"MANILA, Philippines Bataan 1st District Rep. Geraldine Roman has urged the House of Representatives to tackle proposed amendments to the Family Code of the Philippines in its remaining session days, so that provisions giving undue priority to men are changed. During a press briefing on Monday, Roman was asked about the Houses achievements during the 19th Congress in terms of pro-women legislation, in time for the celebration of Womens Month. The lawmaker said that while the third reading passage of the proposed Absolute Divorce Act is a win for women empowerment, there are measures that they want passed before the 19th Congress ends. READ: House approves divorce bill on final reading For other pieces of legislation, yes we are still hopeful. Do you know that under the Family Code there are 11 articles that actually give priority to the husband? Its always the male spouse who has the say. Property issues, you want to sell a house, maybe the entire family is already okay with it as you need money. But if the husband says he does not want to, he will be followed, she said in Filipino. Your 21-year-old child will be wedded off and the family has agreed because the woman is pregnant. But if the father says he does not want it, thats it. So theres something intrinsically unfair about these 11 articles in the Family Code, she added. According to Roman, she and other members of the House committee on women and gender equality, which she heads, fully support House Bill No. 11218 or the proposed amendments to Executive Order No. 209 which established the Family Code. In particular, HB No. 11218 wants the amendment of Articles 4, 96, 124, 211, and 225 of the Family Code. The bill seeks changes to Article 96, which tackles the administration and enjoyment of communal properties of spouses. Originally, the Family Code states that in case of disagreement, the husbands decision shall prevail, subject to recourse to the court by the wife. If HB No. 11218 is enacted, Article 96 will now read as any act of administration by either spouse without the consent of the other shall be unenforceable until it is subsequently ratified by the non-consenting spouse. Disagreements can still be settled in court, but the bill proposes that the wordings be changed into gender-neutral terms, like In case of disagreement, the spouses shall make earnest efforts to settle their differences: provided, that should the spouses fail to enter into a compromise, either spouse shall have recourse to the court for a proper remedy in a summary proceeding, which must be availed of within five years from the date the contract was entered into, by the parties or upon knowledge of the non-consenting spouse, whichever comes later. Currently, the bill is still at the House plenary, and it is still in the period of sponsorship, which means it has not been approved on second reading yet. Roman said that while she is aware that the bill may no longer be signed into law during the 19th Congress, approval of the measure on third reading before the session ends means the proposal would be forwarded to the committee during the 20th Congress. For the longest time, we in the committee on women and gender equality, unanimously, all of the women legislators of the House of Representatives, we want this changed. Because this is a remnant, a vestige of the old regime that always gives men priority over women. As if all men have good behavior, Roman pointed out What were asking for is just equal standing within the family. So we are pushing for this. I hope the rules committee listens to us, we have already made our sponsorship speech, we have six working days left, thats why we hope it will pass through the period of interpellation and third reading so that during the 20th Congress, it would not have to go through rigorous processes at the committee level, she added. According to Roman, she understands that the proposed Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sex Characteristics Equality Bill has faced difficulties, but something as basic as the Family Code must be fair to both sexes. With the SOGIESC Equality Bill, we are facing difficulty in passing it into law, but something as fundamental as the Family Code, even if we ask and survey the women here, I think it is correct for us to amend the Family Code, she added. READ: SOGIESC bill reaches House plenary after almost a year Despite advances in society, several womens rights advocates still see many points for improvement in the Philippines. Last February 3, several pro-women groups gathered to call on corporations to take a stand against violence against women and children , launching a policy framework as businesses remain silent on the proliferation of domestic violence cases. According to the Zero VAWC Alliance, the framework outlines nine key principles for organizations to address domestic violence, including survivor support, accountability measures, and workplace policies that promote safety and equality.

"Scientists urge SC: Protect fisherfolks rights, municipal waters","MANILA, PhilippinesA scientist group has urged the Supreme Court to uphold the rights of small-scale fisherfolk amid legal battles over commercial fishing operations encroaching on municipal waters, which are meant to be reserved for artisanal fishers. AGHAM Advocates of Science and Technology for the People expressed support for small fisherfolk, religious groups, and local government units resisting commercial fishing in municipal waters. The group said allowing large-scale fishing operations in these areas could worsen the decline of the countrys fish stock and further threaten the livelihood of coastal communities. A provision in the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998 allows LGUs to grant commercial fishing vessels access to municipal waters under certain conditions. AGHAM, however, warned that this could dramatically shrink the fishing grounds available to over a million small-scale fishers. Based on studies from various organizations, if the Supreme Court upholds its ruling on the Mercidor petition, municipal fishers could be left with just 2 percent of their traditional fishing grounds. In comparison, 98 percent of the countrys waters would be open to commercial fishing vessels. Under the law, commercial fishing inside the 10-15 kilometer municipal water zone is allowed only if the area is deeper than 7 fathoms and if LGUs permit it. However, some coastal areas reach this depth just a few kilometers from shore, raising concerns about the ease with which commercial fishers could enter municipal waters. Mercidar Fishing Corp. challenged fishing restrictions on October 25, 2023. Less than two months later, the Malabon RTC ruled in its favor, nullifying municipal control over commercial fishing in the 15-km zone and lifting the ban on waters shallower than 12.8 meters. On August 19, 2024, the Supreme Court upheld the decision, citing the OSGs late appeal. READ: Petition filed vs SC ruling on big-scale fishing in town waters AGHAM also flagged the poor enforcement of rules prohibiting commercial fishers from using active fishing gear within these waters. Compounding the issue, some commercial operators continue to resist vessel monitoring systems a key tool in tracking illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing under the amended Fisheries Code . If commercial fishing operators and companies refuse to follow the existing rules, fully allowing them inside municipal waters would spell ecological disaster, AGHAM warned. Recent data from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Philippine Statistics Authority showed an alarming trend. As of 2022, the country had 370,000 registered municipal fishing vessels compared to just 5,090 commercial vessels. Despite being only 1.3 percent of total registered fishing vessels, commercial fishers produce almost as much catch as municipal fishers. With the Supreme Court ruling allowing more commercial fishing in municipal waters, AGHAM fears that fish stocks will deplete even faster, pushing small-scale fishers deeper into poverty. If commercial vessels with highly efficient fishing gear gain wider access to municipal waters, it will only accelerate the exhaustion of our marine resources, the group said. AGHAMs warning echoed a previous one by Oceana, an international marine protection group. They stated that the declining marine municipal fisheries output already threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and pollution faces an even greater risk if commercial fishing is legitimized within municipal waters, which are legally reserved for small-scale fishers. READ: Fish harvest drops to lowest amid legal fight over municipal waters A preliminary report from the PSA stressed the reported declines in marine municipal fisheries, inland municipal fisheries, and aquaculture. Only the commercial fisheries sector showed growth in 2024. Marine municipal fisheries production dropped by 8.8 percent, from 879.96 thousand metric tons in 2023 to 802.77 thousand metric tons in 2024 its lowest level since 2002. This reduced the sectors share to 19.8 percent of total fisheries production. In contrast, commercial fisheries output increased by 4.2 percent, reaching 857.33 thousand metric tons in 2024, up from 822.43 thousand metric tons in 2023. It now accounts for 21.2 percent of total fisheries production. AGHAM also refuted claims from commercial fishing groups that municipal waters are underutilized because many small-scale fishers lack the means to fish farther out at sea. Most municipal fisherfolk cant afford fuel for longer trips, while others rely on loan sharks for capital. They often have no choice but to sell their catch to their creditors at unfair prices, AGHAM said. Instead of opening municipal waters to commercial fishers, AGHAM urged the government to step in with direct support for small-scale fishers. Among their proposed solutions: In line with AGHAMs appeal were concerns raised by Oceana, which earlier described the Supreme Courts ruling as highly disturbing. Oceana argued that municipal waters are legally designated for small-scale fishers and that opening them to commercial vessels violates their rights and threatens food security. At least 50 bishops , including Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, have also voiced opposition, warning that the ruling could push coastal communities into deeper poverty by allowing unfair competition. READ: Groups to SC: Protect rights of small fishers BFAR has filed a motion for reconsideration with the Supreme Court, arguing that allowing commercial fishing in municipal waters would contradict efforts to ensure sustainable fishing and marine conservation.

Budget Secretary Pangandaman hails 5.7% budget deficit drop,"MANILA, Philippines We are very pleased with the report that our budget deficit for 2024 has gone down to 5.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product or P1.506 trillion. This is better than expected, Department of Budget and Management Secretary Amenah Mina F. Pangandaman said. This came following the recent release of the Cash Operations Report of the Bureau of the Treasury on the national governments full-year fiscal performance for 2024. This is the lowest rate recorded since the pandemic started in 2020, Pangandaman noted. It is a marked improvement compared to the 6.2 percent deficit recorded in 2023, given the better-than-expected revenue and spending performance. This is also well within the fiscal outlook of the Development Budget Coordination Committee at our last meeting. Pangandaman stressed that this is thanks in large part to the dynamic leadership of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. and the Philippine Economic Team who have been at the forefront of ensuring that the macroeconomic targets of the administration are met. The DBCC met on December 2, 2024, to revisit the governments medium-term macroeconomic assumptions and fiscal targets, including the deficit outlook for 2024, which is expected to reach 5.7 percent of GDP. This performance reaffirms that we are on track with our Agenda for Prosperity, Pangandaman added. This solidifies the Philippines position as one of the dynamic emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific region. The DBCC aims to gradually reduce the budget deficit to 3.7 percent by 2028. Pangandaman said that the countrys economic managers remain committed to achieving growth-enhancing fiscal consolidation while prioritizing long-term investments in key sectors such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare to sustain our economic recovery. Through these efforts, we will continue to build a Bagong Pilipinas that fosters job creation, increases incomes, and reduces poverty, the Budget Secretary and Chair of the DBCC assured. This positive outcome underscores the effectiveness of the Department of Budget and Managements efforts to optimize agencies budget utilization rates, Pangandaman said. Government spending rose by 11.04 percent compared to the previous year, surpassing the target by 2.97 percent, driven primarily by the accelerated implementation of various health and social protection programs, increased salaries for qualified government employees, and strong infrastructure and other capital outlays of the Department of Public Works and Highways, among others. Meanwhile, government revenues for 2024 reached Php 4.419 trillion or 16.72 percent of GDP, higher by 15.56 percent compared to 2023.

Legarda leads the PH push for ocean protection ahead of UN conference,"MANILA, Philippines A decade after the historic Manila Call to Action on Climate Change, Senator Loren Legarda remains at the forefront of global climate actionthis time, with an urgent call to protect the worlds oceans. As the Philippines prepares for the 2025 UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, Legarda is pushing for stronger commitments on marine biodiversity conservation, blue carbon ecosystems, and climate-resilient ocean governance. With just 100 days before the UN Ocean Conference, we must move beyond pledges and into action, Legarda declared. We cannot politely request changewe must demand it. Demand that governments, industries, and institutions take bold, irreversible steps to protect our oceans. Demand that we turn rhetoric into results. Legarda, alongside French Ambassador H.E. Marie Fontanel, led the launch of 100 Days for the Ocean, a mobilization campaign under the Blue Nations Initiative, which unites the Philippines and France in amplifying global ocean advocacy. The four-term senator has been at the forefront of key legislative and diplomatic efforts to protect marine ecosystems. She has championed the Philippines participation in the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People and the Global Ocean Alliance, committing to protect at least 30% of the worlds land and ocean by 2030. Recognizing the need for concrete action, Legarda funded activities leading up to the UN Ocean Conference in collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Climate Change Commission . She also underscored the importance of passing the Blue Economy Bill, which she principally authored and sponsored, now in its final stages of legislative deliberation. Despite progress over the past decade, Legarda expressed frustration at the slow pace of global action. Last year, for the first time, the Earths temperature breached the 1.5C thresholdcrossing the very line we fought to avoid, she warned. For us in the Philippines, this is not an abstract statistic. Every fraction of a degree warmer brings more devastating typhoons, rising sea levels swallowing our coastlines, and extreme weather events upending lives and livelihoods. We are no longer talking about projections. We are living the consequences of inaction. Legarda emphasized that the fight for ocean protection is a fight for survival, not just for the Philippines but for all nations. A decade ago, we called for climate action, climate solidarity, and climate justice. Today, we raise a demand. For our oceans. For our climate. For future generations who will either suffer from our inaction or thrive because of our courage. Legarda first championed global climate action when she co-led the Manila Call to Action on Climate Change alongside French actress and climate advocate Marion Cotillard, a declaration endorsed by then-Presidents Benigno Aquino III and Franois Hollande. As chairperson of the Senate Subcommittee on the Paris Agreement, she championed the Philippines ratification of the treaty, which entered into force on Earth Day, April 22, 2017. As the UN Ocean Conference nears, Legarda is making it clear: the time for waiting has long passed. Now is the time to act.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2039478/legarda-leads-the-ph-push-for-ocean-protection-ahead-of-un-conference,others

The ninth month of the Islamic calendar, Ramadan is one of the most important months in Islam. During the month-long observance of Ramadan, adult Muslims are obliged to abstain from food, drink, and other physical needs from sunrise to sunset. Acts of kindness would be taking center stage in many Bangsamoro communities where the faithful devout more time in prayer and Quran recitation.

The bridges opening was delayed because a third-party audit found that it had a defective design unsuitable for its length and load. Nakakagalit. Heads must roll!Anuman ang dahilan, dapat ma-blacklist ang contractor niyan at parusahan, the lawmaker said. At dapat ayusin nila ang tulay without any additional cost to the people, he added. Bong Revilla also wants the Department of Public Works and Highways to hold their engineers and personnel in charge of overseeing the project accountable. Hindi dapat nakakalusot sa DPWH ang ganito, he stressed. Pitong taon binuhusan ng pondo ng bayan, tapos dalawang buwan pa lang giba na, Bong Revilla lamented. Meanwhile, the solon expressed concern for the public and those who may have been hurt by the incident. Ipinagdarasal natin na sana ay walang nasaktan o napinsala sa nangyari, he ended.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2039253/bong-revilla-heads-must-roll-over-isabela-bridge-collapse,others
"Manila Water, ERC lead historic first: Pioneering retail aggregation switch","MANILA, Philippines As a key advocate of the amendments in Retail Aggregation Program , Manila Water has taken a pioneering step in securing cost-efficient electricity, becoming the first pilot entity to switch from captive to contestable market under the expanded RAP on February 7, 2025. With the promulgation of the Omnibus Rules, the coverage of the RAP has been expanded, allowing qualified consumers to benefit from more competitive energy options, expanding the freedom of choice, and promoting energy democracy The enhanced RAP framework empowers customers like Manila Water to consolidate the power demands of their facilities within the same distribution utility franchise areas, reinforcing the principle of freedom of choice and unlocking access to more affordable electricity through the retail market. By leveraging this opportunity, Manila Water enhances operational efficiency, ensuring long-term benefits for the communities it serves. Through this collaboration with the ERC [Energy Regulatory Commission], we have helped refine the RAP to offer greater flexibility in energy sourcing, freedom from choosing power provider and empower to negotiate for lower electricity tariffs. This initiative strengthens our ability to power water and wastewater treatment facilities efficiently while ensuring that cost savings translate into improved services for our customers. At the same time, this step forward contributes to a more competitive and sustainable energy market that benefits the nation, Manila Water President and CEO Jocot de Dios said. Currently, the water company has successfully consolidated ten wastewater facilities under the RAP, namely: Heroes Hill Sewage Treatment Plant , FTI STP, Kalayaan STP, San Mateo STP, East Avenue Lift Station, Road 5 , Mahabang Parang Lift Station, UP Diliman STP, Diego Silang STP, and Olandes STP. These facilities have a combined average demand of 500KW. For the customers, as mentioned earlier, [the RAP] allows greater freedom to negotiate more acceptable and suitable terms for their power requirements. For the retail suppliers, it allows for the growth of a new market that will usher in more economic activity and more jobs, ERC Chairperson Monalisa Dimalanta said. This milestone reflects Manila Waters commitment to responsible resource management and service excellence to t customers. In cooperation with the Energy Regulatory Commission and its implementing partners MERALCO, PrimeRES Energy Corporation, and the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines Inc. , Manila Water continues to advance innovative solutions that optimize operations and provide greater value to the communities it serves.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2039242/manila-water-erc-lead-historic-first-pioneering-retail-aggregation-switch,others
VP purposely did not comply with COA requirement to list CF recipients,"MANILA, Philippines Vice President Sara Duterte purposely did not comply with the requirements of the Commission on Audit to list real recipients of confidential funds worth P612.5 million given to the Office of the Vice President and Department of Education under her leadership, according to a lawmaker. La Union Representative and Deputy Majority Leader Paolo Ortega V said the issue is the refusal to comply with the requirement, and not the failure to do so. READ: House impeaches Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate Hindi naman sa hindi nagko-comply. Ayaw talaga nilang mag-comply. Yan ang nakikita kong problema dyan. Siyempre kung may tinatago ka, magkaka problema ka talaga dyan, Ortega said in a statement. READ: Not all agencies are entitled to CF ex-COA commissioner Mendoza He noted that this was a response to the statement of senatorial candidate and former COA commissioner Heidi Mendoza that all agency heads are required to follow the COA guidelines in keeping a separate list of real identities of recipients of funds aside from their aliases. Alam naman po natin yan kasi during the committee on good government na mga hearings, nasabi naman po ng COA lahat yan. Kumbaga, subject to COA rules talaga lahat yan at meron naman silang procedure sa mga yan. So napakasimple, ayaw lang talaga nilang mag-comply. Bakit, may tinatago siguro sila, Ortega added. Further, Manila City Representative and House committee on good government and public accountability chairperson Joel Chua echoed Mendozas statement, noting that the list of CIF [confidential intelligence funds] is supposed to be given to the COA in a sealed envelope to protect confidential informants. So bakit magkakaroon ng ganyang requirement kung hindi naman tunay na pangalan ang ilalagay? Kaya nga may mga protective measures na ganito dahil nga para maprotektahan yung mga pangalan, yung mga tao na ginamit dito sa intelligence gathering. So, kung ilalagay mo lang naman dyan mga pangalan na kagaya ng Mary Grace Piattos at kung anu-ano pa, so bakit pa maglalagay ng ganyang mga proteksyon ang ating COA? Chua argued. The name Mary Grace Piattos surfaced during the investigation of the House panel on good government and public accountability where she was supposedly the person who signed acknowledgement receipts as part of the liquidation reports referring to the P23.8 million confidential funds covered by 158 receipts. The Philippine Statistics Authority confirmed that there is no Mary Grace Piattos in their live birth and death registry. Previous House hearings had been probing the alleged misuse of the confidential funds allocated to the Office of the Vice President . A House probe found out that the OVP and the Department of Education submitted about 4,500 acknowledgement receipts to the Commission on Audit to explain how they used the P612.5 million of confidential funds.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2039532/vp-purposely-did-not-comply-with-coa-requirement-to-list-cf-recipients,others
"VP Duterte impeachment trial delay may endanger evidence, witness Chua","MANILA, Philippines Manila 3rd District Rep. Joel Chua on Friday warned that delaying the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte may endanger the evidence and witnesses. Chua, a member of the House of Representatives prosecution team,said that while they respect Senate President Francis Escuderos views on when the impeachment trial should start, they cannot help but express concerns about the risks brought by the delay. The reason why we want the impeachment to start is because you know, we are also looking at the evidence that we have gathered, these may be tampered, Chua said during a press briefing. Second, our witnesses, of course, we are concerned that if the hearings would take some time before starting, many of them might be scared, he added. On Wednesday, Escudero said the trial would start on July 30 when the 20th Congress starts office and end in October. READ: Senate can wrap up Sara Duterte impeachment trial in 3 months Escudero As of now, what we can do is to appeal. At the end of the day, of course, we also respect the views of the senators, especially the Senate President. We will talk about that, but that is one thing that me and the other prosecutors are considering and worrying about, Chua said in Filipino. The House impeached Duterte last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a Vice President. The articles of impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate as the 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-third of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, the trial has yet to start as the articles of impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before the session ended on February 5. It means Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. There are also conflicting opinions regarding whether it is proper for the current Senate to start the trial when the 2025 midterm elections will surely change the composition of the legislative chamber. Despite these concerns, the House and the Senate have started preparing for the impeachment trial. On Friday morning, House Secretary General Reginald Velasco confirmed that he released Memorandum order No. 19-1006, which directs the following offices to perform these duties: Among the functions of the units would be to provide plenary support, legal research, records management, stenographic transcription, information technology, security, and administrative coordination. The Houses formation of the secretariat comes after Escudero last Wednesday outlined the duties of offices and officials once the impeachment trial starts. READ: Escudero readies administrative support to Senate for VPs impeachment Prosecutor and Ako Bicol party-list Rep. Raul Angelo Bongalon said Escuderos decision may be a signal that the Senate is now tackling the matter with a sense of urgency.

Court orders continued detention of 3 in slay of Agusan mining exec,"PROSPERIDAD, AGUSAN DEL SUR A court in Quezon City has ordered the continued detention of three suspects in the killing of retired Col. Samuel Afdal while the trial of their case is ongoing. The order was contained in a resolution dated January 10, 2025, a copy of which was shown to the Inquirer on Thursday by lawyers of Afdals widow, Evelyn. READ: Alleged brains behind Agusan mining execs slay falls In the resolution, Judge Juris Dilinila-Callanta of Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 85, denied the petition to post bail of murder suspects Ryan Mark Baylon, Rosalino Degracia and Alemar Awado, as the evidence presented by the prosecution, so far, showed that the guilt of the accused is strong. The circumstances narrated by prosecution witnesses during their testimony before the court, according to Callantas resolution, would establish that accused Baylon, Degracia and Awado are probably guilty of the offense charged. Afdal, owner of Rosario Manobo Mining Corp., survived an ambush on Oct. 26, 2021 while driving on an uphill bend toward the companys base camp in Rosario, Agusan del Sur. He died on Nov. 15, 2021, while undergoing treatment in a hospital in Davao City. A fourth suspect, former New Peoples Army rebel Jeffrey Mamerto, had confessed to pulling the trigger against Afdal, and pointed to Baylon as the killings alleged mastermind who offered Degracia and Awado P200,000 for the hit job, and telling him about a good location to ambush the former soldier. Mamerto further confessed to have been paid P50,000 by Degracia and Awado, who were his former NPA comrades. Apparently, accused Baylons inducement and command with a promise of reward or monetary consideration facilitated the commission of the crime of murder, Callantas resolution said. The Afdal family, in a press conference in Davao City on Friday, welcomed the decision of the court to keep Baylon, Degracia and Awado in jail as they face trial. It is only fitting for the three accused, especially the mastermind, who has a propensity to evade justice, to be locked in detention while trial is underway, to ensure the speedy resolution of the case, the Afdal family said in a statement. Baylon was arrested on July 1 last year, in Kibawe, Bukidnon, after almost three months of hiding since a warrant was issued against him. He is currently detained at the Quezon City jail, along with Degracia, while Awado is in a jail in Bislig City where he is being tried for another murder case. Mamerto is serving a 10-year sentence at Davao Penal Colony after his conviction on November 15, 2023, for the lesser offense of homicide in a plea bargaining deal with the prosecution. From Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur, the case has been heard in Quezon City since April last year following a Supreme Court order for its transfer, upon the prosecutions request.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2039221/court-orders-continued-detention-of-3-in-slay-of-agusan-mining-exec,others

PNP probing motorbike donations by alleged Chinese spies,"MANILA, Philippines The Philippine National Police had launched a probe into the alleged donation by suspected Chinese spies of motorcycles to the police force. The development was disclosed by PNP Crime Investigation and Detection Group chief Brig. Gen. Nicolas Torre III on Saturday when asked if the national police force follows certain guidelines in accepting donations from non-government organizations and foreign entities. I believe that the chief PNP had already ordered the inquiry on that matter para malaman kung ano ang punot dulo dyan at yung exact circumstances ng donations na yan, Torre said at the Saturday News Forum in Quezon City. Torre also said that the PNP follows guidelines whenever foreign entities donate equipment to the police force. It could have been donated to the local government which the PNP really does not have any control. I dont want to speculate, Torre pointed out. When asked if the PNP found any irregularities in the donated motorcycles, Torre said that the case is still subject to investigation and it is too early to arrive at a conclusion. A Reuters report revealed that Wang Yongyi, Wu Junren, Cai Shaohuang and Chen Haitao made donations to Tarlac City and the police force through Chinese-backed groups in 2022.

Marcos inaugurates Pasig River rehab project phase 3,"MANILA, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday led the inauguration of the third phase of the Pasig River rehabilitation project in Intramuros, Manila.

Our mission is simple, but it is difficult: to bring back the river to its pristine state and make it a vibrant waterway once again for life, for culture, and for mobility, the President said in his speech. I was happy and a little surprised to know that the Esplanade has become an instant hit among our Gen Zs and some Gen Alphas, who use it as a backdrop for IG stories and for TikTok, he added.

Marcos family ex-employee nabbed for estafa,"MANILA, Philippines A former employee of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.s family was arrested by the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group for estafa, the police said on Friday. According to the report, the CIDG implemented an arrest warrant against Simeon Sander Dela Cruz III on Thursday in a Pasay City hotel. In an interview on Friday, CIDG Director Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre said the suspect was a private employee of the Marcoses but was let go. Torre did not say when the suspect stopped working for the First Family. However, despite no longer working for the Marcoses, the suspect was allegedly using his affiliation with the First Family to convince victims that he could facilitate government contracts for a 3- to 5-percent commission, according to the CIDG. Torre said the suspect was supposedly introducing himself as an undersecretary and using his photos at official functions the President attended to back up his narrative. The CIDG chief alleged that the suspect had been engaged in the scheme over the past year. When we arrested him last night, he was wearing a respectable barong. He was wearing a pia barong at a five-star hotel, Torre said in an interview in Camp Crame on Friday. He was doing things that were misrepresentations that definitely wont be tolerated by the principals he was using, which was the First Family, he added.

SC rules media accreditation guidelines must not infringe free speech,"MANILA, Philippines Freedoms of speech, expression and of the press should not be suppressed by guidelines and procedures for media accreditation, the Supreme Court said. The SCs reminder is contained in a decision dismissing as moot and academic the petition for prohibition with prayer for the issuance of temporary restraining order filed by the Customs Tri-Media Association Inc., and several journalists covering the Bureau of Customs . READ: Tri-comm probe on fake news online not meant to gag free speech Barbers In recognition of all these, this Court has not wavered in its duty to uphold these cherished freedoms by striking down laws or regulations, which while guise as promoting a legitimate government interest, are in reality nothing but naked means to suppress the exercise of free speech, expression, and of the press, the SC said through Associate Justice Jhosep Lopez. It added that any limitation on the exercise of free speech must be justified on legitimate grounds that are clear and indubitable and with means that are narrowly tailored and only specifically calibrated to achieve those purposes. Thus, no matter how laudable the objective of respondent in weeding out illegitimate media personalities, the means used to achieve such an objective must not unnecessarily sweep on the rights of legitimate media personalities. The furtherance of a substantial governmental interest must not amount to an infringement of the freedom of expression. Otherwise, any rule or regulation that encroaches on this area of protected speech will be stricken down, the SC said. The petition assailed Custom Memorandum Order No. 37-2011 issued by then Bureau of Customs Commissioner RozzAno Rufino Biazon requiring media practitioners to submit accreditation requirements to the Office of the Public Information and Assistance Division of the BOC who would screen and issue the identification card. Columnists can enter the BOC premises as long as they can present clear documentation that they were on assignment from a specific news organization or publication. The memorandum also provides, among others, that: the editorial content of the publication must at all times be compliant with the Philippine Journalists Code of Ethics; the No I.D., No Entry shall be strictly enforced; and media interview with the BOC officials and employees must be pre-arranged with the PIAD to avoid work disruption. Petitioners argued that the BOC converted into law the Philippine Journalists Code of Ethics, which is only a private undertaking agreed upon by journalists. They added that requiring members of the press to prearrange the conduct of interviews and to obtain visitation passes before they could enter the BOC, would enable the BOC to receive advance information as to who will be interviewed, allowing its errant employees to avoid the discovery of illicit activities. The case is already moot and academic after the BOC repealed the questioned memorandum. With the repeal of Custom Memorandum Order No. 37-2011, the SC said there is nothing left for this Court to declare as unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Senior Associate Justice Marvic Leonen dissented with the majority of the justices as he insistedthat the Court should have ruled on the merit of the petition despite the repeal of Customs Memorandum Order No. 37-201 to guide the Bench and the Bar, and to avoid its repetition in the near future. Leonen said a memorandum can be considered as a form of prior restraint as it infringes on the right of members of the media to free speech and free press. Information gathering is necessary to journalistic work. When the State hampers this task, it harms the role of the press in a democracy. Any regulation that goes into the content of the press, as in this case, only stifles the exercise of free expression, speech, and of the press, the justice explained.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2038846/sc-rules-media-accreditation-guidelines-must-not-infringe-free-speech,others

Security for Mindanao bets must come from same Army unit Lacson,"MANILA, Philippines Candidates in hotly-contested areas in Mindanao must be given security coming from the same Philippine Army unit to prevent election-related violence, former senator Panfilo Ping Lacson said on Thursday. In a statement, Lacson a former Philippine National Police chief said that having the same personnel from any Armed Forces of the Philippines unit would prevent armed confrontations. The former senator said this after Vice Mayor Mohammad Omar Samama of Datu Piang, Maguindanao del Sur, who is seeking reelection, was shot while he was speaking during a medical mission in Barangay Magaslong last Monday. Beyond the usual reactive investigation of election-related violence in Maguindanao, government may consider replacing all the security escorts of the opposing candidates with AFP personnel belonging to the same army battalion or division in the region, Lacson said in a tweet on X. Having Army personnel belonging to the same unit and under the same field commanders replacing PNP and private armed groups securing both camps will prevent armed confrontations, he added. Samama, son of Datu Piang Mayor Victor Samama, was brought to an undisclosed hospital in Maguindanao del Sur. Police are looking at politics as the possible motive, as the elections are just three months away. Both Samamas are running under the United Bangsamoro Justice Party, the political party of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. But aside from this attempt on Samamas life, two more shooting incidents were recorded in Mindanao in Cotabato City on Tuesday and in Lanao del Sur on Wednesday. On Wednesday morning, Abdulazis Aloyodan, 60, former mayor of Lumbaca-Unayan in Lanao del Sur, was killed by unidentified gunmen who emerged from a pickup truck. Aloyodans relatives, particularly Lumbaca-Unayan Mayor Jamalia Aloyodan, said the former mayor had no known enemies and had already retired from politics. Meanwhile, an engineering faculty member of Notre Dame University was killed in Barangay Rosary Heights 3 in Cotabato City. Footage from a closed circuit television camera showed that a gunman, aboard a motorcycle from the opposite lane, shot Angas several times along the busy Notre Dame Avenue. But Lacson said that he has actually received information that at least six more candidates for municipal council posts, along with their supporters, were killed in politically-motivated incidents in Maguindanao. The Commission on Elections has already acknowledged that there is an increasing trend of election-related violence in Cotabato City and Maguindanao del Sur two areas under the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2038858/security-for-mindanao-poll-bets-race-must-come-from-same-army-unit,others
"Cheap rice sold to elderlies, PWDs, poor in Tacloban City","TACLOBAN CITY The government helped sell 1,500 bags of cheap rice to senior citizens, persons with disabilities , and beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program during the two-day Kadiwa ng Pangulo that ended here on Friday, Feb. 28. The rice was sold atP29 per kilogram in Plaza Rizal. This is in compliance with the mandate of the President to sell rice at P29 per kilogram. But this is for the so-called vulnerable sector only, said Romelo Anade, city agriculture officer. According to Anade, senior citizens, PWDs, and 4Ps beneficiaries only needed to present their identification cards for them to buy at least 10 kilograms of cheap rice. Those who do not belong to the identified vulnerable sectors can still buy rice at the Kadiwa though at P45 per kilogram, he added. For the rice sold at P45 per kilogram, about 2,500 sacks were available during the Kadiwa ng Pangulo. Lowering the price of rice is one of the campaign promises of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. All the rice sold at the Kadiwa was sourced from local farmers, and seven farmers groups joined the activity, according to Anade. We are also helping our local farmers in this activity, he added. Anade also said they envisioned a place where not only rice would be sold at lower prices but also vegetables and fish. Eddie Misay, a PWD, said he was happy that basic commodities, particularly rice, were sold at a lower price during the Kadiwa ng Pangulo. We cant almost afford the prices of our basic commodities.

"DOH reports 1,046 diarrhea cases in Eastern Visayas","TACLOBAN CITY The Department of Health has reported 1,046 cases of acute watery diarrhea in Eastern Visayas from Jan. 1 to mid-February this year. The situation is largely due to prolonged rainy days. The number of cases is still lower compared to a year ago. DOH Eastern Visayas regional information officer Jelyn Lopez-Malibago gave the information in a phone interview on Thursday, She also said the count in the first six weeks of the year is lower by 24 percent compared to the 1,376 cases logged in the same period in 2024. Eastern Samar province recorded the highest number of patients at 304, followed by Samar, 224; Biliran, 216; Leyte, 114; Northern Samar, 106; Tacloban City, 62; and Ormoc City, 20. Despite clusters of cases in 41 villages across the region, no outbreak has been declared, Malibago told the Philippine News Agency. DOH defines an outbreak based on a significant rise in cases over the past five years, local government capacity, and recommendations from health authorities, she noted. The decline in acute watery diarrhea cases early this year is attributed to preventive measures such as awareness campaigns, advisories during flooding, and the distribution of water testing kits, she added. The DOH funded the acquisition of 99 water testing kits to local governments last year, significantly increasing the number of kits available in towns and cities. Previously, water testing kits were provided by the World Health Organization , according to Rez Dacoco, DOH regional coordinator for food and waterborne diseases. Dacoco said diarrhealoose, watery, and possibly more frequent passage of stoolis a common problem during rainy days as runoff contaminates water sources, especially in open sources. Meanwhile, Dacoco reported that suspected cholera cases in the region significantly dropped by 79 percent, from 564 cases last year to 118 cases this year. Southern Leyte recorded the highest number, with 90 cases concentrated in the towns of Padre Burgos, Macrohon, and Maasin City. The situation is largely attributed to damaged water sources caused by Typhoon Odette in 2021. DOH continues to monitor waterborne diseases and urges local government units to prioritize water safety. Even purified water from refilling stations isnt guaranteed safe unless tested, Dacoco added. Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms will manifest between 12 hours and five days after ingesting contaminated food or water. Among its symptoms are acute diarrhea, vomiting, and rapid dehydration. The illness affects children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated, according to the WHO. Aside from cholera, contaminated water can also cause acute gastroenteritis, typhoid fever, hepatitis A, dysentery, and amoebiasis, the DOH said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2038983/doh-reports-1046-diarrhea-cases-in-eastern-visayas,others

More bridge collapse incidents likely if execs not held accountable-Lacson,"SAN JOSE DEL MONTE, Bulacan Incidents like the collapse of a bridge in Santa Maria town, Isabela will likely happen again if government officials responsible for such projects are not held accountable, former Sen. Panfilo Lacson said on Friday. In a press conference here with the senatorial candidates of the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas, Lacson said he did not want to preempt investigations on the collapse of the Cabagan-Santa Maria Bridge on Thursday, but he believed that the materials used for the bridge were likely substandard. Ibig sabihin, siguro I dont want to preempt whatever investigation is being conducted or will be conducted pero malamang sa hindi substandard yong materials, he said. This means, maybe I dont want to pre-empt whatever investigation is being conducted or will be conducted but more likely the materials used were substandard.)

Lacson mentioned his advocacy for budget reform, which strives for an equitable allocation of government funds to areas who may need it more. The former senator then mentioned that the collapse of the bridge is an example of funds not being properly allocated or spent. Ang aking pangunahing plataporma hindi lamang sa panahon ng kampanya, kundi lalo kong ginagawa nong akoy nasa Senado na, yong budget reform, kasi hindi kumakalat yong biyaya ng national budget sa mga karatig-lugar ng Metro Manila at lalo na sa malalayo.

The House of Representatives impeached Duterte on February 5 and immediately transmitted the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate for trial. But Escudero noted that the transmittal to the Senate was made just two hours before the Senate ended its session. He has repeatedly explained that the Senate can only convene as an impeachment court when Congress is in session. Other lawmakers, however, argued the Senate could still convene as an impeachment court even during the break, as the Constitution specifically states that the trial shall forthwith proceed.

Escudero disagreed with Pimentel. The court needs to convene in an open session, the Senate leader stressed during last weeks press conference in Quezon City.

House offices assigned to help impeachment prosecutors Velasco,"MANILA, Philippines After the Senate, it is now the House of Representatives turn to prepare for the impeachment proceedings against Vice President Sara Duterte. Different offices in the Batasang Pambansa have been tasked to provide technical and administrative support to the prosecution panel. In a statement on Friday morning, House Secretary General Reginald Velasco confirmed that he has released Memorandum order No. 19-1006, which directs the following offices to perform these duties: Among the functions of the units would be to provide plenary support, legal research, records management, stenographic transcription, information technology, security and administrative coordination. The House Secretariat plays a vital role in ensuring the orderly conduct of legislative proceedings, including impeachment trials, Velasco said. This directive ensures that the prosecution team has access to essential logistical, research and documentation support to facilitate a smooth and efficient trial process, he noted. According to the memorandum, personnel from these offices are required to report to the Senate full-time during the impeachment trial, while attendance would be monitored through the HousePass system. Velasco noted that the assigned personnel will adhere to strict House rules and ethical guidelines, ensuring transparency and professionalism throughout the process. This is a routine function aligned with our constitutional duty. The House Secretariat remains neutral and professional in fulfilling its mandate, he said. As the impeachment process moves forward, the Impeachment Secretariat will continue to provide the necessary support to uphold the integrity of the proceedings, he added. The formation of the House secretariat comes after Senate President Francis Escudero last Wednesday outlined the duty of different Senate offices and officials once the impeachment trial starts. READ: Escudero readies administrative support to Senate for VPs impeachment Prosecutor and Ako Bicol Party-list Rep.

READ: Senate can wrap up Sara Duterte impeachment trial in 3 months Escudero Duterte was impeached by the House last February 5 after 215 lawmakers filed and verified a fourth impeachment complaint. The case was hinged on several issues like alleged misuse of confidential funds lodged within her offices, threats to ranking officials including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and conduct unbecoming of a vice president. The Articles of Impeachment were immediately transmitted to the Senate. The 1987 Constitution requires a trial to start forthwith if at least one-thirds of all House members in this case, 102 out of 306 have signed and endorsed the petition. READ: House impeaches VP Sara Duterte, fast-tracking transmittal to Senate However, trial has yet to start as the Articles of Impeachment were not forwarded to the Senate plenary before session ended on February 5. This means that Congress would have to reconvene first after the election season, or through a special session to discuss the matter. There are also conflicting opinions regarding whether it is proper for the current Senate to start the trial when the 2025 midterms elections would surely change the composition in the legislative chamber. Former Senator Ping Lacson believes though there is no issue if the impeachment trial starts within the 19th Congress and crosses over to the 20th Congress. This is based on the same principle used by the judiciary where jurisdiction of a court division does not change despite the resignation or retirement of a sitting justice.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2039015/house-offices-assigned-to-help-impeachment-prosecutors-velasco,others
