Grant Shapps hires ferry fleet to transport people back to offices,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/28/grant-shapps-hires-ferry-fleet-to-transport-people-back-to-offices/,2020,"Transport secretary Grant Shapps is so convinced that going back to work in offices is safe, that he has hired a fleet of ferries to transport people into city centres.
The UK Transport Secretary has made a deal worth £185 million with one of his ex-public school mates who has no ships and has never transported anyone anywhere. “Going back to offices is very, very safe…”, said Shapps, adding “… and I’m so determined to get people back to work that I’ve even arranged for a fleet of ferries to take them into the office.”
Mr Shapps said he was unaware of the fact that the vast majority of office spaces in the UK were nowhere near docks large enough to take the ships, and that the vast majority of office workers would not be able to get onto a ferry anywhere close to where they live. “These are minor details that I’m sure can be ironed out as soon as my mate banks the cash”, he burbled happily.
When the Rochdale Herald reporter asked how he would be able to get into the landlocked newspaper office from his landlocked suburban home by ferry, Mr Shapps replied, “…easy peasy. There are ferries at the bottom of your garden.”"
"Move classrooms into pubs, says government",https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/06/move-classrooms-into-pubs-says-government/,2020,"After Ministers were forced to make a choice between opening schools in September or keeping pubs open, the government has decided to move classes into pubs.
This will have the advantage of adding parental supervision alongside teachers as they can all sit in the pub together and keep both schools and pubs open. “We have seen an opportunity to consolidate knowledge of the ‘three Rs’, reeling, rioting and retching…” said a ministerial drinks-person, “…while at the same time supporting the hospitality industry and increasing the amount of time children spend with quality role-models.”
Children would be taught to consume large quantities of alcohol, not to bother with social distancing and be given ’50 metre staggering certificates’ if they manage to walk that distance after 5 pints of strong lager.
‘A Levels’ will henceforth be known as ‘Alcohol Levels’ and will be examined by a breathalyser. A fail will mean a pass, and vice-versa."
Michael Gove “more slippery than Teflon”,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/12/michael-gove-more-slippery-than-teflon/,2020,"Independent research at the Technical University of Rochdale has found that Michael Gove is more slippery than Teflon – and that a patent has been applied for which could revolutionise the development of a new generation of non-stick pans.
Rather than go to the expense and difficulty of sticking a non-stick coating to the inside of the pan, researchers have found that simply printing an image of Michael Gove onto the surface of the pan is even more effective. “Nothing sticks to it. He’s such a slimy two-faced weasel that getting him to adhere to basic human dignity is impossible, let alone such abstract concepts as truth and loyalty…” said Emeritus Professor Pritt-Stick, head of the department of adhesive research, adding “…he could fall face forward into a cess-pool and emerge whiter than white – although more work needs to be carried out on removing the smell.”
The Technical University of Rochdale Institute will benefit from the money raised from the patent, and invest the proceeds into research into turd polishing, something previously thought to be impossible, but now deemed to be feasible given the impact of the Gove research.
Further research is now also being carried out by Rochdale University’s Department of Applied Linguistics, who will attempt to answer the question, “…who put the Gove into Government?”
Once the answer is found, there may be consequences."
Future election results to be based on pandemic exam model,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/14/future-election-results-to-be-based-on-pandemic-exam-model/,2020,"Following the overwhelming success of the Department of Education’s strategy of grading academic exam results based on teachers’ predicted grades and previous attainment levels, the government has announced a plan to determine General Election results using a similar model, the Rochdale Herald has learned.
“Staging a General Election every 5 years takes a great deal of organisation and costs an enormous amount of money…”, said a votes-person from the Electoral Commission, adding “…we could save time, energy and money by using the same tactics that we used to grade A levels due to the pandemic – a mixture of predicted results and past performance.”
Under the new system adults of voting age will not have to put a cross on a piece of paper, attend polling stations, or even register to vote. Instead an aggregate of all newspaper opinion polls will be used to predict the results which will then be moderated by the Electoral Commission, taking into account the previous performance of each political party.
Voters who are unhappy with the result of their ‘predicted’ vote may challenge the poll result by writing a strong letter of protest to their local newspaper, which will then be considered for publication.
Concerns about the fairness of this system and the fact that the majority of opinion polls are run by newspapers that may have an agenda favouring a single political party, are unfounded, says the Commission. “We have carefully listened to the opinions of all opposition and minority party politicians and gently, yet firmly, filed all the objections in a large waste-paper bin, marked for recycling…” said the votes-person.
Even more money will be saved, as removal vans will not have to appear outside Downing Street in the foreseeable future."
Matt Hancock adds Straw Clutching to his cv as “transferable skill”,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/07/17/matt-hancock-adds-straw-clutching-to-his-cv-as-transferable-skill/,2020,"Hot on the heels of Boris Johnson’s success in the Stable Door Shutting championships, the Health Secratary, Matt Hancock has added Straw Clutching to his own cv as a transferable skill a source at No. 10 has told The Rochdale Herald.
Mr Hancock today called for an investigation into the way deaths related to the coronavirus outbreak in England have been recorded. His concern being that the numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 has been exaggerated by Public Health England (PHE).
One leading expert told The Rochdale Herald that the overall number of deaths could have been exaggerated by as much as 1000 bringing the actual figure right down from 45,000 to a “world beating” 44,000 deaths so far in the UK.
Dr Tone Loc, a bolognologist from The University of Life in Newton Mearns, told The Rochdale Herald that the method of collecting data provided by PHE so far was “a quick and easy method. Oven ready if you will.”
Prof. Gustav Spiegelimbadezimmer, professor of currant affairs at the Bath bun institute, explained that “As we go into winter, it will be incredibly confusing and concerning if we have an increase in deaths as we are trying to work out who we need to buy Christmas presents for.”
“If we go by the government’s figures, Granny and Grandpa are still on the list. If we go by PHE’s figures, well, we might just save ourselves the price of a bottle of sherry and a pair of socks.”
Mr Hancock, who recently clutched a particularly weighty straw when he appeared to try to move the original date on which lock down started forward retrospectively only to be foiled by the tv news coverage, newspaper articles and collective memories of millions of people, is said to be extremely pleased with himself.
Which must be lovely for him as everyone else thinks he’s a massive bellend."
Cummings replaced by Orwell in No.10 reshuffle,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/07/19/cummings-replaced-by-orwell-in-no-10-reshuffle/,2020,"Downing Street today confirmed that Dominic Cummings has been sacked and replaced by George Orwell as the government’s chief political advisor – effective immediately, The Rochdale Herald has learned.
A new-speakesperson from the newly formed Ministry of Truth said, “…all government policy has been extensively borrowed from fiction and we realised we no longer needed anyone making it all up on the fly. We realised that the overwhelming majority of Cummings’s ideas were directly borrowed from a political bible written by Orwell in 1948.”
Major government initiates will now include:
The government has not ruled out borrowing from other fictional works in the near future. Ideas include the renaming of major political parties – The Conservative Party will become Griffindor, the Liberal Democrats Hufflepuff, the SNP Ravenclaw and The Labour Party will be known as Slytherin – with an added caveat that former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will be known as ‘Corbymort’ or ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’ and held up as a bogeyman to terrify children of school age.
Public schools and Oxbridge Universities will now hold the title of ‘Institutions for Special Educational Needs’ as it is recognised that rich and privileged people need to be ‘specially educated’ in order to rule the rest of us. Normal schools will become ‘Super Academies’ with head-teachers being replaced by ‘Deans’ and ordinary teachers becoming ‘Professors’. All children will wear gowns.
The Russia Report will be re-named ‘The Eurasia Report’. The Rochdale Herald will keep you informed as to who we are at war with as soon as it is released."
