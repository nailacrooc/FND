Bears cleared of ‘shitting in the woods’ says watchdog,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2021/03/31/bears-cleared-of-shitting-in-the-woods-says-panel/,2021,"The independent Bear Complaints Commission has found that there is no evidence that bears are guilty of shitting in the woods.
The misconduct watchdog, made up exclusively of bears, has been investigating allegations that bears have been excreting in forested areas for a number of years. Complaints from members of the public about the smell and sticky texture of bear droppings have been flooding in for the last few decades.
Bruno the bear, chairbear of the commission, stated: “Bears have a very difficult job to do in areas with a lot of arboreal growth. There is a common public misconception, exacerbated by Hollywood films such as ‘The Jungle Book’, that the bare necessities of life are easily available to bruins at large. Nothing could be further from the truth. While bears may face real challenges with continence in rural areas they are dedicated to the highest standards of beardom.”
Bruno added that bear behaviour in woods has been exemplary and that bear training is of such a high standard that bears would “…never be caught shitting in the woods…” and added, gruffly, “…if you go down to the woods today, you’ll never believe your eyes. In fact, if you go down to the woods today, you’re in for a big surprise!”
Claims that the misconduct group is biased as it is made up entirely by bears are ‘unfounded, wild and baseless allegations’ says the watchdog."
Priti Patel congratulates Boris Johnson on arrival of 3001005789th baby boy,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/29/priti-patel-congratulates-boris-johnson-on-arrival-of-3001005789th-baby-boy/,2020,"Priti Patel, Minister for whatever the heck it is she does has been one of the first Government Ministers to congratulate Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds on the birth of their son.
Ms Patel, who could barely conceal her happiness as she grinned through her statement said, “I’d just like to congratulate Boris on the arrival of his 3001005789th child. It’s a very happy occasion. I hope he’s a very masculine child and am looking forward to meeting him at my next candlelit supper.”
A spokesman for Boris Johnson told us, “We’ve no idea where Boris is. On hearing Priti congratulate him on his 3001005789th child the colour drains from his face. He looked like one of those ancient Greek blokes who’ve just finished the pudding course and told the executioner to bring on the Hemlock. He was last seen heading to Iceland. Not the country mind, the frozen food supermarket.”
Elsewhere, it’s not just Boris Johnson that is celebrating a birth. There were unconfirmed rumours that Kim Jong Un was delivered of a baby boy over the weekend. A rumour denied by North Korean officials who said he’d just had a larger than normal dump. There have been rumours about the North Korean leader for 2 weeks with some speculating he’s locked himself away as he grows out a poorly executed lock down haircut.

Cats growing increasingly desperate to find cure for Coronavirus,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/23/cats-growing-increasingly-desperate-to-find-cure-for-coronavirus/,2020,"Pet cats have announced that they’re ramping up their efforts to find a cure for Coronavirus as many find they’re now forced to spend entire days with their humans.
Cat, Bill Board told us, “It’s been hell this week and it’s only Monday. I got up this morning looking forward to another 11 hours sprawled out in front of the radiator and they just wouldn’t leave. I figured it would be temporary but I’ve spoken to Jeff down the street and he’s finding the same thing. His humans have been in every day for the last week. Even bringing a stunned but still breathing rat and leaving it in the kitchen didn’t work.”
Stan Still, a Tabby told us, “How am I supposed to take a dump in someone’s shoes now? They’re always here; I wish they’d get lost. They’re interfering with my valuable staring at the wall time. It’s got to stop so I’ve been learning advanced physics this week and I’m booked on a glass working course next week so I can build my own mricroscope.”
Orla Board, a Manx cat told us, “Anyone would think they owned the place the way they’ve been going on. She just sits around all day on the computer occasionally working and I’m sure I caught him masturbating to Japanese porn 5 times this morning. I’ve tried walking on the computer key board that normally gets them to go away to a different room. But no such luck. They even spent Sunday moving the furniture around. I’d finally scratched the perfect groove into that settee.”
New emergency measures announced today have meant cats will only be entitled to 19hours sleep a day as the crisis deepens."
