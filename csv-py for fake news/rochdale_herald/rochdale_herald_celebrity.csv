Boris Johnson praises BBC for spending £250m on non-existent PPE for the Proms,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/25/boris-johnson-praises-bbc-for-spending-250m-on-non-existent-ppe-for-the-proms/,2020,"Boris Johnson has said that Britain shouldn’t be ashamed about the BBC’s decision to spend £250m on non-existent PPE for the Last Night of the Proms.
Mr Johnson said, “We should be proud that the BBC bought a load of non-existent PPE from a company that sells second hand dolls because the Director General is mates with the companies owner. It was the sort of decision that I can applaud as it stops people talking about that exam thingy the other week. Anyway, I’ve heard the BBC intends to replace Songs of Praise with Gary Linekers’ guide to mosques.”
A spokesman told us, “This whole row has been excellent for the Government. It’s stopped everyone talking about how utterly inept and corrupt we are. I mean, we tried threatening people with being invaded by brown folks from France. That normally works but the exams thing just wouldn’t go away. This Proms thing has really helped as it totally takes attention from us.”
Mr Johnson later told us, “Whiff-whaff, Latin, brrrth, whaff-whiff, fight them on the beaches.”"
Greta Thunberg releases Scandinavian Death Metal album.,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/01/22/greta-thunberg-releases-scandinavian-death-metal-album/,2020,"The music world has been surprised by the release of an album by Greta Thunberg and the Prophets of Doom, a new death metal outfit formed by the ecological campaigner.
It is seen as the biggest image change since Charlotte Church started performing mannered anthemic rock in a basque and knickers.
Called ‘Scorched Earth and Extinction’ the album is only available electronically as records have petroleum in them and CDs are, like, plastic, you know. Chart analysts predict the release will top the album chart outselling ‘Fuck Me, Are They Still Going’ by The Courteeners. Among the tracks are ‘Eat Shit You Carnivore Monsters’ and the lead single ‘Spit On Trump (On A Spit).
The latter sees the cherub faced eco-pixie screaming the lyrics, “Donald ain’t no good to me / spear him on rotisserie. Piss on him like lemonade/ baste him in saliva marinade.” All profits will go towards shitloads of cocaine."
Thousands gather in London to watch fireworks through their phones,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/01/01/thousands-gather-in-london-to-watch-fireworks-through-their-phones/,2020,"Scores of New Year’s Eve partygoers descended on London last night to watch the spectacular fireworks display through their smartphones.
Over a hundred thousand people stood next to each other with their devices held aloft to celebrate the coming of a new decade.
“It’s much more important to record the event and upload it to Facebook than actually live in the present moment and enjoy the occasion,” screamed one reveller.
“Why stay at home with loved-ones and watch the pyrotechnics in HD on a massive screen when I could punch my way through rabid drunks, blow out my ear drums and view the whole thing on a tiny screen held up in front of my stupid glowing face?
“I don’t need to experience anything directly with my own five senses anymore. Once-in-a-lifetime music concerts, weddings, my son’s birth, cycling holidays – I’ve only ever seen them through my phone.
“I might as well be a bodiless brain suspended in jelly plugged into a virtual reality machine reporting events on social media that never actually took place.
“Although that would be a rather pointless waste of a life,” she conceded."
Prince Harry gets job as Prince Harry look-alike,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/01/20/prince-harry-gets-job-as-prince-harry-look-alike/,2020,"Prince Harry has a new job as a Prince Harry look-alike in Canada.
His new boss told us, “There’s a lot of attention on Prince Harry at the moment. With that attention then demand for a Prince Harry look-alike increases. We’d had several applications but nobody that looked right. Then Prince Harry turned up and he was perfect. He can do the voice and everything. We’re sure he’ll be a success.”
A spokesman for Prince Harry told us, “Who says a lifetime of cutting ribbons isn’t useful? Prince Harry has only been looking for work a week and got a job already. This should serve as an example to people out there. Don’t lose faith because if all else fails you can become a look-alike of yourself.”
It’s rumoured that Prince Harry’s first engagement will be as a replacement for Prince Andrew at a Royal Family photo call. One insider said, “He’s perfect for it. He knows all the script and everything”
The spokesman has refused to comment on allegations that Prince Harry will play Prince Harry in The Crown. “It could get confusing when he plays the part of Prince Harry impersonating Prince Harry as Prince Harry in The Crown. It might just be easier to get Ed Sheeran to do it.”"
Boris Johnson evades detection to win 2020 season of Hunted,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/20/boris-johnson-evades-detection-to-win-2020-season-of-hunted/,2020,"Using an impressive combination of stealth, sneakiness and bare-faced cheek, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has trounced both his opponents and his pursuers to claim victory in the 2020 season of Channel 4’s hit reality series
Celebrity Hunted
.
The show in which contestants go on the run for a month and attempt to evade capture by ex-police, intelligence officers and chase teams in blacked-out 4×4’s has gripped viewers since 2015. Despite having access to the fugitives’ personal data, ANPR. CCTV and other powers of state, the hunters led by the Investigative Journalist and ex-detective Mark Wiliiams-Thomas, couldn’t even get close to the elusive Johnson.
“It was astonishing!” said Williams-Thomas, “We had trackers on his bank cards, mobile phone and Twitter account. We even had drones over Chequers. I’ve never encountered such a devious bastard in my life!”
“We though Johnny Mercer was brazen when he sneaked in and out of Parliament to vote, but we’d expect such things from a trained soldier. Mercer can’t hold a candle to Johnson though. We staked out five COBRA meetings following information that the PM generally attends these during national emergencies, but it appears he was tipped off and didn’t show. He was thumbing his nose at us live on the BBC one morning. Our snatch squad was there within minutes and thought they had him surrounded only to watch him vanish into a fridge. They checked the fridge and he had gone, fuck knows where. Probably Narnia or Diagon Alley or somewhere equally magical.”
Johnson’s crowning moment was undoubtedly when he checked into St Thomas’s Hospital in London. Amid blanket media coverage he managed to vanish in plain sight for three whole days while the hunters posted teams on every exit. “We had to step back that time.” admitted Williams-Thomas. “We knew exactly where he was, but obviously we couldn’t just run in and grab him. The NHS staff were stressed enough as it was without us barging in and causing a scene. Turns out he was playing possum and we fell for it. Genius!”
After that, the trail went cold. Johnson’s Twitter account fell silent and he simply disappeared without trace with his pregnant partner. It is unclear whether he made it to the extraction point, but as nobody seems to know where that is, it’s safe to assume he did.
“We give up.” sighed the exasperated Williams-Thomas. “We’re really fed up with chasing shadows and have to concede that the best man won. We probably won’t do another series as frankly, this was an embarrassment. Wanker!”"
Nigel Farage leaves LBC for remake of Howards’ Way; Nigels’ Way,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/06/11/nigel-farage-leaves-lbc-for-remake-of-howards-way-nigels-way/,2020,"Nigel Farage has left LBC and got a job on a new remake of Howards’ Way called, Nigels’ Way.
Producer Bill Board told us, “Nigel plays Nigel, a man who has experienced 2 redundancies in 6 months. He leaves London and settles in a seaside town on the south coast of England.”
“Nigel is struggling at the beginning. His kids increasingly hold him in contempt. His wife initially hates her new life and wants to move back to London. This leads to the breakdown of their marriage. We see Nigel hit his lowest ebb with him attempting to give a speech to some empty chairs in his living room.”
“But then things change. Nigel meets some alcoholic xenophobes that happen to be members of the local yachting club. Nigel becomes involved and gradually regains his sense of purpose. He begins campaigning for the ships at the local Navy base to be allowed to sink small boats carrying refugees that he encounters whilst out on his yacht.”
“When this fails he forms a band of brothers with other members of the yachting club. Nigel leads them into the English Channel to do battle with the refugee boats. But they quickly learn they don’t have enough skill. But this isn’t about skill at harassing refugees. It’s about a man finding purpose and camaraderie in his life again through xenophobia.”
Howards’ End originally aired between 1985 and 1990. It told the story of a bunch of people that were members of a Yachting Club near Southampton. It was crap."
