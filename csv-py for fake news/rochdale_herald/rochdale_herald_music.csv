“One walk a day more than enough” say The Proclaimers,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/24/one-walk-a-day-more-than-enough-say-the-proclaimers/,2020,"Following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s announcement that the UK is now in a state of national emergency and that citizens are only permitted to leave their homes to exercise once a day, Scottish pop duo The Proclaimers have said “That’s plenty!”
“When I wake up, well I know I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be the man who’s staying at least six feet away from you at all times,” said singer songwriter Charlie Reed.
“When I go out, well you know I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be the one who’s socially distancing myself from you,” said twin brother Craig Reed.
The brothers told The Rochdale Herald that they intend to take a daily walk of 500 miles, 500 more if the sun shines on Leith, just to be the men who walked 1000 miles to fall down on the sofa and watch Homes Under The Hammer."
Greta Thunberg releases Scandinavian Death Metal album.,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/01/22/greta-thunberg-releases-scandinavian-death-metal-album/,2020,"The music world has been surprised by the release of an album by Greta Thunberg and the Prophets of Doom, a new death metal outfit formed by the ecological campaigner.
It is seen as the biggest image change since Charlotte Church started performing mannered anthemic rock in a basque and knickers.
Called ‘Scorched Earth and Extinction’ the album is only available electronically as records have petroleum in them and CDs are, like, plastic, you know. Chart analysts predict the release will top the album chart outselling ‘Fuck Me, Are They Still Going’ by The Courteeners. Among the tracks are ‘Eat Shit You Carnivore Monsters’ and the lead single ‘Spit On Trump (On A Spit).
The latter sees the cherub faced eco-pixie screaming the lyrics, “Donald ain’t no good to me / spear him on rotisserie. Piss on him like lemonade/ baste him in saliva marinade.” All profits will go towards shitloads of cocaine."
