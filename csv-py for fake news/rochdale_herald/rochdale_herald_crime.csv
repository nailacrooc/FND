Turn your house into a Costa and other tips for hosting gatherings of more than 6 people,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/09/09/turn-your-house-into-a-costa-and-other-tips-for-hosting-gatherings-of-more-than-6-people/,2020,"The Government have announced that gatherings of more than 6 people are to be banned. But what do you do if your “Company AGM” is raided by the fuzz? Here’s our top tips if you find yourself confronted by the local constabulary.
1) Everyone is working from home now so tell the police that it isn’t a social gathering but an AGM and these people are your shareholders. They’ll have to let you go as you’re contributing to the economy that pays their wages.
2) Turn your house into a Pret a Manger or Costa. The Government are really worried that these companies might go the way of Gaz lamp lighters. So if the fuzz do turn up just say you’re running a coffee shop and sell them a £12 sandwich.
3) If you can’t be bothered with the above just get a chip and pin machine. These confer immunity to all viruses as evidenced by Government policy.
4) Turn your house into a school. The fuzz can’t even tell you that you can’t be a school as everyone has 6 months experience of teaching now. In addition, get your kids to start rioting and tell the fuzz you’re demonstrating the second law of thermodynamics.
5) Tell the police it’s not a social gathering at all and you’re all going for a drive to test your eyesight out. Barnard Castle is nice this time of year.
6) Sod all of the above as you’re just breaking the law in a very small and defined way. This is now Government policy and carries the added bonus that the police can’t also question you about your garden furniture you bought from a bloke in a pub, the white powder on the table or the remains of that person you have under your patio."
Head of the Mafia innocent of being in Mafia says jury of Mafia members,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/02/06/head-of-the-mafia-innocent-of-being-in-mafia-says-jury-of-mafia-members/,2020,"The head of the Mafia, 4 Tony’s Tony is definitely not part of the Mafia after a jury made up of members of the Mafia found him innocent yesterday.
4 Tony’s lawyer told us, “My client wishes to put all these allegations behind him. He has had a  traumatic few years from the time his uncle sustained all those machine gun wounds whilst mowing his lawn to when his 4 closest friends died in that freak hedge trimming accident.
The fact is that what people are calling the Mafia is nothing more than a social club for old people. They go on trips to DIY stores because they like DIY. As was established in court, that video of him strangling another member of the Mafia was actually footage of him demonstrating mouth to mouth resuscitation. The jury found him not guilty so you should drop the charges.”
4 Tony’s lawyer refused to comment on the recent charges of corruption that have been filed against him. He did however pay tribute to the only witness in that case, Freddie no eyes. “Freddie was such a good employee who was mowing his lawn when he sustained all those gunshot wounds. We are looking into taking Flymo to court once I have been found innocent of all charges next week.”
Jury member, No nose Noel told us, “People will say that a jury made up of members of the mafia isn’t going to be impartial when it comes to trying the leader of the Mafia. Well, we looked at the evidence and aquited based on that evidence. It was clear to me that 4 Tony’s would release my family if I found him innocent. That’s what the evidence said so I moved to acquit.”
It’s understood that 4 Tony’s will now carry on managing his extremely lucrative florist business."
Criminals allowed to break law in ‘specific and limited way’,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/09/09/criminals-allowed-to-break-law-in-specific-and-limited-way/,2020,"The Home Office has confirmed that British criminals will now be allowed to commit crimes in a ‘specific and limited way’ following the government’s recent abandonment of the rule of international law.
As long as crimes conform to a new ‘specific and limited’ template, police will now be forced to allow them to take place. A Home Office crimes-person explained: “Breaking down criminal activity into specific and limited acts of criminality will mean a lot less work for our already overstretched police force. Smash and grab raids, for example, can be limited to one person smashing and another person grabbing – and that, specifically, will no longer be an arrestable offence.”
Other criminal activities such as mugging, assault, GBH and vandalism will not be prosecuted if the activity is shared by more than one thug, with each villain limiting their participation to a single specific felony – as long as gangs do not operate in groups of more than six and maintain social distancing throughout.
“Many criminals already wear gloves and masks and are models of the kind of behaviour which will help maintain safety among the criminal fraternity, their victims and society at large…”, said the crimes-person, adding “…we could all learn a lot about minimising Covid-19 transmission from the criminal community.”"
