20 a day smoker worried 5G mast will give him cancer,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/24/20-a-day-smoker-worried-5g-mast-will-give-him-cancer/,2020,"A Bolton man says he fears that 5 aside football pitch flood light is actually a secret 5G mast that will cause him to develop cancer. 38 year old Bill Board told us that he fears the mast is a plan by the Government to kill him with cancer. Bill, who got a U grade in GCSE Science and spent the 2 year course telling teachers that he didn’t understand why he should study science as he was never going to need it when he was joining the Army explained that he likes to do his own research into these things.
Professor Frederick Seddon of Rochdale College told us, “It’s a load of rubbish obviously and all the studies demonstrate that. The problem we have at the moment is that at some point society decided it was cruel to tell the terminally thick that they’re terminally thick. Now equal weight is given to Bill’s opinions as say that of a research team of Physicists and medical doctors looking into the effects of 5G on people. Then, because Bill is terminally stupid he’s incapable of understanding the evidence but nobody can challenge him because he has a right to an opinion no matter how stupid, ignorant and uninformed.”
Professor Seddon went on, “To a large extent the media has a lot to answer for. Whether its newspapers badly reporting about the carcinogenic properties of various molecules to the harmfulness of GMO’s and nuclear power they’ve all had a part in encouraging total idiots into thinking they’re making informed choices.”
“The BBC are just as bad. They take a scientific subject and interview a scientist on it then, for “balance”, they interview somebody that was in Eldorado or Nigel Farage to explain why the scientist doesn’t know what they’re talking about and that in fact they are part of an establishment cover up. Now they’re wondering why people are burning down 5G masts. Perhaps they should add a bit of context by reporting other areas of the news in the same way? For instance, they could take the same approach with Match of the Day. Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer could spend 10 minutes discussing the highlights of Man City v Liverpool then Nigel Lawson could be invited to spend 10 minutes explaining that what they’ve just seen is evidence that football doesn’t exist and that Gary and Alan are in fact part of an elaborate establishment cover up.”
Bill’s friend, Stan Still told us, “Yeah Bill’s pretty stupid. He’ll say stuff like he only smokes when he goes out but since the lockdown he’s still been getting through 20 fags a day and I don’t think there’s been a night he hasn’t sunk 8 pints since it all started. If he gets cancer he’ll blame 5G. He’ll buy any white powder and stick it up his nose. He once spent a week in Ibiza snorting horse laxatives. We only found out because he attempted to sue this bar we always went to because he said they were giving him dodgy pints as he always had the squits the rest of the night after we’d left.”
It’s unclear when society will go back to telling the terminally stupid they’re terminally stupid and ignoring them but there are signs this may be close as Donal Trump has encouraged his supporters to inject bleach to fight Coronavirus."
5G blamed for amnesia as thousands of twats forget to be Islamophobic,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/12/5g-blamed-for-amnesia-as-thousands-of-twats-forget-to-be-islamophobic/,2020,"Amidst growing concern from the internet’s top pseudo-scientists about the risks posed by mobile technology, yet another coal has been added to the fire.
According to the prominent YouTuber Hope L’Scase, long-term exposure to massive doses of gamma radiation from thousands of 5G masts over the past 15 years has had a profound effect on our short-term memory. “Anyone with half a brain can see what they are doing.” L’Scase explained to her eleven followers, “I can.” Her video then continued with 15 minutes of white noise crackle before ending, “It’s all part of the Government’s plan to make us forget what they promised us in the past.”
“The science behind this is dubious at best,” Professor Ray D. Yates of Rochdale Community College told The Herald, “but clearly we need to investigate further. Analysis of a sample of 120,000,000 Tweets, Facebook posts and Daily Mail stories has revealed a 92% drop in the number of Islamophobic comments. This is remarkable by all accounts.” Prof. Yates continued, “There is as yet absolutely no evidence to link 5G with mass amnesia, but we are unable to explain what would cause such a massive shift of focus in the online turdblossom community. As recently as February they were adamant that Muslims were the biggest threat to civilisation as we know it. Them and Jeremy Corbyn.”
“However, in recent weeks we have seen their attention drawn to a very different threat in the form of a deadly virus. Only extensive scientific research will tell us why they now perceive a very real threat to be more serious than a totally imaginary one. Furthermore, they still blame Corbyn.”
It isn’t just social media users who appear to have been affected. Sources have reported that some 300,000 NHS staff have completely forgotten the Hippocratic Oath and are now lining up to punch Matt Hancock in the throat.
It appears that every cloud does indeed have a silver lining."
Chris Witty signs lucrative sponsorship deal with Andrex toilet paper,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/09/21/chris-witty-signs-lucrative-sponsorship-deal-with-andrex-toilet-paper/,2020,"Chris Witty has shocked fans around the world after signing a multi-million pound, multi-decade deal to become the new face of Andrex bog roll.
The 54 year old epidemiologist, Chief Medical Officer and toilet roll salesman has ended his close partnership with Lidl own brand loo roll, quitting the German brand after only 1 year.
“Nothing sells bog roll quite like an epidemiologist with a terrifying message about home isolation and death.” A spokesman for Andrex told The Rochdale Herald.
“He’s got a light touch and is quick on his feet, he’s the perfect spokesman for the brand. He’ll also be advising the government on Friday to lock you in your downstairs loo with your kids until January so obviously he’s the perfect spokesman for Andrex.”
Chris Witty was unavailable for comment because he’s dealing with a public health emergency that doesn’t give you the squits."
Coronavirus maybe more deadly than Iain Duncan Smith warns Government,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/02/10/coronavirus-maybe-more-deadly-than-iain-duncan-smith-warns-government/,2020,"The Government is warning that Coronavirus could be more deadly than Iain Duncan Smith. The warning comes as the number of cases in Britain doubled to 8.
A spokesman said, “When discussing the deadliness of a virus it’s always best to use a comparison people are familiar with. That’s why we want to warn the people that this virus could turn out to be deadlier than Iain Duncan Smith. We hope the public take every precaution and report any symptoms to their nearest health centre.”
The Government has also changed their advice and are recommending British people exercise full racism against Chinese people. A spokesman said, “This virus is spread by sneezing. If you don’t get sneezed on by a Chinese person then you’ll be fine. That’s why we’re recommending people be as racist as possible to Chinese people. Clearly nobody else could get this.”
Elsewhere, the Chinese media has reported that it’s state broadcaster, CTV, has cancelled the new series of The Masked Singer after one contestant nearly caused a riot."
Rochdale man to drink 100 pints to help the N.H.S.,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/20/100-pints/,2020,"Rochdale resident Jim Tossking has announced that he hopes to raise £25m for the N.H.S. by supping 100 pints of bitter.
A regular at Rochdale’s famous Rat and Pudding pub, Jim is known to locals as ‘That tosser’, which h thinks is an affectionate reference to his surname. “Any bugger can walk up and down the bloody garden.” said Jim.  “He made 20 million so I reckon doing 100 pints ought to get at least 25 million.”
“Obviously I’m not going to buy the ale myself so I’m expecting the local N.H.S trust to pony up for the beer. It’s not like they won’t coin it from the sponsor money.” Jim expects to take the ‘Sponsored Sup’ to take seven nights, but others in the Rat and Pudding were unconvinced. “He’s a total jessie” said landlady Rita Brass.
“Yon streak of piss couldn’t sup three in a night without throwing up on his dog.”"
Donald Trump appoints Doogie Howser M.D. Coronavirus Czar,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/02/27/donald-trump-appoints-doogie-howser-m-d-coronavirus-czar/,2020,"POTAUS Donald Trump has announced the creation of a Coronavirus Czar charged with coordinating the US’s response to Coronavirus. He revealed that Doogie Howser M.D. has been appointed.
In a 5 hour rambling announcement POTATUS said, “We have the best people in place to deal with this. I’ve appointed Doogie Howser M.D. to lead our response. I’ve seen him in action and he’s a great doctor. He performed a tracheotomy on someone in a restaurant once and he was only 13. Once he’s finished with Coronavirus he’s going to work on Ivana. It’s Doogie time.”
“People have been criticising our response. Well we’ve now got the best doctor in charge of this thing and, I just came from a prayer meeting with Mike Pence. Mike’s been praying and praying like, millions of times a day. It really is the least we can do.”
Neil Patrick Harris, who starred as Howser told us, “He’s had me locked in this cupboard for 4 days. Please let me out. Send for help. The other day he wanted me to examine his prostate. He also makes me mash cauliflower into his mashed potatoes. I don’t think I’ll last much longer. Coronavirus will be a blessed relief.”
A White House spokesman said, “We attempted to explain the concept of TV to him but he just doesn’t get it. He’s even tried contacting Dusin Hoffman about finding a cure following his work in Africa in the ’90’s. I’ve no idea how to explain that Outbreak wasn’t a documentary.”
We tried contacting Dustin Hoffman for comment but he has so far refused."
Which filthy johnny foreigner should you blame for Covid-19?,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/31/which-filthy-johnny-foreigner-should-you-blame-for-covid-19/,2020,"All over Britain, McDonald’s branches are silent and your gran might die from Covid-19. The PC libtards say this is a result of complex factors interplaying that mean that a novel virus can spread easily. Everyone interested in the truth knows that’s rubbish. It’s foreigners that have caused this and we’re here to guide you through which foreigners to blame. So buckle up leftard avocado knitters because today, we’re dropping some truth bombs and your feelings are going to be the collateral damage.
Meghan Markle
Meghan only married Prince Harry because she thought she would be the King if she did. Before marrying him she turned him into Princess Harry and then had a child with him to trap him into the relationship. Then, when she realised she wasn’t ever going to be King she took Prince Harry to Woke-ada so they could have sex with Woke-ada’s gay President. The thing is, Woke-ada is so boring it doesn’t even have a McDonald’s so they’ve had to move to Los Angeles but Harry will get really sun burnt there. So Meghan needs to come up with a way of becoming King of England and that way is Covid-19. It’s no coincidence that her and Harry were over here visiting just before it happened and she definitely owns a Microsoft laptop. I mean, join the dots people. Bill Gates invented this thing so Meghan could become King. In the meantime, Harry is talking about doing things like helping the disabled instead of leaving them in a forest to be  eaten by wolves like what would happen in Britain.
The EU
And by the EU we mean the French. The French have a history of inventing diseases. In the 15th Century they invaded Italy and invented Syphilis. Before Syphilis STD’s were just things that would make you itch for a couple of days but would go away. But the French invented one that would make you go mad. They did this because they’re rubbish at fighting wars. Instead of having to fight, French prostitutes would be told have sex with the enemy and all the enemies men would die from it allowing the French to invade. Michel Barnier is that prostitute and he’s now given Covid to Boris in order to invade Britain and popularise accordion music and mime artists. Not only that but, everyone knows that the French are sending infected refugees over here in speed boats to infect us.
And if you still don’t believe us. It was a French flight attendant that had sex with the monkey that invented AIDS in the 1970’s and gave it everyone else.
The Chinese
From the Black death to West Nile Virus and German Measles the Chinese have invented every disease ever (Except AIDS and Syphilis). Not only that but everyone knows they like weird food. Ming Garden’s down the road? My mate Gary once got a meal from there and they’d put an entire cat in it. Katsu Curry? There’s cat in that. So they definitely invented it, it even started there after Bill Gates had infected the US Army with it.
Muslim’s
Obviously, blaming the Jews would be a bit Black Death/Spanish Inquisition. Basically, Muslim’s are deliberately infecting themselves with Covid-19 so they can implement Sharia law. What they do is visit people’s grandma’s and get invited into the house. Whilst your Grandma is making them a cup of tea they’re licking her Werther’s Original’s knowing that when she eats them or offers them to your kids. Your kids will eat them, become infected and die. Avoid this by wrapping your gran’s Werther’s Original’s in bacon. This will render any plan to impose Shari Law void.
Diane Abbot
This Woman can’t even put her shoes on properly so a pair of rubber gloves is going to be beyond her. Plus, once everyone is dead from Covid it means she’ll be able to impose socialism on everyone."
IMPORTANT ADVICE TO STOP SPREAD OF VIRUS,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/05/important-advice-to-halt-spread-of-virus/,2020,"The Rochdale Herald would like to pass on advice regarding the nasty viral infection which has reared its ugly head in the UK recently.

UK moves to a pocket full of posies phase of Coronavirus plan,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/07/uk-moves-to-a-pocket-full-of-posies-phase-of-coronavirus-plan/,2020,"The Government has this morning announced, it has begun the “pocket full of posies” phase of its Coronavirus plan.
Spokesman Bill Board said, “We use the same system that was designed in the 17th century for coordinating these things. Up until now we’ve been in the “Ring a ring ‘o roses” phase. There are are 3 further phases. Atishoo 1 and Atishoo 2 then the phase about all falling down.”
The plans include journalists wearing plague doctor masks when interviewing. Politicians are also expected to increase the frequency they are seen in badly fitting lab coats attempting to look like they know how to use a pipette.
The Government spokesman said, “It’s improving that people don’t panic. Roads must be kept open to allow emergency vehicles through. This will also make it easier for the Government to evacuate the country.”
Elsewhere today various organisations have been setting out their plans for dealing with the virus. The Church of England has said it intends to increase the frequency of prayer sessions whilst the Catholic Church has promised to start burning homosexuals at the stake and ensuring women are kept indoors last their sexual urges cause them to start spreading the virus.
The British Association of Chavpreneurs has also announced it intends to maintain high prices for hand sanitizer and toilet rolls by its members going out and continuing to buy all the stock in Aldi and Lidl and selling it on Ebay.
In other news a local man that failed GCSE Science is now an expert on evolutionary biology and virology. He’ll be releasing his latest paper at a symposium to be held at various branches of Rochdale Wetherspoons later today. Other speakers include various conspiracy theorists whose intellect is too limited to accept evolution. They have taken time out of their busy schedule of shouting, “We won you lost” to attend.
In addition to all of this there are reports that flamethrower manufacturers are struggling to keep up with demand after an Australian TV company revealed flamethrower to be 100% effective against viruses. B&Q is bracing itself."
Disaster as it’s revealed Government only has enough Care badges for 1 in 5 care workers,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/16/disaster-as-its-revealed-government-only-has-enough-care-badges-for-1-in-5-care-workers/,2020,"Undercover reporters for The Rochdale Herald have discovered that the Government only has enough “Care” badges for 1 in 5 care workers as part of its latest scheme to deflect attention away from its total failure to tackle Coronavirus with anything resembling a plan or strategy.
One care worker who wishes to remain anonymous told us, “For 3 weeks now we’ve been warning that we’re not equipped for this. Over Easter weekend 1/3 of the residents in the home I work at died. The Government announced they were doing something and revealed the badges. At first I thought it was great as, whilst I might be completely vulnerable to infection and infecting other residents through lack of PPE I’d always be able to look at my badge and realise I’m valued. Well, when I say valued, they might see more favourably my appeal against deportation after they refused me the right to settle here now they’ve left the EU and I don’t earn enough money to qualify.”
Another care worker told us, “The badges were delivered this morning but I didn’t get one. Looking at it would have made up for the parking ticket I’ve just got for parking in an NHS parking spot whilst I take a resident to hospital to have her broken arm fixed. Still, it’s good to see that the MP that voted against allowing us to park for free whilst dropping elderly relatives off at hospital has his badge on. That provides much succor to me.”
When asked a Government spokesman told us, “Stop being so critical of us. It’s not like we’ve had long enough to prepare. We’ve only been in power 10 years and scientists have only been warning of such a pandemic since 1997. Anyway, imagine if Jeremy Corbyn had won?”
Elsewhere, there are rumours that retired WWII vetran Capt Tom Moore is being investigated by ATOS over his fitness to work. The 99 year old has raised £13m for the NHS. A spokesman said, “He told us he couldn’t work because of chronic arthritis and limited movement. Well, I’ve seen him moving round his garden. We’ll be taking the appropriate legal action. The lazy scum bag will pay for this. Hanging is too good for him.”"
Coronavirus equals UK mortality rate of Michael Barrymore’s swimming pool,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/05/coronavirus-equals-uk-mortality-rate-of-michael-barrymores-swimming-pool/,2020,"The Government has announced that as many people in the UK have died from Coronavirus as have been found dead in Michael Barrymore’s swimming
pool
.
A spokesman said, “This is a milestone for this virus in the UK. Earlier today a person died from Coronavirus. That brings the total number of deaths in the UK to 1. To put that in context  that’s equal to the number of people found floating dead in Michael Barrymore’s swimming pool. It is also equal to the number of people that have been shot dead by Oscar Pistorius.”
There are fears that deaths from the virus could increase over the coming weeks. “We’re preparing for the worst. In the coming days we expect it to equal the mortality rate of Princess Diana’s car crash. By next week it could be as lethal as lorry drivers and next month you’re looking at something as lethal as Iain Duncan Smith, the Royal Family and Jim Jones.”
A young boy we interviewed to pad this article out a bit told us, “I’m really scared. I’ve never heard of Michael Barrymore but I’ve watched My Kind of People and was genuinely shocked and saddened. That show spawned Charlotte Church and the X Factor. If Coronavirus is worse than that who knows where it might lead.”
We tried to interview Coronavirus but it declined to meet us. Shame, we fancied 2 weeks in isolation."

Britain shows appreciation for NHS by funding it properly,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/27/britain-shows-appreciation-for-nhs-by-funding-it-properly/,2020,"Britain has decided to show its appreciation for the NHS by funding it properly.
The nation has made the decision that it doesn’t matter what expensive treatment you and your insurers can personally afford if you catch a disease from someone who cannot afford the same.
As a result, the UK has reaffirmed its belief that free at source healthcare is a right for all.
Britain has also decided that a single health service has an incredible negotiating power, so can buy medicines at a better price for all.
The massive negotiating power it has with suppliers is similar to the power of that sovereign wealth fund the Norwegians set up.
You know, that one they funded with the money from the oil in the North Sea they didn’t piss up against the wall.
That one, worth over £750 billion, that one, that we could have had one like.
That one.
To restore this power, Britain has also decided to reverse the division of the NHS into separate trusts, realising this 1990 decision had its origins in political dogma rather than public health.
Savings are also expected to arise from a reduction in both layers of management and the money those managers spend on professional advisers in an effort to avoid being sued.
This will instead be spent on medical care.
With less professional advisers recommending decisions that involve spending money on professional advisers, it is thought that outsourcing will also stop.
Hospitals are likely to return to the model of having a maintenance staff rather than paying a company £40 to hang a picture in six weeks.
These staff will also receive fair pay and a NHS pension encouraging them to take pride in their work than being precariously “self-employed” gig economy gimps.
With Trusts removed and outsourcing ended, the decision to remove services like mental health provision from the NHS and parcel them up into community interest companies ready to be bought by Americans will also be reversed.
Finally, the nation has decided that it will start listening to experts again, particularly when they warn a plague is coming."
“Could Coronavirus be as deadly as Harold Shipman?” Your Coronavirus questions answered,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/13/could-coronavirus-be-as-deadly-as-harold-shipman-your-coronavirus-questions-answered/,2020,"With Coronavirus fever hitting the nation Rochdale residents had many questions. Professor Frederick Seddon of Rochdale College answers some of them.
Will Coronavirus be as deadly as Harold Shipman?
Harold Shipman killed between 250 and 300 people. The latest Government predictions are that 5000 to 10000 people could get Coronavirus. Given a mortality rate of 3.6% this means that we can expect 180-360 deaths. To put that in context, Flu has a mortality rate of 0.1%. 5-10 people would be expected to be dead given 5000 – 10000 people infected. So yes, Coronavirus will be deadlier than Harold Shipman.
If the shops run out of soap can I make my own?
Yes. There are methods available on the internet to do this. One thing to bear in mind is that you’ll need a ready supply of fat. The fat clumps together as it doesn’t like water so it helps pus the virus off your skin. The cheapest option will be to use fat from Coronavirus victims. Just make sure the corpses are quite fresh.
How should I deal with elderly relatives?
At Rochdale College we’ve found the best way of dealing with them is by using a pillow. It tends to muffle the screaming as well which is always useful.
I’m worried that football will be cancelled and I’ll finally have an excuse to stop going as I’ve hated it for years. How should I handle this?
Tell everyone you’ve got Coronavirus then fake your own death.
Am I a dick head?
Yes Barry, yes you are."
Trump gives a shot in the arm to 2020 Darwin Awards,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/25/trump-gives-a-shot-in-the-arm-to-2020-darwin-awards/,2020,"President Donald Trump has thrown an unexpected and much appreciated lifeline to the 2020 Darwin Awards.
The well-known website which describes itself as  a “salute the improvement of the human genome by honoring those who accidentally remove themselves from it in a spectacular manner” was started in 1993 and has featured many incredible example of human stupidity. Past winners have elected to exit the mortal coil by pissing on live rails, posing for selfies on precipices and playing chicken with 800 tonne freight trains.
However, with the worldwide lockdown imposed to combat coronavirus, hundreds of thousands of potential Darwin nominees have been confined to their homes, greatly reducing their creative scope for self-destruction. Had the Herald bothered to contact Wendy Northcutt, curator of the awards, she probably would have told us, “It’s looking pretty grim for this year to be honest. Sure, many thousands or unfortunate souls have died from this horrible virus, but these were normal, decent people. There just aren’t enough total fucking dickheads playing on busy roads, headbutting trains or bungee jumping with steel cables. Unless they get back out there and start feeding themselves balls-first into heavy machinery soon, we may have to cancel this years awards through lack of interest. Yes, I mean the honourable mentions too.”
We imagine Ms Northcut would have continued, “President Trump has always tried hard to keep us afloat. His support base amongst the trigger-happy members of the NRA has produced a steady trickle of gun cleaning incidents; we always consider those for a nomination. More recently he kindly urged thousands of morons to take to the streets and protest the lockdown, but although many have risen to the call, it will be hard from us to distinguish the fuckwits from the innocent victims they help kill.”
But at a press conference yesterday, President Tide Pod surprised the world with the brilliant suggestion of injecting industrial strength disinfectant directly into the bodies of infected patients, a strategy so brilliant in that it will neutralise the virus by depriving it of a living host. Total eradication could be further guaranteed by scorching the lungs with artificial sunlight.
“That man’s a genius!” Northcutt didn’t actually say because we never spoke to her. “We’ve been saying for years that the human gene pool needs a little chlorine. Trump has listened and, well, come up trumps. After only hours the Emergency Medical Hotline in Maryland has received over 100 calls from potential nominees. It looks like this year could actually produce a bumper crop. Thank you, Mr President!”
The Herald has contacted a number of leading medical experts, cleaning product manufacturers and other clever bods for comment, and the response has been unanimous.
“Under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone consider injecting or ingesting cleaning products. Don’t even do it sarcastically. Put the fucking stuff down and leave it to the medical professionals to do their job!”
“And stay indoors!”"
Coronavirus causes charmer to consider condoms,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/23/coronavirus-causes-charmer-to-consider-condoms/,2020,"Since moving to London, St Cuthbert’s alumnus Ben Green has prided himself on, in his own words, “spreading his chutney round Putney”.
Claiming to have graduated one of Rochdale’s leading Catholic schools, he has for several years used this to justify what his nan calls “forgetting to wear his raincoat”.
Whilst Green was an early adopter for protective Tesco apparel, wearing overalls and a mask to pick up his resupplies of Strongbow Dark Fruits, he has until now persisted with his love for bareback riding at the rodeo.
However, all of that could be about to change.
“I have long been confident that when I shoot, I won’t score, whether on or off the pitch,” explained the Fez Club 5-aside captain, “but I realise now that confidence was based on a world before coronavirus.”
Green had initially enjoyed the increased opportunities from the virus, for example asking girls if they would like to be his “Quaran-queen” or indeed whether they would like a rim job if they were short on Andrex.
But increased media focus on the potential for disease transmission has caused Green to reconsider his approach to his occasional seconds of intimacy.
“Now, with working from home increasingly prevalent, the chances of a girl working out exactly where I live have increased, and with that, the potential for consequences.”
As such, Green has decided to learn how to put condoms on in case he accidentally sires and abandons a series of children with different women, and is consequently forced to assume the office of Prime Minister at this time of national crisis.  He remains untested for STDs."
Virus tests increase to 1 million a day as Matt Hancock includes tests he’s thought about,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/05/04/virus-tests-increase-to-1-million-a-day-as-matt-hancock-includes-tests-hes-thought-about/,2020,"The UK government has announced that Covid-19 testing has now far surpassed the target figure, coming in at 1 million a day.
Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, explained the new figures have been broadened to include all the tests he’s thought about.
Speaking at the daily briefing Hancock told media figures, “My imagination is an incredibly powerful tool in getting control of this virus. We now have the capacity to think about over a million tests a day and that means they’re as good as done. Not only that but I can picture the results being great, so they are.”
Home Secretary, Priti Patel has faced criticism as some suggest that imagined tests are not the same as physical, corporeal ones. In response Patel argued, “I’m sorry that you’re wrong and made yourself look like a complete dickhead but the numbers are actually very clear. Due to the efficient imagination of Matt Hancock testing has increased by two-hundred and ninety five hundred thousand, four hundred and two thousand five percent.”
The NHS have reported a huge increase of spinal injuries following the announcement as Conservatives attempt to pat themselves on the back."
"Well I’ve never caught anything off my kids before, Facebook mum lies",https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/05/21/well-ive-never-caught-anything-off-my-kids-before-facebook-mum-lies/,2020,"Before 2020, Rochdale mum Di Coughlan had rarely posted anything other than pictures of her adorable children and grimacing husband.
That all changed a couple of months ago, when a new profile filter “#Stay Home – It Could Save Lives” appeared, alongside a seemingly never ending set of rants about such topics as people going to the park at the same time as Di wanted to go there with her kids.
She was also vexed by the queues of people trying to get into Tesco when she was trying to get into Tesco, the people walking around the street when she was walking around her street, and the noise of her neighbours’ TV which forced her to turn Netflix up.
It seemed everyone was getting in the way of her normal routing, stopping her from just “Di-ing”.
However, as the end of the Easter Holiday this was replaced with tales of how Ms Couglan is “beyond appalled” at the “so called Teachers Unions telling the governments what teachers want to do”.
She was quite sure that many “wise teachers” would #resist the “politicisation of the opening of schools.”
Still sporting her “#Stay Home” filter, she informed several of her friends that she had categorically never caught so much as a cold from her kids, so they should go back to school.
Former friend Mehdi Al-Professional told the Herald “I just asked her whether she was sure that was true, and she banned and blocked me.
I mean Sebastian is a perpetually snot nosed feral creature and I’m sure I’ve had about five colds off him last year, so it seemed far fetched.”
However, having received a letter from Ms Coughlan’s lawyers, the Herald can inform you that the notion that her children are walking little petri dishes prone to licking doorknobs is false.
Just because every mewling ball of sick and pus you ever encountered in primary school is an incredibly obvious vector for symptomless transmission does not mean they should be drawing on Di’s walls in crayon for a second longer than is necessary.
So there, lefty councils and unions."
Goveid-19 now ‘out of control’ in UK.,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/07/12/goveid-19-now-out-of-control-in-uk/,2020,"A new, highly infectious virus – Goveid-19 – has reached pandemic proportions throughout the UK, an investigation by The Rochdale Herald has revealed.
Goveid-19 was first detected during the Conservative Party leadership election campaign in 2016 but was not at the time thought to be anything other than a minor irritant. The first person infected was Michael Gove, after whom the virulent disease has been named. The first sign of infection was a loss of his charisma and he wound up having as much as a used condom floating in the piss-filled gutter of a public house car park in South London.
Gove transmogrified into a golem, seemingly fabricated entirely out of smegma and was cursed with viscid, glistening perspiration. He was demonically given the ability to perambulate and gifted with a semblance of speech while remaining unable to tell the truth in any way, shape or form.
Goveid-19 is now spreading rapidly throughout the population. Public Health England have asked the public to be alert for the following symptoms:
Should you develop any of these symptoms, please self-isolate for the rest of your life. There is no cure."
Thousands come together for eye testing,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/06/07/thousands-come-together-for-eye-testing/,2020,"Thousands of people have come together in the name of ophthalmic health this weekend. Many even brought their own testing kits.
One attendee told us, “It’s great to see so many people out testing their eyesight before driving home. I’ve read at least 40 eye test charts at various distances and can confirm that I’m ok to drive.”
Another told us, “My eyesight is very important to me. The other week I attended one of these mass tests on my own street. We all sang, We’ll meet again. Then we tested various cakes and read the letters V and E from various distances. It’s nice to be able to get together in the town for a bit of mass testing.”
A third one, Bill Board told us, “Last week I tested my eyesight by going to the beach and reading the writing on several distant ships. It’s nice to be able to do this closer to home.”
Bill served in the Army for 23 years before leaving, buying a 3 bedroom semi-detached house that is now worth £250,000. He has 2 cats, a collection of antique dart boards and type II diabetes.
Elsewhere McDonald’s has been inundated with people attending eye tests at its drive-thru’s. One employee told us, “We’ve been really busy. Loads of people turned up yesterday and parked at various distances from the menu and read items off it.”"
“Operation Cumshot” – UK gov commits to spunking £100bn on wizard wheeze,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/09/10/operation-cumshot-uk-gov-commits-to-spunking-100bn-on-wizard-wheeze/,2020,"The initiative, the budget for which totals almost that of the entire NHS England budget for 2019-2020, has been nicknamed “Operation Cumshot”. This is due to its obvious objective of spunking £100bn over the faces of the usual Conservative party cronies.
“I’m delighted!” Anthony Farquar-Hunt, the 3rd Earl of Little Shittington, told The Rochdale Herald.
“My bank account is going to look, to all intents and purposes, like a plasterer’s radio once good old Boris has spaffed his load all over it.”
Planned spending for the Department of Health and Social Care by NHS England is £140.4bn in 2019/20."
