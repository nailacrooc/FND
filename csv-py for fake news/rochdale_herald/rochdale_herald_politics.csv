Chris Grayling announces he’s pregnant after taking Covid-19 antibody test,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/05/14/chris-grayling-announces-hes-pregnant-after-taking-covid-19-antibody-test/,2020,"Chris Grayling has revealed he’s pregnant after he took the new Covid-19 antibody test.
A spokesman said, “It came as quite a surprise for Chris that he was pregnant. He wasn’t even trying for a baby and had just nipped out to get some petrol. It does mark an improvement on the last time he went out for petrol and Notre Dame Cathedral burnt down.”
Mr Grayling is expected to take a full 9 months of maternity leave. When asked if this would impact his day to day duties an aide told us, “There’ll probably be far fewer fires. Do you know that last year he attended a barbeque and burnt an entire village down? Nobody has a clue how he managed it. He lit the barbecue and stood there and before anyone knew it the whole village was on fire.”
A small child we interviewed to pad this article out a bit told us, “I have no idea who this is but I’ve learned bogies make a great meal.”
Mr Grayling has 2 children, 1 dog, a house that has 3,0000987654 bricks, several cars, takes 150000 breaths a day, has 8000000 red blood cells and has been the MP for Epsom and Ewell since 2001. He once drove past the exit for Rochdale on the M62 and wanted to be a train driver when he was little.
We contacted him for comment but he answered the phone, went to answer the door and never came back."
Boris Johnson makes it perfectly clear that he doesn’t know his R’s from his elbow,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/05/11/boris-johnson-makes-it-perfectly-clear-that-he-doesnt-know-his-rs-from-his-elbow/,2020,"In an historic address to the nation this evening, People’s Supremo Boris ‘BloJo’ Johnson outlined the roadmap back to the new normality that opposition MPs have been crying out for these past seven weeks.
Key points include a ‘back to work, back to reality’ (the reality of succumbing to a deadly virus) policy for poor people, specifically those in the manufacturing and construction industries (who, confusingly, were already allowed to keep working under the current restrictions), but only on the condition that they they don’t use public transport to get to work, unless of course they rely on public transport to get to work, which many of them do, in which case the jury is still out.
Slightly richer people are encouraged to keep working from home, but are now allowed out more to exercise and infect each other, for which they will now be fined double, an amount that will be reduced by 50% if they remain ALERT for the invisible and practically undetectable threats that can now be monitored by a personally invasive app that hasn’t been beta tested but might be rolled out at some point.
Metropolitan commuters are still advised NOT to lick the ‘stop’ button on London buses, at least for the time being. This draconian restriction on our and YOUR personal liberties is expected to be phased out by July, when some restaurants will be allowed to reopen as long as strict social distancing is observed, ensuring that no food is at any point ordered or consumed. Or prepared and served.
Heartening news though came via the fact that we have only reached Danger-Apocalypse-Fan/Faeces-Interaction-Scenario Level Four, in spite of having the worst death toll in Europe and second worst in the world. This is in part thanks to our having left the EU so are no longer considered among European figures, otherwise we would now have inevitably reached Level 42, and would have had to suffer the sight and sound of BloJo attemting funk slap-bass to a medley of 80s chart hits as an accompaniment to that epic car crash of an announcement. Viewers noted an apparent thankfulness for small mercies.
In other news, the pollen count today was high, the sperm count low, and the R number was up from R1 to a thundering Geoffrey Rush Hamming It Up In Pirates Of The Caribbean V: Dead Men Tell No Tales (i.e. RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR).
Finally, the Prime Monster told a nation puse with breath so baited it could have caught a Koi Carp that ALL passengers arriving on Blighty’s sacred shores will be subject to a quarantine period.
Unless they’re arriving from Ireland.
Or France.
And not just yet.
Well, that’s ok then."
Treasury seek OAP to sit in baked beans to fund Social Services,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/17/treasury-seek-oap/,2020,"In a surprise press release, the Treasury have today revealed a novel initiative to bolster funding for cash-starved Social Services.
In the statement, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Rishi Sunak
announced, “Following the outstanding achievement of 99-year-old Captain Tom Moore in raising millions for charities supporting our amazing NHS, we intend to recruit an elderly lady to sit in a bathtub full of baked beans for a week.”
He continued, “Captain Tom had done an amazing job and it saves us a lot of time and money. The ideal candidate would have to be of a certain age, at least 90 years old. If she had a military background, that would be great. Perhaps one of those women who used to help land our Spitfires over the radio. Yes, one of those. The successful candidate will of course be permitted eat all the beans she wants and we wouldn’t even touch her pension. She could even bring her own toast.”
Mr Sunak listed a number of other plans to raise money including sponsored hula hooping by hip replacement patients and octogenarians with cataracts playing darts.
The Chancellor concluded, “These are just a few of the exciting initiatives we intend to implement over the coming months. We will continue to provide updates on our GoFundMe page.”"

Rishi Sunak to announce 80% wages to be replaced by a free bike,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/05/12/rishi-sunak-to-announce-80-wages-to-be-replaced-by-a-free-bike/,2020,"The Chancellor of the Exchequer is set to announce that the job retention scheme, which sees those workers furloughed by their employer receive 80% of their wages from the government, will be replaced by “free bicycles” The Rochdale Herald has learned.
Rishi Sunak MP, who said a few weeks ago that he would do “whatever it takes for as long as it takes” is expected to double down on the Prime Minister’s announcement on Sunday that those in the manufacturing and construction industries, amongst others, should return to work but not use public transport. He is expected to do this by means of slashing the furlough payment from 80% to 60%.
To counter this, it has been reported that he will be adhering to the time honoured Tory principle of “I’m alright Jack” and may be offering those plunged into abject poverty a free bicycle.
“This serves several purposes,” a source to The Rochdale Herald.
“Firstly, it let’s us combat any complaints about anything by anyone with the retort ‘on yer bike’ which is, quite frankly, hilarious and secondly it saves us an obscene amount of cash which could be better spent bailing out the banks again.”
Mr Sunak’s office declined to respond to our request for clarification."
UK in shock as Boris Johnson steps down,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/01/uk-in-shock-as-boris-johnson-steps-down/,2020,"The people of the United Kingdom took a collective gasp today, Wednesday 1st of April, as Boris Johnson announced he would be stepping down.
“This morning,” the Prime Minister announced from self isolation inside number 10 Downing Street, “my hand has been forced.
“Since testing positive for Covid-19, I have been in self isolation. Drastic times call for drastic measures and in this time of national emergency I feel there is nothing else to do but step down into the wine cellar and get my own bottle of Chateau Lafite.
“The staff won’t come anywhere bloody near me.”"

UK airlines have said that, at the government’s insistence, 14 day quarantine measures will be introduced for all passengers arriving at UK airports. These measures will come into force at the beginning of June, almost three months after the Prime Minister announced a ban on non essential travel.
Well. That’s alright then."
Dominic Raab warns against travel to Iran and other Scandinavian countries,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/01/05/dominic-raab-warns-against-travel-to-iran-and-other-scandinavian-countries/,2020,"The foreign secretary Dominic Raab has warned British nationals not to travel to Iran or any other Scandinavian countries following last week’s US airstrikes on the capital of Bulgaria, Baghdad.
“I’m not sure why people keep calling me the foreign secretary.” Dominic Raab told The Herald. “I’m not foreign, I’m from Buckinghamshire.”
“And I can’t type”
“Anyway I hadn’t quite understood that Iran is a real place until this morning. Apparently you shouldn’t go there at the moment because all of their koalas are on fire or something.”"
Johnson replaces Cabinet with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/01/01/johnson-replaces-cabinet-with-the-four-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse/,2020,"Boris Johnson committed himself to leading Britain into ‘a new chapter’ yesterday. Downing Street sources revealed that the chapter referred to by the tousled Muppet Prime Minister will be Chapter 6 of the Revelations of St John.
Johnson has pledged to personally cut the first six of the Seven Seals which he claims are ‘holding Britain back’. with immediate effect.  The first four seals reveal the new cabinet, the Four Horsemen of The Apocalypse.
BBC political minion Lauren Duessenberg said “It’s a bold move and the most radical reshuffle ever.  War will take over the Foreign Office and Civil Unrest Contingency planning.  Famine will oversee Defra and post-Brexit trade.
Pestilence will get the Department of Health and the DoE; while Death is pretty much a straight swap for Iain Duncan Smith.” The cutting of the fifth seal will see the tormented souls of the martyrs appear screaming for vengeance. This is thought to be a reference to the ERG.
Government policy is to give them white robes, and a leaked document indicates a pointy hood with eye slits as the likely design. When the Prime Minister slices through the sixth seal (to be marked by a commemorative 50p piece), Britain is likely to experience a great earthquake wherein, according to Jacob Rees-Mogg ‘the sun becomes as black as the sackcloth of hair, and the moon like blood’.
This will be followed by the sky receding like a scroll rolling up, every mountain moving out of place and the people retreating to caves in the mountains. This means Scotland will be largely unaffected.
Johnson said “Obviously there will be some short term sacrifices to be made and the survivors of the apocalypse may well cry out for the mountains to fall on them to spare them from my wrath. But let’s face it, what everyone wants is just to get the Apocalypse done.”"
Dominic Raab announces lucrative trade deal with Juice Plus+,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/02/06/dominic-raab-announces-lucrative-trade-deal-with-juice-plus/,2020,"Dominic Raab has announced that he has completed a very lucrative trade deal with Juice Plus+.
A spokesman for Mr Raaab told us, “At our away day in the north everyone  was told that they could all contribute to Britain’s potential by securing trade deals. The Government want to use Britain’s new found freedom to pursue non-traditional trade agreements. As such Dominic Raaaab handed over £160m pounds to Juice Plus+ to secure exclusive rights to their beetroot and avocado extract  energy boost juice. It’s a large outlay but we could make 300 times that by selling it.”
When asked about how Mr Raaaaab first heard about the opportunity his spokesman said, “It’s such a coincidence. He was washing his hands in the toilet when he saw an old school friend. They got talking and his old school friend mentioned how he was making a fortune selling juice. He said he’d never felt so good and that Raaaaaaab should consider it. It just so happened that there was a seminar on that very evening. Raaaaaaaab went along and the rest is history.”
It’s not just Juice Plus+. The Government is expected to announce a scheme to convert derelict housing in Oldham into time share apartments. A spokesman said, “We want to regenerate areas that were destroyed by the Tories. These areas have a lot of cheap buildings we can buy. We think that once we convert these into time share apartments we’ll be able to attract foreign tourists to them. Loads of tourists come over to see Manchester United. Instead of staying in an artificial environment like the centre of Manchester they could come to Oldham. We even offer an ultra realistic street crime simulation.”
It’s expected more ideas will be announced following Dominic Cummings appearance as a paedophile in the next series of Happy Valley."
Boris “getting Coronavirus done”. PM tests positive.,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/27/boris-getting-coronavirus-done-pm-tests-positive/,2020,"The Rochdale Herald can confirm that the Prime Minister of the UK, Boris Johnson, has tested positive for Coronavirus.
Having been tested for Coronavirus on the advice of Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Witty, it has been confirmed this morning that the PM tested positive.
He will still be “in charge” of the government’s response to the virus and has plenty of practice at self isolating having been engaged in social distancing throughout the recent flood crisis.
Incidentally, has anyone else noticed that Chris Witty doesn’t blink?
Weirdo."

Ms Patel, who could barely conceal her happiness as she grinned through her statement said, “I’d just like to congratulate Boris on the arrival of his 3001005789th child. It’s a very happy occasion. I hope he’s a very masculine child and am looking forward to meeting him at my next candlelit supper.”
A spokesman for Boris Johnson told us, “We’ve no idea where Boris is. On hearing Priti congratulate him on his 3001005789th child the colour drains from his face. He looked like one of those ancient Greek blokes who’ve just finished the pudding course and told the executioner to bring on the Hemlock. He was last seen heading to Iceland. Not the country mind, the frozen food supermarket.”
Elsewhere, it’s not just Boris Johnson that is celebrating a birth. There were unconfirmed rumours that Kim Jong Un was delivered of a baby boy over the weekend. A rumour denied by North Korean officials who said he’d just had a larger than normal dump. There have been rumours about the North Korean leader for 2 weeks with some speculating he’s locked himself away as he grows out a poorly executed lock down haircut.
Dominic Raaaab will stand in at PMQ’s today just as soon as he finds the front door to his house."
Campaign to crowdfund a copy of Bravo Two Zero and box of tissues for Mark Francois a success,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/01/17/campaign-to-crowdfund-a-copy-of-bravo-two-zero-and-box-of-tissues-for-mark-francois-a-success/,2020,"A crowdfunding campaign set up to raise enough money for a copy of Bravo Two Zero and a man size box of tissues for Mark Francois has been declared a rip roaring success.
Campaign organiser, Bill Board told us, “Frankly we didn’t expect it to be this successful. Within an hour we’d reached the £9.99 total we wanted to reach. Now we’ve got so much money we’ll be able to buy copies for all of Boris’s kids. It just goes to show, give people enough sentimental nonsense about loving your country and you can get them to do anything that isn’t in their interests.”
Francois is alleged to have been totally elated. One spokesman told us, “He flicked to the bit where they take on that Iraqi Army Division. He then went away and we haven’t seen him since.”
Francois rarely talks about his military experiences but it’s been alleged he served in the First World War. A spokesman said, “He served with a Major Sharpe at the Battle of the Somme. As a member of an elite machine gun battalion he helped inflict the highest number of casualties the British Army has ever experienced in one day. He also earned the Iron Cross at Omaha beach when the Americans stormed it.”
Mr Francois is believed to be planning spending this evening attempting to convince women he’s James Bond."
Boris catches coronavirus despite consistently washing hands of all responsibility,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/27/boris-catches-coronavirus-despite-consistently-washing-hands-of-all-responsibility/,2020,"Finally, after what feels like years of writing about this car crash of a government you NHS applauding, social distance ignoring flag shaggers voted in, we have something positive to report about the PM.
Boris Johnson has tested positive.
Despite consistently washing his hands of all responsibility, the Prime Minister reported that, as a rich and important person, he has had a test, and unfortunately it was positive.
He is not thought to have caught it from his aides.
Mr Johnson has long advocated working from home, having financially supported a number of home workers over the years, including from public funds.
It is unclear which home workers the Prime Minister has exposed himself too recently, so anyone who has pretended to come whilst in contact with him is advised to self-isolate.
There is some speculation though over whether Boris has indeed been infected. We understand that despite maintaining a vigorous holiday regimen and adhering to the concept of weekends, the recent crisis has left the Prime Minister deeply envious of the Leader of the Opposition, who has continued to potter about doing fuck all.
Fitting in enough time around government commitments to replay The Last of Us, whilst creating an all too realistic real life scenario for its sequel, has been a challenge for Boris, despite the free time saved by getting rid of the cute dog he had as an obvious election prop.
And there’s no prospect of another holiday any time soon.
Announcing a positive test should now allow the PM to remove himself from the day to day tedium of actually doing his job.
He is expected to continue to sit in his pyjamas spaffing a few ill-considered words up against a wall for the Telegraph, in between bouts of wanking.
It’s probably made us all a bit more likely to get through this, so let’s leave him be."
Michael Gove “more slippery than Teflon”,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/12/michael-gove-more-slippery-than-teflon/,2020,"Independent research at the Technical University of Rochdale has found that Michael Gove is more slippery than Teflon – and that a patent has been applied for which could revolutionise the development of a new generation of non-stick pans.
Rather than go to the expense and difficulty of sticking a non-stick coating to the inside of the pan, researchers have found that simply printing an image of Michael Gove onto the surface of the pan is even more effective. “Nothing sticks to it. He’s such a slimy two-faced weasel that getting him to adhere to basic human dignity is impossible, let alone such abstract concepts as truth and loyalty…” said Emeritus Professor Pritt-Stick, head of the department of adhesive research, adding “…he could fall face forward into a cess-pool and emerge whiter than white – although more work needs to be carried out on removing the smell.”
The Technical University of Rochdale Institute will benefit from the money raised from the patent, and invest the proceeds into research into turd polishing, something previously thought to be impossible, but now deemed to be feasible given the impact of the Gove research.
Further research is now also being carried out by Rochdale University’s Department of Applied Linguistics, who will attempt to answer the question, “…who put the Gove into Government?”
Once the answer is found, there may be consequences."
"Move classrooms into pubs, says government",https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/06/move-classrooms-into-pubs-says-government/,2020,"After Ministers were forced to make a choice between opening schools in September or keeping pubs open, the government has decided to move classes into pubs.
This will have the advantage of adding parental supervision alongside teachers as they can all sit in the pub together and keep both schools and pubs open. “We have seen an opportunity to consolidate knowledge of the ‘three Rs’, reeling, rioting and retching…” said a ministerial drinks-person, “…while at the same time supporting the hospitality industry and increasing the amount of time children spend with quality role-models.”
Children would be taught to consume large quantities of alcohol, not to bother with social distancing and be given ’50 metre staggering certificates’ if they manage to walk that distance after 5 pints of strong lager.
‘A Levels’ will henceforth be known as ‘Alcohol Levels’ and will be examined by a breathalyser. A fail will mean a pass, and vice-versa."
Matt Hancock adds Straw Clutching to his cv as “transferable skill”,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/07/17/matt-hancock-adds-straw-clutching-to-his-cv-as-transferable-skill/,2020,"Hot on the heels of Boris Johnson’s success in the Stable Door Shutting championships, the Health Secratary, Matt Hancock has added Straw Clutching to his own cv as a transferable skill a source at No. 10 has told The Rochdale Herald.
Mr Hancock today called for an investigation into the way deaths related to the coronavirus outbreak in England have been recorded. His concern being that the numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 has been exaggerated by Public Health England (PHE).
One leading expert told The Rochdale Herald that the overall number of deaths could have been exaggerated by as much as 1000 bringing the actual figure right down from 45,000 to a “world beating” 44,000 deaths so far in the UK.
Dr Tone Loc, a bolognologist from The University of Life in Newton Mearns, told The Rochdale Herald that the method of collecting data provided by PHE so far was “a quick and easy method. Oven ready if you will.”
Prof. Gustav Spiegelimbadezimmer, professor of currant affairs at the Bath bun institute, explained that “As we go into winter, it will be incredibly confusing and concerning if we have an increase in deaths as we are trying to work out who we need to buy Christmas presents for.”
“If we go by the government’s figures, Granny and Grandpa are still on the list. If we go by PHE’s figures, well, we might just save ourselves the price of a bottle of sherry and a pair of socks.”
Mr Hancock, who recently clutched a particularly weighty straw when he appeared to try to move the original date on which lock down started forward retrospectively only to be foiled by the tv news coverage, newspaper articles and collective memories of millions of people, is said to be extremely pleased with himself.
Which must be lovely for him as everyone else thinks he’s a massive bellend."
Cummings replaced by Orwell in No.10 reshuffle,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/07/19/cummings-replaced-by-orwell-in-no-10-reshuffle/,2020,"Downing Street today confirmed that Dominic Cummings has been sacked and replaced by George Orwell as the government’s chief political advisor – effective immediately, The Rochdale Herald has learned.
A new-speakesperson from the newly formed Ministry of Truth said, “…all government policy has been extensively borrowed from fiction and we realised we no longer needed anyone making it all up on the fly. We realised that the overwhelming majority of Cummings’s ideas were directly borrowed from a political bible written by Orwell in 1948.”
Major government initiates will now include:
The government has not ruled out borrowing from other fictional works in the near future. Ideas include the renaming of major political parties – The Conservative Party will become Griffindor, the Liberal Democrats Hufflepuff, the SNP Ravenclaw and The Labour Party will be known as Slytherin – with an added caveat that former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will be known as ‘Corbymort’ or ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’ and held up as a bogeyman to terrify children of school age.
Public schools and Oxbridge Universities will now hold the title of ‘Institutions for Special Educational Needs’ as it is recognised that rich and privileged people need to be ‘specially educated’ in order to rule the rest of us. Normal schools will become ‘Super Academies’ with head-teachers being replaced by ‘Deans’ and ordinary teachers becoming ‘Professors’. All children will wear gowns.
The Russia Report will be re-named ‘The Eurasia Report’. The Rochdale Herald will keep you informed as to who we are at war with as soon as it is released."
Grant Shapps hires ferry fleet to transport people back to offices,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/28/grant-shapps-hires-ferry-fleet-to-transport-people-back-to-offices/,2020,"Transport secretary Grant Shapps is so convinced that going back to work in offices is safe, that he has hired a fleet of ferries to transport people into city centres.
The UK Transport Secretary has made a deal worth £185 million with one of his ex-public school mates who has no ships and has never transported anyone anywhere. “Going back to offices is very, very safe…”, said Shapps, adding “… and I’m so determined to get people back to work that I’ve even arranged for a fleet of ferries to take them into the office.”
Mr Shapps said he was unaware of the fact that the vast majority of office spaces in the UK were nowhere near docks large enough to take the ships, and that the vast majority of office workers would not be able to get onto a ferry anywhere close to where they live. “These are minor details that I’m sure can be ironed out as soon as my mate banks the cash”, he burbled happily.
When the Rochdale Herald reporter asked how he would be able to get into the landlocked newspaper office from his landlocked suburban home by ferry, Mr Shapps replied, “…easy peasy. There are ferries at the bottom of your garden.”"
Future election results to be based on pandemic exam model,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/08/14/future-election-results-to-be-based-on-pandemic-exam-model/,2020,"Following the overwhelming success of the Department of Education’s strategy of grading academic exam results based on teachers’ predicted grades and previous attainment levels, the government has announced a plan to determine General Election results using a similar model, the Rochdale Herald has learned.
“Staging a General Election every 5 years takes a great deal of organisation and costs an enormous amount of money…”, said a votes-person from the Electoral Commission, adding “…we could save time, energy and money by using the same tactics that we used to grade A levels due to the pandemic – a mixture of predicted results and past performance.”
Under the new system adults of voting age will not have to put a cross on a piece of paper, attend polling stations, or even register to vote. Instead an aggregate of all newspaper opinion polls will be used to predict the results which will then be moderated by the Electoral Commission, taking into account the previous performance of each political party.
Voters who are unhappy with the result of their ‘predicted’ vote may challenge the poll result by writing a strong letter of protest to their local newspaper, which will then be considered for publication.
Concerns about the fairness of this system and the fact that the majority of opinion polls are run by newspapers that may have an agenda favouring a single political party, are unfounded, says the Commission. “We have carefully listened to the opinions of all opposition and minority party politicians and gently, yet firmly, filed all the objections in a large waste-paper bin, marked for recycling…” said the votes-person.
Even more money will be saved, as removal vans will not have to appear outside Downing Street in the foreseeable future."
Tories “Limited and specific” law breaking given thumbs up by criminals,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/09/16/limited-and-specific-law-breaking-given-thumbs-up-by-criminals/,2020,"Harry “Hatchet” Higgins told The Herald “I’m happy as a pig in shit mate.”
“You’ve got that Cummings geezer doing what he wants when he wants so a few mugs go to the beach. That was one thing. But now the bleedin’ front bench is breaking international law with impunity. Well it’s a green light innit?”
Whilst we’re not likely to be arguing with “Hatchet” in a hurry, we can see his point.
Many people in the UK took Dominic Cummings’ flouting of the rules as a signal that while the letter of the law says one thing, the spirit of the law has another, quite separate identity.
With the government now intent on breaking the law, albeit in a limited and specific way, how many other laws are open to interpretation?
“I’ll only be stealing diamonds from now on” says Fingers Farrington. “Is that specific enough? And if I limit myself to smash and grab robberies only I reckon I’ve got myself covered.”
Fred East of Bristol tells us “I’ll be limiting myself to murdering members of my immediate family only and specifically by strangulation.”
“Thanks to the Conservative party for showing us all that we can break whatever laws we like as long as it’s in a limited and specific way.”
Can’t argue with that."
