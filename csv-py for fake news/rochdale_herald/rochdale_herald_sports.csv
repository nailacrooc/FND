22 year old discovers new green job is actually vegetable picking,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/07/08/22-year-old-discovers-new-green-job-is-actually-vegetable-picking/,2020,"A 22 year old Rochdale resident has told us that his new ‘green’ job is actually just picking vegetables for £3.50 an hour.
Bill Board, who was recently made redundant from Rolls Royce told us, “I expected this kick starter job to be a way to improve my skills and be a much needed down payment on my future. It was going to be part of the green economy revolution. I was going to be working at the cutting edge of green technology. An opportunity to work with AI.  I thought it must be designing hydrogen fuel cells or working on nuclear fusion.”
Mr Board went on, “I got to the interview and was told it was going to be part of the green jobs movement. We’d be helping insulate buildings in a sustainable way and producing food in a more sustainable way. Turns out I’ve been stood on the roof of a disused pub for 5 hours shovelling manure and picking vegetables. It’s freezing cold, raining sideways and I’m trying to work out if this is mud or s**t.”
Mr Board told us, “Still, at least I’ll be able to go to a fancy restaurant and get 50% off the bill up to £10 which means it’s a KFC family bucket for me.”"
Man saying all lives matter wants Navy to torpedo boats full of refugees,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/06/07/man-saying-all-lives-matter-wants-navy-to-torpedo-boats-full-of-refugees/,2020,"A Rochdale man who keeps saying that all lives matter is also in favour of the Royal Navy being used to torpedo boats carrying refugees.
Bill Board, who lives in a 2 bedroom terrace house worth over £100,000 told us, “I keep seeing this black lives matter stuff. But for me, it should be all lives matter. I’m a humanitarian at the end of the day and don’t think people should be judged on the basis of their skin colour. All lives are important.”
Board, who collects beer mats and used to be a gas lamp lighter went on, “I saw an interesting thing on YouTube as well. It’s about those refugees coming here in boats. Nobody was stopping them. They just get in a boat in France and come over here. You ask me the Navy should torpedo them. That would stop them. I mean, it’s dangerous and they’re risking the lives of little kiddies. They’re all paedophiles as well.”
Bill has several health conditions that we’re using to pad this article out a bit. A few years ago he had a knee operation and is still using a mobility scooter to get around. The scooter is taxed and has insurance. Bill mostly wears tracksuit bottoms but on a Friday he puts jeans on to go to the club.
Bill also had cause to complain about a disappointing meal he had a Wongs Chinese buffet about 22 years ago. He was given £40 off his bill after his story appeared in several local newspapers. He still talks about this as the highlight of his life."
Burnley residents fear diversity means marrying outside of immediate family,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/06/23/burnley-residents-fear-diversity-means-marrying-outside-of-immediate-family/,2020,"A Burnley man has told us that he fears moves for more diversity will mean that people will be forced to marry outside of their immediate family.
Bill Board told us, “For years Burnley residents have married within their immediate families. That’s our tradition and we feel that it’s now under attack.”
Bill’s wife and sister, Orla Board told us, “People laugh at us but it’s quite handy. Whereas most people get together and have to learn what their partner likes; we didn’t have any of that. I already knew Bill doesn’t like onions but likes a blow job first thing.”
Bill told us, “It made meeting Orla’s parents for the first time really easy. I got in the car, drove around the block, got out and my parents were there. No difficult conversations or anything. And all it means is that you have to keep 1 out of every 4 kids locked in the loft of your house because they’re so horribly disfigured.”
Orla told us, “It’s our traditions and they’re under attack. Next they’ll be saying we shouldn’t marry cousins or even distant relatives. Well no way. It’s not for us. You can take your lefty Marxist diversity and shove it. If brother wants to marry sister then it should be allowed. It was good enough for people in the Bible and I don’t see you condemning Songs of Praise.”
It’s rumoured that residents will march in protest this weekend at the idea of marrying outside your immediate family."
20 injured by lion at Rochdale pride march,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/06/08/20-injured-by-lion-at-rochdale-pride-march/,2020,"There were scenes of carnage yesterday after a lion got loose and mauled several people at the annual Rochdale Pride event.
One eye witness said, “I knew something had gone wrong because my friend turned and said, “That’s gone wrong”. We were having such a nice day as well. I’d had 2 Lion bars and was looking forward to a choc ice.”
An event organiser that lives in a £200,000 home near a field told us, “The Pride event is one of the highlights of the Rochdale calendar. It commemorates the time a lion save the town from the great flood of ’84. Often we have people confusing it with Gay rights and being a bit disappointed but that’s later on in the summer.”
But many campaigners see this as further evidence that you shouldn’t allow lions to just wander around central Rochdale for one weekend a year. One, who collects antique glassware and won a Spot the Ball competition in 1985 told us, “We’ve been warning that something like this might happen. It’s totally crazy letting lions walk around a town like that. A few years ago all the police horses disappeared during the Pride march. The organisers tried to make out they’d gone on their holidays to the Serengeti, been kidnapped and then ransomed off. They even held a fund raising event to get them back. It was obvious those horses were actually eaten by lions.”
It isn’t clear yet if this will be the end of Pride for Rochdale. We contacted a medium to find out. She told us, “I see an empty chair. There is a small child dressed in a sailor suit. There’s also a man with a mullet and a shell suit. He’s wrapped an XR3i round a lamp post.”
At this point we ended the discussion after it became too graphic. Instead we will hold a reader poll to determine if Pride should be abandoned."
Drunk driver that crashed car into tree blames tree for causing accident,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/07/06/drunk-driver-that-crashed-car-into-tree-blames-tree-for-causing-accident/,2020,"A drunk driver that crashed his car into a tree on Saturday night has told us the tree caused the accident.
A police spokesman said, “We were called to a report of a man having crashed into a tree on Saturday night. When we got there he was attempting to open a bag of crisps and singing Coldplay songs. We could smell alcohol on him so we breathalysed him. He was 4 times over the legal limit so he was arrested.”
Eye witness, Stan Still said, “I’d seen him in the pub an hour before hand knocking pints back like it was going out of fashion. I left before he did. I’m surprised he was able to get the key in the ignition to be honest.”
The police spokesman confirmed that they had obtained footage of the man driving towards the tree with his head hung out of the window. The man is said to have been yelling “2 world wars and 1 world cup” at the tree.”
The mans solicitor told us, “My client is not guilty of causing the accident. That tree shouldn’t have been there. It should also be noted that everyone that has ever advised my client to not crash into a tree whilst drunk is at fault for not advising him strongly enough. He’ll be seeking compensation.”"
Scientists observe Burnley residents using simple tools and communicating in primitive grunts,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/06/23/scientists-observe-burnley-residents-using-simple-tools-and-communicating-in-primitive-grunts/,2020,"In a paper published in the journal Science this week scientists led by, Professor Frederick Seddon of Rochdale College have said they’ve observed Burnley residents using basic tools, communicating in grunts and solving simple problems.
Professor Seddon told us, “This research is a huge step. What was once written off as a primordial and backwards area of the Earth has been shown to have animals that are more advanced than we initially thought.”
Seddon went on, “We observed one group attempting to push a ball through different sized holes. Initially they were flummoxed but after a few months they were able to complete the task.”
Elsewhere Professor Seddon told us, “Their grunts seem simple to us but for residents of Burnley being able to communicate, even in such a primitive way is a huge step. Different grunts clearly meant different things. There were even 40 different grunts that seemed to mean residents should throw faeces at each other.”
And one touching detail was observed. “We were able to observe a group drinking fermented gooseberries and having a fight. It was just like the Vervet monkey.”
It’s hoped that Professor Seddon will now get more funding to research the behaviour of Burnley residents."
